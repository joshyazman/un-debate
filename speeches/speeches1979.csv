"1",9,"AFG",34,1979,"ï»¿It is a welcome tradition in each session of the General Assembly to begin policy statements by paying a tribute to the President of the General Assembly and other office-bearers on their election to the high posts of the Assembly sessions  as a fitting recognition of their experience and qualifications  which are an important factor in their election to such responsible posts. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan therefore takes pleasure in observing this tradition by extending its sincere and warm congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your unanimous election to the high office of the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I deem it necessary to mention that you  Mr. President  not only represent your great country  the United Republic of Tanzania  but also the struggling continent of Africa whose people have decided with faith and conviction to eradicate from their continent the evils of apartheid and racial discrimination and the last vestiges of colonialism and alien domination. Your outstanding contribution to the decolonization efforts of the United Nations and your personal dedication to the cause of freedom and the liberation struggle gives us every assurance that the important deliberations of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly will be termed a successful endeavour in the ongoing struggle of this Organization for a peaceful and prosperous world.51.	May we also express our appreciation to your predecessor  the prominent Colombian statesman and diplomat  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for the successful conduct of the deliberations of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.52.	When we assess the successes and failures of this Organization in matters of peace and security  the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  dedicated to the realization of the aims and objectives of the Charter  deserve our admiration.53.	The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan welcomes with joy the admission of Saint Lucia as a new Member of this Organization. This admission which reflects the success of the decolonization process in that former Territory takes us one step closer to the objective of the universality of this Organization.54.	Last year when we came to this Assembly at its thirty-third session  only six months had elapsed since the Afghan people had successfully carried out the Saur (April) Revolution under the leadership of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan  the vanguard of the working class of the country. At that time  from this very rostrum  we declared to the world that the Afghan people  having struck down the towers of tyranny and despotism  had dedicated themselves to building a new society free from the exploitation of man by man despite enormous economic and social problems which we inherited from the previous despotic regime.55.	In such circumstances  the first step required for building such a prosperous society free of exploitation was the uprooting of feudalism in the country and thus the liberation of the toiling people of Afghanistan  namely  the workers  the peasants and other toilers  from the unjust feudalistic relationships prevailing in the country and from the domination of imperialism and reaction.56.	In order to achieve this lofty goal  the Revolutionary Government  among its other measures  successfully implemented  during the year and a half that elapsed since the victory of the April Revolution  three major decrees issued by the Revolutionary Council of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.57.	By the implementation of Decree No. 6 we have removed the burden of the system of unjust mortgages  usury and interest payments that was previously imposed on millions of our working peasants by the feudal fords and big landowners.58.	By Decree No. 7 we ensured the equality of the rights of Afghan men and women before the law and in all political  economic  social and other fields. Afghan women are no longer exchanged for money or material goods under the guise of bride-money  dowries or marriage expenditures.59.	As I stated earlier  one of the major tasks of the Revolutionary Government has been to eliminate the feudal and pre-feudal relationships from the socio-economic structure of the country. For this purpose the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan successfully implemented Decree No. 8 in a record period of six months with the all-round co-operation of the Afghan people  as a result of which more than 3 million jeribs of land previously owned by feudal lords and big landowners were distributed free of charge to thousands of landless farmers and petty landowners. The joy of an Afghan farmer and his dependants who have become the owners of land for the first time in their entire lives can be imagined. Today the land in Afghanistan belongs to those who cultivate it.60.	Another major undertaking of our Government is the campaign for the total elimination of illiteracy  which is the legacy of past despotic regimes and which is estimated to afflict the disturbing figure of 90 per cent of our population. At present  more than 1 million people are registered in the illiteracy campaign courses throughout the country.61.	Another important accomplishment of the Revolutionary Government is the successful completion of the national population census  done for the first time in the country. That will offer reliable scientific data for the developmental projects undertaken by the Government within the framework of the new five-year economic development plan of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. This plan is intended to remove the causes of the economic and social backwardness of the country and to provide decent conditions and higher standards of living for the Afghan people.62.	I have given a brief account of some of the important measures which our popular Government has taken so far in the interest of our working people. I considered it my pleasant duty to draw the attention of this Assembly to what we have done for our working people in order to change their lot for the better. However  imperialists  reactionary circles and left extremists in Afghanistan's vicinity are engaged in hatching conspiracies against our revolution. Using a handful of fugitive enemies of our people and of our revolution  and  with the co-operation of their agents inside Afghanistan  they make armed attacks on and intrude into Afghan territory  in the course of which they damage schools and hospitals and kill women  children and elderly people.63.	We have stated time and again that we want to live in peace with all peoples and nations  and particularly with our neighbours  on the basis of peaceful coexistence and provided they do not interfere in our internal affairs.64.	The April Revolution of the Afghan people  being a victorious workers' revolution  by its nature calls for peace and peaceful coexistence  because in peace it can achieve its aims and objectives in the interest of the working people of Afghanistan and for their ultimate emancipation from exploitation.65.	Unfortunately  this peaceful desire of our people and this genuine call of our revolution for peace and peaceful coexistence is not reciprocated by some of our neighbours. As I indicated earlier in my statement  the reactionary circles in Afghanistan's vicinity not only encourage the anti-revolutionary escapees who have lost their economic bases and interests in Afghanistan after the victory of the April Revolution to carry out subversive activities inside Afghanistan  but also provide them with comfortable shelter for the realization of their nefarious designs.66.	One thing is obvious: the April Revolution of the Afghan people is irreversible. The reactionary circles  the imperialists and other enemies of our people and of the revolution will eventually realize that they cannot succeed in their heinous designs. They cannot alter the determination of the Afghan people to build a society free from exploitation of man by man; they cannot reverse the process of history.67.	The foreign policy of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  which is the reflection of its internal policy  is one of peace  peaceful coexistence and cooperation with all peace-loving countries and nations  and particularly with our neighbours.68.	Our relations of close friendship and mutual co-operation with the Soviet Union have developed positively during the last 62 years  and especially after the April Revolution  in the interest of our two peoples. These relations  which reflect the mutual desire of our two peoples constitute an excellent example of friend-ship  co-operation and good neighbourliness between States  and are based on sincere respect for the independence  national sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State and on the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs.69.	Our amicable relations with India  which have long and firm historical roots  are developing day by day  to the benefit of our two peoples.70.	As far as our relations with Pakistan are concerned  our Government and people have the sincere desire to maintain friendly relations with that country on the basis of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. We hope the feelings of friendship of our working people towards the noble working people of Pakistan will be taken into account and reciprocated by the Government of Pakistan in its attitude towards the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the April Revolution. This in our view will positively contribute to paving the way for the normalization of relations and the promotion of mutual co-operation between our countries in the interest of peace in this region and in the world.71.	We further hope that our only remaining political problem with Pakistan will be solved by peaceful means and through sincere and amicable negotiations.72.	With regard to Iran also  we have the same desire for friendly relations and mutually beneficial co-operation on the basis of peaceful coexistence and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. This sincere desire emanates from the feelings of brotherhood and solidarity maintained by our working people towards the noble working people of Iran.73.	Concerning the rest of the countries  we not only are desirous of maintaining friendly relations and mutually beneficial co-operation with them  but also we would spare no sincere efforts to achieve that goal.74.	Needless to say  we are meeting at a crucial time as far as the international situation is concerned. Despite our common and continued efforts aimed at removing threats to international peace and security and at limiting the opportunities for resorting to the policy of force  the world still faces complex political and economic problems which are fraught with dangers to peace and security. However  some positive developments in the international situation offer us promising hope that the encouraging opportunities which are still at our disposal may be utilized in the interests of world peace. They may also provide concrete assurances to the international community that present and succeeding generations will not fall victim once again to the scourge of another world war or nuclear holocaust. We are pleased to note that even greater victories are won as a result of the struggle of peoples in Asia  Africa and Latin America.75.	In the present international situation  domination and hegemonism have caused much concern among different countries. So we support the proposal made by the Foreign Minister of the USSR against the policy of hegemonism and domination  and the inclusion of an item entitled ""Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"" in the agenda of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan hopes that due consideration will be given to this issue.76.	Mr. President  as you and other distinguished representatives attending this Assembly are aware  the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which was held earlier this month in Havana  Cuba  successfully concluded its deliberations on the major political and economic problems with which mankind is confronted today. The positive results of the Havana summit meeting of the non-aligned countries will certainly contribute not only to the successes of this Assembly in indentifying the challenging problems which affect us all  but also to the formulation of more effective approaches and solutions to those problems.77.	The Sixth Conference of the non-aligned movement  reviewing the current international situation  expressed its satisfaction that efforts for the attainment of genuine peace  equal security for all  universal application of the principles of active and peaceful coexistence  and equal co-operation were intensifying.78.	The Middle East still constitutes one of the most dangerous hotbeds of crisis in the world and poses a serious threat to international peace and security  which results primarily from the hostile  aggressive and expansionist policy of Israel  backed by imperialism  and from the denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.79.	The conclusion of partial agreements in the absence of the main partyânamely  the Palestinian people  headed by the PLOâhas further complicated the possibility of finding a just  lasting  and comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem. The Sadat- Begin agreements have violated the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the non-aligned Conferences and have totally disregarded the rights and interests of the Palestinian and Arab people.80.	A just and lasting peace in the Middle East can only be achieved when all the Israeli occupationist forces are unconditionally withdrawn from the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories  including Jerusalem  and the usurped national rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish a national State of their own  are restored  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly.81.	The reported acquisition of nuclear weapons by Israel is a matter of serious concern at a time when Israel is continuing its illegal occupation of Arab and Palestinian land and its flagrant violations of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. The possession by Israel of nuclear weapons cannot but introduce a dangerous dimension to the already deteriorating situation in the Middle East. It furthermore raises the question of violations by certain nuclear- weapon States parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of their obligations under that Treaty.82.	The crisis in Lebanon has not yet found a lasting solution. The continued Israeli aggression against Lebanon  particularly the escalation of air raids against the Palestinian camps in southern Lebanon  is further proof of the aggressive and anti-peace policy of Israel.83.	For the purpose of maintaining peace and security in the world  Member States are obligated under the Charter to settle disputes or situations which might endanger world peace by peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law. This obligation entails another basic obligation for Member States: to refrain in their relations with other States from the use or threat of force. It is therefore a matter of concern to all peace-loving countries and forces to note that the resort to the policy of using force is still being resorted to by certain countries.84.	The acts of provocation and intervention against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  whose people have already made enormous sacrifices during their heroic anti-colonialist and anti-imperialist struggle  causes us concern. We hope the people of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Kampucheaâwho  like any other free people in the world  do not need to have lessons taught them from abroadâwill be left alone to continue their national missions of reconstructing their damaged countries after those hard and arduous years of colonial and imperialist domination.85.	We oppose attempts to internationalize the question of Kampuchea after the Kampuchean people victoriously established a legal and popular regime in their country. The bringing to this forum  as a new agenda item  of questions relating to Kampuchea is nothing but an attempt to restore to power a clique in exile  which has been rejected by the Kampuchean people.86.	The concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace has yet to materialize. Certain Powers are increasing their military presence and are strengthening their military bases in the Indian Ocean  contrary to the United Nations Declaration on the matter  and against the will and aspirations of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean. We demand the dismantling of imperialistic military bases in the Indian Ocean and an immediate halt to the deployment of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the Indian Ocean.87.	We reiterate our stand for the peaceful reunification of Korea without any foreign interference and for the withdrawal of foreign military forces from the southern part of the Korean peninsula.88.	The situation in southern Africa has further deteriorated as a result of the persistence of the abhorrent policy of apartheid and the joint imperialist-racist man-oeuvres to prolong the domination of Namibia and Zimbabwe. The so-called internal settlements  or bogus elections  are nothing but conspiracies against the aspirations of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe. Imperialists and racists must realize that they cannot impede forever the access to full independence of Namibia and Zimbabwe under the leadership of their legitimate and authentic liberation movementsâ namely  SWAPO and the Patriotic Front  respectively.89.	In the name of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan  I reiterate the solidarity of the Afghan people and Government with Angola  Mozambique  Zambia  Botswana and your own country  Mr. President  the United Republic of Tanzania  as front-line States confronting the racist entities which have been planted on the African continent by the colonialists and imperialists against the will and aspirations of the African people.90.	The struggle of the people of Western Sahara for self-determination and independence under the leadership of their authentic liberation movement  the Frente POLISARIO  seems to be in the last stage of its total victory. The establishment of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic for the purpose of ending the domination of their country will  we hope  close another chapter of colonialism on the African continent. We further hope that the decisions and recommendations of the sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in Monrovia in July will contribute to speeding up the process of decolonization in Western Sahara. We welcome the agreement reached between the Government of Mauritania and the Frente POLISARIO; we praise the courageous decision of Mauritania to give up all territorial claims to Western Sahara.91.	The Cyprus problem is another acute problem which causes our concern: a fellow non-aligned country is confronted with the challenge of the infringement of its independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment as a result of foreign interference in its internal affairs. While supporting more constructive  serious and effective negotiations between the representatives of both Cypriot communities on an equal footing and without foreign intervention  we believe conditions of normality and peace could better be provided by the withdrawal of all foreign military forces and by ending the foreign military presence in Cyprus.92.	We hail the victories of the peoples of Nicaragua and Grenada against the dictatorships which brought considerable hardships to those peoples and damage to their countries.93.	The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan welcomes the inclusion in the agenda of an additional item relating to assistance for the reconstruction of Nicaragua. We are confident that the international community will respond positively and generously to the needs of the people of Nicaragua  who suffered a lot as a result of the repressive Somoza military dictatorship and of the immeasurable hardship and bloodshed it imposed on that courageous people.94.	We demand the speedy application of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to the remaining colonial Territories in Latin America and elsewhere in the world.â95.	Furthermore  we demand the termination of all imperialistic foreign military bases on the soil of other countries and consider them as an infringement of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries where these bases are located.96.	The concept of peace and security as a long-held desire and as a shared objective of peace-loving mankind  in our view  cannot be realized until general and complete disarmament  including nuclear disarmament  is achieved.97.	The continuation of the arms race  particularly the nuclear arms race  and the excessive expenditures on armaments not only pose a serious danger of extinction for our civilization  but also reflect our very limited success in giving effect to the resolutions and decisions adopted on disarmament  particularly at the tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament. In this connexion  the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan welcomes and supports the formal proposal presented to the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly by Czechoslovakia calling for inclusion in the agenda of an item entitled ""Adoption of a declaration on international co-operation for disarmament"".98.	The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan considers the conclusion of the Treaty on strategic nuclear weapons between the Soviet Union and the United States a positive step towards curbing the arms race and a success of the policy of peace. We hope the effective implementation of that Treaty will pave the way for the conclusion of new agreements on limiting strategic arms.99.	We maintain the view that the convening of a world disarmament conference with the participation of all nuclear-weapon States would offer a good opportunity and a suitable forum for assessing our achievements and our failures regarding the speedy implementation of the resolutions and decisions on disarmament.100.	We firmly support the broadening and deepening of the process of dÃ©tente and hope that political detente will soon be supplemented by military detente and will encompass all regions of the world.101.	Afghanistan considers the United Nations as an indispensable instrument for maintaining international peace and security  despite violations of the Charter by certain Member countries and the non-observance of United Nations resolutions by those countries. We shall continue  inter alia  our efforts towards the further strengthening of the role of this Organization in responding effectively and quickly to situations which tend to threaten world peace and security.102.	The very slow progress in the ongoing efforts at restructuring present international economic relations is further compounded by the prevailing crisis in the world economic system  which has severe repercussions on the economy of the developing countries  particularly the land-locked and least developed among them  because of their greater vulnerability to external economic influences.103.	The developing countries which have inherited backwardness and poverty from the dark era of colonialism are determined to emerge from exploitation to economic emancipation and from dependence on imperialism to self-reliance. For this purpose they have sincerely and seriously continued their efforts for the establishment of a new international economic order based on justice and equality. We hope that through positive dialogue and with a demonstration of political will on the part of the developed market-economy countries  this shared goal will soon become a reality.104.	I deem it necessary to draw once again the attention of this Assembly to the well-known special problems and particular needs of the developing landlocked  least developed and island countries. The measures taken so far in their favour have yet to be implemented. The United Nations Special Fund for Land-Locked Developing Countries  established by this Assembly to compensate for the additional transport  transit and transhipment costs of the land-locked countries has yet to become effectively operational. We hope generous financial contributions will be made to the Fund during the new pledging conference.105.	I should like to conclude my statement by reiterating our faith and conviction in the ability and constructive strength of peoples and nations  in the dignity and worth of human persons  and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.106.	Despite many problems and challenges facing mankind  we have every reason to believe that we have the ability to build together a new and better world  where people and nations can live together in peace with one another without any concern or deprivation.107.	Let us make the ideal of building such a world of peace and prosperity a reality where there exists freedom and equality of rights for all without any discrimination and without any exploitation of man by man. Let us rededicate ourselves to the realization of this lofty objective with all our strength and potentialities and with some higher degree of determination and faith."
"2",95,"ALB",34,1979,"ï»¿Permit me first  Sir  to extend to you the warmest congratulations of the Albanian delegation on your election to the important post of President of the thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly.2.	I should like to take this opportunity also to welcome Saint Lucia as a new Member of our Organization.3.	This session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time when the world situation is very complex and fraught with great dangers. This is the result of the intensification of the expansionist and hegemonistic policy pursued by the super-Powers and their efforts to exercise their dictates  their arbitrariness and their interference in the internal affairs of all countries. The fact is that this policy and these actions affect  in one way or another and to varying degrees  all the countries of the world.4.	The rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union for domination and hegemony in the world has been and remains the main source of tension and conflict between different countries  as well as local wars  and is the greatest danger to the peace and security of the peoples.5.	Today all of us are witnesses to the efforts being made by the super-Powers to extend their military alliances  to strengthen further their aggressive character and to intensify their activities and interference in increasingly broad areas of the world. A feverish race is going on between the aggressive blocs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and the Warsaw Treaty .Organization  not only to increase their military arsenals but also to include other countries in those blocs and to exercise increasing pressure on countries which want to preserve their national freedom  independence and sovereignty. New military bases are being added to the ones they already have in foreign countries; their fleets  equipped with nuclear weapons  are patrolling the most distant seas; and the skies are filled with satellites that spy on all the countries of the world. The imperialist general staffs are working out plans concerning which countries should be attacked first and which subsequently; in what region they should intervene today and in what region tomorrow.6.	A new aggressive alliance is in the process of being created in the Far East. In the shadow of and in collaboration with the United States  social-imperialist China is seeking to create spheres of domination  to become the principal military Power in that zone  and to establish its domination in Asia and throughout the Pacific.7.	In the economic field  the super-Powers and the other neo-colonialist States are intensifying daily their efforts to plunder the national assets of the peoples of the world and to exploit  directly or indirectly  all the countries which depend on them. The super-profits the big imperialist Powers obtain from the plundering of oil and other raw materials from the Arab countries  Africa  Asia and Latin America  and from the inequality of prices in trade and the fabulous incomes they earn from the colonialist system of loans  credits  aid and so on have already become incalculable. The indebtedness of many countries of the world to the imperialist and neo- colonialist Powers is increasing relentlessly  which only serves to make the situation of the peoples of the world even worse.8.	World imperialism is striving to preserve at all costs this intolerable situation and these relations  through demagogy and deception  through interference and diktat  and by fire and the sword. It is trying to preserve and extend the omnipotence of multinational corporations in foreign countries  to preserve inhuman  bloodthirsty neo-colonialism  and to prop up reactionary regimes which defend imperialist domination wherever it exists.9.	A flagrant example of the arrogance  cynicism and aggressiveness of imperialism is the decision of the United States to create a military strike force ready to intervene by force in the Middle East oil zone whenever it considers that its own interests are in jeopardy. In that way the United States imperialists are seeking to suppress with fire and the sword the right of peoples to determine in complete freedom and sovereignty how they will dispose of their wealth and the fruits of their toil and to whom they are going to sell and from whom they are going to buy.10.	The super-Powers are striving to extend their policy of pressure  diktat and arbitrariness to all their international relations. They want to monopolize all world affairs  to become arbiters and to impose on others solutions which suit their own narrow interests. Through false slogans  intimidation and blackmail and under the pretext that they are defending them from this or that enemy or that they are assisting them to find solutions for some particular difficult situation  they are striving to place other countries under their tutelage and turn them into appendages of their imperialist policies  to make them cannon fodder for the aggressive wars they are preparing.11.	The crisis in the economic  political  military  cultural and other fields  which has the imperialist Powers and the big capitalist countries in its grip today  is becoming even more acute. This is a consequence of their system of exploitation and their internal contra-dictions  the armaments race and their unrestrained non-productive expenditure  their rivalry on an international scale for markets and zones of influence  and the resistance which their hegemonistic and aggressive policies are encountering.12.	However the big imperialist Powers are striving to saddle not only their own working people but also other peoples with the burden of the crisis  which has been going on for a very long time with no end in sight. The fact is that these Powers  while stubbornly maintaining colonialist and neo-colonialist systems in their international economic relations  are turning more and more to the exportation of inflation  are increasing the prices of the commodities they export  and are intensifying their plunder. They are to blame for the great disorders which we can see in the international monetary systems  the anomalies which are apparent in the raw material markets and in the widening of the gap in terms of per capita incomes between the developed and the under-developed countries.13.	If the standard of living has fallen  if unemployment has increased and the economy is marking time in many countries  this comes about because world imperialism and capitalism are seeking to preserve intact their capitalist super-profits  because they want to preserve and even further intensify social and national oppression  and because they want to emerge from their crisis at the expense of others.14.	Certainly  the present-day international situation is not characterized only by the policy and activities of super-Powers and the forces of reaction. One of its main  most important and very encouraging features is the increased determination of peoples to oppose the policy of aggression and war  of plunder and exploitation  practised by the imperialist Powers. In many countries the movement of the broad masses of the people against foreign domination  economic exploitation  social and national oppression and cultural and spiritual impoverishment is increasing in scope and depth.15.	The latest events prove that the imperialist Powers and world reaction cannot feel at ease and secure even where they thought that their domination was indisputable. The facts show that the earth is being scorched under the feet of imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism  that the volcano of anger and hatred on which they are sitting has erupted and will continue to erupt ever more powerfully.16.	A vivid and significant example of this is the overthrow of the bloodthirsty regime of the Shah of Iran. The uprising of the Iranian people was a powerful explosion of their hatred for the despotic tyranny of the feudal-bourgeois class with the Shah at its head  and against foreign domination. It constituted a powerful blow to all imperialist Powers and world capitalism  first and foremost to American imperialism which  until then  had plundered Iranian oil and mercilessly exploited the working masses of Iran. This is also confirmed by the great disarray caused in the capitalist- imperialist world by the events in Iran and the measures taken in that country for the establishment of national sovereignty over its oil and other sectors of the economy.17.	Imperialism and the international bourgeoisie are terrified that the Iranian example might spread  especially in the Middle East  leading to an outburst  a revolt of the people against foreign domination and plunder  and the establishment of national control over oil and its use to the advantage of their liberation and progress.18.	Various imperialists have invested considerable sums of money m the oil-producing countries of the Middle East in order to exploit the natural resources of those countries  from which foreign monopolies draw colossal profits. In no way do they want these riches to be placed in the hands of those to whom they belongâ the peoples of those countries. The capitalist monopolies and the imperialist Powers which stand behind them are striving at all costs to preserve the existing situation  to preserve their intensive exploitation and merciless plundering of Arab oil. To that end  the imperialist Powers are using all possible means to defend those political forces and social structures which collaborate with the monopolies and assist them in oppressing and exploiting the masses. They are dispatching large quantities of weapons and advisers  forming alliances and manoeuvring in various ways to suppress the legitimate demands of the peoples of the region and to prevent them from winning their full freedom and independence and exercising their genuine national sovereignty in every sector and on all questions.19.	It is not for nothing that imperialism has set up Israel and keeps it alive; it is not in vain that it has armed it to the teeth. Israel is the most bloodthirsty tool of American imperialism  its gendarme for defending the monopolies which plunder Arab oil  the dagger ready in its hand ready to strike the Arab peoples who are fighting for their rights. Therefore  the struggle against Israel  the liberation of the occupied Arab territories  the liberation of oil from foreign monopolies  the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  are a major problem common to all the Arab peoples. Naturally  they also have other specific problems and preoccupations  but it is this great problem which binds them together in a common cause and which makes their unity imperative. The solution of this problem through their joint struggle also contributes and leads to the solution of their specific problems.20.	It is precisely against this common cause of the Arab peoples that the blows of United States imperialism  world capitalism and Soviet social- imperialism  which is also striving to profit from the situation in order to capture dominating positions in the Middle East  are aimed.21.	It is the intensification of imperialist interference and the aggressive activities of American imperialism  the manoeuvres of Soviet social-imperialism  the intrigues of Chinese social-imperialism and the growing arrogance of Israeli Zionists which have made the situation in the Middle East even more grave and tense.22.	The American-Egyptian-Israeli talks at Camp David brought about further complications and have made the solution of the problems still more difficult. The Arab peoples and progressive opinion have considered the situation created in this region after the signing of the separate Egyptian-Israeli Treaty as a heavy blow to the just cause of the Palestinian people and the vital interests of the other Arab peoples  and as assistance to United States imperialism and its Zionist tool to interfere and dominate in the Middle East.23.	The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has supported and will always support the just cause of the Arab peoples. We hold the view that there can be no peace and stability in the Middle East without a just and lasting solution to the problems of that region  and first and foremost the Palestinian problem. If these problems are to be solved  Israel must be forced to withdraw from all the Arab territories it has occupied through violence and aggression. It must be forced to put an end to its aggressive  annexationist policy against the Arab peoples and countries  and the way must be barred to the interference and plots of the United States of America and the Soviet Union in that region. In order that peace and stability may be established in the Middle East  it is essential that all the national rights of the Palestinian people be restored.24.	We are convinced that the fraternal Arab peoples  who are progressive peoples with an ancient culture and long traditions of struggle for freedom and independence  will be able to cope with the new difficulties created by the intrigues and plots of their imperialist Zionist enemies and will  by establishing militant unity among themselves  succeed in realizing their lofty national aspirations.25.	The overthrow of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua is another example that proves once again that when peoples develop a self-awareness and are determined to fight to the end for their rights  the struggle of the masses of the people becomes a powerful wave that topples even the most ferocious regimes supported by imperialism.26.	The events in Nicaragua have shown that the situation in the majority of the countries of Latin America is revolutionary and that the revolution for the overthrow of the bourgeois-landowner class and the elimination of the dependence on imperialism has become ever more emphatically the order of the day. The peoples of that continent are becoming ever more conscious of the need to intensify the popular struggle against internal and external oppression and exploitation  for freedom  democracy and social progress. They can no longer reconcile themselves to Latin America's remaining a preserve of the United States of America  from which the big United States monopolies draw colossal super profits.27.	United States imperialism  which dominates and exerts strict control over the most vital sectors of the economies of the majority of Latin American countries  employs all its meansâmilitary  political  economic  propagandists  and so onâto preserve and strengthen at all costs its domination on that continent and to prop up the dictatorial regimes that are in its service.28.	Recent years have seen an intensification of efforts by the Soviet social imperialists to penetrate Latin America in various forms and to seize dominating positions in that continent. By means of deceitful demagogy and diabolical activities  they are playing a disruptive and subversive role in the liberation movement in Latin America.29.	The poverty of the masses of the people  the weak and one-sided development of the economy  inflation and unemployment and colossal indebtedness to United States capital are direct consequences of the twofold oppression and colonialist and neo-colonialist blunder of the Latin American countries by United States imperialism. These serious conditions and these situations have led to the implanting of the idea of revolution as the reliable path to national and social liberation in the consciousness of workers  peasants  progressive intellectuals and the masses of the youth of those countries. The great revolt of the people in Nicaragua was a clear demonstration of this.30.	The greed of the imperialist super-Powers and the former colonial Powers is increasingly being directed towards Africa. As a consequence  numerous external and internal factors which create political insecurity  which hinder and weaken the struggle against imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism  and which sometimes lead to conflicts  setting one African State against another  are operating on that continent today. The stirring up of local wars by the super-Powers and other imperialist Powers  in which they intervene with armaments supplies or advisers or even by bringing in mercenaries from abroad  is becoming a widespread phenomenon in Africa. The facts have proved that wherever the United States of America  the Soviet Union and the other imperialist Powers have offered their ""good offices"" or have offered to play the roles of protectors and peace-makers between States  conflicts have become even more acute  hotbeds of tension have increased and the imperialist Powers have seized the opportunity to strengthen their presence in this or that country.31.	But there is no force that can halt and extinguish the awakening of the peoples of Africa  their struggle for freedom and independence and their efforts to establish their complete sovereignty over their resources or to preserve their own cultures and traditions. United States imperialism  Soviet social imperialism  Chinese social imperialism and the other big capitalist Powers can make every effort and use every trick  can spread various empty theories about so- called ""non-alignment""  ""three worlds""  and so on; they can provide handouts and credits  but they cannot halt the march towards realization of the aspiration of the African peoples to advance free and independent on the path of development and progress.32.	The freedom and the emancipation of the African peoples is one of the major imperatives of the time  an irresistible historical process. The peoples of the African continent  the proletariat and the new revolutionary intelligentsia  which are becoming ever more conscious of the oppression by foreigners and by internal enemies  can no longer believe in the false preachings of the old colonialists and the neo-colonialists as to their ""benevolence"" and their alleged ""concern"" for the development and progress of Africa  and they can no longer believe in the alliance and the diabolic aid which the Soviet or Chinese social imperialists and others offer them. The correct road to the achievement of liberation  development and progress for Africa is resistance and determined struggle against the diktat of and political  economic and military interference by international imperialism  against the reactionary theories and the deceitful propaganda of foreign Powers  against the plots and intrigues they employ to maintain their domination and plunder  and against racial discrimination and oppression.33.	The Albanian people have always been and will remain sincere friends of the African peoples and resolute supporters of their liberation and anti-imperialist struggles. They strongly support the just struggles of the peoples of Azania  Namibia and Zimbabwe to put an end to the savage policy of racial discrimination and apartheid and to win their freedom and independence. The farce of ""internal settlement"" through ""elections"" of the problem of Zimbabwe or Namibia is but a smokescreen for the racist regimes and the imperialist Powers standing behind them to preserve and perpetuate their colonial domination.34.	Imperialism and social imperialism  the overt and covert enemies of the freedom and independence of the peoples  cannot halt the advance of history. The deep- rooted revolutionary transformations within individual countries  and particularly on the international level in general  are an objective demand of our time and are a question that needs to be taken up for solution  not some distant prospect. Millions of people have joined the struggle for such transformations today  and this struggle will certainly advance irrespective of the obstacles and difficulties in its path.35.	Imperialism  social imperialism and world capitalism are striving by every possible means to maintain and expand their domination and exploitation of the peoples. The peoples of the world are fighting to throw off the foreign yoke  to win their freedom and to live in independence. History proves that  no matter how difficult and protracted the struggle  the final victory belongs to the peoples.36.	In his book Imperialism and Revolution the leader of the Albanian people  Enver Hoxha  wrote:' 'The imperialist and social-imperialist Powers are striving in the same way to prevent the African  Asian or Latin American people from developing stage by stage their revolutionary struggle against the oppression and savage exploitation carried out by their leaders and the imperialists  who rule in agreement with them and who suck their blood. The duty of revolutionaries  progressives and patriots in countries with a low level of socio-economic development and dependent on the imperialist and social-imperialist Powers  is to make the peoples aware of this oppression and exploitation  to educate  mobilize and organize them and to hurl them into the liberation struggle  always bearing in mind that it is the broad masses  the peoples  that make revolution.""37.	National liberation struggles are just. Therefore  they enjoy the support of all revolutionary  democratic and progressive forces in the world. They are also indispensable  because it is only through them that freedom and national independence can be won  that genuine democratic rights can be established and that social justice can be achieved.38.	Socialist Albania  the Albanian people  are on the side of the oppressed  on the side of those who rise up against foreign domination and internal reaction. They support the revolutionary straggles of the peoples  which serve to bring about progressive and qualitative changes in their lives and in the lives of the whole of mankind. Similarly  the Albanian people have maintained and always will maintain solidarity with and support for those who fight against racial discrimination and fascism and for democracy and progress.39.	Another problem which has concerned world public opinion is the grave situation created in South-East Asia. The heroic Vietnamese people had to shed their blood once again to defend their homeland against the barbarous aggression of the Chinese social-imperialists  who have acted towards them just as the old colonialists and United States imperialists acted in the past.40.	The Chinese aggression against the Vietnamese people and all the recent events in Indo-China took place against the background of the fierce rivalry of the imperialist super-Powersâthe United States  the Soviet Union and Chinaâwhich  in order to attain their hegemonic and expansionist aims in that area  employed both the methods of direct intervention and the well-known imperialist practice of inciting Indo- Chinese against Indo-Chinese. The sufferings of the peoples of Indo-China today are the continuation of the sufferings of which they had been the victims for years  nay decades on end  because of the aggression and interference of United States imperialism  which spread death and destruction throughout Viet Nam  Laos and Cambodia. Again  it was the United States imperialists who gave their blessings to and encouraged the aggression of the Chinese social-imperialists against the Vietnamese people. The crocodile tears shed by United States imperialists  when they express regret over the plight of the peoples of Indo-China or when they seek to pose as the champions of principles  can-not conceal these facts. Similarly  the hypocrisy of the S<3viet social-imperialists when they speak of their friendship for the peoples of Indo-China fails to conceal their hegemonic aims in South-East Asia and their efforts to lure the countries of this region into their sphere of influence.41.	Recent events have once again confirmed the fact that imperialism and social imperialism are the enemies of the peoples of Indo-China. Reliance on the ""friendship"" of one super-Power  in the hope of being defended against the threats and hostility of the other  always has dangerous consequences.42.	Just as they gave powerful support to the struggle of the Indo-Chinese peoples against the United States imperialist aggressors and their lackeys  the Albanian people also support the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against the barbarous aggression of the Chinese social-imperialists and condemn this aggression. We have supported  and will continue to support  the right of the Vietnamese people  the Cambodian people and the Lao people to live free and independent and to preserve the independence  national sovereignty and territorial integrity of their own countries. We support the right of each of these peoples  and indeed of every other people in the world  to resolve their internal problems themselves free from any foreign interference.43.	With its aggression against the Vietnamese people and its hegemonic activity in South-East Asia  China came out openly with the policy of an imperialist superpower. At a time when the new Chinese imperialist doctrine of ""teaching a lesson"" is being added to the notorious enslaving doctrines of United States imperialism and the ill-famed doctrine of ""limited sovereignty"" of Soviet social-imperialism  the dangers threatening the freedom-loving peoples and countries of the world are becoming ever greater and more serious.44.	During the past year nothing has occurred in Europe to prove that the dangers threatening the peoples and States of that region have been eliminated. The United States of America and the Soviet Union have a great deal to say about the need to preserve the status quo in Europe. But this kind of status quo in no way implies tranquillity or security for the European countries. The two super-Powers need this status quo to maintain their spheres of influence  to dictate their will and to maintain the permanent threat and fear in Europe  in face of the Soviet-United States military potential and the possibility of a confrontation between the two super-Powers and the aggressive military blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization.45.	The arms race and the war preparations in Europe are assuming ever greater proportions and being intensified at an ever increasing rhythm. The United States and the Soviet Union exert constant pressure on the States members of the aggressive alliances which they control to force them to increase their military budgets  to integrate themselves to the utmost within American and Soviet war strategies and to involve them in aggressive activities on all continents. The United States imperialists have again pulled out from their archives the plan for the creation of a special military force  within the framework of NATO  which is to be used by them as a mobile international gendarmerie in any corner of the world  wherever their interests may be affected.46.	The military manoeuvres of an aggressive character conducted by the United States and the Soviet Union  and the NATO and Warsaw Treaty countries  the provocative movements of the United States and the Soviet fleets in the Mediterranean and other seas around Europe  are by no means evidence of any detente or the strengthening of understanding and trust in Europe  as those countries claim. They are evidence of the constant contradictions and the clash of interests between the super-Powers and imperialist Powers and the feverish preparations for war.47.	But  naturally  these contradictions are not on such a scale as to justify the claims of the Chinese social-imperialists that war in Europe is imminent and that a world war will inevitably begin on that continent. It is understandable that the Chinese social-imperialists greatly desire a war in Europe and are striving to kindle one in the hope that the two other imperialist superpowers will destroy each other and  then  the Chinese social-imperialists will remain the sole masters in the world. Hence  the intrigues and conspiratorial activities of the three imperialist super-Powers are interconnected in Europe today. Under these conditions  the resolute rebuff to this dangerous activity by the peoples of Europe takes on special importance.48.	The American imperialists and the Soviet social imperialists have long been engaging in various types of action to trouble the waters in the Balkans. To these intrigues  the Chinese social-imperialists have in recent years added their own. The Balkan peoples have cause to remember the misfortunes caused them by the intervention of the imperialist Powers in the past  and they have sufficient experience to judge what actions they must take to prevent others from turning the Balkans into a powder keg.49.	The People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always been and will remain a factor for peace and stability in the Balkans. It has worked and will continue to work to maintain and develop good-neighbourly relations with adjacent States and will oppose efforts by the imperialist Power's to create tension and foment disturbances in the Balkans.50.	The Government of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania has always considered that the question of Cyprus must be solved by the people of Cyprus themselves. We welcome any positive step that will contribute to the establishment of harmony and understanding between the two communities  and in this connexion we hope that conditions for a just solution will gradually be worked out in keeping with the interests of the people of Cyprus as a whole and of the peace and stability of the surrounding area.51.	Similarly  we reaffirm our support of the right of the Korean people themselves to resolve the question of the reunification of their homeland independently and without outside interference.52.	The pursuit of the arms race and other preparations for war by the imperialist super-Powers is a matter for serious concern to freedom-loving peoples and countries. The imperialist Powers' propaganda concerning disarmament cannot conceal the threat that the unbridled arms race is bringing to bear on the world. For that matter  it has been proved that disarmament cannot be achieved through discussions  resolutions or agreements between the arms race protagonists. In no way can the Soviet-American agreement concluded following the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] at Vienna be considered as a for-ward step towards disarmament  as is claimed by the American imperialists and the Soviet social-imperialists. That agreement totally fails to deal with the question of how the two super-Powers will implement disarmament or of how to slow down the arms race between them. It merely defines how  in what proportions  with what and when they will increase their arms supply. What kind of disarmament is it when weapons are being increased and improved  when the traffic in weapons is spreading  when the manufacture of arms and research in this field are absorbing colossal amounts of money and when hundreds of thousands of the most capable human minds  have been put to work on weapons and war at a time when hunger  disease  and other afflictions  are so widespread? The peoples of the world are against the arms race and against imperialist wars  but they are unable to agree to relinquish their freedom and sovereign rights to escape these wars  as the American imperialists and Soviet social imperialists demand. Nor can the peoples of the world come to terms with the overtly warmongering preachments of the Chinese social-imperialists  who are trying to divert them from their opposition to preparations for a world war on the pretext that it is inevitable. The struggle against arms and the arms race  against preparations for war and against the danger of the outbreak of war is not a vain and hopeless one.53.	Comrade Enver Hoxha  the leader of the Albanian people  has said:- ""When the super-Powers are no longer able to achieve their predatory interests through economic  ideological and diplomatic means  when contradictions have become acute in the highest degree  when the agreements and 'reforms' prove incapable of resolving such contradictions  then war will begin between them. Thus the peoples whose blood will be shed in this war must do everything in their power not to be caught unawares  to sabotage the rapacious inter-imperialist war to prevent it from assuming world-wide proportions and  if they fail  to transform it into a war of liberation and emerge from it victorious.""54.	This year the Albanian people are celebrating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the liberation of their homeland and of the triumph of the people's revolution. During these 35 years of free and independent life  they have brought about profound transformations in all areas. Socialist Albania has established a diversified industry; it has created a powerful energy base and today has a collectivized agricultural system that is undergoing continual modernization. Our people is now producing the iron and steel it needs  factories and equipment of all kinds  and is beginning to set up a machine-tool industry. Albania is economically stable and is experiencing continuing growth in this area. It is in a position to provide high rates of economic and cultural expansion and to improve the standard of living of its population without foreign economic aid. Internal resources ensure extended socialist growth. Our economy's vitality was particularly demonstrated last year when we were able successfully to counter the anti-Albanian moves of the Chinese social-imperialists by completing and putting into operation projects they had intentionally left incomplete or had sabotaged.55.	The People's Socialist Republic of Albania is pursuing a principled and independent foreign policy. Firmly adhering to the policy of good neighbourliness and the recognized democratic principles governing the relations among sovereign countries  Albania stands for the development of normal relations and for the expansion of trade  cultural and other exchanges with countries that respect those principles. It supports sincere international co-operation with freedom- loving  democratic and progressive countries. Our country has repudiated and will continue to repudiate all the chauvinist concepts of the imperialists and social imperialists who are attempting to base all international relations on inequality  arbitrariness and diktat.56.	Albania is confident of its future. The Albanian people  under the leadership of the Albanian Labour Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha  are working with enthusiasm and great determination towards the farther development and strengthening of their homeland  relying entirely on their own resources. As always  they will vigilantly safeguard their own victories. They hold out a begging hand to no one. The People's Socialist Republic of Albania will respond appropriately to any attempt by the imperialists  the social imperialists  or anyone else  to divert it from its independent political and ideological course.57.	The Albanian people value highly the feelings of solidarity and respect that freedom-loving peoples and countries and progressive mankind throughout the world hold for them. We should like to take this opportunity to express our thanks and our profound gratitude to all those who expressed their friendship and solidarity with the Albanian people in the great damage they suffered as a result of the powerful earthquake that struck several regions of Albania on 15 April of this year. The consequences of this earthquake were completely overcome before 1 October 1979  as provided by the decision of the Council of Ministers of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania. In less than six months  therefore  relying entirely on our own resources  we rebuilt or repaired 17 128 houses and economic and socio-cultural buildings  all at State expense and at no cost to the inhabitants.58.	In conclusion  I should like to reaffirm the readiness of the Albanian delegation to join its efforts with those of other democratic and progressive countries in order that the work of this session of the General Assembly may serve the cause of freedom and independence of peoples and of true peace and security in the world."
"3",163,"ARE",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of my country  I have the honour of extending my most sincere congratulations to Mr. Salim on his election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am sure that his choice for this important post reflects the international community's appreciation of his qualities  which we have observed in his discharge of the functions of Permanent Representative of his country. They are qualities  that have been reflected in his very wise conduct of the chairmanship of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and in the important role which he played in bringing about justice and truth in southern Africa and Palestine while he represented the United Republic of Tanzania in the Security Council. We are sure that  with his qualifications and experience in international affairs and his dedication to the United Nations  he will be able to fulfil the task entrusted to him in leading the work of the Assembly with total success.69.	We should also like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to Mr. Salim's predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  who conducted the proceedings of the last session of the General Assembly so successfully.70.	We should also like to congratulate Saint Lucia  which has just been admitted to membership in our Organization.71.	On behalf of the delegation of United Arab Emirates 1 should like to express again our respect and appreciation to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for his efforts to achieve the primary objective for which the United Nations was founded: namely  the safeguarding of international peace and security. The Secretary-General has been consistent in his efforts and has carried out a number of visits to various parts of the world  the results of which have been reflected in the excellent report he has submitted to us on the work of the Organization  In spite of the positive results that have affected international life in certain areas  the main feature of the report is the profound concern we all feel about the fate of mankind because of a continued absence of democracy in international life and the persistence of economic and social injustice in the world today.72.	A review of the international situationâwhether from the political or the economic standpointâsince the previous session of the General Assembly  hardly gives grounds for optimism  for  on the political scene  we unfortunately see certain dangerous trends emerging that might reactivate certain aspects of the cold war and lead to a deterioration of the situation in certain parts of the world. This derives from the failure to achieve real progress in solving serious international problems by eradicating their causes  and from a failure to respect the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.73.	The Middle East  of which we are a part  is still far from real peace  in spite of the efforts that have been made both inside and outside the United Nations.74.	Our delegation would like to reaffirm that we are profoundly convinced of the truth  accepted by the international community as a whole  that the cause of the Palestinian people is at the very core of the Middle East problem and that there can be no settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict without a global settlement of the Palestinian question. We believe that that settlement should be based on the following: first  Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  and secondly  the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  particularly its rights to return  to self-determination  to have an independent State and to recover its sovereignty over its territory. We also believe that the PLO  which we consider to be the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  should participate in all efforts to settle this question in conformity with the right of peoples to self-determination and in application of the principle of the inadmissibility of the annexation of territory by force. Respect for these principles alone can bring us to the just and lasting peace so much hoped tor by the people of the region.75.	In the light of all these facts and principles we rejected the Camp David agreements and the Israeli- Egyptian peace treaty because those agreements disregard these facts and principles.76.	The barbarous attacks of Israel upon southern Lebanon  the victims of which are Lebanese and Palestinians  are of profound concern to us  because they are a threat to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon. They also threaten the Palestinian people  which are menaced by total extermination. We address an appeal to the international community to adopt all measures necessary to compel Israel to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council that demand its withdrawal from all Lebanese territory.77.	The development of events in southern Africa  in Zimbabwe and Namibia  are of profound concern to us because we think that the racist minority is still trying to perpetuate its domination and to trample underfoot the dignity of the peoples of that region and to subject them to domination.78.	In South Africa  the racist Government continues to establish Bantustans and to apply the policy of apartheid.79.	In Namibia  the racist regime of South Africa continues to create obstacles and great difficulties in order to prevent the United Nations from participating in the process of ensuring independence for that people and thus enabling it to exercise its right to self- determination under the leadership of the SWAPO  its only legitimate representative.80.	In Zimbabwe  Ian Smith and his supporters among the racist white minority  continue to subvert any effort made and any conference convened for the settlement of the problem in that region under the leadership of the Patriotic Front  the sole legitimate representative of that people.81.	We are convinced that we should increase material and moral assistance for the African liberation movements until their regions are liberated from the yoke of colonialism and the domination of the racist minority. The United Arab Emirates have always given assistance to the liberation movements  and we shall continue to do so until such time as colonialism and racism have been eradicated from the area.82.	The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization contains another disappointment on an important question that has concerned the United Nations for a long time: the question of Cyprus. The breaking-off of negotiations between the two Cypriot communities is a source of concern with regard to the future security of this island. We can only hope for the resumption of serious negotiations between the representatives of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities  so that they may reach an agreement that will guarantee peaceful coexistence for the people of the island and will safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.83.	The United Arab Emirates has declared on many occasions that it welcomes the creation of nuclear-free zones. Our State has also supported  since its independence  the United Nations Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace so that rivalry between the great Powers may be eliminated from that region to which we belong. We have also co-operated diligently and faithfully with our neighbours to bring stability and security to that area.84.	We followed with great interest the long and tedious negotiations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  and we hope that at the forthcoming session it will be possible to carry out the programme of action that was drafted at the eighth session  so that next year we can have a convention on the law of the sea.85.	The tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  showed the importance that the peoples and Governments of the world attach to this important subject. This subject is intimately linked with the primary objective that led to the creation of the United Nations  namely the safeguarding of international peace and security. It is no longer possible to continue to live in a climate of nuclear terror  nor is it possible any longer to remain silent about the vast resources that are being wasted on armaments at a time when mankind is in dire need of all those resources for purposes of economic and social development. While the tenth special session was very difficult and the negotiations highly complex  it can be said that its results constitute a first step on the long road that should lead to general and complete disarmament. The Final Document adopted by consensus at the end of the special session stipulates a strategy for disarmament  which will help guide us in all our efforts to this end in the years to come. The special session also recommended the creation of an international organization to deal with disarmament questions in all their aspects  and we hope that the next special session to be held on this subject will make even more progress in order to clear the way for the holding of a world disarmament conference in which all the States of the world will participate and which should be prepared for in such a way as to guarantee its success.86.	We welcome the most recent agreement concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic armaments  the treaty resulting from the second stage of SALT negotiations.87.	Since the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly  economic problems have grown more complex daily and the gap between developed and developing countries has become wider and deeper. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer because of the refusal of the developed countries to participate in serious negotiations to create a new  just and equitable economic system.88.	The current economic systems are no longer adequate. Consequently  it has become necessary to hasten the conclusion of negotiations between the developing countries and the developed countries under the auspices of the United Nations and in accordance with the relevant resolutions  the most important of which are those adopted by the sixth and seventh special sessions89.	In order to provide radical solutions to international economic problems  we must find just solutions to a certain number of problems  the most important of which are the indexing of primary commodity prices of exports from the developing countries to the developed countries  and in turn  the establishment of equitable prices for the manufactured goods imported by the developing countries from the industrialized countries. International trade problems should also be settled by alleviating the protectionist policies pursued by the industrialized countries  which prevent the products of the developing countries from reaching markets. There are also the problems of the transfer of technology  of increased and diversified industrial productivity and of limiting the control transnational societies exercise over the natural resources of the developing countries. There must also be a drastic solution of financial and monetary questions because the present monetary system obstructs financial and monetary relations between States. The present system has created distortions in the balance of payments of the developing countries and has increased the rate of inflation in those countries because the developed countries export inflation; it has also caused a deterioration in exchange rates  which has forced the developing countries to limit their development programmes and has imposed on them a heavy burden of indebtedness.90.	The phenomenon of famine  rife in developing countries  is a source of great concern and should be promptly alleviated through a joint international effort  so people suffering from hunger may be adequately fed.91.	We believe that the international community should intensify its negotiating efforts within the context of the North-South dialogue in order to devise a new formula for a new international economic order based on right  justice and equity. We hope that the next special session of the United Nations General Assembly  which will be held in 1980  will provide the opportunity for the realization of this objective.92.	The United Arab Emirates wishes to reaffirm that it will continue to fulfil its responsibilities to the international community and the third-world countries who believe in collective efforts and true international cooperation aimed at establishing a new international society based on the principles of justice and peace."
"4",210,"ARG",34,1979,"ï»¿First of all  I wish to convey to Mr. Salim our profound satisfaction at seeing him occupying the high post of President of this session of the General Assembly. His vast and important experience in this Organization  the intelligence and efficiency with which he has for so long directed the work of the Special Committee on decolonization  and his recognized personal and professional qualifications are all elements that ensure that his performance will contribute positively and significantly to the success of this session. Moreover  he represents the United Republic of Tanzania  a country with which Argentina maintains cordial relations.283.	I believe it unnecessary to underline the important and positive role that the United Republic of Tanzania  as well as its African sister republics  plays at present in the international community. That important role constitutes one of the most characteristic events of the post-war era  and has contributed to stabilization and democratization in international relations. My Government is convinced that the growing and active participation of Africa in international life is an indispensable factor for an adequate solution of the grave political  social and economic conflicts that preoccupy the world and endanger peaceful and orderly coexistence among nations.284.	My Government wishes to hail and congratulate also Mr. Salim's predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre  who so efficiently discharged his duties as President of the Assembly during the thirty-third regular session and with whose country  Colombia  the Argentine Republic is bound by so many close ties.285.	The General Assembly  loyal to its adherence to the principle of universality  a few days ago admitted as a new Member of the Organization a young Latin American nation  Saint Lucia  whose recent independence and present inclusion in the comity of nations we celebrate greatly. We extend to the Government and people of Saint Lucia our warmest congratulations  and to its delegation we wish to convey our sentiments of goodwill for the development of close and fruitful cooperation within the United Nations.286.	Peace  the preservation of which is the main objective that has brought together here the representatives of 152 countries  neither can nor should be considered the mere absence of armed conflict. The strengthening of peace and the consolidation of international security presuppose much more. Peace means a state of affairs in which conflicts  rivalries  distrust and attempts to impose political  economic or ideological supremacies are abandoned in order to open the way to understanding  harmony and co-operation. It means widening and deepening the incipient process of detente  which began to emerge a few years ago. It means  in other words  the realization of the purposes and the principles sanctioned by the United Nations Charter.287.	Seen from this perspective  the review of the major world events since the preceding general debate does not allow us to draw very optimistic conclusions. Those conditions are far from having materialized; instead new hotbeds of tension that have appeared in-various regions increasing the possibilities of confrontation which are always latent.â288.	Subtle methods of penetration and destabilization  used for perfectly obvious purposes  are constancy being applied  thus rendering meaningless the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States that is so often proclaimed and as often violated. Nihilistic violence  which aims at the destruction of free societies incapable of reacting  has continued to manifest itself and affect even those who  having given refuge to those terrorists defeated in other countries  believed that they were immune to their criminal attacks.289.	This last aspect of a rather discouraging overview is also linked to the subject of human rights  the distorted treatment of which is adding to the list of disturbing factors. Indeed  the noble cause served by the protection of those rights is being inadmissibly exploited as a political weapon in order to affect relations between States. The good faith and credibility of States are challenged  while accusations levelled at them by exiled groups dealing in terror are accepted at face value. Furthermore  official opinions  tinged with subjectivity  are frequently broadcast by those who lack a thorough understanding of things alien to them  about sovereign decisions adopted by other countries in their domestic affairs. This violates the most elementary norms of international coexistence.290.	Curiously enough  many other countries which have appointed themselves prosecutors of the behaviour of others conveniently resort to amnesia when it comes to flagrant violations of human rights that they committed only a few years ago. If we were to start a trial here and assign responsibilities  recent events would supply us with more than enough examples to turn those who accuse us today into the accused.291.	We wish to be very clear in stating our points of view. We believe that the protection of human rights is one of the fundamental achievements of the entire civilized world and not the questionable patrimony of one country or group of countries in particular. Consequently  we declare our most firm support for any measures which by common consent might be approved by the United Nations in order to strengthen those rights and make uninterrupted progress in this field. But with equal firmness  we reject any attempt to take advantage of the exalted feelings aroused by the invocation of those rights when this is done for minor political ends.292.	Having conceived of the protection of human rights as a common endeavour by the community of nations represented here  we must recall the approach taken by General Assembly resolution 32/130. Quite correctly  this resolution maintains that it is necessary to look for global solutions to those problems  taking into account both the over-all context of the various societies in which they present themselves  as well as the need for the promotion of the full dignity of the human person  which is closely linked to the political  economic and social development of each country. To isolate the individual from this reality  to deny the special circumstances of each community or to pretend to see human rights as an abstraction detached from other rights and duties essential to nations would be tantamount to dooming to failure in advance the efforts which must be made to achieve progress in this field.293.	These concepts  to which Argentina adheres  were welcomed and endorsed a few days ago by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Havana from 3 to 9 September 1979. Their reiteration continues to be indispensable every time certain countries stubbornly ignore the universal demand contained in General Assembly resolution 32/130 and fail to co-operate in the creation of the political and economic conditions which would make for a better life for all mankind. The various organs of the United Nations  including the Secretariat  must apply that resolution in its spirit and its letter as soon as possible  if we wish to preserve the credibility and authority of our Organization.294.	Functioning indisputably as the underlying cause in the majority of problems and localized international crises  competition among the centres of Power to maintain  acquire and increase their spheres of influence and hegemony plays a significant role. This situation has direct repercussions on the arms race being perpetrated by the super-Powers  which has reached unheard-of proportions quantitatively as well as qualitatively.295.	Argentina welcomed the signing of the second SALT Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. We nevertheless believe it is necessary to emphasize that its positive side lies mainly in the fact that its implementation could lead to the improvement of the political climate between the two countries and their respective allies. From the point of view of the reduction of nuclear arsenals  the results are unfortunately very poor and fall far short of the logical expectations generated by the lengthy negotiation for the agreement. This short-coming transcends the bounds of bilateral relations since  as we maintained on 26 May 1978  at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament:"" .. .in any generalized nuclear conflict between the two super-Powers there would be no possibility for any nation to proclaim itself neutral  or for innocent peoples to remain passive spectators. They would all  without exception  willingly or not  find themselves involved in the holocaust and suffer its consequences.'296.	At the same time  the increase in recent years of conventional forces deployed in certain critical areas in the world creates permanent security imbalances in a play of balances and counter-balances which give rise to justified anxiety. I refer in particular to Central Europe  the Middle East and the Indian Ocean. Here again  the special responsibility of the United States and the Soviet Union becomes apparent. Detente should therefore also manifest itself in these and other areas of the world through restraint and self-limitation of military expenditures and simultaneously through the development of maximum efforts to solve political problems which may become more complex because of the increase in armaments.297.	While the great Powers continue to accumulate weapons of every description at a speed that exceeds by far any reasonable level of legitimate self-defence  some of the industrialized countries persistently raise secondary issues in order to shift attention from the grave threat posed by vertical proliferation. The need to avoid the emergence of additional nuclear-weapon States is given as a pretext and is emphasized in order to protect the monopoly of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes through discriminatory practices that endanger international co-operation on this subject. The General Assembly clearly stated in its resolution 32/50 the inalienable right of developing countries to develop or to acquire such a technology in conformity with their national priorities  interests and economic and social needs.298.	The tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  later reiterated those ideas and recommended that new efforts be undertaken to achieve an international consensus on non-discriminatory and universal ways of checking the proliferation of nuclear weapons  In the pursuit of these goals  both the nuclear Powers and those countries which need atomic technology to increase their sources of energy and accelerate their progress bear a joint responsibility. Therefore  as an essential quid pro quo for non-proliferation  restrictive and collective practices that give rise to legitimate mistrust and hinder the development of the least developed countries should cease to exist.299.	We consider that a greater democratization of international relations would at least contribute to alleviating some of the problems that we are discussing here. The unity of human destiny and  in the long run  the community of interests of all nations are facts the understanding of which no one can evade. To try to achieve peace and security on a global scale without undertaking the balanced development of all peoples is to pursue a myth that our century cannot afford. To accept an error of such magnitude would be tantamount to believing that injustice can endure and that at present the well-being of the few can stand on solid foundations at the expense of others.300.	Hunger  destitution  disease and the exodus of refugees in different parts of the world undoubtedly have profound humanitarian undertones  but the implications of those situations transcend those areas and  under certain circumstances  provoke political tensions with the attendant deterioration in international relations 301.	Such is the case of the millions of Palestinians who have been displaced from their homes in the Middle East and whose situation is of fundamental importance in the search for any just and lasting solution of the area's serious problems. That is why today my Government once again states its conviction that  until the rights of the Palestinian people are recognized and implemented  the idea of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East will continue to be Utopian and all the peoples in the area would suffer the painful consequences of such a reality 302.	Another serious problem that has a direct bearing on the maintenance of international peace and security is the situation obtaining in southern Africa  where the questions of Namibia and Southern Rhodesia  as well as the persistence of apartheid  combine to form a pattern of conflicts of seriousness too obvious to require reiteration. My country  whose position In this matter is well known and  moreover  is in accord with that of the Organization  is confident that the parties involved will make all the necessary efforts so that those questions may be solved in a peaceful  speedy and just manner through negotiation and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.303.	When referring to the ordeal of the refugees  I cannot fail to mention that Argentina does not content itself with expressing solidarity in mere declarations devoid of any real content  but makes it tangible by means of practical action. The painful predicament sustained under such varied circumstances by hundreds of thousands of refugees from South-East Asia has moved Argentina to open its doors to numerous groups of families  the first of which have already arrived in our country. Surrounded by the hospitable affection of our people in a climate of freedom and order  they will be able to forget all their past suffering and fully enjoy a better life. This is yet another tangible contribution we make to a well-understood protection of human rights.304.	For many decades  Latin America has kept itself apart  physically as well as mentally  from the serious conflicts that have played havoc in other parts of the globe. The States of our region  after having fought for the achievement of their independence and the establishment of their national identity  very early on began a long process towards integration  a process that was favoured by the common historical and cultural legacy of their peoples and decisively led by illustrious statesmen from all parts of the continent who saw unity as the best possible defence in the preservation of a patrimony that was won at such a costly price.305.	Many and arduous efforts were made to establish the inter-American system  which has a place in history as being the first case in which sovereign countries laid the foundations of organized coexistence in order to regulate the harmonious development of their relations and to preserve their freedom and independence. We proudly claim for the Latin American republics the privilege of having been the first ever to proclaim and practise the fundamental principles that lead to international law and justice and that have been incorporated into the United Nations Charter. Suffice it to mention  inter alia  those of the juridical equality of States  respect for their sovereignty and territorial integrity  non-interference in their internal affairs and the pacific settlement of disputes.306.	But Latin America  in spite of its own organization and uniqueness  is part of a world reality and  like other regions  is exposed today to fluctuations in international policy  foreign interference  compromises arrived at outside it and the consequences of a generalized economic crisis that is already showing its menacing traits.307.	We are aware of the growing interdependence of nations and of the unity of the larger destiny of mankind. We are  however  certain that  in order to play an outstanding role in the common enterprise of forging a decent and acceptable future  Latin America can make its best contribution by acting in unison  closing ranks and offering its experiences and achievements while also demanding that its rights and aspirations not be curtailed.308.	Now  more than ever  we have to unite all our forces and conjure the ideals inherited from our forefathers and the profound feelings of brotherly friendship that bind us together  in order to overcome temporary differences and to serve those permanent interests that are common to all of us.309.	At times one loses sight of those permanent interests for merely circumstantial reasons or sacrifices them on the altar of certain political currents  which  after all  serve only interests that are completely alien to our region. But we trust that those values that are unique to the American peoples will inevitably lead to the reality of regional integration that will consolidate our structures and erect the best possible barrier to foreign ambitions of penetration.310.	As regards its relations with neighbouring countries  Argentina wishes to express from this forum its deepest gratitude to His Holiness Pope John Paul II for having accepted the request that  together with the Republic of Chile  it addressed to him pursuant to the Montevideo Agreement of 8 January of this year '' that he act as mediator to guide both countries in the negotiations they maintain with regard to the southern region of the American continent. Our gratitude goes also to the Holy See for the activity displayed at a higher level with advice  suggestions  and ideas in order that a rapprochement might be achieved between the two countries in the search for an equitable and honourable solution of that dispute.311.	The most recent meeting of the non-aligned countries at the highest level of political representation took place only weeks ago  and for the first time on our continent.312.	Fully aware of the responsibility implied by full membership in the non-aligned movement  we went to Havana to explain Argentina's position on the main items of the heavy agenda and  in particular  with a view to contributing frankly to the examination of the movement's structure and of the role it should play in world affairs.313.	We took the opportunity to reaffirm our conviction that the non-aligned movement should continue substantially to use its influence in world affairs  which requires that it remain faithful to the basic concepts which led to its creation. This implies  in essence  a reaffirmation of its total independence and flat rejection of the strategy of those Powers or blocs which try to impose their systems or ideologies on others.314.	The movement is made up of nations which have diverse political  economic and social regimes  but which are of one mind in their decision to preserve their national identities and retain their freedom of action in the face of any overt or covert attempt at domination or influence by the most powerful. This unity of purpose in diversity and plurality is its raison d'etre and the source Of its power and authority to guide the never-ending search for the solution to the serious problems faced by mankind.315.	If for any reason the movement should abandonâeven momentarilyâits non-aligned stance and identify itself with the interests or objectives of any Power  its very existence would lose all meaning.316.	We believe that the exchange of views which took place at the Sixth Conference had positive results. We hope that the principles which inspire and nurture the common endeavours of the non-aligned countries will be strengthened  as that would have favourable repercussions as a factor for rapprochement  cooperation and peace in the United Nations.317.	The Republic of Argentina  like other Latin American countries  has suffered and resisted  throughout its history as an independent country  all sorts of attempts to encroach on its territorial integrity  to determine its domestic policies and to modify its behaviour in the field of international relations. We have faced embargoes  blockades  subversion  campaigns to discredit us  and the occupation of our national territory.318.	Even today  we continue to be the victim of the illegal occupation of an inseparable part of our territory  the Malvinas Islands  which in 1833 were usurped by force  thus giving rise to the dispute on sovereignty which since that time we have continued with the United Kingdom.319.	The United Nations has discussed this problem on many occasions. As is known  the question of the Malvinas Islands has appeared on the agenda of the General Assembly and of the Special Committee on decolonization for many years and both organs have adopted important decisions on the question. The most recent of these calls on the parties to the disputeâthe Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdomâto pursue negotiations without delay in order to put to an end the colonial situation prevailing in the Islands.320.	On the basis of that resolution  the two Governments have already held four rounds of negotiations  the results of which have been promptly communicated to this Organization.321.	My Government  which has repeatedly expressed its conviction that direct negotiation between the parties constitutes the best way to settle disputes  reiterates its firm determination to persevere in the search for a prompt and just solution to this problem. But Argentina's decision cannot be unilateral. It has to be matched by a similar spirit on the part of the British authorities  so that with a view to the future we might jointly eliminate the only obstacle still standing in the way of our traditional links of friendship and resume our common effort for broad co-operation in every field. This reference to the question of the Malvinas Islands would be incomplete if we did not express here our gratitude to the non-aligned movement  which has consistently and firmly supported my country in its legitimate claims. The recent Conference in Havana adopted the following declaration on the issue:' 'In the special and particular case of the Malvinas Islands  the Heads of State or Government firmly reiterated their support for the Argentine Republic's right to the restitution of that territory and sovereignty over it and requested that the negotiations in this regard be speeded up.""322.	With respect to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  I should like to state that we are concerned by the intention of some industrialized States to enact unilateral legislation on the mining of the sea bed. Such action would seriously hamper the conclusion of the Conference and would jeopardize the very future of the convention  at a time when the General Committee of the Conference has already decided to adopt it at the next session.323.	Moreover  and as we have done repeatedly in the past  we wish to reaffirm our full rights in the maritime areas subject to our national sovereignty  and our firm determination to ensure respect for them in all their implications  including that concerning the innocent passage of warships.324.	In conclusion I should like to state that the disturbing situation I have tried to describeâand by no means exhaustivelyâadversely affects the search for solutions to the global problems which should spur the imagination and the joint efforts of all the Members of this Organization.325.	Many are the questions requiring urgent attention which could be solved if we decided to use to the full measure of its potential the invaluable instrument of co-operation that is the United Nations.326.	This General Assembly  in particular  should continue to seek to reflect the problems of the world and at the same time act as a catalyst for the changes that our times require. For this to happen  it is essential that the Member States agree on an order of priorities and concentrate on those items which  because of their importance and urgency  can be entrusted to no other forum. This role  assigned to the Organization by its Charter  of being a centre for the harmonization of the efforts of the international community  calls for a process of selection  for our resources and our time are limited. Questions which  because of their nature  could be entrusted to other organizations  should yield to those which  because of their impact on peace  security and development  require the political will of all the nations represented here.327.	If we do not urgently undertake the procedural and substantive rationalization of the General Assembly  we run the risk of distorting its true function. We would become entangled in the enormous bureaucratic machinery that is already apparent today  and we would see a blurring of the dividing line between the principal and the secondary  between the vital and that which is a mere academic exercise or an item of lesser political or economic significance.328.	The principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter form a cohesive whole which has been developed and supplemented by numerous declarations and resolutions of the General Assembly  the most representative political body in the international community. On many occasions consensus has proved to be an effective means for decision-making  since it commits all Member States to make their positions compatible with a common objective. On other occasions the principles involved were not  by their very nature  susceptible of compromise. But in every case  the taking of decisions should be preceded by a process of negotiation  accommodation and flexibility  marked by the mutual respect which would be a guarantee  not only of the effectiveness of the results  but of full knowledge and understanding of the viewpoints of those who do not share the same ideas 329.	This negotiating process demands time and goodwill. In order for time to be available and for the necessary goodwill to materialize  we feel that the General Assembly should concentrate its work on a limited number of priority questions and should entrust the rest to other agencies of the system. Only in this way shall we be able to transform the Organization into an efficient tool and silence those who argue that the really important problems are not brought to this forum because it lacks the means of achieving adequate results with a guarantee of implementation.330.	These are some ideas which we wish to submit to the consideration of our fellow representatives in this Organization. As always  we are inspired by the desire to contribute to the effective unity of the nations here assembled  with a sense of active militancy for the high ideals that led us to San Francisco 34 years ago."
"5",315,"AUS",34,1979,"ï»¿It gives me particular pleasure to address the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  meeting as it is under the presidency of Ambassador Salim. The Australian Government and successive Australian representatives to the United Nations have known his capacity  his energy and the vitality of his ideas  assets which we are confident he will be able to employ in the coming year for the benefit of the Organization as a whole. Australia's membership in the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  in particular  has provided us with the privilege of co-operating closely with him in the important work of the United Nations in the field of decolonization. Through this work Australia and the United Republic of Tanzania continue to demonstrate a mutual concern to extend basic human rights to all peoples. My delegation offers him its full co-operation in discharging his many responsibilities as President of the General Assembly.199.	It is always a pleasure to welcome new Members to this- Organization and  on behalf of the Australian Government  I was happy to become a sponsor of the admission of Saint Lucia  a fellow Commonwealth country.200.	The end of a decade is an occasion for reflection and for the drawing up of balance-sheets. In many respects the 1970s marked a turning-point in international affairs. It was a decade in which many of the assumptions of the past were found to be inadequate. The international agenda has been drastically altered and new issues have come to the fore.201.	Energy problems emerged as one of our most serious concerns. Demands for the establishment of a more efficient and more equitable international economic order have been among the more compelling pressures for change. International concern to limit the catastrophic potential of the arms race has continued unabated. Particular emphasis has been given to human rights and the issues of social justice.202.	These issues will also dominate the agenda of the 1980s. However  whereas in the 1970s we began to grasp and to adjust to the changing realities involved  in the 1980s we will face the daunting task of finding solutions.203.	As we move into the 1980s it would be reckless to ignore the difficulties which now cloud prospects for global economic growth. It would be reckless and inhumane to overlook the fact that some 800 million people in the developing world still live in absolute poverty.204.	The challenge we now face is that after some 25 years of unprecedented growthâa process in which many developing countries sharedâthe economies of most countries are now faltering. Steady rates of growth have been broken and governments are hard- pressed to restore them to the previous levels. Growth in trade  which had been running at 8 per cent in the 1950s and the 1960s has fallen by half. Inflation  unemployment and protectionist measures have emerged as major problems for the developed market-economy countries. This has had serious consequences for the developing countries. Australia has shared these problems  understands their impact on developing countries and is committed to their resolution.205.	The international community must face these problems squarely. We must not shrink from the responsibilities we all share. Next year's special session of the General Assembly will provide a major opportunity to come to grips with the constraints on growth to which I have referred  and that opportunity must be grasped.206.	We expect the special session to undertake a thoroughgoing assessment of the lessons of the 1970s and to initiate a bold and imaginative response to the challenges of the 1980s. That response must entail a renewed interest in a more efficient and more equitable international economic order.207.	The international development strategy for the third development decade will be a particularly important matter for the special session. We owe it to our own people to ensure that the special session produces a practical and action-oriented strategy. Ways of giving impetus to the real factors of growth must be found. The strategy must identify national efforts and commitments and clearly establish objectives in relation to economic and social development. Above all  it must present realistic ways in which all countries can work for the achievement of these objectives.208.	Australia  for its part  has been taking stock of how these relationships  and in particular the North- South dialogue  can be made more productive. This has been the basic concern behind our practical approaches at the fifth session of UNCTAD and our initiative at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries meeting in Lusaka to have a study made of constraints on growth. The stalemate in the present dialogue must be broken.209.	Australia has considered carefully the proposals put forward to launch global negotiations in the United Nations  open to all Members  in certain important areas which are central to the North-South dialogue. We are prepared to accept in principle the proposals for global negotiations. This is on the understanding that the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 will be able to draw up a programme for negotiations setting out  in an acceptable form  the priorities and the modalities for the negotiations and their relationship with ongoing negotiations on these issues in other forums. We would want to be sure that the projected global interrelated negotiations should be carefully approached so as to ensure  as far as possible  practical progress on the complex issues involved. Such progress will inevitably come by stages and not necessarily in an interlocked  interwoven fashion. We must seek to move forward wherever we can  and some areas will of course be more susceptible to forward movement than others. We are naturally concerned  in particular  that the opening of any global negotiations on a wide range of interrelated issues should not hold up ongoing negotiation on them in other more specialized forumsâfor example  in UNCTAD on the Common Fund and on international commodity agreements.210.	In addressing the constraints on growth  my Government has put special emphasis on the current high levels of inflation  with its damaging effects on development  on employment  on exchange rates and on trade flows. Unless controlled  inflation brings in its wake economic disruption and social disintegration. Its worst effects weigh most heavily on the poorest members of our communities.211.	The failure of many developed countries to control domestic inflation has unquestionably had a severely adverse impact on developing countries  which look to the developed world as the market for 70 per cent of their exports and as the major source of capital and development assistance. Sound anti-inflationary policiesâa necessity if we are to achieve sustained economic growthâmust be adopted by all countries.212.	There is  I believe  a fundamental link between inflation  protectionism and the relative lack of progress in structural adjustment in many of our economies. Higher inflation rates have led to defensive protectionist policies. Such policies bring with them distortions through misallocation and inefficient use of labour and capital. They frequently involve wage and export subsidies and supports  instead of positive adjustment measures. They lead to efforts in both the manufacturing and agricultural sectors to maintain inefficient and unproductive operations and obsolescent industries.213.	The task of dismantling protectionist measures is quite formidable; adjustment cannot be instantaneous. But we should not be deflected by narrow sectional interests. We must recognize that adjustment measures also open up new opportunities.214.	In Australia's view the developing countries must be given greater access to world markets for their exports. Only last week my Government announced a new series of initiatives aimed at improving the developing countries' share of Australian trade. These measures include the further expansion of the Australian system of tariff preferences.215.	A significant number of developing countriesâ several of them in Australia's regionâhave now emerged as important exporters of manufactures and services. The increasing diversification of those countries' economies and their movements away from import-substitution strategies have laid a basis for large-scale expansion of output and increasing trade specialization. While this development presents a major competitive challenge to the industries of many developed countries  there are also substantial opportunities mixed in with it. We should all be seeking to associate ourselves with their growth and together aim to share the benefits of the expanding trade flows that they are generating.216.	An open world trading system needs the dynamic of increased trade flows based on comparative advantageâflows which have been most noticeably stimulated in recent years by the newly industrializing countries. If the international trading system is to realize its full potential and bring benefits to the international community as a whole  we must prevent the erection of further obstacles to trade. At the same time  we must make progress in dismantling existing protectionist barriers.217.	Australia will continue to press these items in the relevant international forums. We see these issues as essential elements in the establishment of a better and more just international economic order. For this reason Australia will be asking the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board to consider a draft resolutionâ similar to the one that we introduced at the fifth session of UNCTADâon the related issues of inflation  protectionism and structural adjustment.218.	Energy issues are now also recognized as crucial to economic growth. Significantly increased prices of certain energy resources and doubts about their supply have hindered economic development and have set back efforts for economic recovery. This is a matter of particular concern to all energy-deficient countries  particularly the non-oil-producing developing countries.219.	Recent events have re-emphasized the urgent need to implement policies aimed both at conserving oil and at adapting economies to the necessity for using alternative energy resources. This transition is bound to be protracted and  in many countries  quite painful. But the need to embark upon it is imperative.220.	I am convinced that we will fail in the task that confronts us if energy producers and consumers adopt confrontational attitudes. Interdependence is a basic and intractable feature of the global energy scene. Indeed  if the so-called energy crisis taught us any thing at all it is that we must establish a realistic basis upon which a consensus can be built.221.	No country can ignore the world-wide consequences of what is happening. There is now  as ministers of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have recently warned  a real danger that  without responsible policies by oil consumers and producers alike  the energy situation will seriously damage the world economy.222.	Australia is prepared to bring a constructive and realistic attitude to the issues involved. We see ourselves as having particular responsibilities. Australia is well placed as regards indigenous energy resources  and we are a net energy exporter. We have abundant coal and natural gas reserves  and our vast uranium deposits are now being mined. While developing these resources  we have also increased support for energy research and development and have promoted energy conservation and inter-fuel substitution. We have been active in furthering international cooperation in a variety of bilateral  regional and international arrangements.223.	Australia has given particular attention to the needs of the developing countries of our region. We are working actively in ESCAP and in the Commonwealth Regional Consultative Group on Energy. We are also co-operating closely with other countries of the region on a bilateral basis. Emphasis has been placed on the possibility of establishing energy systems suited to the particular needs of these countries. This entails developing available conventional resources and appropriate alternative technologies.224.	My earlier reference to uranium was in the context of its use as a valued energy resource. But Australia is deeply conscious that there are alternative and awesome uses to which it can be put. With substantial resources of uranium  Australia undoubtedly has a special responsibility to ensure that it is used for the betterment of mankind and not for its annihilation 225.	The continuing imperatives of maintaining peace and security must remain uppermost among the challenges facing the world community in the next decade. The creation of conditions which will strengthen international security and give the world the confidence that it can live in peace is vitally important.226.	The continuing process of strategic arms limitation between the United States and the Soviet Union is absolutely fundamental to the maintenance of the global balance and the prevention of nuclear war. The signing of the second SALT treaty was the most important step forward in arms control during the last year. We still look forward to its early ratification and implementation. We expect it to provide a basis for further quantitative and qualitative controls on the nuclear arsenals of the super-Powers in a future agreement to be reached at the third round of SALT.227.	Australia also attaches great importance to the earliest possible conclusion of negotiations among the United States  the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom on the terms of a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. The submission of the text of a treaty to the Committee on Disarmament before the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1980 would advance consideration of the issues and make a significant contribution to the success of that Conference  and we urge the three negotiating Powers to work towards this end.228.	A test-ban treaty will inhibit the further development of existing nuclear arsenals. It will be an additional pillar of the international non-proliferation regime by providing a new avenue through which countries can renounce nuclear weapons. It will also give further reassurance that nuclear programmes in non-nuclear-weapon States were directed exclusively to peaceful purposes.229.	The second Review Conference will provide a timely opportunity to lend weight to the objectives of the Treaty  to review its operation and to take account of the concerns of new parties. Australia  as a firm adherent to the principles of non-proliferation  will continue to play an active role in the preparations for the Conference.230.	Australia is encouraged by the fact that the Treaty continues to display its relevance and its value by attracting new States parties. The accession of Indonesia and Bangladesh was a welcome development. Increasing membership contributes to the benefits which the Treaty provides for regional and international security and  of course  for stable international trade and co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.231.	The global non-proliferation scene and international nuclear co-operation could  however  be seriously damaged by the emergence of a situation in the Indian subcontinent  which shattered the fragile constraints against proliferation in that region. Australia regards this with very great concern. The risks of proliferation in southern Africa and the Middle East are also most disturbing. We hope that countries which have not acceded to the non-proliferation Treaty will reassure the international community by affirming their acceptance either of full-scope safeguards on their nuclear industries or of some other binding and verifiable commitment.232.	Non-proliferation objectives have also been enhanced by the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation  which concludes early next year. There has been significant agreement on a range of problems previously the subject of controversy. Useful ideas have emerged which could lead to important new institutional barriers to proliferation  including  for example  schemes for international plutonium storage and international spent-fuel management. We also believe that the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation study  which examined supply assurances  has put forward some useful ideas on possible common approaches to non- proliferation conditions to apply in nuclear trade.233.	The Committee on Disarmament in Geneva  during its first year of operation  has devoted considerable effort to elaborating possible new arms control instruments. Australia  as a member of the body since the beginning of this year  has welcomed the opportunities that membership has conferred to bring new perspectives to the work of the Committee. We look forward to helping the Committee produce concrete results as it pursues its work. In particular  we hope that 1980 will see agreement obtained on measures of nuclear arms control and on radiological and chemical weapons.234.	We further hope that  once work has been completed in the Committee on a comprehensive test-ban treaty  the nuclear-weapon Powers will give serious consideration to proposals for a cut-off in the production of fissionable materials for nuclear weapons. This would be a major step to ending the nuclear-arms race and reinforcing non-proliferation  and would represent further real progress in the search for conditions in which mankind can be freed from the threat of devastation and destruction.235.	In considering the conditions for maintaining international peace and security  we must pay particular attention to the areas of conflict and tension. Through its peace-keeping machinery the United Nations has played an important role in containing otherwise dangerously volatile situations. Peace-keeping machinery not only protects future generations from the horrors of war  it protects people now from the threat of conflict caused by rivalries and fears from the past.236.	Australia has maintained a firm tradition of sup-port for the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. We see our contributions to peace-keeping  in Cyprus  the Middle East and Kashmir  as direct contributions to the cause of peace. Our offer to contribute to the proposed United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia has been made with quite the same conviction. But peace-keeping forces do not of themselves generate lasting peace. Parties to conflicts must be persuaded to negotiate  as they are now doing in London in relation to Zimbabwe  as certain of them are doing in the Middle East  and as they must continue to do in Cyprus.237.	I now want to consider some of these issues in more detail. We are all familiar with the long history of the Middle East conflict and with the disappointments which have characterized it. Australia has supported the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.  We see it as a first step towards a just  lasting and comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East. We understand the fears and concerns of others and appreciate that a solution of that region's problems depends on factors not yet settled or dealt with in the current negotiations. In this context  Australia regrets the current policies of the Israeli Government in relation to the establishment of settlements in the occupied territories.238.	It is essential to devise a peace which satisfies all interested partiesâand which puts an end to terrorism. We therefore base our policies on the need for negotiations starting from the principles of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries must be accepted. The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to a homeland alongside Israel  and their corresponding responsibility to live peacefully with all their neighbours also must be recognized.239.	In this spirit the Australian Government continues to offer its support to any efforts to reach a settlement acceptable to all parties concerned. We hope that all will turn away from statements  actions and policies which are prejudicial to the search for a comprehensive peace.240.	In thinking about the Middle East we should not ignore the sufferings of the people in the ravaged and divided land of Lebanon. The Australian community has been enriched by the arrival of large numbers of immigrants and refugees from Lebanon and other parts of the region and we share their heartfelt concern that no effort should be spared to bring peace to the region.241.	The plight of the people of Cyprus is also a matter of the greatest concern to the Australian community. We whole-heartedly support the continuing role of the United Nations and of the Secretary-General in particular in efforts to bring peace to all the people of Cyprus. Australia welcomed the resumption of intercommunal talks in June 1979  following the agreement between President Kyprianou and Mr. Denktag  itself based on the Makarios-Denktas guidelines 16 but we greatly regret that those talks have not progressed. We hope that debate on the Cyprus issue at this General Assembly will provide the impetus for further progress.242.	Australia is deeply concerned at the continuing tragic loss of life as a result of the conflict in Zimbabwe. There have been too many wasted years and wasted opportunities. The agreement reached at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka in August provides a new opportunity which must not be lost. Australia fully supports that agreement which we hope will carry the parties to settlement.243.	The presence of the principal parties to the dispute at the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference recently convened by the United Kingdom Government is encouraging. We urge the parties to carry their negotiations to fulfilment and to bring an end to the present tragic situation which has brought the whole of southern Africa to the brink of ruin and war.244.	As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Australia has actively sought a peaceful and lasting solution to the question of Namibia. The Australian Government gives its full support to the consultations being carried on between the representatives of the five Western countries and the South African Government and strongly hopes that those consultations will resolve the current impasse. It is crucial for stability in southern Africa that agreement be reached on the Secretary-General's proposals. 245.	There remains  of course  the problem of the policies of the South African Government. Australia will continue to work for the end of the deplorable policy of apartheid. The point is approaching when patience will run out within South Africa itself and when increasing resort to violence will be seen by many as their only option. Let us hope that that point will not be reached. Let us hope that reason and responsibility will prevail.246.	Australia is deeply concerned by the problem of refugees throughout the worldâin Africa  the Middle East and South-East Asia. We give full support to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in his efforts to alleviate the distress and to promote the resettlement of the dispossessed peoples. My own country has a proud and continuing tradition in settling refugees from many continents and countries.247.	In South-East Asia  the plight of the ""boat people"" from Viet Nam and the land refugees from Kampuchea has assumed tragic proportions. Innocent men  women and children have been displaced and rendered homeless on a massive scale. They have been forced to flee from war  famine  disease and the abhorrent pressure of political coercion. A major humanitarian crisis exists. This has precipitated serious political and economic problems and tensions in the region. The exodus has been of such proportions as to jeopardize regional stability.248.	The financial  political and social burdens involved have fallen particularly heavily on the countries of first asylum that is the States of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The international community must recognize the very real limits on the ability of those countries to cope with a crisis of such massive proportions. Important new steps towards meeting that crisis were taken at the meeting convened by the Secretary-General in Geneva in July.  We in Australia have from the beginning taken in a substantial number of refugees and we are also providing substantial financial assistance.249.	At the same time  Australia believes it is vitally important to recognize that the underlying causes of the refugee exodus have yet to be tackled. We have noted that since the Geneva meeting there has been a diminution in the numbers of those leaving Viet Nam. We look to the Government of Viet Nam to abide by the undertakings it gave at Geneva and to make sustained and serious efforts to resolve this problem in all its aspects.250.	The tragedy of widespread starvation and disease in war-ravaged Kampuchea also demands our immediate attention. Whatever one's political persuasion  whatever one's views on the causes of the present havoc in Kampuchea  one cannot ignore the desperate plight of several million of the Kampuchean people. It is vital that massive international relief should reach the Khmer people immediately. They must be saved. It is essential that the practical problems of organizing necessary relief measures be overcome quickly. In the name of humanity  it is imperative that all parties fully co-operate in this emergency. The international relief agencies and voluntary organizations must be allowed to carry forward this task as a matter of the utmost urgency.251.	Australia for its part is prepared to do all within its power to assist in international relief efforts. We have already agreed to provide  through the World Food Programme  3 500 metric tons of rice for humanitarian relief in Kampuchea. We are also completing arrangements for a special charter flight to carry emergency food and medical supplies to the people of Kampuchea. Australia fully supports the appeal to the international community made by the Secretary- General on 27 September for funds and supplies for Kampuchea.252.	Against this background  my Government is also deeply concerned by the intensified hostilities in Kampuchea. An increase in the scale of the fighting can only add to the already intolerable suffering of the people of Kampuchea  swell the flow of refugees and complicate still farther the difficulties of organizing relief operations. Wider conflict within Kampuchea also carries risks of escalation and so endangers the security of the South-East Asian region as a whole. We must do immediately whatever we can to alleviate the misery and want of millions of human beings. But we must also recognize that there can be no lasting solution to the problems of Kampuchea until peace is restored  all external forces withdrawn and conditions created in which the Kampuchean people can decide their own future for themselves  free from outside interference of any kind.253.	A recurring theme of many of the conflicts to which I have referred is the disregard for basic human values and rights. It is therefore particularly appropriate that at this time His Holiness Pope John Paul IIâa great humanitarian  a great defender of freedom  of faith and of the human spiritâshould be attending this session of the General Assembly. His presence tomorrow will remind us all of the commitments we have all made in supporting the Charter of the United Nationsâcommitments to the achievement of real improvements in the condition of individual men  women and children.254.	The United Nations has embarked upon a number of action-oriented programmes. The International Year of the Child  the United Nations Decade for Women  the two United Nations Development Decades  the Disarmament Decade and the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  have all aimed to improve the lot of individual men and women.255.	Much has been done to bring comfort and hope to the dispossessed and the deprived peoples of the world. Major instruments in the field of human rights have entered into force and new instruments are now being framed. The validity of the claims of the nations and people suffering economic and social hardship have been increasingly recognized. Energetic attempts have also been made to confront the problems of terrorism and refugees. But  having said that  I recognize that major problems of human rights and social needs remain.256.	Nothing is more pernicious in this regard than racism and racial prejudice. At the recent Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka  Australia joined with every other Commonwealth country in issuing the Lusaka Declaration of the Commonwealth on Racism and Racial Prejudiceâa document which addressed itself to the problem of racism in all its forms  in every country. Racism is one among the many human problems that must be tackled in the 1980s. People will not accept nor should they be expected to accept fear  want and the systematic violation of their rights. The United Nations must organize itself to deal effectively with the pressing problems confronting so many in everyday life.257.	We agree with the Secretary-General on the need to generate renewed public support in all countries for the United Nations and its work to fulfil its objectives on behalf of all mankind.258.	Australia is moving into the 1980s with a strong desire to promote solutions to the many challenges which we face. We do so on the basis of a considered assessment of Australia's place in the new circumstances of today. I have  as recently as 18 September  submitted in the Australian Parliament a report on Australia's relations with the third world. So far as I know  no other developed country has undertaken so detailed an analysis of the question of its relations with the third world  yet it is a question which affects the prospects of peace  prosperity and progress for all mankind.259.	Australia accepts the fact that it has serious responsibilities. We are not prepared to stand idly by at a time when drift and even stalemate hamper progress in key areas of international relations. This drift must be arrested and the stalemate  broken.260.	We have no illusions that the next decade will be any easier than the last. The international community must approach the 1980s with renewed vigour and with a determination to develop practical and realistic solutions to the issues which we face. Above all we should avoid situations in which preconceived or outdated attitudes and ideological rigidities preclude progress. With goodwill  no problem is intractable."
"6",362,"AUT",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is a particular pleasure for me to see you presiding over this General Assembly. I wish to congratulate you most sincerely on your election.164.	You are the representative of a country and of a continent to which Austria feels particularly close. In the course of almost 10 years as Permanent Representative of your country you have combined rich experience and thorough knowledge with a deep devotion to the ideals of our Organization. Your qualities of leadership and diplomatic skills augur well for the work and the successful conclusion of this session of the General Assembly.165.	At the same time  I should like to express my sincere gratitude and that of my country to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the former Foreign Minister of Colombia  for the tact and the extraordinary political understanding with which he presided over the last session of the General Assembly.166.	I also wish to say a special word of welcome to the delegation of Saint Lucia. With the admission of Saint Lucia to the United Nations this Organization has taken a further step towards the universality of its membership and strengthened its role as a forum for global international co-operation.167.	One year ago  when I spoke before this Assembly there was little reason for optimism or satisfaction. The international situation today merits an even less positive assessment. We are living in a world of regional conflicts threatened by an uncontrolled arms race  by economic disruptions  increasing poverty in developing countries and steadily deteriorating environmental conditions. Wherever we look  we face human suffering  misery and lack of freedom.168.	In such a situation we cannot afford to despair or to be cynical. Instead  we must confront the major international problems and try to solve them in a spirit of human solidarity.169.	Efforts to eliminate the imbalances in the inter-national economic system have  thus far  not been very successful. Poor States continue to become poorer and rich States richer. New and renewed endeavours will be required in order to overcome the persisting problems of the world economy  especially those affecting the more disadvantaged countries.170.	We are encouraged by the initiative taken by developing countries to launch a round of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development. We feel that such a global round  which would take place within the United Nations system and with the full participation of all States  could make a significant contribution to the solution of major global economic problems. In order to secure the success of such negotiations special attention will have to be paid to their most careful preparation.171.	The recent United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development impressively demonstrated the fact that  with the necessary political will and determination  the international community is able to respond positively and constructively to the challenges of development. We are confident that the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development will open new avenues of inter-national co-operation. Austria has already taken the necessary steps to contribute its share to the newly created Interim Fund.172.	Any meaningful effort for global economic development will have to include industrialization as one of its basic elements. In agreeing on the new constitution for UNIDO  the international community has recognized the central role of that organization in the promotion and co-ordination of activities in this field.173.	In pursuing our efforts to make progress in the various areas of the North-South dialogue  we should  above all  bear in mind two basic considerations which could help to achieve a decisive break-through in the establishment of a just and new international economic order.174.	On the one hand  l am thinking of the concept of a significantly increased transfer of resources from industrialized to developing countries  a concept which has repeatedly been put forward by the Federal Chancellor of Austria  Mr. Bruno Kreisky. If properly implemented  it would provide developing countries with additional means for the development of their infrastructures.175.	On the other hand  I should like to reiterate our conviction that in a world of limited resources  mounting arms expenditures represent an enormous waste of technical and of human resources. They should finally be brought under control. Reducing arms expenditures would undoubtedly make a substantial contribution to bridging the economic gap between developed and developing countries.176.	The efforts of the international community to take specific  militarily significant and verifiable steps towards arms control and disarmament have  unfortunately  in no way prevented the unobstructed continuance of the arms race. The immense danger created by the arms race for the future existence of mankind has not diminished.177.	On 18 June of this year  the second SALT Treaty was signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in Vienna. This was a very important step in the process of reduction of tensions between East and West. Impetus for that process is indeed urgently needed. The political importance of this treaty cannot be overrated. We are happy that this historic event took place in Vienna.178.	This positive evaluation of the second round of SALT  however  cannot make us forget that the treaty represents only a step on the way towards disarmament. Our satisfaction with the signing of the SALT treaty is combined with the earnest hope that the treaty will soon be ratified; and that it will be followed by further negotiations leading to a meaningful reduction of the threatening arsenals of the nuclear-power States. Furthermore  the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  scheduled for next year  should serve as a timely reminder of the urgency of effective disarmament in the nuclear field.179.	""We also hope that the successful completion of the second round of SALT will stimulate other efforts in the military sphere aimed at the relaxation of tensions.180.	In this context we have in mind in particular the Vienna negotiations on the mutual reduction of forces in Central Europe. After more than six years of negotiation  tangible results are essential for the whole of Europe.181.	We expect  moreover  that the Treaty will have positive effects on the outcome of the second follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to be held next year in Madrid. There are many indications that questions relating to detente in the military field will play an important role at the Madrid meeting. Initiatives such as the plan for a European disarmament conference submitted by France and the proposals made by the Warsaw Pact States in May of this year lend justification to hopes for progress particularly in the context of initiatives for confidence-building measures.182.	Austria attaches great importance to disarmament measures since we are convinced that a continued positive development of detente largely depends on success in the area of disarmament. Austria strongly believes in the policy of detente for which we do not see any meaningful alternative. However  without visible progress in stemming the arms race this policy would lose credibility and would be compromised.183.	In the area of human rights there is already talk of a so-called third generation of human rights. At the same time we must note with dismay that in large areas of the world not even the first generation of human rightsâthat is  those basic rights flowing from the concept of individual freedomâhave been implemented. Each day we hear of trials where the most severe penalties are handed down  without compliance with even the most elementary right of defence. We hear of torture  expulsion and oppression. The death penalty remains a recognized practice in the criminal law systems of many States. In Austria  we firmly reject that type of punishment as being incompatible with human identity and the sanctity of human life. We hope that efforts to eliminate universally this cruel and inhuman punishment will soon prove successful. The initiatives undertaken within the Council of Europe are of particular importance in this area.184.	The situation is equally depressing in the area of implementation of the so-called second generation of human rights  that is  those basic rights which flow from the concept of equality and which are meant to ensure the material requirements for human existence. I need only refer  for example  to the daily reports on the high rate of unemployment in many parts of the world. The situation of unemployed youths who are denied the right to work from the very outset is particularly alarming. We must also not forget the millions of people whose lives are threatened by hunger and who face the future without hope for any improvement in their economic and social conditions.185.	This is particularly true of the millions of refugees living in many parts of the world. All those refugees are victims of human rights violations  both those who seek asylum as the result of racial or religious discrimination or political persecution and those persons who are denied the right to a homeland or who are forced by hunger to leave their country.186.	In Europe there are many thousands of such persons; while in the Middle East 650 000 Palestinians are still living in camps. In Africa several million people are forced to live as refugees in miserable and often hopeless conditions. In the course of this year the exodus of refugees in South-East Asia caused a dramatic situation which called for immediate action. We gratefully acknowledge the efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who  prompted by that compelling situation  convened a Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia in Geneva in July for the purpose of improving the lot of those refugees. That Meeting had a purely humanitarian objective  which it achieved thanks to numerous commitments to provide assistance. However  the political issue underlying the refugee problems remains unsolved. I can only repeat the appeal that I made at Geneva for respect of the basic rights of all persons to ensure that no one is forced to seek asylum abroad any longer.187.	At this point I should like to underline the extraordinary efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in carrying out his ever- increasing tasks for the alleviation of the lot of refugees throughout the world and to convey to him and his staff the gratitude of my Government.188.	Terrorism constitutes a serious threat to human rights  to the existing order of our societies and even to world order itself. We firmly condemn every manifestation of terrorism  whether it be politically motivated or purely criminal. We condemn any act of terrorism by private individuals  organized groups or States. There can be no justification for terrorism whatsoever. We support all efforts by the international community to combat terrorism  in particular the initiatives taken in this regard by the United Nations. We are pleased to note that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages has succeeded in completing a draft text. We hope that that draft will soon meet with general approval.189.	Of the many conflicts in today's world I wish to refer only to three which I consider to be representative of the many existing elsewhere: Cyprus  the Middle East and southern Africa. 190.	Austria  like many other countries  had hoped that substantial progress would be achieved as a result of the decision reached in May of this year to resume the talks between the ethnic communities in Cyprus. So far those hopes have not materialized.191.	The fact that United Nations troops have been present in Cyprus for 15 years now should induce the parties to the conflict to work harder to achieve a lasting solution satisfactory to both communities. The presence of United Nations troops in Cyprus should also serve the purpose of creating the necessary conditions for a negotiated settlement. It is important that no one get the impression that the United Nations presence in Cyprus is sanctioning the status quo.192.	I should like to take this opportunity sincerely to thank the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to mediate between the two parties to the conflict. At the same time I should like to thank all United Nations soldiers in Cyprus  as well as in the Middle East  for their contribution in support of United Nations peacekeeping operations and to express to them our full appreciation.193.	The crisis in the Middle East  owing to its complexity and its relation to political  economic  social  religious and human rights problems  is one of the most explosive and dangerous in the world.194.	We fully recognize the efforts made by Israel and Egypt  supported by the United States of America  which finally led to the conclusion of the Egyptian- Israeli Treaty of Peace of 26 March 1979. Unfortunately we have to note that no further steps which are necessary for a comprehensive  just and lasting peace  based on the principles set forth in Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and on the recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people  have been forthcoming.195.	However  there are also positive elements in recent developments. We are of the impression that the PLO has modified its earlier political objectives and has thus gained a more realistic assessment of the political possibilities in the Middle East. At the same time  the international community shows an increased tendency to realize that there can be no lasting peace without a just settlement of the Palestinian question. Such a settlement can be achieved only through direct negotiations with the Palestinians. The great majority of Palestinians today accept the PLO as their representative. The situation has evolved in such a way that negotiations with the Palestinian people are possible only through the PLO. It is likewise clear that whoever is interested in learning the views of the Palestinians will also have to establish contact with the PLO. As long as the Palestinian question is not resolved and Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  including the general recognition of the secure existence of the State of Israel  not fully implemented  there will be no peace in the Middle East.196.	Since the peace efforts of the past two years have not produced the results we have all hoped for  it will again be the task of the United Nations to strengthen its efforts in this regard. Therefore  it appears to me desirable to invite the Secretary-General to convene a forum for direct negotiations among all involved and interested parties.197.	Events in Lebanon confront us with the tragic result of this unresolved conflict. The many victims of the conflict and the extensive destruction it has caused give us ample proof of the urgency of achieving peace in the Middle East. The world should not and must not sit by passively while this small and long-suffering country continues to be the victim of constant military intervention.198.	The situation in South Africa gives us cause for great concern. There is little indication that the South African Government is moving away from its policy of institutionalized racial discrimination. The oppression of the opponents of apartheid  the banning of organizations and the continuation of the policy of bantustanization can only increase tensions in southern Africa and lead to tragic results. Austria condemns the policy of apartheid and advocates continued United Nations efforts to eliminate this form of institutionalized human rights violations.199.	Last year we had hoped that we would soon be able to welcome Namibia among the Members of the United Nations. Our hopes have again been frustrated. Nevertheless  we remain convinced that the United Nations plan for the establishment of an independent and democratic Namibia is the only feasible and promising way to achieve a peaceful solution of the Namibian problem. We strongly appeal to all parties concerned to be ready to co-operate in order to make it possible for the negotiations to be resumed and successfully concluded. Austria remains ready to participate actively in the implementation of the United Nations plan.200.	The Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held in Lusaka last August  has brought about a new stage in the question of Southern Rhodesia. We welcome the efforts of the front-line States to facilitate solutions to the benefit of the people of Zimbabwe. We also appreciate the new initiative undertaken by the United Kingdom to reach a solution acceptable to all parties.201.	Although the picture of the world situation I have presented is hardly optimistic  I do not wish to join the critics of our Organization. On the contrary  I realize that the international situation would be even worse without the help of the United Nations. A world organization and a world order  as imperfect or ineffective as these may appear at this moment  are becoming increasingly necessary and even indispensable. The creation of a new world order and universal peace and security: this is the challenge of our time.202.	While the methods and means of traditional diplomacy may be sufficient to keep some of the great problems under control  they cannot offer lasting solutions. We must find new ways to resolve conflicts. Such measures are already the subject of intensive study by the scientific community  particularly in the field of peace research.203.	We should try to apply science and its perceptive capacity to the organization of international cooperation and to the cause of improving the political decision-making process. A mere fraction of the human intelligence and ability now being wasted on the development of vast military arsenals could  if used in these positive directions  yield promising results.204.	In any event  greater use must be made of science and scientific knowledge in order successfully to face the ever-growing problems and dangers which plague mankind today and which are often the root of political conflicts. I am referring in particular to problems relating to energy  the exploitation of new technology and the protection of the environment.205.	Among these problems the question of energy appears to us of particular significance  since it is at the very centre of many issues of future economic and social development. The growth prospects of the world economy will to a large extent depend on the way in which we are able to deal with this problem. We feel that especially in the field of energy there is an urgent need for a strengthened international framework for action. We believe that the United Nations would be a most suitable forum for dealing with the energy problem on an overall global basis. In this context the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy to be held in 1981 in our view assumes special significance and importance.206.	Bearing this in mind  the Austrian Federal Government has decided to invite the United Nations to convene that Conference in Vienna. We believe that the Austrian capital  as the seat of a number of important international and United Nations organizations and agencies in the field of energy  industry and technology  would offer a most appropriate setting for the conference.207.	In accordance with its traditional policy of neutrality  Austria wishes to live in peace and freedom with all nations of the world. While differences in the degree and intensity of our relations still exist  we have succeeded in establishing good and friendly relations with all countries. This applies in particular  and irrespective of their social and political system  to our neighbours and to the permanent members of the Security Council. The Austrian Government will continue to make every effort to pursue a consistent policy of detente by not only maintaining but also further developing good relations in all areas.208.	In this context  I would like to refer to the non- German-speaking ethnic groups living in Austria. We consider them as an enrichment of our cultural life. These groups serve at the same time as a bridge to neighbouring States. It is therefore our declared will and policy to guarantee the existence of these ethnic groups and to protect their language and culture.209.	It has been almost 10 years now since Austria and Italy agreed  in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661(XVI)  on a proposal for the solution of the question of South Tyrol. This solution has been approved in a democratic way by the competent political bodies of Austria  Italy and South Tyrol. The consensus on a new arrangement for the autonomy of South Tyrol  together with the ongoing implementation of the planned measures contained in the so-called South Tyrol package  have created new possibilities for better neighbourly co-operation between Austria and Italy.210.	Despite the progress made over the last few years  I must however note that a number of issues  including some of vital importance  have not yet been successfully resolved. Nevertheless  we may continue to hope that our efforts willâin the well-perceived interests of all partiesâsucceed in achieving solutions to the remaining problems in the near future.211.	In concluding my statement I should like to reaffirm Austria's strong support for the United Nations. On 23 August this year Austria handed over the Vienna International Centre to the United Nations. This will serve as the permanent headquarters for a number of important organizations and agencies of the United Nations system. This should be seen as a symbol of Austria's continued commitment to the United Nations "
"7",433,"BDI",34,1979,"ï»¿A birth in a family is naturally a source of joy and of hope. Thus the people of Burundi share the legitimate pride of the people of Saint Lucia on their accession to independence and admission to the great family of the United Nations. The entry of Saint Lucia into the United Nations is striking proof of the universality of our Organization. The victory of the people of Saint Lucia is undoubtedly an encouragement to other peoples struggling for their dignity and freedom.3.	In quite different context  let me pay a tribute to the memory of a great African statesman  Agostinho Neto  champion of the freedom and the real independence of Angola and indefatigable defender of peace and dignity in Africa and throughout the world. We wish to convey to the Angolan people our deepest condolences and our feelings of solidarity and encouragement at this difficult time.4.	Ever since its foundation  the United Nations has set itself the fundamental task of safeguarding international peace and security  the establishment of justice in the world and the strengthening of the ties of cooperation and solidarity among all the peoples of our planet. The triumph of these ideals calls  first of all  for the establishment of an equitable and democratic system in international relations and the promotion of an order of mutual understanding and respect for human rights and for peoples in their totality.5.	It is within this context that we should view the struggle being waged by the United Nations to put an end to injustice in the world and to create conditions for a just and lasting peace so necessary for fruitful cooperation among nations.6.	The work that has been done in this area by the United Nations is  in our view  of particular importance. We should therefore like to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the General Assembly  which can take pride in having so consistently lived up to the importance of its task and  therefore  constitutes an ideal framework for co-operation  exchange of experience and decision-making.7.	The positive record of the General Assembly is due not only to the political maturity and sense of responsibility of the Member States  but also to the farsightedness and devotion of the distinguished persons who have so competently discharged the functions of President of this principal organ of our Organization.8.	In electing you  Sir  as its President  the General Assembly not only acted in keeping with its principles and noble traditions. It also wished by design to mark the importance and gravity that it attaches to this session. Your extensive experience in international affairs and your commitment to supporting peoples in the struggle for their independence and dignity are guarantees of the success of this session. We take this solemn occasion to extend to you our sincere congratulations on the trust that the General Assembly has placed in you. Of course  the tribute we pay to you  on behalf of the people and Government of Burundi  goes also to your country  the United Republic of Tanzania  whose ties of solidarity with my country  Burundi  were forged long ago and have been strengthened at the time of our national liberation struggle.9.	We also wish to extend our sincere gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Lie'vano of Colombia  for having so masterfully and successfully conducted the proceedings of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.10.	We should also like to extend our greetings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose competence  integrity and devotion in the service of peace and the liberation of peoples have aroused in our breasts sentiments of the most profound admiration and highest esteem.11.	The work he has been doing ever since he has been Secretary-General of our Organization deserves more than our congratulations and encouragement. We should like to take advantage of our presence here to assure him once again of our confidence and of the total support of the Government and people of Burundi in his noble task of working unremittingly for the triumph of the fundamental objectives of the United Nations Charter.12 For the first time in the history of our country  the Head of State of Burundi is personally taking part in the work of the General Assembly of the United Nations. This decision was no accident but a logical consequence of the revolution carried out by the people of Burundi on 1 November 1976. That date marks a major turning-point in the history of our country. To understand this  it is sufficient to refer to the period immediately preceding and that immediately following the radical change that took place on that date. To put you in the proper chronological context  let me briefly describe the true history of our country.13.	A mere 17 years have elapsed since our independence  which was gained by dint of tremendous sacrifices by our people and the valuable support rendered by friendly countries and by the United Nations.14.	At first sight  Burundi is a young State. However  the truth is quite different. Indeed  the most critical history books  as well as other most authoritative sources of information  are unanimous in asserting that the State of Burundi  cohesive and organized in all sectors of national life  goes back as far as the fifteenth century A.D. The nation of Burundi  even at that time  could take pride in its age-old unity  the decisive elements of which remain today. These are  primarily  the will to live together as a people proud and jealous of their national independence and sovereignty  and  secondly  a common national culture and a single national language  Kirundi  which is spoken throughout the whole country without a single dialect.15.	All these factors have served to shape the personality of Burundi. This was the driving force of the Burundi nation  which  under the aegis of the party Union pour le progres national [UPRONA]  was successful in the elections organized by the Belgian administration and supervised by the United Nations on 18 September 1961. This victory was to lead Burundi  as we know  to true independence on I July 1962. Thus  the unity of the Burundi people was once again consecrated. This marked the turning of a page after a period of darkness and humiliation  and there opened up a new era of liberty and co-operation.16.	Unfortunately  successive Governments in power did not respect the people's verdict. Irresponsible citizens allied themselves with external enemies of our country to divide and exploit the united  peaceful and hardworking people 17.	It was therefore necessary to establish State structures in such a way as to make possible and irreversible the creation of a society where national concord and social justice would prevail. For this purpose  power had to be handed over to its true holders  the people. In order to achieve this goal  it was necessary to create conditions which made it possible for the Burundi people to embark on a course of national reconstruction. It is within this context that we adopted  from the very outset  a programme of national rehabilitation  the main element of which was national reconciliation. This major concern of our policy underlay all our decisions. All appointments to posts of responsibility and authority were thus inspired solely by the criteria of competence and patriotism.18.	The importance of this policy of national reconciliation did not relegate to a second place the other strategic sectors of national life. Thus  the programme of national rehabilitation set as its other immediate objectives the fight against hunger and poverty  ignorance and disease on the one hand and  on the other  the struggle against social injustice and man's exploitation of man.19.	This policy was reflected in the following measures. In the field of agriculture  it was decided first to increase production of consumer goods in general  and of food-stuffs in particular. Secondly  it was decided to diversify exports. As far as the rural world was concerned  the Government embarked upon a policy of improving and modernizing living conditions  the electrification of important centres in the country  and supplying water to villages and development centres. In the field of education  the Government adopted important measures with a view to enabling all Burundi citizens without discrimination to go to school and university in the same conditions. This policy of the democratization of education was reflected particularly by the State's assumption of responsibility for all teachers and professors  by the building of school and university infrastructures  by the provision of teaching materials and scientific equipment  and by the granting of scholarships to all students. The sole condition laid down for this was that they be successful in competitions and examinations.20.	With regard to health  the Government decided on the development and improvement of infrastructure in this area  while promoting the training and improvement of cadres.21.	These health measures would have been futile if social justice in all its dimensions had not been established. That is why the people's revolution of 1 November 1976 called for the elimination of the vestiges of feudalism. It was in this context that we decided on agrarian and fiscal reform and also on the installation of a sound system of justice  which would be accessible to the people  by the creation of new courts.22.	All these measures were taken in response to the wishes expressed clearly by the people in the course of many consultations which we held from the very first hours of the revolution on 1 November 1976. It is the constant dialogue going on between the people and ourselves which has made it possible for us today to endow with real content the well-known saying ""government of the people  by the people and for the people.""23.	The reorganization of the UPRONA party  the crucible of national unity  and repository of the independence of our country  has no other goal but that of transferring power to the people through its organizations.24.	Out of respect for the profound aspirations of the Burundi people  we did everything in our power to ensure that this mass party  membership of which is entirely free  should be in a position to conceive  guide and monitor all political  economic  social and cultural activities in our country.25.	In order to permit the Burundi people effectively to exercise its prerogatives of sovereignty  we created the necessary conditions for the party to be able to guide and genuinely to control the executive. In other words  the people run and manage their own affairs in the communes and the provinces. Leaders are only kept in their posts to the extent that they enjoy the confidence of the people.26.	Thanks to the political maturity of our people  we believe that the time has come to permit it to choose its leaders at all levels. This task is incumbent on the National Congress of the UPRONA party  a meeting of which is scheduled for the end of this year  and this will constitute in practice the consummation of the action already laid down at the level of the communal assemblies and provincial congresses of the renovated UPRONA party.27.	In the light of the foregoing  we can claim that the State which we are organizing is one which will permit the Burundi people to perpetuate their history  to strengthen their age-old unity  to consolidate the victories they have won  to build their democracy and to determine their future in a free and sovereign manner. It is for the people of Burundi  in fact  to pronounce on the type of society which will safeguard their identity  while guaranteeing their progress in a world Ml of change.28.	This is the role of the National Congress of the party  and this is why we quite rightly consider that this session of the party will constitute an event of primary importance in the national life of the Burundi people. We were therefore anxious to inform the United Nations and the whole international community of this  especially because we in Burundi consider that there must exist a certain harmony between internal options and a country's foreign policy.29.	The guiding principles of our country's foreign policy are well known. These are good neighbourliness  positive non-alignment  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  international co-operation and support for national liberation movements.30.	In the light of those principles which are  for us  inviolable  we propose first of all to deal with subjects relating to the question of decolonization  problems of security in the world  the advent of a new world order and the question of human rights.31.	The emergence of new independent nations is an event of the first importance in international relations in this last quarter of the twentieth century. This phenomenon is explained by the struggle of peoples subjected to colonial domination and by international solidarity. In the course of this irreversible process of liberation  the United Nations has played an important role. However  in spite of the impressive volume of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council the work of decolonization is not yet done.32.	We believe that the time has come to tackle the true obstacles to decolonization.33.	In so far as concerns Africa  we have come to the conclusion that it is strategic and material interests which put a brake on the liberation of South Africa  Namibia  Zimbabwe and Western Sahara 34.	In our day Africa has  unfortunately  become the proving-ground for rivalry between the great Powers. This renewed interest in Africa can be explained  first and foremost  by the geographical situation of our continent  which is washed by both the Atlantic and Indian oceans and the Mediterranean Sea; secondly  by the disruption of political-military alliances in southern Africa following the liberation of Mozambique and Angola; and  thirdly  by the fact that Africa constitutes a vast reservoir of primary commodities and possesses very sizeable resources still unexploited owing to a lack of skilled people and adequate financial resources.35.	Those three elements underlie certain policies of power and domination  such as those implied by the establishment of military bases and the presence of warships off the African continent and the policies of aggression continually engaged in by the racist colonial regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury against Angola  Mozambique and Zambia. It is also those strategic and economic interests which inspire the plans of certain Governments for the political and economic destabilization of progressive regimes in Africa.36.	Conscious of those obstacles in the path of the liberation of African Territories still under racist colonial domination  we are convinced that it is our Organization's task to take the courageous measures that the situation requires 37.	In the light of the events occurring in southern Africa  the United Nations must take energetic and bold measures that are called for and made necessary by the requirements of freedom and dignity. In particular we call upon Member States which maintain various relations with those racist and colonial regimes in southern Africa to review their policy which  in any case  is in quite clear contradiction with their own system of government and their statements in the United Nations. At a time of co-operation between States and of interdependence it is incomprehensible that millions of human beings should be sacrificed on the altar of strategic and economic interests  interests that are futile  because sooner or later the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe will become the true masters of their own countries and resources. History is rich in lessons in this area 38.	It is for this reason that we suggest to the great Powers with their interests in southern Africa that they turn over a new leaf in their record of co-operation with the racist and colonial regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury and instead turn towards support for the national liberation movements with a view to preparing for the independence of those countries which are still under colonial domination and laying the foundations for solid co-operation.39.	The example of the intensive co-operation which exists between the independent States of Africa and their partners in the Western world .should calm the exaggerated apprehensions and unjustified fears of certain countries or certain societies with regard to the maintenance of their interests in southern Africa after the liberation of South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe.40.	For all those reasons  we believe it is realistic completely to isolate the racist and colonial regimes in southern Africa. We therefore urge the Security Council to make use of the provisions  of Chapter VII of the Charter to impose economic sanctions on South Africa  Furthermore  we hope that the economic sanctions decided upon against Rhodesia will be strengthened.41.	We  for our part  will continue to support the national liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  that is to say  the South West Africa People's Organization for Namibia  the Patriotic Front for Zimbabwe  and the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania.42.	We should also like to pay a tribute to the frontline countries  whose solidarity with the liberation movements has been the greatest encouragement for all the peoples engaged in the struggle for their survival and dignity. The international community should offer further support to those countries victims of repeated acts of unprovoked aggression by those regimes which have been condemned by history.43.	The situation prevailing in Western Sahara is the result of a deliberate policy of recolonization  which has been reflected in the invasion  occupation and denial of the identity of the Saharan people. The sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held in Monrovia  Liberia  in July last  both reaffirmed the inalienable right of the Saharan people to self-determination and independence and recognized the need to permit that people to take a free decision about its future. The Burundi Government has always supported the just cause of the Saharan people under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO.  We hope that the voice of African wisdom will be heeded by all the parties concerned and that the Saharan people will finally become masters of their Territory and destiny. Then arms will fall silent and a new era of co-operation and peace will dawn in the region.44.	The situation prevailing in the Middle East is a matter of the greatest concern to us all. The international community has recently witnessed a major diplomatic offensive which culminated in the signing of the agreements between Egypt and Israel. Some thought that that was an important step towards peace. Unfortunately  at the present time peace and security still remain in jeopardy. The Palestinian people are still without a country and many other issues still remain unresolvedâsuch as Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and the status of Jerusalem.45.	A just and lasting solution to the question of the Middle East must take account of all those elements the point of convergence of which is the concept of a home- rand and the formation of an independent State. It is in this context that we would encourage any initiative designed to revive peace negotiations among all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] representing the Palestinian people.46.	In the face of increasing tension in the Mediterranean we call on those States parties to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to transform the region into a zone of peace and co-operation.47.	Also in the context of the maintenance of international peace and security we whole-heartedly support the aims of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1971. We call on all States to review their policies of power  which consist of setting up or maintaining military bases in that area  in order to guarantee the sovereignty  territorial integrity and fruitful development of the region.48.	Peace is an indivisible whole. Security in Africa  Europe and the Middle East would indeed be precarious if Asia  where most of humanity lives  were faced with large-scale conflicts. We have great respect for these peoples with their very old civilizations. Africa has ties of active solidarity forged through the history of the liberation of the African and Asian countries.49.	We ask all South-East Asian States to settle all their conflicts or disputes themselves without outside interference  so as to safeguard world peace in this region. We sincerely hope that  thanks to their own genius  these States will be able to overcome the obstacles to their negotiations  so that the conditions for viable peace and fruitful co-operation in the region may be created.50.	On the question of Korea  our Government supports the efforts towards the peaceful and independent reunification of that country. So that this goal may be achieved  all foreign troops must be withdrawn and all bases and other foreign military installations in South Korea must be dismantled. We would also like to draw the attention of the international community to the untoward effects the admission of a divided Korea to the United Nations would have.51.	The Second World War was enough to demonstrate the drama of mankind's existence threatened by the huge arsenal of destruction made available to human societies through science and technology. Therefore it is urgent to do everything possible to avoid anew global conflagration and to discourage any escalation of violence  for the very survival of the human race. The only way to achieve this is to carry out complete and general disarmament. This will only be done by promoting a sense of solidarity and friendship among peoples and by making people aware of the danger represented by the arms race.52.	In these circumstances  only political commitment by States can unleash the disarmament process. The Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly [resolution S-J0I2] represents a stage which should be stressed within this context. It is important that the measures recommended in this document should be followed up.53.	The signing of the agreements reached at the conclusion of the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] by the United States and the Soviet Union is another encouraging sign. We hope that the negotiations during the third round of SALT will start soon.54.	There is every reason to encourage the initiatives undertaken towards creating nuclear-weapon-free zones. Here we consider it imperative to take the appropriate measures for the application of the Declaration on the Denuclearization of Africa  for the creation of zones free of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and in South Asia  and for the respect of the treaties and protocols banning nuclear weapons in Latin America.55.	All these measures are of course only aimed at the establishment of true peace. There is no doubt that this implies stopping the arms race  reducing stocks of conventional weapons and destroying stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.56.	Nevertheless  if we want to achieve real peace  we must work towards the universal establishment of an order of justice and equity in international relations.57.	The ever-growing gap between rich and poor countries  the persistence of an unjust international order in die distribution of resources and the maintenance of relations of domination are factors which give rise to serious tension which  in the long term  threaten the establishment of true peace on a global scale.58.	The response to this situation can only be sought through the United Nations resolutions relating to the establishment of a new international order based on justice and equity. The advent of a new international order in the field of economic relations and information will be our next subject.59.	In spite of the efforts made at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly and later at the North-South Conference in Paris and at sessions of UNCTAD  we have to face the fact that the situation of inequality and injustice is getting worse; hence the need to transform the system of dependence and exploitation into relations of mutual benefit. It should be made clear at once that this struggle for economic liberation by the third-world countries is not directed against the industrialized countries.60.	The claims of the developing countries are in fact those of having the sovereign rights to their own re-sources  the establishment of machinery for stabilizing the prices of primary commodities which they export  the creation of reasonable conditions of access to the international market  the transfer of science and technology to the developing countries  the reform of the international monetary system and finally international co-operation free of any alienation or humiliation.61.	These demands by the third-world countries take real account of the interdependence of nations and the complementary nature of world economies.62.	The full importance of this factor was really felt during the 1973 oil crisis. Drastic measures to deal with the root causes of the crisis should have been taken from then on. The industrialized countries did not have the courage to follow this course; hence the almost insurmountable difficulties which all countries must face. However  we must recognize that this crisis was63.	This is why we believe that this category of countries deserves special attention from the international community. We hope that in the new development strategy and in the programmes being followed by the United Nations system as a whole the bulk of aid will be devoted to those countries which are the poorest.64.	In this context we would like to stress the particular difficulties of land-locked countries. For some time the international community has been aware of the situation. The United Nations has even advocated special measures aimed at them.65.	The creation of the United Nations Special Fund for Land-locked Developing Countries was a response to these countriesâ concern. Unfortunately  for reasons which are still unclear  this fund enjoyed neither the sympathy nor the necessary support of the developed countries for the achievement of its aims. We can only express our regret  because the problem of being landlocked can only be overcome with the aid of the industrialized countries. When we say this we in no way wish to minimize sub-regional or regional co-operation in this field.66.	The need for granting greater financial and technical assistance is particularly justified because these land-locked countries fall into the category of the least advanced of the developing countries. As members know  the international community has been made constantly aware of the vulnerable position of these poorest of the developing countries.67.	In response to the wishes expressed by these countries  the fifth session of UNCTAD advocated a programme of action  which deserves the unreserved support of Member States and the whole of the international community. Within the same context  we hope that the international community will strengthen its - co-operation with the countries which have suffered from drought  and natural disasters and those which suffer from geographical disadvantages.68.	Assistance on the part of the developed countries will only be able to achieve its objectives to the extent that the developing countries themselves are convinced of the need to strengthen their co-operation.69.	The United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries  held in Buenos Aires last year  set up some important milestones in this area. We would like to reaffirm our support for the Plan of Action adopted by the Conference.  It does  indeed  seem to us appropriate to appeal to our friends in the third world who possess technology adapted to our conditions of development or who possess sizeable financial resources. In this context  we welcome as an important factor the intense co-operation which exists between Africa and the Arab world  whose historical  geographical and cultural ties are guarantees for the strengthening of this solidarity.70.	We are also gratified by the growing co-operation between Africa  Asia and Latin America.71.	However  this co-operation among developing countries would be strengthened if the movement of people and goods were not curbed by  among other things  the lack of infrastructure in the fields of transportation and communications. This is particularly true of Africa. The United Nations has officially recognized this fact by the proclamation of the United Nations Transport and Communications Decade in Africa for the period 1978-1988. This decision has been welcomed as an essential factor in the integrated development strategy of the African continent. We therefore hope that the programme and the measures proposed by the OAU will call forth a widespread response from Member States and the whole United Nations system.72.	We should like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to UNDP  which has done pioneer work in this field. Indeed  UNDP has set the tone by its decision to set aside a certain sum from its reserves in order to support the objectives of the Decade. It is our firm hope that this example will be followed by Member States and all international institutions.73.	It is  further  indispensable to reserve an important place in the new development strategy for the United Nations Transportation and Communications Decade in Africa.  In our view this would be an important contribution to the advent of the new international economic order.74.	The new world order is founded not only on justice and equity in international economic relations  but also on the democratization of information. It is impossible to stress too much the role that information can play in the area of comprehension among men and mutual understanding among peoples. We believe that in order to attain this objective it is indispensable to strengthen vertical and horizontal co-operation with the view of bringing about free and balanced circulation of information. We must recognize the value and quality of the work done in this area by UNESCO.75.	We should also like to encourage the work of the Committee to Review United Nations Public Information Policies and Activities. We would  however  welcome close co-operation between UNESCO and the United Nations Department of Public Information. In this effort to seek objectivity in the field of information  we must recognize the important role of non- official organizations. We must encourage efforts to establish better organized and more fruitful cooperation between the public and private information sectors.76.	We  for our part  are ready to look into any formulas for co-operation with the representatives of the information sector  a sector which exercises such a great influence on the lives of individuals and peoples.Indeed  it would be no exaggeration to claim that much change in the world is the result of the technological revolution in the information media. For example  if respect for human rights is today an important element in the credibility of a Government  this is in large measure due to the publicity resources employed by the information media.77.	Since we are on the subject of human rights  should like to make clear the position of my Government on this question  which is a matter of fundamental concern to the international community.78.	For a long time  stress has been laid on civil and political rights  while economic  social and cultural rights have been left aside. For our part  we believe that all these rights are indissolubly linked in terms of their conception and the universality of their application. Conceived in this way human rights embrace the rights of the individual in general  of women and children in particular  and also the rights of peoples and States.79.	It is clear to us that it is the whole gamut of human rights that should guide us in our policies and positions in the appropriate United Nations organs. As a member of the Commission on Human Rights  Burundi has every intention of discharging its responsibilities in this area.80.	We hope thus to deserve the confidence which the Governments of Member States have placed in our revolution.81.	We assure the Assembly of the commitment of our Government to the triumph of the cause of liberty for men and peoples. In this way we will contribute to the building of a better world in which justice and co-operation prevail. We say this because  like all the other members of the Assembly  we are convinced that all our efforts should be aimed at the building of a new society  based on friendship and solidarity. For humanity  to which we all belong  shares a common destiny 82.	The participation of all the nations of this General Assembly is the most convincing testimony of their commitment to justice and solidarity.83.	We wish to extend our greetings to this Assembly as the builders of this society where peace  brotherhood and solidarity will prevail."
"8",480,"BEL",34,1979,"ï»¿1.	The sudden events through which we have lived this year have brought about a lack of confidence in the future and the feeling that less than ever before are we able to surmount our economic  social  moral and national problems.2.	Public opinion perceives a certain weakening of authority  a lack of leadership in the conduct of international affairs; it perceives  at any rate  the precarious- ness of the fragile balances in today's world as well as the causes of tensions and conflicts. Certain essential problems concerning the preservation of peace are stagnant  whether they relate to the Middle East  Namibia  Rhodesia or Cyprus. These problems have been bogged down at a time when it seemed that the goal was nearly attained. As a result the present peace becomes fragile.3.	Other problems have sprung up  some of them very crucial  in South-East Asia  Iran  Afghanistan and certain regions of Africa.4.	In the economic sphere  substantial rises in the prices of oil products are affecting the economies of all states. Inflation has not been controlled anywhere. For nearly 10 years now the international monetary system has been in an ever-increasing state of convulsion. The dollar  which claimed to be the new international monetary standard  is eroding. And when its foundations give way  should one not fear being cast adrift? The phenomenal rise in the price of gold is an illustration of this psychosis.5.	Such is the present state of our anxiety.6.	And yet we must not forget the enormous progress of the last few years in the economic and social fields and in international relations.7.	The deep sense of hostility between the greatPowers which existed after the war has disappeared and detente gives rise to hope of a lasting peace.8.	The Europe of the nine members of the European Economic Community is progressing in all aspects  politically and economically. This is happening slowly  it is true  but with the assurance that this is its destiny. It is preparing to expand and also to become more deeply- rooted in public opinion. On the international level its contribution is increasing  particularly in the area of development co-operation.9.	Of course  there is no great universal design today. Consequently  must we not  more than ever before  progress in several directions  step by step? The gap between disquiet and frustration and confident optimism can be quickly bridged.10.	The United Nations provides a privileged framework for the solution of a multitude of problems and the establishment of a world community.11.	I shall not go over the ideas already developed before the Assembly on 25 September  on behalf of the nine States members of the European Economic Community  by Mr. O'Kennedy  the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Ireland  who is President of the Community for this six-month period. Members will have noticed that the statement of the Community before the General Assembly gains more in substance each year. That shows the progress achieved towards the formulation of common positions in international affairs. It means that there are several questions on which I need not dwell. I shall therefore limit myself to developing some views on four subjects  the first of which is the Middle East.12.	On 17 September 1978 the Camp David Agreements were signed. Who would then have dared to hope that the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty would be implemented on schedule? And yet the third phase of the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai has just been carried out. The two countries are discovering the path of mutual understanding. Thus the Treaty signals a first step in the implementation of the principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  on the way to an over-all settlement that will create conditions for a lasting peace. It is an act of courage and political farsightedness  yet by itself it will not solve all the problems. We can  however  hope that it will give an impetus towards peace.13.	That is why I share the conviction of many Arab leaders that peace in the area can be restored only through a just and over-all settlement of the conflict. Such a settlement should be based above all on recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people  its right to self-determination and its right to a homeland  as well as withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  including those in Jerusalem. It is up to the Palestinians themselves to decide upon the actual manner in which they wish to express their national identity and to decide  with the parties concerned  whether they prefer a status of autonomy or an independent State  a federal framework or a confederate one.â14.	Soon we should get down to some hard thinking with a view to defining the Palestinian entity that is so often talked about. We should reflect on its political and economic viability. Such clarifications will give more concrete shape to the wish of our Governments to arrive at a global settlement in the not-too-distant future. The Belgian Government has no doubt that the representatives of the Palestinian people  and in particular the PLO  should be associated with such a settlement. For its part  Belgium has had regular contacts with the PLO for several years now. In Brussels  the PLO has for quite some time maintained an information and liaison office. For my part  I hope to see the PLO adopt a policy of peace based on recognition of Israel and its right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries  as well as on acceptance of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  whose over-all principles remain valid.15.	I have closely followed the efforts undertaken in the Security Council with a view to completing this resolution. I appreciate the attempts to include in the resolution the point""That the Palestinian people should be enabled to exercise its inalienable right to self-determination  national independence and sovereignty in Palestine  in accordance with the United Nations Charter and relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly"". 16.	Belgium  which maintains friendly relations with Israel  is fully conscious of Israel's security needs. But we wonder whether Israel's security would not be best guaranteed by relations of mutual confidence with its neighbours rather than by the continued occupation of their territories in a climate of hostility. History shows us too many examples of States wasting their moral capital in pursuit of such a policy.17.	The PLO  for its part  should of course cease its acts of violence against Israel  especially at a time when the international community is increasing and even accelerating its recognition of the justice of its demands.18.	The Israeli people and their leaders have long sought  and after much suffering have finally attained  their national ideal in circumstances which the Palestinian people are in turn now undergoing. May the common experience of so much parallel suffering finally bring the Palestinians and the Israelis together in dialogue and peace. That is  I believe  the hope of the vast majority of this Assembly.19.	This year  once again  southern Lebanon has continued to be the powerless witness of its own physical and moral destruction. It seems particularly unjustified that Lebanon  the only country that refused to enter the Middle East conflict  has become the victim of a war that is above all a war of others. Our Organization must support the endeavours now being made in many places to restore peace in Lebanon and to restore the full authority of the legitimate Lebanese Government.20.	I come now to my second subject  disarmament.21.	From this very rostrum  on 2 June 1978  during""Imagination  coupled with the restraint on the part of all and the will to succeed  might lead to a more productive stage in the efforts to achieve disarmament."" This  members will agree  showed prudent optimism.22.	Unfortunately  we have to acknowledge that that more fruitful stage has still not yet been reached and that  indeed  the arms race has not slowed down.23.	Nevertheless  Belgium remains convinced that disarmamentâand  in the meantime  the cessation or  at least  the slowing down of the arms raceâconstitutes what is undoubtedly the most urgent task of the community of nations. Like other speakers who have preceded me  I am pleased by the conclusion between the two biggest military Powers of a new Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms after some seven years of negotiation.24.	Even though  strictly speaking  this is not a disarmament measure  the treatyâif it is ratified  as my country and  I believe  most countries hopeâwill open the way to new negotiations aimed at substantial reductions in the long-range nuclear stockpiles of the two Powers and will  in a more general sense  make a powerful contribution to the creation of a climate favourable to the success of other negotiations now under way or being prepared.25.	Another positive point that concerns us in this field is the performance of the new Committee on Dis-armament  which was established by this Assembly last year. We have reason to be pleased with its initial work. The questions of substance were discussed in a constructive spirit that augurs well for its next session.26.	My country is also pleased with the atmosphere surrounding the work of the Group of Governmental Experts on Regional Disarmament charged with assisting the Secretary-General in the elaboration of a report concerning the different aspects of that subject. We are convinced that when that report is submitted to the General Assembly next year  it will show that the regional approach offers a wealth of concrete possibilities for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements that would contribute effectively to the cessation of the nuclear and conventional arms race. In this context Belgium is following with particular interest the actions of Mexico and other countries in Latin America.27.	I come now to human rights. Every day brings us countless reports of torture  injustice  persecution  dis-crimination  fear and hunger. Fortunately  the world community is showing increasing concern regarding those denials of human dignity. The United Nations plays an essential role in making people aware of the universal significance of human rights  but our world is still searching for the proper way in which to express its legitimate concern.28.	The list of human rights has grown longer and the interdependence of these rights is recognized. However  interdependence does not mean equivalence; rights differ  in that they may be immediate or evolutionary in character; they differ in the role which the State may play in their realization. Some rights  such as the right to life  are fundamental and should be recognized everywhere in the same way; other rights are better realized in ways that are adapted to cultural  economic and social conditions. The elaboration of standards has now reached such a degree of development that our Organization might envisage a synthesis which would relate the rights to one another and which would be capable of laying the basis for a more coherent international policy on human rights.29.	All rights are universal  but in many cases this is compatible with a regional approach. Western Europe has already acquired considerable experience in this regional action  particularly through the action of the Council of Europe  but it has no monopoly on it. We see considerable activity in this field in the Americas and in Africa. Any regional initiative deserves to be encouraged  as long as it is in accordance with the instruments of universal applicability which constitute the international bill of human rights.30.	Our Organization has also made some progress in the way in which it deals with human rights violations  but its action remains slow and timid and this deficiency is particularly felt in the case of serious violations. The collective voice of the United Nations should be allowed more effective expression wherever it is still possible to correct a situation. This voice should not be toned down when an appeal is made to national sovereignty or political considerations.31.	May I recall in this respect that Belgium was not to be counted among those who have made it difficult  or even impossible  for the United Nations to carry out a real investigation of the massive violations of human rights in Kampuchea when those violations were at the peak of their atrocity? I want to reaffirm that the position taken by my delegation this session concerning the credentials of Democratic Kampuchea in no way constitutes approval of the policy followed in the past by that regime.32.	The President of the Assembly has emphasized that if all Governments observed or enforced the various covenants and rules of human conduct and governmental responsibility  none of their citizens would be obliged to seek refuge abroad. Alas  they are far from doing so and the sad stream of refugees is continually growing. The humanitarian action of the United Nations with regard to this problem is indispensable; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees deserves support proportionate to the situation. The Geneva Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia  convened by the Secretary-General  reflected credit on our Organization. It focused particularly on the unprecedented problem of the Vietnamese refugees. Although it was not able to deal with the causes of the massive exodus  it contributed to the beginning of a solution to the question of asylum. In conformity with its tradition  Belgium will take a generous share in this humanitarian action.33.	The Geneva Meeting hardly touched upon the specific problem of Kampuchea  yet the suffering of the population is becoming more frightful every day. We witness famine  massive displacements and desperate flights towards neighbouring countries. Only a political settlement  accepted inside as well as outside the country  could bring about reconciliation and the resurrection of a free Kampuchea. Immediate material assistance is indispensable. The international efforts that have been started must be amplified and must benefit all Kampucheans who need them urgently. It would be unthinkable for this vital assistance to be jeopardized by political considerations.34.	In concluding may I mention the North-South dialogue. Five years ago  at the sixth special session  the General Assembly launched the idea of a new international economic order. Since then the developed and the developing countries have been pursuing a continuing dialogue.35.	The new Lome Convention which  I hope  will be signed on 31 October  will strengthen the links between the nine countries of the European Community and the 57 countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific. It seems to us that the Europe of the nine- member Community increasingly exemplifies international co-operation and a determined desire for progress. It also seems to me that each of the participants in that Convention can mention this effort without vanity or embarrassment.36.	The North-South dialogue is continuing. It must continue. The interdependence of States and problems requires this.37.	Already it has achieved moderate but unquestionable results. Admittedly they are not commensurate with the goodwill expressed and the efforts deployed  and perhaps the dialogue has given rise to too many conferences and committees  and perhaps their respective agenda are overloaded with too many problems. One cannot examine and resolve everything at the same time.38.	Moreover  the multiplicity of development objectives selected by international gatherings over the years  as well as the absence of priorities  seems to us to detract from the credibility of the consensus achieved. Each of us needs to be more realistic.39.	We were interested to note the proposal made by the Group of 77 at the last meeting of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. It widens the field of our discussions by including the question of energy.40.	Of course  it will first be necessary to agree on the aim of this exercise and on its conditions and methods.41.	In any case  it seems to us that the dialogue should be conducted on the basis of solidarity. Problems of the economy in general and of the industrialized countries in particular cannot be excluded from it. The acceleration of development for all cannot be dissociated from the recovery of the world economy and the maintenance of economic conditions favourable to over-all growth in all regions  in particular those which suffer from a marked backwardness in the development of their human potential and natural resources.â42.	The dialogue must favour a new international economic order. It must  by definition  be a new one  but it must also be orderly  so that there may be a more balanced distribution of rights and obligations for all.43.	It is not possible  I must reiterate  to hold such a dialogue while ignoring energy problems.44.	Oil represents nearly 15 per cent of world trade. Its increase in price imposes an enormous transfer of resources on the industrialized countries. One could estimate that the most recent rise in oil prices will result in a loss of growth of approximately 1 per cent of the gross national product for the European Community. It will mean an additional burden for the entire Community of more than $12 billion. The resulting transfer of resources takes on its full importance when one recalls that in 1978 the industrialized countries together spent 0.32 per cent of their gross national product on official development assistance.45.	The dynamism of our economies is profoundly affected by the rise in oil prices. That rise inexorably erodes the balance of payments  particularly those of developing countries which do not produce oil.46.	A world-wide effort at common action on all aspects of the oil problem is therefore necessary.47.	On 27 September  this Assembly heard a remarkable speech by Mr. Jose Lopez Portillo  the President of the United Mexican States  who described the problem of energy to us in all its scope and gravity. I welcome his proposalâone of apparent modesty  but great realismâto form a working group comprising representatives of oil-producing countries  industrialized countries and oil-importing developing countries in order to formulate concrete proposals in this field.48.	In my view  the development of a new strategy  quite as much as the continuation of the dialogue  must take into account the considerations I have just set before you. On the other hand  a number of facts and objectives must be mentioned.49.	There appears to be agreement on the priority developing countries must give to the increase and di-versification of their food production. Their concern to ensure subsistence for their populations and to husband their foreign currency resources are primary objectives. Moreover  the development of agriculture and rural activities is the major source of employment in developing countries.50.	There is general agreement  furthermore  that the purchasing power created by agricultural development in itself favours the process of industrialization. On the whole  the international community considers the industrialization of developing countries to be one of its principal objectives because such industrialization is a factor for rapid growth.51.	I should like to emphasize  however  that industrialization cannot be accompanied by long-term protectionist measures. In view of their importance in world trade  the industrialized countries of course bear the primary responsibility for the freedom of trade. However  the fight against protectionism  against tariff and non-tariff barriers  is the task of all countries  whether industrialized or in the process of industrialization. By the same token  free access to raw materials must be guaranteed to all. For that matter  only the liberalization of international trade can ensure the integration of developing countries into the international economy.52.	In this connexion  I am surprised that the question of private investments  indispensable in this process of industrialization  has hitherto not been the subject of agreements within the framework of the dialogue.53.	The transfer of private resources to developing countries surpasses government aid each year; often such transfers  whether they be foreign investments  bank credits or financing guarantees  are more than twice as high as government aid. However  they require an atmosphere of confidence  an appropriate protection of investments  andâwhen circumstances call for itâa free transfer of income and repayments  a reasonable and speedy compensation for expropriations  non-discriminatory treatment and the opportunity  in the event of disputes  for recourse to various international arbitration bodies recognized by the parties concerned 54.	As for official development assistance  we are all aware of the efforts to be made by developed countries and some developing countries  whatever their economic and social system  to increase their transfers of resources. Yet such official assistance has its limits. We must ensure its best possible distribution  as well as the most suitable means for its use. In this spirit  ought we not to take more into account the diversity of the developing countries? Is it not more equitable to direct official development assistance to the most disadvantaged countries to an increasing degree and to satisfy their basic needs?55.	Finally  we cannot overlook the fact that the transfer of resources will not truly be promoted save within the framework of growing national economies. Widespread inflation in the industrialized countries and the increase in unemployment today represent preliminary obstacles that must be overcome.56.	The primacy of the human person  peace and justice were the themes set forth during the visit of His Holiness Pope John Paul II to the United Nations. These are also the chapters under which the action of the United Nations is taking place.57.	Our Organization can contribute to defining a great ambition. Essential debates take place here; for example  the definition of a type of society in which rights are more securely established and defended  the search for a durable peace in places where history has opened and is still inflicting deep wounds  and the realization of a new economic order as well.58.	If we can unite our political will  the future of our peoples will not consist merely of uncertainty  and in-stability will not become the law of the world. Perhaps history is but one long tragedy. For my part  however  I would rather believe  with Voltaire  that ""the world  slowly  is progressing towards wisdom""."
"9",526,"BEN",34,1979,"ï»¿First and foremost  may I be allowed to express here the feelings of deep sadness of my delegation at the cruel loss of two of the most courageous sons of Africa; the sudden premature demise of President Houari Boumediene of Algeria and President Antonio Agostinho Neto of Angola  two great leaders of the present-day fight for freedom  two statesmen who placed their lives at the service of the freedom  independence and dignity of the oppressed peoples of the world. Their passing will long be mourned as an inestimable loss. They have left us with a shining example which will give us the courage and determination necessary to press on with the work which they began.44.	I wish to extend to you  Mr. President  the warm  fraternal congratulations of the delegation of the People's Republic of Benin  which welcomes your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of our Organization's General Assembly with pleasure and with pride. Your unanimous election to preside over the work of our present session  dear brother and friend  is both a well-deserved tribute paid by the international community to your country  the United Republic of Tanzania  a front-line country and an un-breachable bulwark of freedom in the southern part of our continent  where so many of our brothers are still being subjected to the iniquitous sway of racist oppression and the most brutal and anachronistic colonial exploitation  and a fitting recognition of your personal merits as a dedicated patriot and an enlightened diplomat unswerving in the service of the cause of the freedom and dignity of our peoples  We are convinced that under your leadership our deliberations will be guided effectively and equitably and that our work will be crowned with success.45.	My delegation also wishes to express its great satisfaction and its appreciation regarding the admirable and praiseworthy manner in which the outgoing President of our Assembly  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  organized and conducted the work of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.46.	Benin would also like to pay a tribute once again to the outstanding administrative and diplomatic qualities of our Organization's chief official  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose activities over the past year have been devoted to the accomplishment of the goals set by our Organization. The delegation of Benin wishes to take this opportunity to express its confidence to him once again and to assure him of the support and friendly assistance of the People's Republic of Benin in his onerous but uplifting tasks in the service of mankind.47.	My delegation would also like to extend a very warm welcome to Saint Lucia on its accession to inter-national sovereignty and its entry into the United Nations. We assure the representative of that new State of our active solidarity and fraternal co-operation.48.	This session of the United Nations General Assembly  the thirty-fourth since the founding of our Organization  provides all Member States with an exceptional opportunity and setting for discussion and debate devoted to an analysis of the world situation and for an examination of the course of history that we may the better perceive the outlines of the profound changes in the structure of societies  for our session is being held at a particularly tumultuous juncture  one fraught with open conflicts and with still latent explosions and revolutionary upheavals in the history of mankind and its societies.49.	The unequal and shocking distribution of wealth and technology  the cynical scientific exploitation  international imperialism  the pitiless sway of multinational corporations  are all characteristics of our era  maintaining and aggravating as they do poverty  the backwardness caused by blockades of every sort and the oppression to which our peoples are subjected  an oppression that has many aspects and assumes many forms.50.	Let no one expect that we will tire of speaking out and denouncing  from every available rostrum and in the striking circumstances of present-day history  those elements that feed the disorder that prevails in the world economy and support the scandal of injustices and inequalities  creating and fomenting hatred among States and endangering international peace and security.51.	Following all my colleagues who have preceded me at this rostrum and have spoken with such faith and eloquence  and before those who will come after me  I also wish to state my rejection of this scandal and my demand for truth and justice  for today the massive and stubborn truth of events can be denied only by the determined intellectual dishonesty and shoddy logic of evil propaganda for evil purposes.52.	The former and present state of affairs is thereby being perpetuated in the world economy. The accession of dozens of former colonial countries to independence over the past 20 years has done little to alter the world's economic landscape. Unbalanced trade  colonial-style exploitation  primitive and undisguised  the subtleties and disguises of neo-colonialism  the ever-increasing technological dependence of the third-world countries  all bear witness to our poverty and to the handicaps from which we suffer on every level. The heavy and constantly increasing indebtedness of our countries is destroying our budgets and dangerously limitingâif not completely annihilatingâour chances for harmonious and independent development. The decrease in aid to our countries or the creation of assistance machinery that is often designed solely to facilitate recolonization  are serious new forms of debt that lead us to fear lest they seriously compromise our fragile independence.53.	Monetary disorder  evidenced by wild fluctuations in the price of gold and the un-workability of certain international monetary regulations set up in the post-war period  is increasing and strengthening the position of the imperialist strongholds in their attempts to preserve their ill-gotten privileges. And as if to perpetuate such imbalances and give permanent status to the institutions and to an unjust morality  based on the law of the strongest in the most savage of jungles  the environment is being destroyed and the seas  the oceans and the continents are being polluted; billions in hard currency  millions more than the sums being devoted to aid to our countries and our economies  are being spent to stockpile atomic weapons and highly sophisticated conventional weapons for blackmail and terror in order to impose the rule of injustice and inequality on us  the eternal victims.54.	This general picture fairly describes the many conferences and symposia that we have attended in this Organization and various institutions within its family  meetings of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  UNCTAD and many others. Those organizations have produced facts  figures and statistics which the most sophisticated computers confirm and refine. I shall spare representatives a long and tedious list of them. They will allow me to eschew certain oratorical devices and not rehearse them once again  as I am sure that they are even more familiar with this list than I.55.	What needs to be denounced is the scandalous evils of a world and an economic and moral orderâor  rather  disorderâwhere the wealth of some dominates and maintains the poverty of others.â56.	What needs to be denounced is this devious  dishonest effort to safeguard and maintain  at any cost  this unjust world where the sterile comforts of some are purchased at the expense of the destitution  hunger and poverty of others.57.	We must reject the smugness and arrogance of the rulers of empires  of banks or of financial consortiums which have been bending over backwards to put the stamp of legitimacy on the status of peoples in bondage to which they would relegate us.58.	What must be denounced also  in this International Year of the Child  is the fact that thousands of children of the third world are doomed to a life expectancy so short that their intellectual and physical potential will never be fully developed  precisely because of this non-egalitarian  unjust international economic order.59.	That is what my delegation proclaims with conviction  with a sense of our responsibility and with a keen awareness of the need to act in accordance with the dictates of justice and dignity shared with us by all the peoples of the third world.60.	This is not a sweeping indictment where hatred and passion are intended to replace truth and objectivity. We are not saying anything that has not already been analysed  discussed  commented on and adopted by our Organization. The new international economic order has  since 1974  been a demand of history. It contains a programme which  by overhauling international economic relations  would establish norms of justice and equity among our countries and peoples  and would establish a new balance  which would benefit peace and friendship among peoples  of the present system of trade and exchange in the world.61.	In Manila in 1978 and in Havana at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  the creation of that new orderâ after so many other regional  continental and world meetingsâwas considered as the only lasting path to fruitful and peaceful international co-operation among States and nations.62.	The solutions to what has been commonly called the crisis are thus well known. The responses to the inhuman and illegal frustration of our countries and peoples  whose resources and development are stagnating  are also well known  but no start whatever has been made on applying them seriously because of the blocking tactics of the imperialist countries. Indeed  only through solidarity and fighting and through organization at the regional and international levels will the ""damned of the earth"" be able to establish a new economic order and bring pressure to bear on those who deliberately shy away from the reasonable and equitable actions called for by mankind today.63.	In the third world and within the non-aligned movement  horizontal solidarity must be asserted increasingly if we are to improve our means of fighting for equity and development and defeat certain forms of blackmail. In the area of energy  for example  while the great oil cartels have been increasing their profits at an extraordinary rate  all forms of propaganda have been used by the Western Powers to make people believe that the members of OPEC are solely responsible for the international energy crisis  inflation and alleged world stagnation.64.	This campaign alone should convince our friends and brothers in OPEC that they must increasingly accord a privileged role to our countries in their programmes of foreign financial investment. That is a duty of solidarity and is called for by reason and it cannot but serve to strengthen our common front against exploitation and foreign domination and actively contribute to our fight for a new international economic order.65.	Of course  it must be recognized that the intervention of the various Arab funds  OPEC assistance and financial aid from the Afro-Arab bank organizations such as the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa provide a growing supply of capital and give us the benefit of a not inconsiderable portion of the oil earnings of the producers of the precious black gold. But the tendency to invest money in the wealthy countries of the West must be combated and  inversely  there must be additional financial flows in our direction to enhance horizontal co-operation.66.	We have just pointed the finger at the parties primarily responsible for international poverty  exploitation and the plundering of our peoples  as well as at those who have taken from our peoples their resources and the fruits of their labour. With all the revolutionary lucidity and dignity now characteristic of our country  the People's Republic of Benin  we have courageously stated our principles and proposed a remedy  from which we expect not so much miracles as direct effects on the established injustices and disorder in the world economic order. The new order  to whose historic creation we wish to contribute  would bring about qualitative changes and a gradual transformation of the situation throughout the world in the interests of dozens of developing countries which are on the periphery of the international capitalist system. But the economy of the nations will see real development and enjoy stable growth only when the freedom of peoples and the full sovereignty of nations are no longer restricted  threatened or questioned.67.	It is very difficult for international imperialism to conceal its ambition of colonial reconquest and neo-colonialist subjugation. Its acts of aggression take the most subtle and brutal forms. Its permanent strategy of selfish exploitation and oppression develops and builds up the most diabolical and bloody means of repressing the resistance of our peoples and of assassinating great leaders of the revolutionary struggle. None the less  the national conscience of the peoples of the oppressed countries continues to develop and their mobilization grows in the struggle against the age-old enemy  at the same time a wheedler and a pitiless executioner  as its hypocritical nature and its own logic make it.68.	Therefore  since the thirty-third session of the General Assembly  the political complexion of the world has changed and taken on new colours. The fall and final crushing of the Fascist pro-imperialist dictatorships in Iran and Nicaragua bear this out.69.	In spite of the barbarous crimes of imperialism and in spite of its plots and manoeuvres  in our great  rich and beautiful continent  Africa  the peoples are mobilizing and struggling. Colonialism  racism and neo-colonialism in fact remain imperialism's methods of domination on our continent. The minority regimes in southern Africa are its ignoble expression and they are legitimately condemned by progressive mankind.70.	The constitutional ruses and chicanery of the white racist minority in Zimbabwe and Muzorewa's treason have not succeeded in making Africa accept an illegal regime irremediably condemned by history.71.	The so-called internal settlement in Southern Rhodesia  where African renegades  traitors to the sacred cause of their oppressed people  have been used  in no way responds to the profound aspirations of the working masses who are suffering in their flesh and blood and in their dignity.72.	The administering Power  the Government of the United Kingdom  must assume full responsibility for the massacres of children  women and old men carried out by the white racists of Southern Rhodesia in the front-line States in order to spread terror there and to dissuade them from showing their active solidarity with the heroic armed struggle of the Patriotic Front  the sole representative of the people of Zimbabwe. In spite of the mandatory sanctions which are still imposed on the illegal regime in Salisbury  the weapons which the white settler army uses come from the arsenals of the Western countries.73.	A tremendous challenge to the international community and to all our Organization's recommendations and decisions therefore renders those sanctions  which should have brought the Fascists of Southern Rhodesia to see the reason of our time and of history  cruelly derisory and fictitious. Those who thus get around the compulsory embargo ordered by the Security Council in its resolution 253 (1968) and gaily trample on our resolutions become accomplices in the crimes committed daily by the Ian Smith-Muzorewa clique in Zambia  Mozambique  Botswana and Angola. Their direct responsibility will not escape the judgement of history. They are also responsible for the plans of extermination and aggression hatched in Salisbury and Pretoria. The blood of the glorious martyrs of Zimbabwe  Kassinga  Maputo and Lusaka will also inevitably spatter them  whatever may be their shameful conscience  their subterfuge or their academic and legal arguments.74.	The plan of the imperialists and of all those working for the international recognition of the Smith- Muzorewa regime is well known. They are making use of all sorts of constitutional trickery and electoral gerrymandering  convening conference after conference  meeting after meeting  with ulterior motives which cannot escape the watchful vigilance of our peoples. We remain convinced that all these manoeuvres will be doomed to failure  as the international community will not allow itself to be tricked and bemused.75.	Any conference or meeting  if it is to succeed  must essentially aim at bringing the so-called Rhodesian rebellion to heel and bringing the true representatives of the Zimbabwean people  the Patriotic Front  to power.76.	The United Nations and the international community must therefore continue to grant all the necessary support to the liberation forces of the Patriotic Front  who represent and express the profound aspirations of the working masses of Zimbabwe.77.	The Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Havana has just proclaimed and repeated this demand  and let there be no mistake  it is the conscience of the world that was thus expressed  the proud and free voice of the immense majority of the peoples of our very rich and beautiful world  the voice of the oppressed and of the future of the world.78.	The problem of Zimbabwe goes hand in hand with that of Namibia. The correct strategic view of the problem of southern Africa  on the basis of the elementary analysis of certain geopolitical realities in fact indicates as clearly as possible that the independence of those two Territories will inevitably promote the liberation process within the very territory of the so-called Republic of South Africa  where the most ignoble colonialist and racist regime imposes fierce and exclusive domination over the indigenous peoples  who are slaves on the land of their ancestors.79.	The tactics used over the past two years by the imperialist Powers is thus to lull the international com-munity and to demobilize the liberation forces by making them believe that negotiations  meetings and endless diplomatic talks organized in one capital after another will solve the problem of the liberation of Zimbabwe and of Namibia.80.	My country  the People's Republic of Benin  has denounced all these manoeuvres  right from their first appearance. The plan for Namibia of the Five Western Powers and what is known as ""the Anglo-American plan for Zimbabwe"" represent the same strategy  set up in order to lull the international community and demobilize the liberation movements. We shall never stop denouncing these Machiavellian manoeuvres and stating that only the courageous and resolute armed struggle will free the peoples of those two Territories. Of course a peaceful settlement is possible  but that must be only on the basis of the strict application of the pertinent resolutions of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  which the racist puppets in South Africa and Zimbabwe  with the thinly veiled support of their imperialist masters  refuse to implement.81.	The Muzorewa-Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia and that of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance in Namibia are twins for which the imperialists  by various means  are astutely trying to gain recognition at the international level. At its last meeting held at Monrovia in July  the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU vigorously denounced that policy and those imperialist plans which flout the profound interests or Africa and its peoples and are aimed at institutionalizing what is felt by some to be a clever solution but is  in fact  nothing more than a gross and debased form of neo-colonialism.82.	The international community must also vigorously denounce apartheid and take action to put an end to it once and for all. Neither the present generation of Africans nor future ones will accept such a social aberration on our continent.83.	The decolonization and liberation of Southern Rhodesia and Namibia are for Africans and all peoples in the world a categorical imperative and a sacred mission entrusted by history to us and to all freedom fighters whose blood has been shed in that noble cause. But this fight for freedom and justice will never come to an end so long as apartheid exists in South Africa and so long as that enormous ghetto and military base continues to be defended and upheld on our continent by international imperialism. No form of African independence can be considered complete so long as the gold  diamonds and uranium of South Africaânow protected by a nuclear shield that has come from the West and from Israelâremain  in the eyes of those who offer the finest sermons on the rights of man  even more valuable than the lives and dignity of all our oppressed and humiliated brothers and of the great black Diaspora of the world.84.	It is strange and indeed curious that those who feel that Nazism is one of the most criminal perversities of history and who fought it at the cost of millions of lives today act with such benevolence towards the most faithful imitation of Hitlerite fascism in the contemporary world  behaving towards it with such a scandalous complicity as they not only invoke all sorts of pretexts and false reasons for refusing to isolate South Africa and Rhodesia through application of the embargo  but also lavish economic  diplomatic and  above all  military support on those countries.85.	We shall go no further in our expression of outrage than this sober language because  today and tomorrow in Africa  the implacable struggle and the innumerable sacrifices of the Patriotic Front  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and the African National Congress of South Africa will inevitably bring about the triumph of freedom  justice and dignity for the peoples of southern Africa.86.	Decolonization is still an unfinished business. In Zimbabwe  the strategy of the colonialists and imperialists is too clear and transparent for us to be mistaken regarding their aggressive plans. A journalist of the French weekly Nouvel Observateur reported in the issue dated 17 September 1979 on something that we all know and perceive when stressed that ""in fact a belt of satellite States is being created where proconsuls propped up by bayonets will rule  protected by jets  radar  missiles and the whole military panoply of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] that South Africa has at its disposal.""87.	The creation of Bantustans  those new reservations for blacks  arid and poor  are similar to those that we have seen in other countries in other historical contexts. They are part of a more cunning organization of the colonial  racist and Fascist system of South Africa  where the white minority has secured for itself the best lands and the basic wealth and maintained in the Bantustans at the same time a very cheap working force that they can keep poor  repressed and humiliated and can kill at will.88.	We could engage for many hours to come in this general indictment of apartheid. Its misdeeds  crimes and belligerent arrogance are growing  but the freedom fighters of the Patriotic Front  of SWAPO and of the African National Congress have redoubled their determination in their struggle to mobilize their peoples against the barbaric acts of colonialism and fascism.89.	The path is undoubtedly still long  hard and bloody that leads to the liberation of southern Africa  but the harsher the struggle the greater will be our sacrifices and our acts of solidarity so that one day  there in that immensely rich southern part of our continent  as in its north-western part  the acts of aggression will come to an end and the right to self-determination and independence and sovereign freedom will be exercised without restriction or military blackmail.90.	I now come to another colonial and expansionist scandal which an African Government is desperately trying to conceal by its lies and give some legitimacy to through the use of arms and aggression.91.	First  though  I should like to repeat that for my country  the People's Republic of Benin  the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic is a de jure reality that history and nine new States have just recognized and that the Frente POLISARIO is the sole and legitimate representative of a proud and heroic people  which the Moroccan regime  contrary to the wisdom and understanding of history and in pursuit of a wild dream  intends to subject to colonial law.92.	At Monrovia  in July 1979  and at Havana a few weeks ago  the OAU and the great movement of non- aligned countries respectively reaffirmed that in Western Sahara there remained but one fundamental historical problem  namely  the inalienable right to independence and self-determination of the Saharan people. Now  our brothers in Mauritania have decided to renounce all claims over Western Sahara and to withdraw their troops from that Territory and have enshrined that courageous determination in an agreement with the Frente POLISARIO. As far as Morocco is concerned  however  it is threatening  terrorizing  bombing and trying to create armed diversions with certain neighbouring countries  but it has not been able to stave off bitter defeats on the battlefield and the capture of thousands of soldiers by the Saharan Liberation Army. What a disgrace! We would repeat that Morocco is stubbornly squandering its resources and leading its army to suicide in an effort to conquer a Territory whose sole master is the great Saharan people. The arms and munitions of the Moroccan army will continue to enrich and reinforce the military potential of the fighting units of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.93.	It is up to our Organisation once again to proclaim loud and clear the right of the Saharan people to independence and self-determination  and to demand that Morocco renounce its annexationist ambitions.94.	If we do not show such determination to support one of the basic principles on which we act and which justify the existence of our Organization  we shall be favouring Morocco's adventure of territorial annexation  and we shall be putting our stamp of approval upon unjust acts of aggression against the Saharan people.95.	The world situation is characterized by the rising anger of peoples  who reject oppression  humiliation and injustice. The upsurge in the struggle of the Palestinians and the Arabs poses a problem for our Organization and the whole world: the question of war and peace in the Middle East.96.	War and peace in the Middle East and  consequently  war and peace throughout the world is the alternative facing imperialism and Zionism as a result of the separate Camp David agreements  the torture of Arab patriots and the expropriation and confiscation of Palestinian land. In spite of legalistic innovations and the creation of machinery to crush Palestinian resistanceâthe bloody tragedy of southern Lebanon being one more terrible exampleâthe three-Power Camp David coalition will inevitably encounter dignified and collective resistance and rejection from all peoples throughout the world who love peace and justice.97.	The PLO has brought about unity among the Palestinian people. It is that people's sole legitimate representative  Its international recognition is increasing  even in certain countries in which Western and Zionist propaganda endeavours to present it as a gang of terrorists and common-law criminals. The PLO alone represents the future of the Palestinian people  and it is the most lively  militant and noble expression of that people. Egypt's capitulation and betrayal will fail  for they do not take into account the determination of the PLO to fight until victory has been achieved  notwithstanding the billions of dollars  the arsenal of weapons and the great amount of technical assistance and means of espionage and intelligence being provided by international imperialism.98.	In Palestine  where fraternal relations and respect among the great universal religions once flourished  Zionism cannot achieve its goal of oppressing  exploiting and expropriating an entire people by arousing the unjust and unworthy hatred of the brothers and sons of the victims of the Nazi holocaust. The Zionist State of Israel must withdraw from the occupied Arab territories; Israel- must cease bombing and killing innocent populations in Southern Lebanon. The terror from the air  the daily round-ups and new plots hatched with its new ally and with international imperialism will only strengthen the determination of the PLO and serve to speed up the mobilization of the people of the area and of the entire world and turn them against Israel's arrogance  oppression and permanent aggression.99.	I might say that this Assembly is meeting today to hear yet another speech on world peace  because  as we move somewhat to the east of the explosive situation in the Middle East  we see that in South-East Asia blood and tears are flowing and the sound of guns may be heard every day. That is taking place in a region where there has been one of the most glorious revolutions of our era  the Indo-Chinese revolution  which has taught us all so much and provided us with so much inspiration. It is a part of the world in which  notwithstanding all the tension and the regrettable ambitions of certain Powers  the people have maintained their unity and solidarity and have been able to overcome one of the most powerful imperialist countries of our day and to give the oppressed nations of the world a legend that is in keeping with their genius  invincibility and respect for the dignity and worth of the human person.100.	That is why my delegation condemns the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary regime  which is guilty of genocide in the killing of more than 3 million Kampucheans  and that is why it firmly supports the people of Kampuchea in their fight for independence  freedom and the construction of socialism. We believe that only the representatives of the People's Revolutionary Council should be allowed to take that country's seat in this Organization.101.	In Korea as well peace and unification must be brought about. That can happen if the wise  realistic and positive proposals of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea are taken into account  studied objectively and supported by the international community.102.	In East Timor  as has been demanded for several years now by the fighters of FRETILIN  in their heroic popular struggle  the right of self-determination and independence must also be exercised.103.	Great Latin Americaâwhich has so many glorious traditions in the anti-imperialist struggle  including the revolutionary flame of Simon Bolivar and Jose Marti""  which is made to burn ever brighter by the heroes of the Moncada Barracksâhas continued to fight against imperialism in that continent.104.	The Benin revolution supports the socialist Republic of Cuba in its legitimate claim that the base in Guantanamo Bay  which is occupied by the United States against Cuba's will  should be restored to it and that an end should be put to the unconstitutional economic blockade that has been unjustly imposed upon Cuba. It is not proper that the Government of the United States should do everything in its power to exert pressures of all kinds to deprive the Cuban people of their inalienable right to choose the path of development that suits them.105.	The People's Republic of Benin fully supports the people of Puerto Rico in their just struggle for self- determination and independence  and we support the legitimate claim of the people of Panama to regain full sovereignty over the Canal that passes through this national territory. We support all the peoples of Latin America who are fighting against Fascist dictators and their imperialist masters.106.	In the various oceans of our planet there exist huge bases and nuclear testing sites  which are being strengthened. In particular  in the Indian Ocean  which laves the shores of a significant part of our continent  there must be a completely denuclearized and demilitarized zone if our countries are to develop in peace and are freely to choose their paths to progress and justice.107.	World peace is  after all  necessarily global and indivisible. And while we welcome the signing at Vienna on 18 June 1979 of the Treaty between the United States and the USSR on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms  concluded as a result of the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] in which we see the beginning of a world of fraternity and friendship among peoples  which we ardently desire  it must be recognized that any armed conflict anywhere in the world and any imperialist intervention  regardless of where it may occur in the world  undermines and jeopardizes the benefits ensuing from the difficult negotiations which led to the second round of SALT. There is an objective link and dialectical interaction between the crises and conflicts which arise in our world. And so-called limited wars can lead  in Africa  the Middle East and Asia to irreversible disasters. The problem of international peace and security must be viewed in these historical terms.108.	International imperialism constitutes  for our countries  which are still weak  and for our people  who are still to a very large extent subject to its colonial laws or its neo-colonialist domination  the prime danger to our security. Thus  it has elaborated a programme in which the full panoply of the means of aggression  intervention and subversion are refined and enhanced daily by the addition of new instruments of death and terror. Various means of blackmail  subjugation and destabilization are being used against the progressive regimes which have chosen the anti-imperialist  socialist path to development  and now mercenaries are being employed. This is an ignoble  hypocritical and repugnant means of armed intervention  of which my country was cruelly made the victim on 16 January 1977. The mercenaries who attacked my country  killed heroic fighters  both civilians and those in uniform  and caused terrible material damage are no longer the phantoms and privateers that certain countries took pleasure in discovering a short time ago in our reports on aggression. Today  the barbaric aggression of 16 January 1977 is no longer a mystery to anyone  even to the most hypocritical and cynical mercenaries of the pen in the service of imperialism.109.	In accepting complaints of certain family members of the victims against the evil Bob Denard and his gang  the lower court in Paris has corroborated once again the fact that aggression did take place and that heinous crimes were committed by the new  faithless and lawless crusaders for imperialism.110.	Scarcely a few weeks ago  there was a wide-scale military intervention organized by a certain European Power in an African country. One puppet was replaced by another crowned valet. All of this makes us realize the searing reality of the problem of military aggression  whether overt or disguised  which is being directed against our countries. In the face of these new threats to international security  to peace  stability and independence  the conclusions of the historic Week of Solidarity with the Colonial Peoples of Southern Africa Fighting for Freedom  Independence and Equal Rights and of the International Conference on Mercenaries which was held at Cotonou from 9 to 16 January 1978 deserve the careful consideration of our Organization and the complete support of the international community. And  as our great comrade-in-arms  President Mathieu Kerekou  said at the Conference:""The mobilization of international opinion against mercenaries  intervention and imperialist aggression is the only way to ensure that a latter-day gunboat policy will not be institutionalized and enforced in an atmosphere of general and unpardonable indifference.""Representatives of the heroic Sandinists  of the new Iran and of militant Grenada seated here in this Assembly. Revolutionary and peaceful Benin is proud to be here. We will dare to win  and we will dare to pursue our revolution  for that is our duty.112.	The many difficulties  traps and pitfalls which have been planted by international imperialism  their fundamental hostilityâwhich is  after all  logicalâwill not divert us from our heroic and just course. We know that we are the majority of the peoples of the earth and of the men of progress  as was proved at the last Conference of non-aligned countries at Havana  as exalted a gathering as one is ever likely to see in history.113.	I hope that I have explained the position of my country in as clear a manner as Members would wish.114.	For us in the People's Republic of Benin  the sighs of frustration  the procrastination and the wishful thinking  must cease if historic policy and the force of action are to make of our Organization a genuine instrument for the liberation of peoples and free understanding among nations and a great cross-roads of peace and friendship which the drafters of the Charter wished to create.115.	We are ready for revolution. The fight goes on."
"10",571,"BFA",34,1979,"ï»¿Upper Volta  through me  wishes to express its great satisfaction  Mr. President  at seeing you presiding over this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. In your capacity as Permanent Representative of the United Republic of Tanzania  you have ably defended the cause of the liberation of peoples and the establishment of a new international economic order. We have no doubt that  as President of the General Assembly  you will prove able to conduct our debates with equity and justice.219.	Allow me to associate in this tribute the President of the thirty-third session  who conducted our proceedings to the satisfaction of all.220.	I also wish to pay a tribute to the work of our Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  who has shown he is able to dedicate himself with equal success both to the protection of peace and international security and to the many-faceted cause of the third world. Upper Volta wishes to convey to him its full appreciation of the fact that he is so constantly available and to thank him for the courageous decisions he has taken.221.	Our Assembly has just been enriched by the ad-mission of Saint Lucia as a Member. I wish to welcome it here on behalf of Upper Volta. There can be no doubt that the new energy it will bring to our Organization will prove a valuable asset to our common quest for peace and progress.222.	In my statement last year I described my country's anxiety about the crises through which the world was passing: the economic crisis  the political crisis  the moral crisis. Those who  like us  persist in believing that evolution should bring progress are obliged to note that the worsening of the world situation in the past year is capable of endangering the very existence of the international community. The economic crisis is reaching such a level of sensitivity that anything could happen unless we move without delay to deal the cards again on a basis that is more reasonable  if not more just.223.	The present session is of particular importance  because it coincides with the end of the Second United Nations Development Decade. This is therefore more than ever the time for stock-taking. We must say this clearly and distinctly: by comparison with the objectives set by the International Development Strategy for the Second Development Decade  we have recorded little progress which would justify satisfaction  and we have little reason for hope. The world economy is just drifting. According to United Nations statistics  in 1978 the growth in world production slowed down very markedly  particularly in the developing countries whose global gross domestic product advanced by only 4 per cent. There is a very striking difference between this rate and the 6 per cent which was recorded in the period 1971 to 1975. At any rate  we are very far from the objective of 6 per cent stipulated by the current Development Decade.224.	The slow pace of economic growth of the least advanced countries is even more dramatic and disturbing. In the case of most of these countries  the average rate of growth of the per capita gross domestic product was below 1 per cent during the period 1976 to 1978. This is indeed a gloomy picture  which makes one even more pessimistic about efforts now being undertaken to formulate a strategy for the third development decade  particularly when one witnesses more and more negative manifestations of international co-operation. In fact  the developing countries have had bitter experience of the lack of understanding and disillusionment that accompany the various negotiations between the North and the Southâor  to paraphrase an eminent modern economist  between the centre and the periphery.225.	It was the same story at the recent United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  and again at the fifth session of UNCTAD  which was held last May in Manila. That session  in which millions of human beings had placed their hopes  constituted crystal-clear proof of what one might call the deterioration of the terms of negotiation. The evasions  almost amounting to outright rejection  employed by our partners  the developed countries  in systematically opposing virtually all our proposals lead us to wonder whether there is still any will to co-operate and  in particular  what future there may be for the attainment of an agreement on a new international economic order.â226.	We are not unaware of the current difficulties of the developed countries. We know that they are confronting an economic recession and an inflationary trend of unprecedented dimensionsâan inflation aggravated still more by monetary disorder and unemployment. We are all the more keenly aware of this in that we have to suffer the consequences  since we depend so much on the economic situation of those countries. It is more than regrettable  at the end of the Second Development Decade  to see the vital interests of three quarters of the world's population being treated as unrealistic and unreasonable.227.	What we are asking for is not the generosity of the richer countries. What we are calling for forcefully is a more just and more equitable distribution of the surplus wealth which the developed countries squander every day in vain pleasures and the frenzied pursuit of futile desires  in the purchase of weapons and other sophisticated arsenals. We are not opposed to the greater growth of the countries which are already economically powerful. We simply ask that this should not have as its consequence further setbacks for peoples that live in conditions on the fringe of the benefits of progress.228.	Need I remind members that the most glaring fact at the close of this century is that more than a quarter of mankind still suffers hunger  malnutrition  illiteracy and disease? Need I emphasize more forcefully that for 800 million people the first priority continues to be the satisfaction of the elementary needs for food and drink  and that for them development is a matter of sheer survival?229.	The food production of the developing countries is growing only at a rate of about 2 per cent  which is half the objective set by the World Food Conference. At the same time  those countries have a population growth of about 2.4 per cent. Statistics show that each year the world's population increases by 70 million. This means that the population of the world will total 6 billion by the end of the century.230.	Even if  as we have seen  the results obtained by world food policy do not yet meet the needs of the developing countries  we must pay a tribute to FAO for its tireless efforts in the field of food aid  and also for its assistance in the sector of agricultural development. These efforts were made notwithstanding its very limited resources. A food strategy should be worked out under the auspices of FAO so that the developing countries will by the end of the century achieve self- sufficiency in food. Such a strategy  in our opinion at least  involves the transfer of agricultural technology to the developing countries and far-reaching action in the sphere of reforestation  environmental planning and development and the rehabilitation of arable land.231.	Anticipating this vast programme  Upper Volta has suggested at previous sessions of the General Assembly the establishment of the United Nations decade of the tree. At the risk of repeating myself  let me reiterate this proposal which  if followed up  as I hope it will be  would help to resolve one of the most awesome problems of the modern ageâhunger  the scourge which degrades mankind and causes the degeneration of our society.232.	Generally speaking  development assistance needs to be reconsidered both in quantity and quality.233.	From the point of view of quantity  development assistance falls far short of the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product  which was decided by common agreement in New Delhi in 1968.  Ten years later  with 0.31 per cent of gross national product for the countries members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and 0.05 per cent for the socialist countries  international development assistance is falling behind. However  the effort made by certain countries  such as the Netherlands and the States of northern Europe  whose official development assistance exceeds the 0.7 per cent target  should be highlighted. Yet the developed world could do even more if it simply agrees to convert a part of the amount allocated for the purchase of weapons to official development assistance. It is estimated that $400 billion are spent annually by the countries of the world on armaments and military expenditure. This is 150 times the total budget of the eight countries of the Sahel  whereas all that would be needed would be one fifth of that amount in order to replant the Sahel area  establish a reforestation programme  provide for the irrigation needs of the eight Sahelian countries in the framework of a policy of food self-sufficiency  bring literacy to all the populations of that sub region  which contains 25 million illiterates  provide for the public-health needs of these countries as a whole  and virtually wipe out unemployment.234.	As for the qualitative level  the forthcoming United Nations development decade should to the extent possible ensure that aid really will promote development. This means that the donors should allow the beneficiaries to set their own priorities because what is good for one is not necessarily good for another. The return on an investment should be measured above all in terms of the well-being of the population concerned.235.	In regard to the third United Nations development decade  since we are at the important stage of preparation for it  I appeal to all those involved in this new gamble on the future  whether they are rich or poor sovereign States  or regional groups or international organizations. Before we embark on this new phase we must learn the lessons of the last two decadesâin other words  to draw a moral from history  as it were. Twenty years ago the international community decided to manage its future and to try to reduce the gap between rich and poor. The objective still remains valid and it must be the basis for the coming decade.236.	In 20 years much has been done and some results are beginning to appear. For example  in the area of public debt in the developing countries there has been a certain amount of relief. At present 11 countries have already converted their debts into grants. Other decisions are expected in this sphere. On the subject of commodity agreements  negotiations have been successful in respect of sugar  olive oil and rubber. Similar results are expected for cocoa and jute. A most encouraging development in this respect was the agreement reached last March on the basic features of the Common Fund  but only after  it is true  some long negotiations. The Common Fund is primarily a victory for the developing countries. It is intended not only to finance commodity stocks for the benefit of the poorer countries  but it continues to be the institution by which those latter countries  in adopting decisions  will carry more weight than they do in other financial organs. However  the few successes which have been achieved in no way diminish the general disappointment which has been felt in regard to international economic relations.237.	Protectionism is re-emerging at a period which is characterized by major economic groupings which claim to be open. Protectionism itself is then added to economic recession to create harmful consequences for the exports of countries with weak markets. The industrial output of the third world  which is already inadequate compared with the objectives agreed upon  is handicapped because it lacks outlets.238.	Trade-balance deficits grow worse from one year to the next. Between 1977 and 1978  for example  the developing countries suffered a further loss of $10 billion in their trade balances  the deficit increasing from $23.5 billion to $34 billion.239.	This is the common lot of the developing countries. But what is one to say when one turns to the fate of the least advantaged among them? There are countries  such as mine  which have grave geographical disadvantages: they are land-locked; they also suffer from the handicaps of history; they were colonized to serve essentially as reservoirs of labour; they have been hard hit by nature; they have suffered natural disasters which are all the more difficult to control in the sense that one does not know within what cycle they belong.240.	The whole world is aware of the situation of the Sahelian countries which have been gravely hit since 1973 by the most severe drought ever  the repercussions of which continue to keep their economy and development in a precarious balance.241.	Our country  Upper Volta  thus expects a great deal from co-operation  both international and regional.242.	We had the good fortune to have the benefit of this flow of solidarity from the international community  whether it be in our capacity as a country of the Sahel or within the framework of efforts made for the benefit of the least developed or geographically disadvantaged countries.243.	The most positive result of these two Decades is the interdependence of inter-State relations which has become evident. Regardless of their political choices  their size or power  whatever their divergence of interests  all States without exception are obliged to cooperate.244.	This coming together of peoples can take place only through fruitful dialogue  a dialogue which takes into account above all the multidimensional nature of manâhis background  his ethics and his social and cultural values. It is only thus that we shall succeed in transforming our national selfishness into world-wide solidarity  a transformation which must  of course  be accompanied by moral uplift. Having understood the need for real solidarity among peoples  Upper Volta  ever since its independence  has resolutely turned to its neighbours to promote with them exemplary regional co-operation of benefit to our different peoples. Accordingly  within the Council of the Entente and the Common African and Mauritanian Organization  and through the implementation of a programme of integrated development of the Liptako-Gourma region and the establishment of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  the West African Economic Community  and the Economic Community of West African States  we are working in a realistic and positive way towards the development of our economies through the maximum use of regional resources.245.	At the national level  my Government  relying on the dynamic forces of the nation and with the help of friendly countries and organs  has drawn up a programme of agricultural development the primary objective of which is self-sufficiency in food by the year2000. The chief means to be used for that purpose are the combat against desertification  the recovery of land in zones infected by onchocerciasis  the improvement of the quality of water and progressive mechanization.246.	To this priority of priorities we have added a policy of breaking out of our land-locked situation by the' construction of roads and railroads. Finally  we have embarked upon a process of economic diversification through the exploitation of our mining resources and the processing of both agricultural and mineral products.247.	All of these efforts stand a chance of success only if they have the benefit of an atmosphere of peace and security  which is the very basis of the United Nations Charter. Yet in that respect we have to note that we have not observed a significant improvement in the international situation and that our world today continues to be marked by the interplay of relations of force and ideological conflicts.248.	The situation in southern Africa  which has frequently been condemned from this rostrum by peoples who cherish justice; the disturbing situation which is developing in the northwest part of the African continent; the internal struggles which are sustained with such damaging effect in certain Statesâthese  inter alia  count among the most disturbing problems for my country  Upper Volta.249.	The Tenth Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries at Lusaka attempted a last- minute rescue of Zimbabwe. We have been following with the greatest interest the proceedings of the London conference which has assembledâaround the United Kingdom  the administering Power responsible for the rebel colonyâRhodesia  the representatives of the racist minority system of the illegal Salisbury Government  and the legitimate representatives of the people of Zimbabwe grouped in the Patriotic Front.250.	We hope that the London conference will make it possible to achieve the ground for understanding among the parties involved so that Zimbabwe will at long last be able to enjoy internal peace in full and complete independence.251.	The situation in Namibia has become intolerable in more than one sense: because the illegal South African occupation is continuing; because the Territory has been serving as a base for the ignominious regime of Pretoria in its murderous attacks launched against the populations of neighbouring African States; and lastly  because this constant challenge to the United Nations is possible only through the complicity of certain States Members of the United Nations.252.	We can say that at long last there is a glimmer of hope now that Namibia  with its proud  intrepid and persevering people  will be able to take its legitimate place in the assembly of nations.253.	We call upon the Western Powers members of the Security Council to show greater political will in finding a definitive solution of this question. We call upon them  in particular  to drop their opposition to the application of Chapter VII of the Charter since all means which have been tried outside that framework have proved to be futile. The Western countries  the main economic and military partners of Pretoria  by refusing to apply sanctions against the racist regime  have enabled it to develop  under the cover of their protection  a military potential which can eventually be used only against independent Africa. The time has come for us to confront them with their responsibilities  because it is thanks to their indulgence that South Africa has always mocked our Organization.254.	All negotiations to bring Pretoria to its senses having failed  what can the international community now do except to apply the relevant sanctions provided for in the Charter? We must denounce any collusion with the system of apartheid  which  despite many resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council  continues arrogantly to prosper and to intensify its repressive efforts against the black population which has now become a foreign population in its own territory and in its own country.255.	The peoples of the Middle East  who endured more than their fair share during the last world war  have since that time known neither peace nor security.256.	The creation of the State of Israel and the armed conflicts which have pitted it against its neighbours are less the source of the ills which have ravaged that region than is the disregard of the rights of the Palestinian people.257.	We believe that all the States of the region have the right to existence and to secure and recognized frontiers.258.	We also feel that the people of Palestine have the right to set up a viable national State. That is the condition essential to the establishment of a lasting peace in the region  just as no just and valid peace can be achieved without the direct involvement of the Palestinian people.259.	Since the end of the Viet Nam war  we have witnessed a re-dealing of the cards in South-East Asia. This process is all the more disturbing in that it involves to the utmost the two neighbouring great Powers.260.	While the political objectives of successive armed interventions  offensives and counter-offensives in that area will be left for the future to reveal  their consequences are already apparent: the dislocation of the economies of the region  the exodus of thousands of men  women and children  and the jeopardizing of individual and collective freedoms in the region.261.	These wanderers  involuntary stars in an unexciting year  provide through their tragedy a striking symbol of the moral crisis of our age.262.	The conscience of mankind cannot fail to be disturbed by the multitude of questions which must be asked  even if few answers are found. And it is here in this forum that these questions must be raised; it is here also that they must be answered.263.	After a third of a century of existence for the United Nations  must we conclude that our Organization has failed in confrontation with the sovereignty of Member States? That sovereignty seems to know no limits  either internally when it brings its weight to bear upon the citizens of the State or abroad  beyond its boundaries  for today  countries large and small set themselves up one by one as policemen  and whether in Asia  Africa or elsewhere  we have helplessly witnessed these interventions which dare not speak their names.264.	Here again we must reaffirm the principles of the Charter and adhere to them tenaciously if we truly want to bring about the triumph of the noble objectives of the United Nations. We must condemn without reservation all Member States which are guilty of subversion and armed aggression against other States.265.	The two super-Powers have just signed the Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. At the same time  they have planned negotiations with a view to concluding an agreement as the outcome of the third round of SALT. Allow a small  peace-loving country to rejoice that a new step forward has been taken in the quest for disarmament. We in Upper Volta believe that the great Powers  in the light of their position in the world and the excessive powers conferred upon them by the United Nations Charter  are accountable to the international community with regard to the achievement of general and complete disarmament. However  in this precise sphere of international peace and security  we of Upper Volta believe in all sincerity that all decisions  to the extent that they concern the existence of mankind as a whole  must be made on the basis of mutual agreement between the great and the small countries  for it is true that the value or credibility of an initiative  suggestion or proposition does not depend solely on the size or economic power of a nation  but on its ability fully to meet the responsibilities that go with its international sovereignty.266.	In Upper Volta  we firmly believe in the need for a common strategy to resolve our common problems. It seems essential  then  that all countries should be fully associated with all discussions which have a bearing on the fate of the world. In view of its practical mission in the search for peace and its multidimensional nature  the United Nations should be the appropriate framework for this.267.	Still on the subject of disarmament  we wish to repeat our position that our African continent must be free of nuclear bases. This is the appropriate place yet again to draw the attention of the countries that co-operate in nuclear matters with the racist regime of Pretoria to the danger to which they are exposing the African continent by enabling South Africa to equip itself with atomic weapons.268.	As responsible people of conscience  we have wanted our continent to be protected from nuclear bar-gaining. What could be more natural than for us to consider any aid to racist South Africa in the nuclear sphere as an unfriendly gesture to the peoples of the continent? We deplore this all the more as the countries concerned are friendly countries which are helping us in our efforts towards economic development.269.	May we dream  may we imagine a better world  in which the selfish interests which now engender the desire for power will yield to the common quest for the well-being of the greatest number?270.	Let me reply on behalf of President Lamizana and of all of Upper Volta  that it would have been impossible to cherish such dreams if it had not been for the wise and edifying words that the Holy Father  His Holiness Pope John Paul II  spoke here before us only a few days ago  words which I am sure will strike a favourable chord with all men of goodwill.271.	As the United Nations advances up the hill  it is our duty to keep it always inclined towards justice and peace: justice for the disinherited and the hungry; justice for the weak; justice for the oppressed and the exploited; and justice for all those who are still fighting for their dignity as free men; peace for our age and for future generations; peace for the rich and for the poor; peace for the suffering; peace in Africa; peace in the Middle East; peace in South-East Asia; and peace for all those who nave faith in the future and in the progress of mankind."
"11",614,"BGD",34,1979,"ï»¿The members of my delegation and I deem it a great privilege to have the opportunity of participating in the deliberations of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We bring to Members the warm greetings of the people of Bangladesh.84.	We are indeed very happy to welcome Saint Lucia as a member of the family of the United Nations. We sincerely hope that the admission of Saint Lucia as a new Member will add to its strength and also to that of the United Nations.85.	Mr. President  on behalf of the Bangladesh delegation and also on my own behalf I offer you our warmest congratulations on your election as the President of this session of the Assembly. Your election to your high office is indeed a tribute to your outstanding personal qualities and wide-ranging experience  as also to your great country  the United Republic of Tanzania  with which Bangladesh has close ties of friendship. We assure you of our fullest co-operation.86.	I should also like to express our deep appreciation to the President of the last session of the Assembly  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  for his valuable contributions. His wise guidance and leadership proved to be of immense benefit to the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.87.	I should like to convey to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our sincere appreciation for his total dedication to upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and his exemplary perseverance in strengthening the United Nations and its organs as an instrument for reducing tension and promoting global peace and stability. We also commend him for his forthright and penetrating report on the world situation during the year under review88.	With the rest of the world  Bangladesh mourns the death of President Houari Boumediene of Algeria and President Agostinho Neto of Angola. As leaders of their respective countries and as dauntless freedom fighters  they have both left a deep imprint on contemporary world history.89.	I should also like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to our sister Members of the United Nations for electing Bangladesh to the Security Council. It has been and will continue to be the endeavour of Bangladesh to justify the confidence thus reposed in it by upholding the objectives and principles of the United Nations Charter and serving the cause of peace  freedom and justice.90.	Total adherence to the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter is to us more than a commitment. It is enshrined in our Constitution. Ever since the admission of Bangladesh as a Member of the United Nations  it has been our consistent effort in concert with the vast majority of the Member States to work for the greater interest of the world community. As a developing country  Bangladesh is fully conscious of the benefit it stands to derive from this world body and also its responsibility in safeguarding the interests of the world community  both political and economic. It is in this spirit that we have always urged that the decision-making process of the United Nations system should be more adequately democratized.91.	From its very inception  Bangladesh has been committed to a non-aligned foreign policy based upon the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  the peaceful coexistence of all States  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  non-use of force and the peaceful settlement of all disputes. As a new emerging nation in this multi-polar world  with its many divergences  we have found the non-aligned movement to be a useful means of steering clear of Power rivalry and the consequent conflicts and controversies  thus ensuring both independence and balance in our foreign policy.92.	Since I had the privilege of speaking before this Assembly last year  Bangladesh has been passing through a quiet and peaceful revolution under the leadership of President Ziaur Rahman. With the election of a Parliament  the nation's sovereign law-making body  on the basis of adult franchise  the country's transition to the democratic process was completed in February last. The restructuring of the administrative services in order to gear them to serve a welfare society  land reforms and decentralization of the Government and the planning machinery  and the mobilization of the people for direct participation in all development efforts are among other revolutionary changes now under way. Following the completion of a two-year approach plan  a five-year development plan within the framework of a 20-year perspective plan will be launched next July. The focus of the strategy of the plan is on the achievement of economic self-sufficiency and the raising of the quality of life of the people  with the top priority assigned to agricultural production and population control. The well-spring of motivation for the rapid political and economic changes in Bangladesh lies in the resolute and determined will of our people to overcome difficulties and move forward along the path of stability and progress.93.	Bangladesh welcomes every effort aimed at advancing the process of detente  the limitation of armaments and the promotion of peaceful coexistence in every part of the world. In the context of these cardinal principles of our foreign policy  Bangladesh has made persistent endeavours in recent years to promote peace and stability in the South Asian region through the creation of a climate of mutual trust  understanding and co-operation  on the basis of respect for sovereign equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Guided by these principles  my Government has endeavoured to promote and expand its friendly and co-operative relations with all peace-loving nations of the world. Tangible progress achieved in that direction can be briefly summarized as follows.94.	An agreement was signed with India to resolve the 25-year-old problem of the sharing of the Ganges waters. Efforts are now under way to evolve a long-term arrangement in this regard to the mutual satisfaction of both countries. Following the agreement with Burma signed in July 1978  the repatriation of nearly 200 000 Burmese refugees is almost completed. Both these agreements are the demonstration of good-neighbourly relations among our countries and contributed to peace and stability in the region. In like manner  efforts were made to promote friendly relations with our other neighbours in the region  such as Nepal  Bhutan  Pakistan  Afghanistan and Sri Lanka; and relations with these countries are growing in strength. Fraternal relations and co-operation with Saudi Arabia  Iran  Iraq  Kuwait  the United Arab Emirates  Turkey and other Islamic States in economic  cultural and other areas were further widened and deepened. As a bridge between South and South-East Asia  Bangladesh has made every effort to strengthen its traditional ties of friendship and co-operation with the countries of South and South-East Asia and the Pacific region. Bangladesh also sought both to expand and to diversify its foreign relations by developing mutually beneficial relationships with other countries of Asia and other continents.95.	The creation of the United Nations in 1945 symbolized the hopes and aspirations of a war-ravaged world for lasting global peace and stability. In the years immediately following the Second World War  the prevailing mood was one of clear optimism and of determination to achieve the twin goals of global peace and progress. The motto was to ""build peace in the minds of the people and banish poverty  disease and illiteracy'. The striking recovery of war-torn Europe and Japan  the resurgence of the nations of the third world and their emergence as independent  sovereign States  advances in science and technology and rapid developments in the means of communication were epoch-making changes on the world scene. As a result  bipolarity was largely replaced by multi-polarity in international relations. The nations of the world became more interdependent than ever before; the specific goals of the majority of our nations were also more well defined.96.	There was  however  a gradual swing in the mood of the nations of the world  throwing up many challenges to the dream of the founding fathers of this world body. Formidable among them are the ideological polarization  the intensification of power rivalry  the escalation of the arms race  the persistence of colonial subjugation and racial discrimination  the widening areas of tension and conflict and  overshadowing all these  the widening gap between the rich and the poor nations.97.	The world of today is evidently in great disarray and is faced with many distressing paradoxes. Armed with its military might  an otherwise small country such as Israel can  with impunity  continue its illegal occupation of the Arab territories and indulge in acts of naked aggression  violence and terrorism in total defiance of international law and the will of the international community. In like manner  racist minorities can continue to flout world opinion and trample upon all canons of justice  morality  freedom and human dignity to prolong their repressive rule over the majority of the population through the brutal use of force  as in Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa. The international community is also a helpless spectator at the frightening escalation of the arms race  although the arsenal which has already been built up by the great Powers is enough to destroy our planet many times over. Tragically enough  this arms race is spreading to engulf other areas of the world  thereby threatening the sovereignty  security and territorial integrity of nations which are either in-adequately armed or totally unarmed. The rule of law is yielding increasingly to international anarchy.98.	The economic scene is equally alarming. Two thirds of the world's population  impoverished by two centuries of colonial exploitation  are in a grim struggle to meet their basic human needs. Ironically enough  the remaining one third  representing the rich industrial nations  are also fighting a hopeless economic battle. In their attempt to preserve an inequitable economic order and protect a life-style based on high consumption  they find themselves in the preposterous situation  on the one hand  of inflation and recession and  on the other  of mounting expenditures for armaments  the rapid depletion of non-renewable resources  the pollution of the environment and growing ecological hazards. While the economic disparity between the two parts of the world continues to widen  both are in a desperate economic situation with inevitable repercussions for the peace and security of the world.99.	It will appear from this brief analysis that the  world is being inexorably driven politically  economically  militarily and morally to a point of catastrophic explosion  which  unless arrested in time  may turn into an all-consuming holocaust. The crisis facing the contemporary world is thus essentially a product of a material and utilitarian system without a moral basis. The ills that plague our world stem not from lack of resources but from lack of a political will to reorder our political and economic system on the foundation of the universal human and moral values.100.	We are clearly standing on the brink of a precipice. We see  however  the stirrings of the world conscience. There is an emerging awareness that the crisis is grave and we must move in concert to overcome it. This is a concern that is shared by the overwhelming majority of nations  cutting across the boundaries of race  religion  geography  politics  economics and ideology and including many nations from the East as well as the West  from the North as well as the South. This new emerging profile of the international community and the trend of its thinking favour the strengthening of the United Nations system for the establishment of the rule of law in international relations and for securing global peace  stability and progress.101.	In our view  many of the challenges and problems posing a threat to peace and security can be resolved through our united action and through the implementation of the United Nations resolutions and decisions.102.	For ages  Moslems  Christians and Jews have lived together in the Middle East. All canons of justice and morality demand the restoration to the Palestinians of their inalienable national rights  including their right to a State of their own. As required by the United Nations resolutions  which Bangladesh has consistently supported  lasting peace can be secured in the Middle East only by the complete withdrawal of Israel from all illegally occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  and the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and the recognition of the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinian people.103.	In like manner  there can be peace in southern Africa only through the transfer of power to the genuine representatives of the people of Zimbabwe and Namibia and the ending of racial discrimination and apartheid in South Africa  We commend the Lusaka initiative and the British efforts and wish for a speedy resolution of the Zimbabwe problem through the transfer of power to the true representatives of the people. We  however  strongly condemn the attempt of the racist minority regime of South Africa to impose a puppet regime in Namibia in contravention of United Nations resolutions  in particular  Security Council resolutions 345 (1976) and 435 (1978). The Bangladesh delegation also denounces the detention and arrest of SWAPO leaders and appeals to all Member States to refrain from recognizing the illegally constituted  so-called ""national assembly"" in Namibia or assisting it in any way.104.	Bangladesh welcomes all efforts towards disarmament  including the recently signed strategic arms limitation treaty. We  however  believe that the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament  provides a good basis for ending the escalation of the arms race. The Final Document of the tenth special session assigns highest priority to nuclear disarmament  together with measures for the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments. That document  along with the programme adopted at the recent meeting of the Disarmament Commission  is a positive step forward and will  we hope  create the necessary atmosphere to induce the superpowers to negotiate with the non-aligned countries for achieving general and complete disarmament.105.	As enjoined by its Constitution  Bangladesh is wedded to general and complete disarmament. It has also consistently advocated the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones as an effective measure of disarmament as well as of non-proliferation. As a token of its commitment to such steps  it has recently signed the Treaty - on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.106.	Bangladesh believes that peace and security would be promoted by the creation of zones of peace in areas like the Indian Ocean  South and South-East Asia  the Mediterranean and so on. It may be noted that Bangladesh participated actively in the recently concluded Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean  held in New York in July last. We hope that the recommendations of the meeting regarding the expansion of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean to include the super-Powers and the major maritime users will facilitate the necessary preparatory work for reaching an international agreement for the maintenance of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.107.	It is the sincere wish of Bangladesh that both communities in Cyprus should live in peace and harmony. We warmly welcome the 10-point agreement reached in May 1979  between the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus under the auspices of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim.  We would appeal to all  both inside and outside Cyprus  to encourage the leaders of the two communities to hold meaningful and constructive discussions leading to a mutually acceptable agreement so that both communities can live with freedom and dignity in a federated Cyprus.108.	We view with concern the unfortunate developments in the South-East Asian region. We sincerely believe that peace can be restored in the region by strict adherence to the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and non-interference in one another's internal affairs. We hope that all foreign troops will be withdrawn from Kampuchea and that conditions will be created to end the conflict there and to enable the people freely to choose a Government without external interference or military presence 109.	As a developing country with a long seaboard  Bangladesh is closely following the prolonged negotiations going on in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We are  however  strongly of the view that the interests of the developing countries should be adequately appreciated and safeguarded. Bangladesh lays special emphasis on the unique problems created by geological and geomorphological factors in some countries and the application of the principle of equity in the solution of such problems.110.	As I earlier observed  the widening disparity between the rich and the poor nations of the world has assumed such an alarming magnitude that economic polarization stands out as the most serious threat to peace and security in the contemporary world. The expectation raised during the initial years of the era following the Second World War that through international co-operation the newly emerging countries could reap the fruits of advances in science and technology  telescope time and attain within decades the level of growth the industrial countries had taken centuries to achieve did not turn out to be true. The level and quality of international co-operation did not match the needs of the developing countries  which also discovered that they did not have free access to the world stock of science and technology or to the world's markets  trade and resources. The development efforts during the last three decades indicate certain constraints embedded in global factors. It has now become more abundantly clear than ever before that the problems of poverty - disease and hunger in the developing countries cannot be effectively resolved as long as those countries remain shackled to an economic order built during the colonial times and designed essentially to subserve the colonial pattern of production and trade. The existing economic system is clearly both unjust and outdated. The inequitable character of this system and the grotesque distortions it produces in the growth pattern are evident from the following illustrative facts.111.	First  the developing countries  particularly the least developed among them  while commanding only one third of the world's resources  have to bear the entire burden of the world's poor numbering over 800 million  over 600 million of whom live in the least developed countries.112.	Secondly  for 1 billion of the world's population  the per capita income remains as low as $150âand is much less in real termsâas compared to the per capita income of over $6 000 for the population of the industrialized countries.113.	Thirdly  the population of the developing countries is over 2 billion but their share of the production of manufactured goods has now declined to 7 per cent.114.	Fourthly  the share of the developing nations in merchandise exports has fallen from 24 per cent of the world total in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1976.115.	Fifthly  the indebtedness of the poorest nations has increased from $29.6 billion in 1970 to $44.6 billion in 1977 and is projected to increase to $64.5 billion by 1985.116.	Sixthly  in 1970 the debt service of the poorest nations accounted for 14.9percent of their exports. It is estimated that this will rise to 17.4 per cent in 1980.117.	Seventhly  measured in real per capita terms  the least developed countries as a group actually recorded a decline between 1970 and 1977 in such key areas as gross domestic production  agricultural production  manufacturing output and import volume.118.	Eighthly  even if the objectives of the projected growth rate in the developing world  as indicated in the last World Bank report "" were to be achieved  some 600 million people would still remain trapped in absolute poverty by the end of the century.119.	Ninthly  in relation to combined gross national product  official development assistance has declined from 0.52 per cent in 1960 to 0.31 per cent in 1977. Ironically enough  there is a net outflow of resources from the poor to the rich countries.120.	Tenthly  prisoners of this anachronistic economic system  the industrialized rich countries are being increasingly driven away from the free-market economy to protectionism  through tariff and non-tariff barriers  in their agonizing struggle against inflation  recession and unemployment and against the paradox of unwelcome deficit for some and surplus for others  with its deleterious effect on the over-all economic situation.121.	Eleventhly  the crisis  grave as it is  is further aggravated by two other crucial problems  namely  energy and food. Though the increased income resulting from the recent rises in oil prices represents no more than an insignificant fraction of the income of the industrialized countries  a disproportionately high burden has been placed on the developing countries  which have been doubly hard hit  having to pay higher prices not only for oil but also for imports from the industrial countries.122.	Food-deficit countries like Bangladesh are faced with the additional dilemma that  though they have the potential for doubling or even trebling their food production through the increased application of the new technology requiring such inputs as fertilizer  irrigation  pesticides and the like  investment in such inputs is growing at a slow pace because of the resource constraint. Owing to the vagaries of nature  they are often faced with food crises and with the unhappy compulsion of diverting part of their scarce resources to meet the food deficit  thus further slowing down the rate of agricultural development. A world food security system is thus an imperative need.123.	The existing economic order is clearly unsuited to contemporary world needs and is ineffective in remedying the malaise of the chronic economic disequilibrium which is detrimental to the interests of both the poor and the rich countries. The restructuring of the existing economic system is  therefore  an imperative in the global interest. It cannot be overstressed that the New International Economic Order aims at raising the quality of life of the peoples all over the world. To say this  however  is not the same as equating the quality of life with a life-style based on wasteful consumption  the predatory depletion of non-renewable resources  the pollution of the human environment and the creation of an ecological imbalance. The restructuring of the existing economic system is  however  imperative  since the search for peace and political stability is bound up intimately with the settlement of the crucial economic issues of our time.124.	The contemporary world economic scene has  however  important implications for the concept of re-structuring the world economic order and the implementation of a new order. The structural changes envisaged in the New International Economic Order will be governed very substantially by the prevailing world political climate. For example  the objectives of the New International Economic Order are likely to become largely vitiated by the continuing escalation of the arms race and its continuing influence on the developing countries. The international economic and political structures are thus interlocked and both profoundly influenced by the values and beliefs of the nations of the world. It is against this backdrop of harsh realities and on the eve of the launching of the third United Nations development decade that my delegation would like to suggest the following programme of action.125.	First  the nations of the world  particularly the great industrial Powers  should undertake a firm political and moral commitment to re-anchor international relations to those human and moral values which inspired and sustained man's undying quest for peace  freedom and progress and to the principles of equality  justice and human dignity which are enshrined in the United Nations Charter.126.	Secondly  the international community should recognize that in the preservation of human rights the most sacred and pressing are the right to life  food  shelter  clothing  health  education and employment and that it is the collective obligation of the international community to ensure the immediate expansion of resources and other support for meeting these basic human needs.127.	Thirdly  there should be a transfer of adequate resources to the developing countries with special attention to the needs of the least developed ones for harnessing their vast human resource for productive employment through support for the creation of jobs  including support for small-scale labour-intensive rural public works projects.128.	Fourthly  there should be a massive supply of inputs for agricultural and rural development  such as fertilizers  pumps and so forth  in order to increase agricultural production.129.	Fifthly  a food security system should be developed with an adequate food reserve built up through contributions from food-surplus countries to help alleviate food crises in food-deficit countries  and special assistance should be given to food-deficit countries to sustain their development efforts.130.	Sixthly  the socio-economic structures should be transformed through decentralization down to the grass-roots level to ensure the widest possible participation of the people in development with emphasis on rural and agrarian development.131.	Seventhly  there should be increasing assistance for projects and programmes which can be executed quickly and progress towards the goal of economic self-sufficiency should be accelerated.132.	Eighthly  the planned strategy should be geared to the productive utilization of women in economic and social development.133.	Ninthly  international policies should be redefined to ensure the transfer of resources in real terms to the developing countries  with the focus placed on the special needs of the least developed ones.134.	Tenthly  there should be increasing economic co-operation among the developing countries with special stress on the investment of the surplus income of the oil-rich countries in joint ventures in the developing countries.135.	Eleventhly  tariff and non-tariff barriers by the industrial countries should be removed and the general system of preferences should be extended beyond 1981 on a non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis to facilitate greater access by developing countries to the world market and world trade.136.	Twelfthly  resources now wasted on unproductive armaments should be diverted to the economic and social development of the third-world countries.137.	Thirteenthly  the resources and capabilities of science and technology should be increasingly applied to productive development efforts in the third-world countries  including pre-disaster planning and the prevention and mitigation of suffering in disaster-prone regions of the world.138.	Fourteenthly  there should be a united determination by the international community to deal with the crucial energy situation with a view to developing economically viable alternative energy sources  evolving an energy-efficient technology and making energy available to the developing countries at concessional prices so as not to impair or retard the pace of their development.139.	Lastly  the full  equitable and effective participation of the developing countries in the formulation and implementation of decisions in all fields of international co-operation should be ensured.140.	I should like to stress once again that adequate provision for meeting basic human needs through the improvement of nutrition  health  housing  education and employment in each of the least developed countries is of paramount importance to the success of any future development plan. Additional resources made available for this purpose would also accelerate economic progress by generating additional employment and income for the rural and urban poor  thus bringing tangible benefits to the poor and subsistence sectors of the population even before the desired structural changes can take place.141.	I should like to conclude on the hopeful note that the nations of the world will unite in their effort to overcome the present political  economic and moral crisis and build a better future for our world. Let us resolve to build on mutual trust and understanding. The available resources and technology are enough to build a world of prosperity for all of us. What is needed is the will of the nations  developed and developing  to cooperate and move in a united endeavour towards this goal  inspired by our shared human heritage."
"12",660,"BGR",34,1979,"ï»¿Sir  permit me  first of all  to express the genuine satisfaction of the Bulgarian delegation at seeing the responsible post of President of the General Assembly this year being entrusted to you  the representative of the friendly United Republic of Tanzania  a worthy son of the African continent and a tireless fighter against colonialism  and one of the most experienced and respected diplomats in the United Nations.42.	It is particularly gratifying for us to note that the recently concluded visit of your President  Mr. Julius Nyerere  to Sofia and his talks with the Chairman of the Council of State  Mr. Todor Zhivkov  were an important incentive for further extending relations between our countries in the interests of peace  co-operation and social progress on earth.43.	I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Lievano  for his devoted efforts at the last session.44.	The Bulgarian delegation would like to welcome the newest Member of our Organization  Saint Lucia  and to wish its people success in their development.45.	We share the profound grief of the Angolan people over the tragic loss they have suffered in the untimely passing of President Agostinho Neto. The Bulgarian people knew and regarded him highly as a committed revolutionary and convinced patriot  a brave fighter against imperialism and colonialism  and a tireless champion of social progress. With his death  Africa has lost a great and worthy son.46.	At present  despite existing difficulties and negative manifestations  detente continues to affirm itself as a durable trend in international relations. Life itself has"" proved that the policy of reducing tensions is the only way completely to remove and ultimately eliminate the danger of a devastating global thermonuclear conflict.47. An exceedingly important step in this respect was the successful talks held between L.I. Brezhnev and President Carter in Vienna  which ended in the signing of the Treaty resulting from the conclusion of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT]  as well as other important instruments  between the Soviet Union and the United States. The SALT Treaty is generally recognized as being the most significant act taken for curbing the nuclear arms race in the period following the Second World War. Once again it has been reaffirmed that even the most complicated problems of international relations can find mutually acceptable solutions when approached with a high sense of responsibility  wisdom  far-sightedness and political realism. We are deeply convinced that the new Treaty can and must become a starting-point for future steps directed towards a genuine reduction of nuclear weapons  and that it will play the role of a catalyst in negotiations on other disarmament issues. It will contribute to a considerable improvement in the general international climate  that is why we hope that this Treaty will be ratified in the very near future  in the interests not only of the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States  out of all mankind as well.48.	World developments unequivocally confirm that detente not only affects East-West relations but constitutes an invaluable achievement of universal significance for all mankind and for progress on our planet. The interests of all nations require that insurmountable barriers be raised against attempts to undermine the process of detente and bring international relations back to the days of the ""cold war"". This need was re-emphasized at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries. The Final Declaration adopted there reaffirmed the desire of the non-aligned countries to rally all forces to preserve peace and security in the world. The People's Republic of Bulgaria highly values the non- aligned movement as an important factor in international affairs and supports its struggle and efforts for the establishment of lasting peace in the world.49.	As a result of the policy of detente  lasting and favourable changes have occurred in the political atmosphere on the European continent. In conformity with the principles and agreements in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  political contacts are being further promoted  economic and cultural co-operation is developing  and the process of mutual acquaintance among European peoples is being broadened. The Madrid meeting of the States which participated in the European Conference is designed to produce further positive changes in the political climate in Europe and the world at large. That meeting must contribute to deepening the process of detente and to strengthening security on the continent.50.	The further affirmation and promotion of the positive trends in Europe requires the implementation of effective practical measures in the field of military detente on the continent. That is precisely the aim of the proposals put forward by the States signatories of the Warsaw Treaty in order to break the deadlock in the Vienna talks on the reduction of armaments and armed forces in Central Europe.51.	To these measures should be added the proposal for the conclusion  among the States attending the European Conference  of a treaty on not being the first to use nuclear and conventional weapons  as well as the proposal for holding a political-level conference with the participation of European countries  the United States and Canada for the purpose of discussing and adopting measures for the strengthening of mutual confidence  the lessening of military confrontation in Europe and the subsequent reduction of the concentrations of armaments and armed forces on the continent.52.	Although we note with satisfaction that these constructive proposals have met with understanding and interest on the part of a number of countries  it is also obvious that tangible progress in military detente on the continent requires joint efforts by all countries concerned. We hope that agreement will be reached in the very near future to proceed in concrete terms towards the solving of these problems.53.	As for the Balkans  we have every reason to be 4 Signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975 satisfied with the considerable positive changes which have occurred in that region. The active and constructive policies of the People's Republic of Bulgaria are aimed at strengthening detente in the Balkans  at reaffirming good-neighbourly relations  friendship and broad  equitable and mutually beneficial co-operation. This is a policy of principle which is consistent and unchanging. It is our desire that the Balkan peninsula be transformed into a region of lasting peace and stability and that we live in an atmosphere of confidence and mutual respect  in close co-operation and friendship with all our neighbours. The Government and people of Bulgaria firmly believe in this noble cause and are working persistently and consistently for its implementation  despite the difficulties resulting from the heritage of history and the complex multifaceted nature of today's realities.54.	The world today is living through a complex and dynamic epoch. It is confronted by many problems which transcend the boundaries and interests of individual States and nations  and which rather concern mankind and are of a world-wide nature. It is these problems that  in our opinion  have the first claim on the attention of the United Nations  not only because they most fully coincide with its international character  but also because they focus upon and comprehend  by their very nature  the necessity for forward movement  and because their proper solution would create the conditions and prerequisites for successfully resolving a number of other international issues.55.	Among global problems a key place is naturally occupied by the reduction  the prevention and  in the final analysis  the complete elimination of the danger of a new world war through the attainment of genuine disarmament  which is a fundamental prerequisite to this. The achievement of this end is important both in itself and also because it paves the way for solving major problems such as overcoming economic underdevelopment in the world  doing away with hunger  developing new sources of energy  eradicating the most dangerous diseases  preserving the environment  conquering the world's oceans and outer space  using the achievements of scientific and technological progress for the benefit of all mankind  awakening the potentially creative forces of the human individual  and pursuing the all-round development of man and human society to its highest point of perfection.56.	This is the direction in which the efforts of the socialist and all peace-loving countries tend.57.	In their declaration of 23 November 1978  the member States of the Warsaw Treaty Organization proposed practical ways for the termination of the arms race. The aim of these proposals is to transfer the question of halting the further qualitative and quantitative increase of armaments and armed forces from the realm of good wishes and resolutions to the sphere of actual practical solutions. In their communique adopted last May in Budapest  the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty reaffirmed the determination of their Governments to carry on the struggle for the attainment of genuine progress in this field. 58.	A central place in disarmament efforts belongs to a range of proposals aimed at the limitation and elimination of nuclear weapons. Such proposals represent a completely logical approach  for the main threat facing the world stems from the increase in nuclear armaments. This approach and clear-cut stand of the socialist countries on this matter are set forth in their proposal submitted to the Committee on Disarmament last February. The primary task now is to begin talks on ending the manufacture of nuclear weapons in all their diversity and on the gradual reduction of nuclear stockpiles  until such weapons are completely removed from the arsenals of States.59.	In the light of the exceptionally complicated nature of the problem of disarmament  negotiations in this field can in our view be facilitated if at the same time  there are continued efforts to strengthen the political guarantees and guarantees under international law for the security of States. That is why we attach such great importance to the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force  which would strengthen confidence among States and provide a strong impetus to the process of genuine disarmament.60.	In emphasizing these issues  the Bulgarian delegation is far from underestimating in any way the other items on the agenda of the current session. We attach particular importance to accelerating work on the drafting of a convention on strengthening guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States  as well as the adoption of measures such as the cessation of all nuclear weapons tests; the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons as well as the destruction of existing stockpiles; the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction and new systems of such weapons; the reduction of military budgets  and so forth.61.	The Committee on Disarmament should take up without delay the drafting of a treaty banning radiological weapons  elements relevant to which are to be found in the draft submitted by the Soviet Union and the United States62.	At the same time  we should like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the importance of universalizing international treaties and agreements concluded in the field of disarmament. We believe that it is imperative for our Organization to make its own timely contribution to the practical solution of this important question.63.	A World Disarmament Conference will play an exceptionally important role in the series of measures directed towards the mobilization of the efforts of States for real disarmament.64.	We welcome the initiative of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic in proposing that the General Assembly should include in its agenda an item entitled ""Adoption of a declaration on international cooperation for the purposes of disarmamentââ  this would undoubtedly contribute to further progress in this field.65.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria also attaches great importance to the conversion of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. That would be an important step towards further strengthening international peace and security and peace on earth.66.	In assessing the present situation in the field of detente  one cannot but take into account also the negative stand and impact of those forces which are opposing the positive developments which have occurred in international relations. For instance  at a moment when there exist genuine conditions for curbing the arms race  new steps are being taken in precisely the opposite direction: to intensify the arms race and to increase military budgets.67.	A further negative factor is the policy of hegemonism  which leads to the undermining of the process of detente  the creation of sources of tension and the provocation of military conflicts. This policy is incompatible with the development of the positive trends in. international life and with the task of  strengthening mutual confidence among nations and the principles of equal rights and the sovereign equality of States.68.	The interests of peace  detente and international co-operation require resolute resistance to the exponents and instigators of this policy of hegemonism  which is so dangerous for mankind.69.	That is why we welcome and fully support the new Soviet proposal for the inclusion in the agenda of an item entitled ""inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"". It is time for hegemonism to be condemned and for effective barriers to be raised against it. We believe that the renunciation of this policy should not only be elevated as a fundamental principle of international relations but should also be embodied in an international agreement.70.	There is no doubt that efforts to ensure a lasting peace in the world are inseparable from the struggle to remove the sources of tension and conflict which exist in various regions of our planet.71.	The security and stability of South-East Asia have been subjected to new trials. The freedom-loving Vietnamese people have been obliged again to defend their inalienable and legitimate rights to a peaceful and independent existence.72.	Socialist Viet Nam  however  which has become a symbol of valour and self-denial in its struggle for independence  has already given a worthy answer to the aggressors. It has also replied to the slanderous campaign which has been whipped up against Viet Nam in connexion with the problem of refugees from IndoChina. That is indeed a serious problem but it must not be used in order to increase tension in that part of the world or to conceal those who are really guilty for the suffering of tens of thousands of people in the region.73.	There is not a shadow of doubt in the opinion of the People's Republic of Bulgaria that the seat of Kampuchea in the United Nations must be occupied by the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and not by those representing the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique  which was overthrown by the Kampuchean people and which imposed a policy of genocide upon its own people for a number of years. We also emphatically object to attempts to have the United Nations interfere in one way or another in the internal affairs of the sovereign People's Republic of Kampuchea.74.	We express our solidarity with the people and Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic in their struggle to protect the independence  territorial integrity and peaceful co-existence of their country.75.	Recent events in the Middle East region have furnished new evidence that the separatist deal between Israel and Egypt does not lead to peace but to an aggravation of the conflict. Attempts to settle the fate of the Palestinian people without their participation have yielded no result whatever. A true lasting and just peace in that region is possible only if Israel withdraws from and liberates all the Arab territories which it has occupied since 1967; if the Palestinian people  headed by their sole and legitimate representative  the PLO  are ensured their right to establish their own State; and if all nations in that area are guaranteed an independent and peaceful existence. That is the only kind of peace which as any future.76.	The Cyprus question still remains open. This problem must be resolved in a peaceful way  as envisaged in the decisions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  while preserving the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus in the interests of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots  and while respecting the non-aligned policy of the Republic of Cyprus in the interest of international peace and security.77.	In recent years  the peoples of a number of countries have scored historical victories in the struggle for national and social liberation from imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and reactionary and Fascist regimes.78.	We welcome the peoples' revolutions in Afghanistan  Nicaragua and other countries  and we wish the nations of those countries success along the road to the construction of a new life.79.	The struggle against colonial domination has entered its final and decisive phase. One of the most acute problems now is to complete the genuine liberation of southern Africa from colonialism  racism and apartheid. At the same time  however  there is an intensification of imperialist and neo-colonialist manoeuvres designed to impose puppet regimes on the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia in order to shield attempts to preserve the economic interests of capitalist monopolies and corporations on a neo- colonialist basis. The People's Republic of Bulgaria condemns those manoeuvres and firmly supports the struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  under the leadership of the Patriotic Front and SWAPO  for genuine freedom and independence.80.	The majority of newly liberated and developing countries continues to suffer from the exploitation of those who formerly exploited them  and particularly from the multinational corporations  which try in every way to preserve the existing machinery of unjust trade and economic relations. We fully support the valid demands of the developing countries for the restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. In the struggle for such a restructuring  the role and importance of the norms and principles of economic co-operation established between the socialist and the developing countries are becoming increasingly emphasized. Those norms and principles based on mutual respect of the rights and interests of all States  emphasize a new approach which is being taken towards the international division of labour  economic exchanges and scientific and technological cooperation. Favourable political and economic conditions exist for the further development of this cooperation. Its realization  however  requires a persistent struggle against all those forces which are opposed to co-operation and unity of action between socialist and developing countries. There is no doubt that the objective advantages and the future will be on the side of those forces which are struggling for independence  equality  stable economic development and social progress.81.	The contribution which the current session will make to solving some of the basic problems facing mankind will be  at the same time  a contribution to achieving those goals which the United Nations has set in proclaiming 1979 as the International Year of the Child. For without detente  without disarmament  without lasting peace and co-operation  and without economic development and social progress  it will be impossible to ensure the kind of present and future which we all desire for children.82.	Children in socialist Bulgaria are the subjects of priority care and attention. They receive the best of everything; they are provided with everything needed for harmonious development and education in a spirit of peace and friendship among nations.83.	Guided by these lofty objectives  Bulgaria initiated and played host to the International Children's Assembly ""Banner of Peace"" that was held last August and was one of the outstanding events held during the International Year of the Child. As the first forum of its kind devoted to children's creativity  and directly linked as it was with mankind's natural quest for continuous creative development and for improving the human individual  the Assembly became a symbol of friendship and solidarity among children of all continents. Under the motto ""Unity  Creativity and Beauty "" the efforts and aspirations of our planet's youngest citizens were united in order to make them the worthiest of creators and better builders of the future. We are deeply convinced that such events open new perspectives and give increased dimension to die noble ideal of solving the over-all range of problems  both present and future  not only of the coming generation  but of the whole of mankind.84.	For four decades  mankind has been spared the nightmare of a world war. There can be no doubt of the contribution the United Nations has made in this respect.85.	Peace and international co-operation are cherished ideals of the Bulgarian people. For the 35 years following the victory of the socialist revolution in Bulgaria  my Government has been pursuing a consistent policy of peace  good-neighbourly relations and co-operation. As Todor Zhivkov  First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Council of State of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  said recently: ""As a Communist Party  as a socialist State  as a nation confidently marching towards its Communist future  we have a hundred reasons to demand peace and to fight for peace in the world  and we have not one single reason to want international tension  distrust  hostility  or 'cold' or 'hot' wars among nations.""86.	That is why the People's Republic of Bulgaria will continue  as it has done heretofore  to make its contribution toward enhancing the role of our world Organization in the common endeavours of nations in order to strengthen peace  promote international cooperation and affirm the progressive processes on our planet.87.	With this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  the United Nations is stepping out of the present decade and is moving on to the next. The manner in which the United Nations upholds and reaffirms its place in international life as a factor that integrates the efforts of States and nations towards the strengthening of international peace will determine the extent to which it will be able effectively to discharge its noble mission. We are confident that it will in fact be able to accomplish this mission in a worthy manner."
"13",705,"BHR",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I have great pleasure on behalf of the State of Bahrain in offering you my sincere congratulations on the occasion of your election as President of the General Assembly at its thirty-fourth session  and in wishing you success in the work of this session. I should also like to thank Mr. Indalecio Lie'vano  the President of the General Assembly during its previous session  for his valuable contribution to the conduct of the work of that session.77.	It is my pleasure to join with other delegations in praising the role played by Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  who deploys his utmost efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations  with patience  ability and strict adherence to the spirit of the Charter.78.	I also welcome the admission of the State of Saint Lucia  as the one hundred and fifty-second Member of the United Nations family.79.	The United Nations has been able to survive for 34 years  to react to international events and to overcome tremendous obstacles that were about to cause its disintegration  including the cold war through which the world lived after the end of the Second World War. It has been able to play a fundamental and effective role in bringing to an end colonial empires in many parts of the world. This Organization and its related agencies have also been able to achieve victories  unprecedented in history  in the fields of technical  technological  economic  cultural  health  food and other types of aid among nations. During this period  the world has seemed to grow smaller by virtue of scientific and technological development  but this has not yet brought the States of the world closer to one another  as relations among States are still fraught with tension and conflict.80.	We meet today in a new session  and on the 24th of this month the United Nations will celebrate its thirty- fourth anniversary. Every year  we meet within the premises of the United Nations to hold meetings  to make successive contacts with each other and to adopt a number of resolutions for the solution of issues and questions which are of importance to the world. To our great regret  the majority of such resolutions are ultimately neglected or forgotten. I should like to refer here to the report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  on the work of the Organization submitted to this session  in which he says:""The past year has been full of uncertainty  tension and conflict. The international scene has never been more complex nor the old concepts of power so diffused. There have been sudden shifts in the political balance and unexpected developments rooted in a variety of forcesâeconomic  political  social and even religious. There is an increasing uneasiness as to the manageability of the affairs  and especially the economic life and social organization  of the planet in circumstances now prevailing. These uncertainties and unforeseen developments affect in different ways the lives and the future of virtually all nations and peoples and give rise to deep-seated feelings of anxiety and frustration  which in turn create a climate favourable to new and unpredictable events.""81.	Therefore  the United Nations has to continue its ceaseless struggle to bridge the gap between its aspirations and its performance in the world of today. Such struggle is  in truth and in fact  tantamount to the fundamental difference between civilization and chaos. It is regrettable that such a gap between the aspirations and the performance of the United Nations still exists. We should therefore do our utmost to narrow such a gap  so as to eliminate the dangers that threaten mankind.82.	We need to reflect  as representatives of States  on the position and real nature of our Organization. If we go through the agenda for this session  we find several questions and issues that are virtually mere repetitions of questions and issues that have now been included in the agenda for more than 10 years and some which have coexisted with this Organization since its inception.83.	The United Nations has adopted resolutions on such matters  but most of those resolutions have not seen the light of day  because of the failure of a minority of Members to comply with the international will and abide by the United Nations Charter. The majority of those resolutions are closely linked to the goals and principles of the United Nations  and aim at serving the best interests of man  promoting equity and justice and establishing security and peace all over the world. This bitter fact leads us to pose the following questions. Are we acting to build a world in which security and peace prevail? Are we acting to establish equitable relations in the world  based on justice  dignity and freedom for all nations and to resist unhealthy relations among States  which tend towards domination  racial discrimination and the practice of persistent aggression against the welfare of other nations? These are merely questions submitted to this Assembly for serious consideration by us all  so that an end may be put to the risks that threaten peace and stability in the world.84.	We should like in this respect to refer to some pressing questions and matters  such as the situation in the Middle East  the issues of racial discrimination and apartheid and the challenges that confront the States of the third world.85.	During last year  events of international importance and significance have occurred one after the otherâevents which have been characterized by tension and recklessness in the relations of States  particularly in the developing world. The third world has been through a period of tension and conflict among its countries. It is regrettable indeed that the third world should have become a dangerous scene for disturbances and bloody clashes among its States. Although tension between the two super-Powers has disappeared or diminished in Europe  it has started to reappear in the third world  where focal-points of tension have been created by the super-Powers and where conflict and rivalry between them have been transferred. It appears that the super-Powers  which agreed to freeze the conflict between them on the European continent  have found fertile ground in the third world on which to increase the momentum of war and rivalry between them and are transforming it into blocs of conflict. The confrontations that are now taking place in Africa and Asia among developing countries are clear proof of the outbreak of a covert third world war between the superpowers.86.	It is regrettable that some States of the third world  which struggled to liquidate colonialism  to resist racism and to defeat political and economic domination  are today waging regional wars to change the legitimate regimes in some other States. It is noted also that the super-Powers have turned to the kindling of conflicts and clashes among the States of the third world  as we can see today in Africa and Asia  instead of to direct intervention  as was their practice in the past. We therefore call upon all the States of the world  Members of this Organization  to abide by the principles of the Charter  particularly the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States.87.	Peace in the Middle East is still a long way off. Israel persists in the policy of aggression and expansionism  which it has followed since the Zionist aggression against the land of Palestine  which was aimed at driving the people of Palestine from their land and depriving them of the right to exercise self- determination. The matter has not stopped at that but has been extended into continuous Israeli aggression against these people and the neighbouring Arab countries  the latest example of which is the aggression against the sister country of Lebanon. Lebanon is still from time to time subjected to brutal aggression by the Israeli forces against sites on which are housed civilian Lebanese and Palestinian refugees. Thus Israel has become the most dangerous racist and expansionist force of this age.88.	The current developments in Lebanon and the increase in tension in that country clearly reveal the expansionist plans of Israel and its attempt to divert attention from its daily practices in the occupied Arab territoriesâpractices such as annexation  occupation  the establishment of settlements and the violation of the human rights of the inhabitants of the occupied territories in breach of and contrary to the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter  the rules of international law and international custom and covenants  which prohibit such practices.89.	The United Nations cannot stand by with its hands folded in the face of such a situation  in which the sovereignty and security of the territory of a Member State is daily subjected to grave violation. The international community is requested to act swiftly to save Lebanon from repeated Israeli aggression  which threatens to destroy its sovereignty and its economy and to drive out its people.90.	Israel could not have adopted such an arrogant stand and. challenged the will of the international community had it not been for the military  economic and political support it receives from some of its allies among Western States. Such support and material and military aid  received annually by Israel  has helped it to perpetuate its aggressive policy and to take measures to change the nature of life in and the geographical characteristics of  the territories it occupied and also to refuse to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations that call upon Israel to withdraw from the Arab territories it occupied and to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.91.	The United Nations resolutions on the situation in the Middle East call for a just settlement of the problem and request Israel to put an end to its occupation and its disregard of the United Nations resolutions on Palestine and the situation in the Middle East. All the appeals and exhortations addressed to Israel by the international community calling upon it to withdraw from all territories occupied since 1967 and to recognize the national rights of the Palestinian people have been met only by disregard on the part of Israel. It continues to disregard them and to pursue its policies of annexation  occupation and establishment of Jewish settlements  and Israel has recently declared that its nationals are permitted to buy Arab land on the West Bank  in violation of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.92.	We have on more than one occasion explained that the Palestine question is at the core of the Middle East dispute and that realization of a just and lasting settlement should conform to the principles of justice and equity and should include the following: first  Israel's withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied since June 1967  including Jerusalem; secondly  recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland and properties and to exercise in peace and freedom their rights to self- determination  independence and national sovereignty  including their right to establish an independent State; thirdly  the participation of the PLO  as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  on an equal footing with all parties to the dispute in the Middle East. This is an indispensable condition in all efforts  deliberations and conferences on the Middle East.93.	I must emphasize here that Arab Jerusalem is part of the occupied Palestine territories and that Israel must withdraw from it completely and unconditionally and restore it to Arab sovereignty and abide by the resolutions adopted in this regard by the General Assembly and the Security Council.94.	In our opinion  such principles constitute the right framework within which a peaceful settlement may be reached  one based on the principles of justice and the rules of international law.95.	Bearing in mind this basic stand  the delegation of the State of Bahrain considers that any agreements that do not include all parties to the dispute will not lead to a durable and just peace and to a peaceful settlement of the dispute in the Middle East. Nor will they be successful unless they take into account the core of the problem  which is the Palestine question  and involve the participation of all parties concerned  including the PLO. Such being our belief  we consider that the Camp David agreements of 1978  and the Washington Treaty of 1979 between the Egyptian Government and Israel do not meet the real requisites of peace in the area since they do not contain the minimum basic principles for the realization of a just settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations  and they do not provide for the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories and for their recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  particularly their right to establish an independent State of their own.96.	The Palestinian people and the Arab States concerned seek peace based on justice  and they would do their utmost to create a climate favourable to its achievement. But it is certain that there will be no peace in the Middle East if the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are excluded  including their right to establish a Palestinian State on Palestinian soil.97.	Therefore we consider that the United Nations is now  more than at any other time  required to stand on the side of fairness and justice and to support the Palestinian people in their unanimous rejection of such agreements and to defeat all settlements or solutions that aim at the liquidation of their cause and infringe upon their inalienable rights. The Palestinian people alone have the right to determine their future  and no agreement concluded behind their backs can be legally valid or binding upon them.98.	We therefore agree with what the Secretary- General of the United Nations has said on the question of the Middle East in his report on the work of the Organizationâthat he considers it ""central to the political  economic and military stability of the world. We submit that the realization of peace in the Middle East is an international responsibility requiring international action to face up to this critical situation in the region so that the conflict may not explode again and lead to terrible results for whose grave consequences the world will be responsible. Among the encouraging signs that mark the awakening of the conscience of the world and which lead to optimism and relief is the increasing attention being paid by the States of the world to the Palestine question and the PLO as a major force in the Middle East conflict whose contribution is indispensable in any serious search for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East.99.	I should here refer to the important speech made by His Majesty King Hussein  King of the sister Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  before this Assembly on 25 September  as it contains a complete and useful analysis by an Arab leader who has lived the problem in all its dimensions. We share His Majesty's opinion that the United Nations is the natural framework for the achievement of the comprehensive settlement of this question that we all seek.100.	The region of southern Africa is passing through a delicate and decisive stage. The developments in that region have been and remain a source of serious concern to the family of nations due to the policies of deceit and procrastination being pursued by the white minority regimes in southern Africa with regard to the transfer of authority to the black majority and the establishment of equality among all the inhabitants there. The efforts of the United Nations to find a peaceful settlement to the question of Namibia have not produced tangible results due to the arrogant attitude of the South African regime and its manoeuvres. Real independence for Namibia cannot be achieved except through free and democratic elections under the auspices of the United Nations in which all national parties concerned may take part  including the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  as the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia  in accordance with United Nations resolutions  particularly Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978).101.	The situation in Zimbabwe has not changed towards democratic rule  as required by United Nations resolutions. The sham elections held last April within the context of the internal settlement have not led to the establishment of black majority rule in Zimbabwe in accordance with United Nations resolutions. In this respect  we hope for success for the discussions in which all the parties concerned are taking part  now taking place in London  to find a peaceful settlement of the question of Zimbabwe and to maintain peace and stability in that region.102. Bahrain would like to reaffirm its support for the struggle of oppressed peoples that yearn for freedom and to condemn the policies of apartheid  which have been denounced by the international community as a crime against humanity as a whole. Bahrain supports the call for continuation of the complete blockade imposed on the racist regimes in southern Africa pursuant to the provisions of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and the application of such sanctions against the racist regime in Israel. It also supports the measures for the isolation of such regimes internationally.103.	As a State in the Gulf region  we attach special importance to the designation of the Indian Ocean and its natural extensions as a zone of peace and stability. Therefore  we supported on various occasions the General Assembly resolution on the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  called for the implementation of the principles contained in that Declaration and requested the Gulf region be kept aloof from the rivalry of the great Powers. We should like to emphasize in this regard that peace and stability in the region are the exclusive concern of the countries of the area  on whose shoulders alone lies the responsibility to protect it  and we declare our complete rejection of any attempt by any party to interfere in the domestic affairs of the region. Therefore  we have called for the establishment of mutual co-operation among the States of the Gulf in the political  economic  cultural and technical fields  on a basis of mutual respect  equality  integrity and non-intervention in domestic affairs  in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.104.	The State of Bahrain has supported the efforts made in various international forums for the establishment of a new international economic order based on justice and equity. We have also explained the need to consider the means to ensure the establishment of such an order. It is regrettable that the various negotiations and the numerous dialogues between the developed and developing countries within the framework of the United Nations and other international forums have not led to tangible progress as a result of the failure of the developed countries to understand the demands made by the developing countries that structural changes be made in international economic relations  which are now based on exploitation. This is what happened at the fifth session of UNCTAD  held in Manila  which did not arrive at tangible results in this respect.105.	Negotiations and dialogue between the North and South are still going on very slowly  although the doors have not been closed to the search for solutions to pending problems. We call in this regard on developed countries to reconsider their stand so that the negotiations may be completed. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly due to be held in 1980 will be able to review the implementation of the new international economic order in the light of the resolutions passed by the United Nations General Assembly at its sixth and seventh special sessions. We hope  too  that the mistakes made in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade will be avoided as the United Nations General Assembly comes to adopt in the forthcoming special session the new international development strategy.106.	The United Nations has proved over more than three decades its ability to accommodate States from all parts of the world irrespective of their political  social or economic systems. This international Organization has been able to find suitable solutions to many crises  conflicts and challenges which confront humanity in a world whose conditions increase in complexity day by day. We hope that this Assembly will discharge its responsibilities and pass suitable resolutions to promote justice and equity and to eliminate the oppression and injustice suffered by oppressed peoples yearning for freedom and independence  and that it will act to establish a political and economic system in international relations based on equality  justice and equity. This has to be done if we wish indeed to meet the great expectations that peoples all over the world place in our Organization."
"14",815,"BLR",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of the Byelorussian SSRI wish to convey our sincere congratulations to the people  the Government and the Socialist Unity Party of the German Democratic Republic  and to that country's delegation to this session of the Assembly on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the foundation of their State. The celebration of this important anniversary and the ceremonial meeting in Berlin have been clear manifestations of the peace-loving aspirations of the countries of the socialist commonwealth and a striking demonstration of the advantages of the socialist social system.105.	The international situation in which the thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly is meeting and working is  in principle favourable to the cause of peace and progress  but it is marked at the same time by considerable complications. There is a good deal that is positive in it which coincides with the aspirations of the peoples  but we cannot fail to see also that contrary phenomena are still powerful. The world has not yet rid itself of the propaganda and threat of war  or of social injustice and hegemonistic ambitions. The picture of the international situation is made up of the real policies of States and if  in analysing it  one identifies the most important and fundamental elements  the essence of the problem lies in whether any given State makes as the corner-stone of its foreign policy the task of strengthening international peace and security  or whether it prefers to aim for other goals which may not only fall short of the interests of peace  but may actually oppose them.106.	As everyone knows the States of the socialist community have made the corner-stone of their foreign policy the prevention of a new world war  the creation of conditions for national liberation and social progress in the world in an atmosphere of international peace and security. The Lenin policy of peace  co-operation and friendship among peoples  which they have pursued unswervingly  reflects the essence of the socialist system and its genuinely democratic character. It is dictated by the interests of the broad masses of the workers and is in keeping with the aspirations of all the peoples of the world.107.	In putting into effect the programme of peace which was proclaimed at the Twenty-fourth Congress of our Leninist Party and developed at its Twenty-fifth Congress  the Soviet State  together with other countries of the socialist community  has achieved major foreign policy successes which have had a most profound and fruitful effect on the whole of contemporary international life. As was stressed by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Comrade L.I. Brezhnev  the Soviet nation is doing everything in its power:"" . . .to develop co-operation with the forces of peace  freedom and progress  to thwart the schemes of aggressive circles and to defend and deepen inter-national detente"".108.	The foreign policies of the USSR and other States of the socialist community are imbued with a sincere concern for strengthening trust and co-operation among States with differing social systems. These policies are linked with the positive changes which have occurred in international life and which together constitute international detente. We are firmly convinced that success in the liberation struggles of the peoples of the world  the struggle against social injustice  reaction and anything which prevents the peoples of the world from marching forward on the road of progress can only strengthen detente.109.	The Byelorussian people  like all the peoples of the Soviet State  with its many millions of inhabitants  is consistent in its support of the idea that the process of detente should become irreversible and that its benefits should be enjoyed by the peoples of the whole world. Together with all the States of the socialist community we shall continue firmly and purposefully to light for this goal.110.	A truly historic landmark in the development of detente and a considerable achievement in the struggle to curb the arms race and strengthen international peace and security was the signing of the Treaty between the USSR and the United States on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Weapons. In order to consolidate this achievement it is necessary that the Treaty be ratified without any artificial delays. The SALT Treaty  which provides for restraining the growth of the strategic potentials of the two great Powers  opens up the possibility of more radical steps aimed at real disarmament and the reduction of the danger of a new war.111.	Of great importance to the cause of peace are the positive changes which have occurred in recent years in Europe  as reflected in the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. But political detente must develop farther in the form of military detente. This end would be served by the conclusion by the States which participated in the Helsinki Conference of a treaty renouncing the first use of nuclear or conventional weapons against one another  as well as by the convening  at the political level  of a conference on strengthening confidence among States  lessening the threat of military confrontation  and reducing the concentration of armed forces and armaments in Europe.112.	As far as the States of the socialist community are concerned  they have shown goodwill and readiness  constantly and in concrete terms  to build a lasting edifice of peace together with other peoples and to do everything in their power to promote the development of international co-operation. This is demonstrated by the striking and meaningful statement made at this session by Comrade Andrei A. Gromyko  member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR  as well as by the statements of the heads of delegations of other fraternal socialist countries. The same goal is sought by the decisions of the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  held at Moscow on 23 November 1978  and of the Committee of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  which met on 14 and 15 May 1979 in Budapest. We must also point out the very constructive initiatives and proposals of the socialist countries put forward at the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe; these open up real prospects for the achievement of an agreement based on strict observance of the principle of the undiminished security of any of the parties to the agreement.113.	At the current session of the United Nations General Assembly  the Soviet Union has proposed for consideration by the Assembly  a very topical and important item: ""Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations''. The amount of grief and suffering which the policy of hegemonism has brought to mankind in the past is well known. We have seen the colonial empires  wars of aggression aimed at the conquest of the territory of other States  and numerous attempts at domination and the subjugation of one State or people to another  such a policy has always intensified international tension  has destabilized the international situation and has been a source of armed conflicts. But it is particularly dangerous today  given the availability and growth of the means of mass annihilation and destruction. Therefore  we must resolutely condemn the policy of hegemonism in all its forms and  on the basis of the principle of the sovereign equality of States and of the purposes and principles of the United Nations  declare  on behalf of the peoples of the United Nations  that never  under any circumstances  or for any reason whatever  shall any State or groups of States be allowed to make a bid for hegemony m international affairs or to seek a position of domination either in the world as a whole or in any of its regions.114.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR calls upon all States Members of the United Nations actively to support the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet Union in document A/34/243 on the inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations.â115.	We  the Soviet people  sincerely rejoice that more and more peoples around the globe have thrown off the yoke of colonialism and oppression and are building a new life. They all have a profound interest in multiplying the fruits of their creative labours in conditions of peace and progress. We welcome the consolidation of the authority of these States in the world arena and their active struggle for the triumph of the ideals of peace and freedom  a struggle against colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism  imperialism and reaction. They are conducting this struggle  inter alia  in the United Nations and other international organizations  and in the non-aligned movement  whose Sixth Conference recently came to a successful close in Havana and made a weighty contribution to the strengthening of international peace and security  to the struggle against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and apartheid and to the consolidation of the political and economic independence of the liberated countries.116.	But among all these positive factors  it is impossible not to see something different: the most reactionary forces of imperialism  the manufacturers of armaments  the militarists  champions of the ""cold war"" and their hirelings and yes men are not slackening their criminal efforts against detente and disarmament and against the liberation struggle of the peoples of the world. They demand more and more billions in expenditures for military purposes and for the creation of ever more destructive and barbarous weapons and they are striving to deploy these weapons on the territory of other States. The States members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  in the 30 years of its existence  have increased their military expenditure tenfold and are continuing to intensify the arms race. Reactionary circles are making attempts to put an end by force to the liberation struggle of the peoples and to interfere in the internal affairs of other States. Aggression has been committed against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  provocations continue against the countries of South-East Asia and territorial claims are being made against other States. Israel's aggressive actions continue in the Middle East and the Western monopolistic circles continue to attempt to preserve  by various manoeuvres  the racist regimes in southern Africa. All of this constitutes a serious danger of war.117.	In this situation there is no more important task than to unite the efforts of all forces of peace  freedom and progress with a view to curbing the aggressors resolutely  curtailing the arms race  expanding and deepening international detente  supplementing political detente with military detente and ensuring the right of all peoples to free and independent development.118.	It is necessary to seek new effective solutions  including those within the framework of the United Nations  to stop the arms race  first of all the nuclear arms race  and to reverse it. In this connexion  the proposal of the Soviet Union on the cessation of the production of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of stockpiles of them until they have been completely liquidated is of special importance. The socialist countries recently submitted in the Committee on Disarmament a proposal on the start of negotiations with regard to this problem  and the United Nations General Assembly should pronounce itself in favour of making this work more active.119.	The Byelorussian SSR is in favour of the conclusion  on the basis of the draft of the Soviet Union  of an international convention on the non-use of nuclear weapons against those States which have renounced the production and acquisition of nuclear weapons and do not have them on their territory  and is also in favour of reaching an agreement on the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of States where there are no such weapons at present. The proposal of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic entitled' 'Adoption of a declaration on international co-operation for disarmament"" is very timely and topical.120.	We should note with satisfaction the progress made in the work of the Committee on Disarmament  in which the USSR and the United States have submitted a joint agreed proposal on the basic elements of a treaty on the prohibition of the development  production  stockpiling and use of radiological weapons. And all the necessary prerequisites exist for the successful completion of the negotiations between the USSR  the United States and the United Kingdom on the treaty on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear- weapons tests. The Soviet-American negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons are going on. However  there are difficulties standing in the way of progress in these negotiations  and these are difficulties of an artificial character. It goes without saying that it is not the erection of artificial obstacles in these negotiations but the attainment of mutually acceptable agreements on these questions that would constitute a substantial contribution to the limitation of the arms race.121.	The need  to work out and to conclude as soon as possible a world treaty on the non-use of force in inter-national relations continues to be exceedingly important.122.	The ensuring of lasting peace and the security of peoples presupposes the need to eliminate existing hotbeds of tension. While confirming our well-known position on the question of Cyprus and on the need for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of South Korea  we should like to draw attention to the problem of the Middle East. The situation in that region as recently become more complicated and more dangerous as a result of the conclusion under the aegis of the United States of a separate Israeli-Egyptian treaty. Any attempts to present this treaty as a kind of ""first step"" in the cause of a settlement in the Middle East should not mislead anyone. It is not a ""settlement"" but an imposed collusion aimed at barring the Arab people of Palestine from exercising their legitimate national rights and at consolidating the Israeli occupation of a part of the Arab lands  encouraging the aggressor and instigating Israel to new aggressive actions against the Arab peoples. Recent events in the Middle East indisputably confirm such a conclusion.123.	The only way to establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East is through a comprehensive settlement with the participation of all parties concerned  including the PLO  a settlement which would make it possible for the lands conquered from the Arab countries in 1967 to be returned to them  for the Arab people of Palestine to exercise their right to self-determination and the creation of their own independent State  and for all the peoples and countries of this region to enjoy their guaranteed right to a secure existence and development.124.	The Byelorussian SSR wishes to express its solidarity with all peoples which have become the victims of imperialist pressures. We categorically condemn expansionism in the policy of China and confirm our full support for the peoples of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea in their just struggle for the protection of their freedom and independence. The recent aggression of China against Viet Nam and its threats to take up arms again to teach Viet Nam ""a second lesson""âall this constitutes a threat to peace and security in Asia and throughout the world.125.	Our time is one of profound social transformations in many countries of the world. In Asia  Africa and Latin America the peoples seek to be the masters of their own destinies; and when tyrannical and pro- imperialist regimes fall  as happened recently in Afghanistan  Kampuchea  Iran and Nicaragua  this is a victory for both the peoples who suffered from the oppression of such regimes and  ultimately  the cause of peace and progress of all mankind.126.	The United Nations must take into account the realities of today. We fully support the legitimate right of the People's Revolutionary Council of the People's Republic of Kampuchea to represent in the United Nations and in other international organizations the Kampuchean people  who rid themselves of the clique of barbarians that had exterminated 3 million Kampucheans to please alien interests. We shall continue an active struggle in this matter  and we are confident that they will find a just solution.127.	The just struggle which the peoples of Africa  supported by the progressive forces of the world  are waging for the full and complete elimination of the vestiges of colonialism  racism and apartheid has entered a final phase. The formation of a free Africa is taking place in conditions of acute confrontation between the forces of national liberation and progress and the forces of imperialism and reaction  which seek to impede this irreversible process and even to launch a counter-attack. This is evidenced by the situation which has evolved in southern Africa  where the racists  supported by imperialist circles  are undertaking desperate efforts to break the will to victory of the patriots of Zimbabwe and Namibia and thus to maintain that region as a preserve of racism and oppression  as well as a bridge-head menacing independent Africa.128.	The Byelorussian SSR has consistently supported the immediate exercise of the inalienable rights of the peoples of southern Africa to self-determination and independence; the transfer of all power to the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia and their authentic representatives  the Patriotic Front and SWAPO; and the eradication of the shameful system of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. We resolutely condemn the manoeuvres of the neo-colonialists in southern Africa and the aggressive actions of the racists against the forces of national liberation and against neighbouring independent countries; and we support the demands for the application to the racist regimes of effective and comprehensive international sanctions in accordance with the United Nations Charter. We condemn the intrigues of the forces of imperialism and reaction  which aim at sowing discord and conflict among the peoples of independent Africa and hampering the exercise of the will of those peoples to build their relations on the basis of mutual respect for independence  territorial integrity and historically formed borders.129.	The solution of the problem of reducing the danger of war and bringing about disarmamentâthe most global problem of our timesâis a prerequisite for the solution of problems facing mankind  including the problem of development. This would create the material guarantees for a peaceful future for all the peoples of the world and would make it possible to divert funds released by the reduction in military budgets to the needs of economic development and to social and cultural progress.130.	The struggle by the developing countries to strengthen their national independence from imperialism  to ensure their economic independence and to let the peoples of the world enjoy the real results of their national independence acquires an ever broader scope and deeper character. The key to overcoming the age-old backwardness of these countries lies in radical social and economic reforms which would release a tremendous amount of collective energy from their peoples. This truth is confirmed by the fact that a growing number of the developing countries are choosing the progressive path to development and are carrying out fundamental social and economic reforms and are achieving tangible results in their development.131.	As far as equitable international economic co-operation is concerned  an important role should be played by a further restructuring of international economic relations on a just and democratic basis. The fundamental principles of such a restructuring are provided for in such important decisions of the General Assembly as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.132.	However  although quite some time has elapsed since the adoption of these decisions  their provisions remain unfulfilled  due to the policies of monopolistic circles in the capitalist countries  which continue to pursue a neo-colonialist course  perpetuating and intensifying their exploitation of the developing countries and maintaining their privileges in international economic relations. The so-called assistance by the West to the developing countries still constitutes but a fragment of the profits  interests and dividends earned by the capitalist monopolies through the exploitation of the developing countries and dependent peoples.133.	The Byelorussian SSR unswervingly supports the normalization of commercial and economic relations  the removal of all forms and manifestations of exploitation  discrimination and diktat and the establishment of genuinely equitable and mutually beneficial relations among States with strict observance of the principle of non-interference in one another's internal affairs.134.	The activities of the States members of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance [CMEA] are a model for such co-operation. In three decades of co-operation  the CMEA member States  through the heroic and relentless toil of their peoples and in spite of the losses and destruction of the Second World War  have increased the volume of their industrial production by 17 times and have approximately tripled their gross agricultural production. Only one tenth of the world population live in the CMEA countries  but they smelt nearly every third ton of steel produced in the world  produce two out of every five tons of mineral fertilizer  manufacture more than one quarter of metal- working equipment and build approximately as many apartments as the ""Common Market"" countries and the United States together. Through assistance by the CMEA member States  about 4 000 projects have been or are being built in the developing countries: iron and steel plants with a total output of 30 million tons of steel a year; electric power stations with a total output of 16 million kilowatts; about 1 million graduate engineers  technicians and other specialists have been trained. The foreign trade turnover of the CMEA countries with the developing countries increased more than 40 times from 1950 to 1977.135.	This year  1979  is the International Year of the Child. This is widely celebrated in our Republic where  as a result of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the construction of a developed socialist society  the rising generation is being given the best that people can have and the children are surrounded by constant care; in our society every person can rest assured about the future of his children.136.	We support activities within the framework of the International Year of the Child in the defence of the children of the whole world from suffering and sorrow  racial discrimination and exploitation  misery and war. The right of children of all peoples to a happy and joyous childhood must be guaranteed.137.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR attaches great importance to the development of international co-operation in encouraging respect for human rights. This co-operation should be brought about primarily through the participation by all States in existing international conventions and covenants in the human rights field and in their implementation. These are the International Covenants on Human Rights  the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination  the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and others.138.	This co-operation should also be brought about through the resolute struggle by the international community  including the United Nations  against the flagrant and massive violations of human rights which are occurring today in southern Africa  in the Arab territories occupied by Israel  in Chile and in all other places where the imperialists and their henchmen are violating basic human rights.139.	Co-operation in encouraging respect for human rights should not be used as an opportunity for interference in the internal affairs of other States or for the incitement of hostility and hatred towards other peoples. Co-operation in this field cannot be facilitated by proposals to change the structure and powers of the bodies in the human rights field formed within the framework of the United Nations or by attempts to create any supranational bodies.140.	The Byelorussian SSR favours strengthening the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security and in the development of international co-operation in various fields by means of the strictest observance of its Charter  and we cannot support proposals for the revision of this Charter  wherever they come from and under whatever pretext they are made.141.	The peoples of the world want secure and irreversible peace  a peace open to broad international co-operation in the name of progress. ""For peace""  as was stressed by Comrade L.I. Brezhnev  ""is life and progress  the prospect of a happy futureâchildren's joyful laughter and smilesâa kind and generous sun over our blue planet"" 142.	To justify these hopes of peoples  to promote the deepening of detente  to search for ways and means of solving the problems of halting the arms race and bringing about disarmament  to contribute to the settlement of urgent international problems  to develop inter-national co-operationâherein  we are deeply convinced  lies the high duty of the United Nations  and the current session of the General Assembly is in duty bound to make its weighty contribution to this noble cause."
"15",897,"BOL",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is a unique privilege for me to be here at this rostrum from which outstanding personalities  Heads of Government and State from all parts of the world  have spoken.81.	I am pleased to be the spokesman for the constitutional President of Bolivia  Mr. Walter Guevara Arze  one of the Bolivians most closely linked with the United Nations and therefore well aware of what this institution means for the maintenance of peace.82.	The presence of Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim as President of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly has a dual and special meaning. First  as a worthy representative of Africa  he confirms the vigorous participation of that continent in the destiny of the United Nations. His country  the United Republic of Tanzania  has been acting with its own personality at the regional level. Secondly  Mr. Salim has been one of the outstanding factors in the struggle for decolonization as well as in the struggle to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination. As we welcome in your person the revitalizing action of the African continent  I should like to express to you  together with the full solidarity of the Government and people of Bolivia with the struggle being waged by the African countries  our satisfaction at seeing you occupy this high post. We must recognize  however  that in your case it is no more than an act of justice  the consequence of a long struggle lasting more than 10 years in favour of all the noble causes defended by our Organization.83.	My delegation also wishes to pay a tribute of appreciation to the former President  Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre  who guided the work of the General Assembly with the skill  sagacity and distinction typical of an outstanding politician and diplomat.84.	The selfless work of the Secretary-General  Mr  Kurt Waldheim  in the delicate tasks entrusted to his responsibility  has won for him our most sincere gratitude.85.	The delegation of Bolivia  on its own behalf and on behalf of the nations of Latin America  has already welcomed the most recent State Member of the United Nations. Now that Saint Lucia occupies its seat in the General Assembly  I should like to repeat my congratulations on its admission to membership. I am sure that Saint Lucia will finally be able to overcome the dead weight of its feudal past and join the efforts of the third world in trying to achieve a better destiny for its people.86.	The year 1979 is a special year in the history of ray country. It is now 100 years that it has been geographically land-locked and the country has returned to constitutional rule after 10 years of de facto governments. On these matters there is a genuine national consensus which is expressed in the unswerving will to recover our sovereign access to the sea and to consolidate freedom and democracy in our country.87.	One hundred years ago today  8 October  on the bridge of the warship Huascar the Peruvian Admiral Miguel Grau made history in the battle waged in the Bolivian waters off Angamos during the Pacific war. In a respectful tribute to Eduardo Abaroa and the heroes who defended the countries victims of aggression  I should like to express a few thoughts on the consequences for the continent left by that unjust and unjustified conflict.88.	Upon leaving Bolivia  Marshal Antonio Jose de Sucre  Bolivia's chief deputy  and one of the founding fathers of the American countries  left a written message which anticipated what would be the main task of the fledgling Republic. He said:""I shall ask from the nation yet another recompenseâto keep up the work I have started and maintain the integrity and independence of Bolivia against all dangers.""89.	The difficulties that were encountered in the implementation of that message and the consolidation of the national State of Bolivia will be better understood if we look at its geographical position at the centre of the continent  where the Amazon  Plata and Pacific basins join. It is a point of continental fulcrum  which accordingly takes up and absorbs the tensions resulting from the conjunction of those powerful forces. Its problems will be understood more clearly if we recall that the original territory of the Republic was twice its present size and that various military and diplomatic actions redrew the map of South America at my country's expense.90.	All that is part of history  and I mention it here only to highlight Bolivia's difficult struggle and its role as a State of regional balance. All that is part of history  except one point: the geographical land-enclosed status of my country. And when in this lofty forum I raise this matter and present it seriously and forcefully  I am aware that it is a present reality  a permanent factor of concern.91.	Indeed  the seizure of my country's extensive coastline was not only the result of an unjust war of conquest but also an immense and fatal historical mistake. It is true that it solved the economic problems of the aggressor country  which for a century exploited the nitrate and mining wealth of Bolivian soil  but it is also true that it destroyed the regional balance  which has still not been restored  giving rise to a state of tension demonstrated by the arms race taking place in the region. What is more  it limited the possibilities for co-operation and understanding among our nations by affecting the role of link and bridge which my country must play in the region.92.	By nature and compulsion Bolivia gravitates towards the Pacific Ocean  and this found expression geographically and physically in its undisputed possession of an extensive coastline on that ocean. The act of aggression which destroyed that natural relationship must be corrected as soon as possible. This is not only a requirement of Bolivia; it is a genuine continental need. It is an act of international justice  but it is also a precautionary yardstick for measuring regional peace and security. In a word  it is an American cause.93.	Furthermore  the complete solidarity of the countries of America and the world is being expressed in ever more categorical terms not only as to the justice of our claim but also as to the urgency of settling it. To mention the most recent demonstration of this  there is the declaration of two thirds of mankind. At the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held in Havana from 3 to 9 September 1979  the following text  whose clarity dispenses me from further comments  was adopted:""The Heads of State or Government  meeting in Havana  gave their backing to the Republic of Bolivia's just and legitimate claim to recover its outlet to the Pacific Ocean with full sovereignty and invited the member States of the international community to declare their solidarity with this inalienable right of the Bolivian people. They also reaffirmed that constructive and fruitful security and peace in America demand a solution to the problem and accordingly supported all efforts to achieve that noble aim and the peaceful procedures set forth in the Charter of the United Nations."" 94.	Furthermore  the entry into force of the Torrijos- Carter Treaties on the Panama Canal   which we had the honour and joy of witnessing a few days ago in Panama  proves that in the end justice does prevail over force  that victory does not confer right  that recourse to violence cannot consolidate territorial annexations  and that there is a way for the peaceful settlement of disputes when international public opinion supports and promotes just causes.95.	Bolivia has recovered its status as a democratic country respectful of human rights  freedom of expression  freedom of political organization and freedom of trade-union movements. We have set up a Government reflecting the will of the people expressed in free elections. There are no political detainees  nor has any Bolivian been expelled from his country.96.	What is said here in a few words is the result of a long and painful process. It is a national victory  to which civilians  the military  intellectuals and workers have contributed. It is  as I have said  the result of a national consensus  which  nevertheless  faces very difficult challenges before it can be finally consolidated.97.	Foremost among these obstacles are economic problems  which are aggravated by external factors. Among these factors  I am bound to mention the bill now before the United States Congress authorizing the placing on the international market of 35 000 tons of tin from its non-commercial strategic reserves. If such a measure were to be adoptedâa measure which would constitute an act of real economic aggressionâBolivia would suffer a most serious blow at a time when we are studying corrective measures to stimulate our economy  which is based essentially on the working of this mineral  representing more than 60 per cent of the total value of our exports.98.	The background of this problem will help place it in its proper perspective. During the Second World War Bolivia contributed to the defence and consolidation of democracy by supplying tin at prices subsidized by its people. At the end of the war much of the tin ac-cumulated by the United States of America was designated as a âstrategic reserve ""  which by public law was intended to meet civilian and military needs in case of war. It is curious and paradoxical to note that the very tin which should be used in case of war is in time of peace being used to upset the conditions of the market for that scarce material and threaten the stability of the democratic process recently initiated in Bolivia.99.	The effects of a drop in the price of tin in the economy and social structure of Bolivia would be profound and irreparable. I shall mention only a few. It is estimated that the per capita income would fall by $30 from a current figure of approximately $600 a year and that there would be a decrease in private and public investment in mining and a further decline in the productivity of that sector. It would be more difficult to develop and introduce more appropriate technologies for the operation of existing mines. Finally  production costs would continue to rise because of price inflation for imported goods and there would be more intensive exploitation of internal production factors  especially cheap labour.100.	What would the United States stand to gain in exchange? Nothing. The economic and trade advantages of such a decision are imperceptible for a powerful country and bear no relation to what the political cost would be. It would only result in building up resentment and discredit for a political opening which in its time aroused hopes among the nations of the third world.101.	Such practices  such manipulation of markets obviously do not contribute to the full enjoyment of human rights. They are not a forward step in the construction of a new international economic order. The countries members of the Latin American Economic System understand this. This was expressed by the tin- producing countries at their meeting at Djakarta in July of this year.  This is the conviction expressed by the Presidents of the Andean group of States  who have now in Panama approved a stance of active solidarity with the just claim of Bolivia.102.	Because of such precedents  I should like to appeal for the understanding of all delegations here present in order that they may continue to give their firmest support to the position adopted by Bolivia and the tin-producing countries in the defence of their legitimate interests.103.	I wish to confirm Bolivia's resolute participation in all actions designed to establish a new international economic order. This explains our recent adherence to the non-aligned movement as a full member. Bolivia's foreign policy is in accord with the purposes and objectives of the movement  and this has led us finally to join actively in the struggle to democratize international relations and to ensure the real participation of the developing countries in decisions that are vital to the destiny of mankind.104.	We cannot sufficiently reiterate the need to consolidate co-operation among developing countries as a necessary requirement for the construction of a new international system. Agreements among the countries of the third world will always be ad hoc and transitory as long as no set of shared interests has been established. That is the transcendental meaning of integration and co-operation among developing countries. On the one hand  it is a matter of making use of the immense natural  technological  financial and human resources our nations possess for our own benefit  and  on the other  of laying the foundations for a joint external policy on ever firmer ground.105.	As demonstrated by the frustrating negotiations that have taken place in various world forums  the existing order will not change merely because right is on our side. It will be changed when there is a change in effective power relationships between North and South. Indeed  the resolutions of international gatherings give formal recognition to changes that have already occurred in fact. The logical conclusion to be drawn from this is that we must not limit ourselves to calling for the establishment of a new international economic and political order; we must build it. The tool for accomplishing this task is co-operation among developing countries. Let us not ask others to do what we are able to do on our own.106.	This is the experience the Andean Group can contribute to the cause of the third world. Ten years ago  the Cartagena Agreement was signed  initiating one of the most advanced processes of integration in the world. Once a solid structure of co-operative relations has been established  the Andean Presidents decided to promote that group's joint participation in continental political problems  beginning with a discussion of the case of Nicaragua within the framework of the Organization of American States [OAS]âwith positive results that are a matter of public knowledge.107.	On the occasion of the Sixth Conference of non- aligned countries in Havana  the countries members of the Andean group again stated their joint position on matters of world concern.108.	On 2 October of this year  at Panama  the Andean Presidents signed a document recording further common action  including joint participation in the ninth regular session of the General Assembly of the OAS to be held at La Paz on 22 October of this year  a meeting intended to present a new image and set forth planning for the inter-American system in the forthcoming decade.109.	The Andean group is confident that democratic systems of government will be established in Latin America in which the exercise of power will derive from the legitimate and free expression of the will of the people and a better situation will be created to promote measures for the political normalization of the continent and the enjoyment of human rights with the greatest respect for the principle of non-intervention. This does not mean  obviously  that the Andean Group is an association directed against anyone else. On the contrary  precisely because it is democratic  its international conduct is guided by ideological pluralism. It is a movement designed to unite  not to divide.110.	We also wish to express our concern at the tensions existing in some areas of the continent and our confidence that the countries of those regions will be able freely to choose their own paths to well-being free from outside pressures or attempts designed to involve them in the play of alien economic  strategic or hegemonistic interests.111.	For the second year  my country is serving as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. This is the second time we have occupied this lofty position in the most important United Nations organ for the maintenance of peace. Our presence in the Security Council has enabled us to practise genuine non- alignment  that is  to act from a position equally removed from the poles of world power and to serve the cause of detente and peace in a positive manner.112.	Bolivia  as a country that practises ideological pluralism  has been able to act in complete independence and with no commitment other than to justice  with the intention of making a firm contribution to peaceful solutions. We have supported the actions of liberation movements and will continue to do so as long as the desire to perpetuate colonialist systems or to create new forms of exploitation under different names exits.113.	If there are no further acts of violence against the front-line States and if there is compliance with the resolutions approved by the Security Council and the General Assembly with regard to the problem of Zimbabwe  we are prepared to co-operate in any peace negotiation that takes into account the legitimate interests of the peoples of Africa and their right to self- government free from any tutelage. The same applies to Namibia and the constant threats and attacks against Zambia  Angola and Mozambique.114.	We are following with particular attention the complex problem of Cyprus. We are pained to see that heroic island divided and occupied militarily. We believe that negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots must be resumed as soon as possible. We sincerely hope that after five long years of waiting  reason and justice will prevail  and that both communities will return to peaceful coexistence under the government of their own authorities.115.	Another of the major problems the Security Council has had to consider is the occupation of Lebanon by foreign forces. My delegation has supported all measures recommended by the Secretary-General to alleviate  at least in part  the suffering of that heroic and victimized people. Bolivia  together with the other members of the Security Council  has striven by its support to contribute to the Lebanese Government's recovery of authority over its territory. Bringing about the withdrawal of the forces that have made that country an arena for confrontation and achieving the recovery and consolidation of the national Government with full authority over the territory has been and will continue to be an arduous task. We fervently hope that it will be accomplished successfully.116.	Bolivia has followed with particular attention the development of events in the Middle East. We have given our complete and unwavering support to Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  whose balance we consider to be equitable and just. On the one hand  it consolidates the existence of the State of Israel and  on the other  it clearly condemns the occupation of Arab territories by force and demands their prompt return. We support the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a homeland of their own where they can establish a sovereign State. Similarly  we support the State of Israel's right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries  and recommend to the parties that they approach this pressing and explosive situation realistically and comprehensively.117.	The delegation of Bolivia was pleased to see the inclusion of the item proposed by Romania entitled ""Settlement by peaceful means of disputes among States"". We consider that such a bold initiative merits attentive and positive analysis by this Assembly  since it is a significant contribution to the applicability of the procedures established under Article 33 of the Charter.118.	As a developing country beset by social and economic problems  Bolivia could hardly remain impassive at the arms race taking place throughout the world. The horrifying statistics on the arms race among the large and medium-sized Powers are all too well known for me to repeat them here  as are the astronomical amounts devoted to increasing their military arsenals but we can hardly be impassive observers. All countries that wish to live in peace must adopt a positive attitude towards general and complete disarmament. The arms race among the countries of the region and of the world blatantly flouts the majority will of the international community. The allocation of voluminous resources to so censurable an end when they could be used for the economic and social development of peoples is absolutely intolerable.119.	As a country with a profound desire for peace  we add our voice to those of all the delegations in this Assembly that have advocated approval of the treaty resulting from the second round of SALT and the early convening of the World Disarmament Conference  whose very title is a warning in the face of the risk of a tragic nuclear holocaust.120.	In conclusion  I wish to express the earnest intent of the delegation of Bolivia to continue to lend its firmest support to the solution of the grave problems afflicting mankind  by sharing responsibilities and efforts with all nations represented within this international conclave."
"16",944,"BRA",34,1979,"ï»¿As the general debate opens  I have the honour and sincere pleasure of conveying to you  Sir  the first expressions of congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. You have the support of the international community represented here  thanks to the esteem we have for your country and for your own personal qualifications  which we recognize and admire. Your constant dedication to the principles of sovereignty and self- determination and the remarkable contribution you have made in the efforts for peace and independence have distinguished your role in the last years as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. You are well aware of the significant ties that exist between the African nations and my country. Endowed with a common heritage in many fields  and as partners in basic aspirations  we have striven to develop our ties into a network of mutual co-operation  which already includes a wide range of activities. It is with particular satisfaction that  in this context  I refer to the imminent opening of the Brazilian Embassy in Darussalam  which will thus establish a direct diplomatic channel with one of the most important capitals of Africa.3.	Before proceeding  I should like to express my Government's appreciation for the very able and productive manner in which a distinguished South Americanâa representative of Colombia  a country to which Brazil is bound by fraternal linksâMr. Indalecio Lie'vano Aguirre  conducted the work of the thirty-third session.4.	For many years and in various ways I have been associated with the work and the development of this Organization and have therefore witnessed its transformation into a true universal forum. Thus it is with satisfaction that I welcome a new Member Stateâa country from Latin AmericaâSaint Lucia  to whose representatives I extend my warm greetings  anticipating fruitful co-operation in this Organization.5.	Upon taking office on 15 March last  President Joao Figueiredo reaffirmed that the foreign policy of Brazil is dedicated to the noble ideals of peace  justice and inter-national co-operation for development. In the coming years we shall persevere in exploring new paths for understanding and co-operation with nations from all parts of the world. In this endeavour we shall be guided by our traditional capacity for friendly dialogue and by our sense of national dignity.6.	As we look to the future  it seems fitting to reaffirm Brazil's adherence to the principles of national independence  the sovereign equality of States  the self- determination of peoples and non-interference in the internal and external affairs of States  as well as our support for the peaceful settlement of international disputes  as provided for in the United Nations Charter. In this connexion  Brazil will continue to work for the strengthening of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security  in co-operation for development and in the furtherance of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion.7.	For the Brazilian Government  it is a matter of satisfaction that relations with our immediate neighbours  the sister nations of Latin America  are increasingly pervaded by positive trends. Winds of change are blowing in Latin America. The countries of the region are conscious of the need to add new dimensions to their historical ties through the intensification of their political consultations  the establishment of new and dynamic cultural links and a substantial expansion of their trade and economic relations. While retaining their own features and peculiarities  Latin American countries are closer than ever to each other. As the area for co-operation expands  new forms of joint action will be required. For its part  Brazil is ready to co-operate  and our concern is that peace and tranquillity prevail in our region and that the countries of Latin America face  side by side  the common struggle for development. With this aim  we are prepared to work with other nations from all parts of Latin America.8.	Brazil feels especially close to its neighbours to the east  the nations of Africa. The links that we have developed over the years reflect not only geographical proximity but also the deeply rooted affinities between our peoples. Together we have identified our interest in the establishment of new patterns of economic and technical co-operation and new flows of goods and services. Together we have sought common solutions in our efforts to overcome the challenges of development and independence  on a basis of mutual trust and respect.9.	We are particularly sensitive to the profound grief of the people of Angola over the untimely death two weeks ago of President Agostinho Neto. To his people he was the guide in the struggle for independence and nation-building and an African leader whose personal qualifications won him great respect and esteem. In my country he was also regarded as one of the most significant contemporary poets of our common language. His death came before Africa could achieve the goal of complete freedom from political and economic domination and racial injustice. But  as he would say  the struggle continues for the self-determination and independence of Zimbabwe and Namibia and for the elimination of apartheid.10.	With the nations of the Middle East  Brazil has forged strong ties of friendship  understanding and cooperation. We view with increasing concern the problems afflicting that part of the world. During the past year  new developments have marked the situation in the Middle East. However  it would be excessively optimistic to say that the prospects for peaceâa just  lasting and comprehensive peaceâare  in some way  better than they were a year ago.11.	Nevertheless  some States are still reluctant to accept the changes that must be brought about for true peace to be attained. Some still insist on closing their eyes to the basic fact that there will not be peace in the area until all territories taken by force are vacated and until the rights of the Palestinian peopleâtheir inalienable rights to self-determination  independence and sovereignty in Palestine  in accordance with the United Nations Charterâare duly recognized and implemented  Furthermore  one cannot foresee true success in peace negotiations without the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization  which is one of the relevant parties in the region's political scene.12.	We believe that all States in the region have a right to exist within recognized borders. This right implies  actually  the recognition of the right of all peoples in the region to live in peace  including those who are homeless and have suffered the most. The world can no longer afford delays in the adoption of effective measures directed towards a future of good understanding  peace and justice in the Middle East. It is the hope of the Brazilian Government that the present session of the United Nations General Assembly may help create diplomatic conditions that will allow for a new political situation to the benefit of all.13.	The world economy is about to enter the decade of the 1980s in a state marked by widespread uncertainties. After more than 20 years of intensive negotiations for the reformulation of relations between the industrialized North and the developing South  the results achieved did not go beyond the theoretical recognition of unbalanced situations and the need to revise them.14.	It cannot be denied that practical measures for the correction of the factors of economic imbalance have been essentially limited to the convening of international conferences or to the creation of multilateral organs concerned more with the debate of the problems than with their negotiation and solution.15.	The institutionalization of UNCTAD and the unfolding of its work over five high level meetings; the establishment of UNIDO; the addition to the text of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of a chapter on trade problems of less developed nations; numerous sessions of the General Assembly and dozens of meetings and conferences on a variety of subjects; the launching of two United Nations Development Decades; the so-called North-South Paris Conference âall this huge effort fell short of modifying the picture of injustice and asymmetry which deeply marks the North-South relationship.16.	The remarkable prosperity enjoyed by the Western economy in the post-war period is threatened today by numerous difficulties. The very essence of the economic problem experienced by the highly developed nations has changed. Formerly  during the period of accelerated growth  the question was how to minimize the elements of instability in a context of sustained expansion; now it is a matter of preventing the international system from reaching heights of intolerable instability.17.	At present  there is a disquieting slackening in international trade  the volume of which until 1973 grew at an average rate of 9 per cent but today increases at an annual rate of less than 5 per cent. The contraction of economic activities anticipates the increase of protectionist trends  and introduces a disturbing element of friction in an economy which is becoming more and more interdependent and internationalized.18.	In the commercial field  it is increasingly clear that lines of division are being established between the North  which is as integrated as ever  and the South  where the share of countries like Brazil in international exports is less than proportional to their contribution to world prosperity. This contribution lies not only in the acquisition of goods and services  but also in well remunerated imports of technological inputs and financial resources  either direct investments or capital loans.19.	Paradoxically  the very difficulties which prevail in the present situation have encouraged increased integration among the highly industrialized economies. Another ambitious round of negotiations within GATT has just been concluded. We note that the results of this round benefited above all the trade of the sophisticated among the highly industrialized nations. In the Northern Hemisphere reciprocal trade is liberalized and constructive solutions are adopted  leading to greater intertwining of the respective industrial sectors  with added financial technological co-operation and increased exchanges of direct investments.20.	Meanwhile  the industrialized world has been drawn closer to those nations which have come to enjoy a greater availability of financial resources as a result of increases in the price of oil.21.	These facts are positive for the world economy and  to that extent  they deserve recognition and support.22.	From the point of view of the specific interest of developing countries like Brazil  however  the pattern of commercial relations with the developed world gives rise to concern  for what is taking place is not the removal of protectionist structures but their development into new modalities  which at times are more subtle  but which none the less are always effective.23.	Far from being abolished  protectionism acquires new features and is updated; it strikes with redoubled impact precisely those nations which  due to a chronic tendency towards external imbalanceâan inevitable requirement of their development effortâare more in need of access to the larger world markets.24.	Concern for the pressing aspects of the economic difficultiesâsuch as inflation in the developed world and the rise in the price of oilâmust not overshadow the broader issue of the struggle to overcome the structures of under-development. Industrialization in developing countries is being hindered at the very moment when the efforts of these countries are starting to yield results  and when they can most contribute to the world economy also as suppliers of increasingly competitive manufactured products. Probably worse than openly practised protectionism  in the form of trade barriers against the sales of those countries  is the omission implicit in the disregard for the problems of North- South relationships which became evident  for example  at the Tokyo Economic Summit  held from 28 to 29 June 1979.25.	As President Figueiredo recently stated in a speech made at the launching  by both the Brazilian Government and private businessmen  of a renewed exports drive:""To our industrialized partners we affirm our disposition towards dialogue and understanding  and our rejection of any unwarranted attitude of confrontation. We wish to reach  together  stable and constructive solutions. Through them we expect to eliminate the spectre of protectionism which has been revived by current widespread difficulties  and also open increasingly wider channels for trade and international co-operation.""26.	In this spirit  we address our friends from the developed world. Brazil favours the resumption of the North-South dialogue through a new and intensified effort for effective negotiations with a view to reshaping the relationship between the developed world and the developing nations.27.	In this context we look forward to the practical results we trust will be attained by the special session of the Assembly to be held in 1980.28.	We trust that the developing world will maintain its fundamental solidarity before the highly industrialized countries. But the developing world cannot have its unity based exclusively on the coincidence of interests vis-a-vis the developed nations. This unity must reflect an effective sense of understanding and co-operation. In order to be authentic  the solidarity of the developing world must be increasingly geared to concrete action. I refer here particularly to the present energy crisis. New forms of commercial co-operation between developing countries must be established. Direct economic and financial flows among developing countries must increase on a mutual basis so as to ensure that situations of acute imbalance do not become a permanent feature in the third world. With this aim  we think that developing countries should maintain urgently all necessary consultations  which should also serve as a preparation for the dialogue they will have with the industrialized countries.29.	Brazil  for its part  is undertaking a major effort to increase its relations of trade and co-operation with other developing countries. We have shared  to the limit of our possibilities  the experience we have accumulated as a tropical country with a relatively high and diversified level of industrialization. Our trade relations with nations from Latin America  Africa and Asia  which in the 1960s accounted for 9 per cent of our exports and approximately 23 per cent of our purchases  represent today 25 per cent of our sales and more than 40 per cent of our imports. More than a billion dollars was allocated by the Brazilian Government in the last few years to the opening of lines of credit in favour of other developing nations. We have provided technical co-operation  though still on a modest basis  to some 40 countries in Latin America and Africa  and we have today approximately 15 000 foreign students in Brazilian technical institutions and universities.30.	In the field of renewable sources of energy  we are opening an entirely new area for our co-operation with other countries. Thanks to substantial investments in the production of alcohol for fuel purposes and the development of a technology for its use  Brazil can become the focus of a broad effort of developing alternative sources of energy with beneficial effects for all countries  producers and consumers  which seek the rational use and adequate conservation of oil reserves  as well as greater stability and predictability in the market development of such an essential product. We are thus contributing to the maximum of our possibilities  to broadening and enhancing the sense of harmony and solidarity in the developing world  which is an indispensable condition for success in the task of revising the patterns of relationship between North and South.31.	Serious political and economic problems with world-wide repercussions have made us all acutely conscious of the importance of dialogue and co-operation among States. Developing countries have awakened to the fact that they can and should seek each other to solve their common problems. They are also aware of the fact that they are denied access to negotiations and to the international decision-making processes which directly affect their legitimate interests and aspirations in so many ways.32.	It can no longer be ignored that all States  without discrimination  have the right to participate equitably and effectively in the decisions affecting their national destinies. It is not only in the energy  trade  monetary and other issues in the economic field that such participation is required. I wish also to consider the present situation in the field of disarmament. Although the tenth special session of the General Assembly  held in 1978 on disarmament  fell far short of producing a clear-cut commitment to nuclear disarmament  it did produce what appeared to be a more open and democratic machinery for disarmament negotiations. But the results of the first year of work of the Committee on Disarmament have not been encouraging. The Committee concentrated on debating its rules of procedure and other procedural questions  while negotiations on basic  substantive questions continued to be conducted directly by the two main military Powers.33.	The agreements reached as a result of the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT]  hailed in some quarters as a major break-through in the field of nuclear disarmament and described in others as not more than a limited step towards what might be called the rational management of the arms race  are a result of such direct negotiations between the two main military Powers. Presumably all other States will be asked to commend the agreements during the present session of the General Assembly. We shall not stand in the way of such a request. But we see the second round of these talks primarily as an intermediate stage which should lead to the early start of negotiations on the third round of SALT  with its promised substantive reductions in nuclear armaments. At any rate  SALT negotiations should be integrated in a broader effort open to the participation of all States  with a view to general and complete disarmament  under effective international control.34.	The Committee on Disarmament itself did not have the opportunity even to begin meaningful negotiations on two measures that had been on the agenda of its predecessor  the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament for a great many years. Neither the trilateral talks on a nuclear weapons test ban  nor the bilateral discussions on the prohibition of chemical weapons led this year to the long-awaited presentation of concrete proposals to the Geneva Committee on Disarmament. Instead  the multilateral negotiating body was presented  at almost the last moment  with a draft on radiological weapons produced by the two major military Powers  with the recommendation that it be speedily approved and forwarded to the General Assembly for endorsement. While welcoming the initiative  the Committee wisely decided that it was entitled to discuss the proposed text more thoroughly. Furthermore  it is significant that the only major disarmament effort in 1979 open to the participation of all States had to do  not with the top priority area of nuclear weapons  but with certain specific conventional weapons.35.	Before concluding  I wish to refer to two issues which received ample consideration at the United Nations during this year. I refer to the law of the sea and to science and technology. The Brazilian Government has actively participated in the work of the Third UnitedNations Conference on the Law of the Sea  spurred on by the desire to reach  with all members of the international community  a universally acceptable legal structure for the use of maritime space. The results of the latest session of that Conference seem to indicate the path towards solving some of the most delicate points of what would be the future convention. However  we are under no illusion about the difficulties still facing us  difficulties which can only be resolved in a constructive mood and in a serene atmosphere. It is regrettable that untimely initiatives should disturb the natural pace of the Conference's work  which is now moving into its decisive phase. I refer  inter alia  to the possible adoption of unilateral legislation on the exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  defined by this Assembly as the common heritage of mankind. Brazil hopes that in this case as well the sense of collective responsibility  which is essential for the success of such a complex and vast project  will again prevail.36.	Brazil has also participated very actively and with great interest in the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. We hope that the Vienna Programme of Action1 and the Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development  to be established  as well as the continuation of negotiations  including those in conferences already programmed within the United Nations  will lead North and South to solutions on the issue of the transfer of technology and the revision of rules which regulate industrial property  in accordance with the needs of the developing countries.37.	In concluding  I should like to assure the Assembly that as in the past the delegation of Brazil stands ready to work together with other delegations for the solution of the issues before the General Assembly. I should also like to state that in Brazil we remain confident and optimistic regarding the future  despite the frequent and serious adverse changes which in the present international situation have opposed our efforts. We are convinced that we are able to overcome the various obstacles facing our country and we are determined to continue to co-operate on an equitable basis in international efforts  here at the United Nations and elsewhere  for the promotion of justice  development and peace."
"17",988,"BRB",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  at a time when the question of the speed with which this Organization can proceed with the decolonization of the remaining non-independent Territories in Africa is still perhaps the most pressing issue before this Assembly  it is particularly significant that you should have been chosen to preside over our deliberations. Your outstanding chairmanship of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples has amply qualified you for this post. For Barbados  it is doubly pleasurable to offer congratulations to you  Mr. President  especially because of the high regard in which you are held as your country's non-resident High Commissioner to Barbados  and also because of the close historical and cultural links which exist between the United Republic of Tanzania and Barbados.2.	The admission to membership in this Organization of our sister Caribbean State  Saint Lucia  is a source of great pride and satisfaction to Barbados and the Caribbean. It contributes to our optimism about the effectiveness of the United Nations in pursuing the principle of universality of its membership as well as of parity among all Member States  regardless of their size or wealth.3.	Since the landmark resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960  many countries  including Barbados  have broken the bonds of colonialism and joined the ranks of the free. The inexorable process continues  although not without hitches. It is to be hoped that  at the thirty-fifth session  this Assembly will welcome at least three other Caribbean States as full Members  namely  St. Vincent  St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla and Antigua.4.	But if our efforts in the cause of decolonization are not redoubled and our voices not constantly raised  we will see a continuance of the delay in the attainment of full independence by another Caribbean sister country  Belize. Barbados continues to deplore the persistent and intransigent claim of the Guatemalan Government to the Territory of Belize in defiance of world opinion and United Nations resolutions. There can be no doubt that the yielding of any part of the territory of Belize  no matter how small  will result in instability and threats to the peace and security of the entire region. Despite the overwhelming international support for Belize's right' to self-determination as demonstrated in this forum  this Organization has come no closer to the resolution of the problems which impede Belize's progress to independence. We call upon those countries which persist in abstaining in their votes on this issue to respect principle and recognize the importance for the Latin American and Caribbean region of having the question of Belize resolved in accordance with the legitimate wishes of the Government and people of Belize.5.	There can be no compromise on the principle of self-determination and the issue of decolonization. At its thirty-third session the General Assembly expressed its commitment to the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination and reaffirmed an earlier resolution calling for Indonesian withdrawal from the Territory of East Timor  Indonesia's invasion and annexation of that small country continues to be of the utmost concern to Barbados. Barbados will continue to give its unqualified support to the people of East Timor in their just struggle against foreign occupation.6.	In the case of the Western Sahara  Barbados also lends its principled support to the Saharan people  through their legitimate representative  the Frente POLISARIO  in their efforts to resist colonialism. Barbados commends Mauritania for its initiative in relinquishing its claim to part of the Sahara Territory.7.	The high hopes which many of us held almost a year ago for an early solution to the problems of Namibia on the basis of the plan of action approved by the Security Council have all been dashed by the wilful obstruction by South Africa of the establishment of a United Nations presence in Namibia to supervise and control elections. While Barbados agrees that the full cooperation of all concerned is essential to the implementation of the Security Council's plan of action  we are of the view that the Western Powers have a special responsibility in this regard.8.	Barbados is fully aware of the importance of South Africa as a major source of supply of mineral resources for some of the Western industrial nations. This reliance  based as it is purely on economic considerations and naked self-interest  should not be a smoke-screen for the abandonment of principle and for delaying the true independence of Namibia and the final liberation of the black peoples of southern Africa. Barbados renews its oft-repeated call for the imposition of total economic and military sanctions against South Africa in order to compel that country to end its recalcitrance with respect to Namibia and to abandon its iniquitous and oppressive regime of apartheid.9.	The recent proposal on the Rhodesian conflict agreed upon only a few months ago at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka represents in our view a promising step towards an ultimate solution to the Rhodesian problem. We fully support the Commonwealth agreement and hope that the talks now taking place between all the parties to the conflict will shortly lead to a negotiated settlement satisfactory to ail parties.10.	But even in areas where the process of decolonization has ostensibly been completed new forms of colonialism reappear or self-determination is not being fully realized. The Middle East is one such area. The attainment of true self-determination for the Palestinian people  as the Secretary-General has reminded us  ""is central to the political  economic and military stability of the world"". For there to be peace with stability  negotiations must take place among all the parties. The efforts made at Camp David are only tentative steps along the road to a comprehensive settlement. A comprehensive peace can  in our view  be achieved only when it is recognized that the Palestinian people have a right to full self-determination and a homeland of their own and that Israel has an equal right to exist within secure borders. Such a peace will never be achieved in a condition of spasmodic raids and continual expansion of new settlements.11.	Over the years we have heard many a speaker rhapsodize about the virtues of detente. We were told that the cold war had come to an end and that a new era of peaceful coexistence had dawned on the erstwhile cold warriors.12.	During the last year  however  it became obvious to the people of the Caribbean that this belief is a dangerous illusion  as contending super-Powers opened up a new front within the region. On the one hand  one super-Power continues to pursue its Messianic  hegemonic and ideological vision of a world where all countries will adopt its economic  social and political system. On the other hand  the other superpower exhumed the obsolete concepts contained in the Monroe Doctrine and the philosophy of ""manifest destiny""   dusted them off and paraded them to the world as new solutions to contemporary problems.13.	Not since the days of the slave trade has the Caribbean experienced such a web of international confrontation and intrigue. In the confusion occasioned by the introduction and intensification of the cold war in the Caribbean  Barbados wants to make its position clear. In 1966  Barbados did not win its independence to give it up again by becoming a vassal State of any superpower. We stand uncompromisingly opposed to any kind of imperialism or colonialism. It follows  then  that Barbados rejects the pernicious imperialist doctrines of ""balance of power""  ""correlation of forces"" and ""spheres of influence""  and  as a corollary  subscribes to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries  a principle which this Assembly has upheld on many occasions. The people of sovereign countries must be left in peace to practise self- determination and to solve their national problems as they see fit. The cold war in the Caribbean region has created a situation where marauders  pirates and mercenaries threaten populations with destruction. This has in turn increased militarization in the area  as many States  menaced by international gangsters  find it necessary to devote scarce resources to the purchase of arms in order to protect themselves.14.	Barbados has been constant in its view that the acquisition of arms uses up scarce human and material resources  which would be better employed in the development of our countries and in the fulfilment of the basic human needs of our people. We firmly hold the view that disarmament should be general and complete. Unfortunately  only very limited progress has been achieved in disarmament over the past decade. As an earnest of our dedication to the goals of total disarmament we will  within a few days  ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.15.	Nations cannot fulfil the aspirations of their peoples in an atmosphere of violence. Barbados has in the past year experienced threats from mercenaries. It is for this reason that we will continue resolutely to support action to eliminate terrorism and the use of mercenaries. These growing evils must be deplored as unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of other countries  calculated to create world tension and instability. At this session my country will seek the support of all States for a strong resolution against the recruitment  training or harbouring of mercenaries and will work towards agreement on an international convention to eradicate this evil.16.	On numerous occasions  in this and other forums  the Government of Barbados has spoken out in defence of human rights. We shall continue to support initiatives which will eliminate violations of human rights wherever they occur. We follow developments in several countries with growing dismay  as we see grave violations of the most elementary human rights in both the political and the social sphere.17.	Because of our deep concern  we will continue to support any action to improve the international machinery for the promotion and protection of human rights. We will also relentlessly speak out against abuses wherever they occur  even if our candour calls down on us the temporary wrath of our friends. That is why we abhor the growing denial of human rights which has appeared within the Caribbean  particularly the denial of the right to dissent and to support or establish political parties of one's own choosing. In our view  there can be no true democracy where people are held without being charged with an offence known to law  are imprisoned for their political beliefs or are denied the right to a free and fair trial.18.	A particular human rights problem of global concern is the major exodus of refugees from their home countries all over the world. This problem has reached alarming proportions in Indo-China and poses a threat to world peace and stability. We are witnessing a callous disregard for humanitarian principles. Barbados whole-heartedly supports the creation of a special fund for refugees and upholds all efforts of the United Nations to alleviate such suffering. We must not allow political pacts and ideological alliances to prevent us from condemning the repressive policies of those countries which disregard and violate human rights. My delegation is therefore prepared to support any measure that would compel all violators to readjust their policies to curb the excessive outflow of their citizens.19.	This Organization must also pursue relentlessly the economic aspects of human rights. For the majority of the world's peoples continue to suffer from malnutrition and a lack of proper health care and adequate shelter  as the world economy fails into deeper and deeper recession.20.	The impact of the myriad economic problems with which we are faced today is being felt by all nations. However  the outlook is bleaker in the case of developing countries  whose economies are weaker and more vulnerable to external influences. These countries are prey  among other things  to severe balance-of- payments problems  unfavourable terms of trade  growing protectionist measures  inflation  unemployment  unstable exchange rates  the erosion of their already meagre savings  a lack of access to capital markets to finance reasonable rates of development and the all-pervasive problem of energy shortages and rising prices.21.	The failure to achieve any meaningful breakthrough on these problems has been due to the lack of genuine political will on the part of Governments to commit themselves to the actions needed to grapple with these problems. Too many of usâdeveloped and developing alikeâcontinue to think in terms of narrow national self-interest.22.	It was precisely this kind of self-interest arid mistrust that prevented the fifth session of UNCTAD from achieving any progress on the structural issues of North-South relations. It is precisely this suspicion that has led to failure in the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 and in the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy. It was precisely this lack of commitment that produced the limited results witnessed at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held at Vienna from 20 to 31 August.23.	Barbados believes that the only way to rescue the world economy from the morass into which it has sunk is to initiate immediately a full  constructive and genuine dialogue on the real issues of structural change  trade  energy and monetary reform. The first requirement for such a dialogue is the political will born of recognition of the interdependence of States. This interdependence must provide for the full recognition and acceptance on the part of all countries of the need for continuing structural adjustment.24.	As we enter the decade of the 1980s a new international development strategy will offer us the occasion to break the stalemate and start anew  building on our successes and learning from our mistakes. The international development strategy for the third decade ought to be the major instrument for the promotion of global economic development. That strategy should set a clear framework of realistically attainable objectives and targets. It should involve the entire international com-munity  with obligations and commitments to be borne by both developed and developing countries. It should be a major feature of our efforts towards a transformation of the world economic order.25.	We of the third world must ourselves also recognize the need to renew our commitment to work patiently and systematically towards the new order. Collective self-reliance and economic co-operation among developing countries are important bases on which to build such an order.26.	Central to the issues of economic growth and development are the world's energy resources. The continual increases in the price of oil pose serious financial problems for oil-importing developing countries like Barbados. The most recent price-hike will have a debilitating effect on our economy.27.	There is need for a systematic  coherent and co-ordinated attempt to devise a long-term strategy that will ease the burden of oil-importing developing countries. Simultaneously  the search for alternative sources of energy should be intensified. Many countries have already embarked on this course of action. Without decrying these individual initiatives  Barbados believes that concerted efforts on the part of the international community are needed to deal with this problem. Barbados therefore welcomes the forthcoming 1981 United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  and looks forward to participating fully and effectively in the work of this Conference.28.	Barbados has  in other forums and on other occasions  enunciated specific proposals for both the short- term and the long-term solution of the energy problem. We need not repeat them here; but we should say that some of them are reflected in the address of the President of Mexico  Mr. Lopez Portillo  delivered before this Assembly on 27 September 1979. His constructive proposals should be given the fullest and most serious consideration by all countries. For our part we wish only to reiterate at this time the need for members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] to recycle their surplus oil funds to assist in the much-needed development of third-world countries.29.	Another vitally important area in which international co-operation is urgently needed is that of the law of the sea. We have taken note of the fact that  at the end of its eighth session  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea approved a programme of work providing for the adoption of a convention of the law of the sea next year.30.	While we consider such an action to be of major importance  we have the strong conviction that the successful adoption of a convention on the law of the sea will elude our grasp if we fail to exhibit the required will and determination to understand each other's concern and difficulties and make the necessary accommodation to produce a treaty which will be of fundamental importance for the future.31.	Barbados  like any small island developing country  continues to place the greatest emphasis on the importance of the sea to the future of its economic well-being  the resources of the sea constitute some of our most vital resources. That is why the Government of Barbados  despite the heavy financial burden and its limited human resources  has continued to participate in the sessions on the law of the sea.32.	The protection of our beaches and of the sea around us is also a matter of grave concern to us. The possible threat to our beaches by oil pollution  traceable to the unregulated and  in many cases  irresponsible behaviour of oil tankers in mid-Atlantic routes  has been increasing. Barbados believes that the international community and the oil companies have an obligation to small island countries on the path of the international oil carriers to protect them from ecological and environmental damage.33.	Island developing countries account for more than 10 per cent of the membership of this Organization. If the over-all goal of justice  peace and prosperity is to be achieved  special attention will have to be paid to their particular problems. It is of the gravest concern that these problems have received scant attention from this forum. These countries exhibit unique characteristics of small population  limited land area  geographical isolation  scarce resources or limited economic opportunities  which make it difficult for them to take full advantage of international efforts to improve the economic prospects of developing countries. For some of these island countries current trade and aid relationships may even be having a negative effect on their development prospects.34.	As an island developing economy  Barbados continues to be critical of the present unreliable techniques being used in the allocation of aid. The gross national product per capita income criterion results in a totally unrealistic and inaccurate evaluation of a country's wealth.35.	Countries such as Barbados  styled ""middle in-come"" countries  have real and serious developmental and structural problems despite their apparent high per capita income. What has been termed by one expert in the field the ""myopic myth of middle-income countries"" militates against the achievement of relative self-sufficiency or progress  since the moment these countries attain a certain threshold of development  vital assistance is withdrawn or drastically reduced.36.	It is hoped that a new look will be taken at other criteria such as the size of a country  its potential for development in terms of its real resources and the finite nature of problems confronting island developing States  in order to arrive at a new philosophical basis on which development assistance is granted.37.	Barbados therefore calls on this Organization to place a high priority on the early implementation of special measuresâincluding those set out in UNCTAD resolution 111 (V) âdesigned to assist the small island developing economies.38.	The sister Caribbean countries of St. Vincent  Jamaica  the Commonwealth of Dominica and the Dominican Republic  in addition to suffering from the vulnerability and fragility peculiar to island developing economies  have recently been exposed to further adversity in the form of natural disasters  namely  a volcanic eruption in St. Vincent  floods in Jamaica and a hurricane in Dominica and the Dominican Republic. Dominica and the Dominican Republic  in particular  were almost totally ravaged  and now face a difficult period of reconstruction and rehabilitation. Barbados calls on the international community to respond speedily to the urgent needs of these countries  by mobilizing the appropriate resources required for their rehabilitation.39.	I referred earlier to the optimism inspired by the giant steps made in the process of decolonization. Our optimism must  however  be tempered when we review the past decade  as it is traditional to do on the threshold of a new era. The world agenda before this Organization has broadened considerably since its creation in 1945; the world is in the midst of a period of change and we go from crisis to crisis with hardly any time to deal with one before another confronts us.40.	New concepts of national interests are emerging and there is increasing interdependence of States. We have witnessed a shift in the pattern of relationships among the major Powers. The international economic system is under strain. The ever present issues of human rights  apartheid  disarmament  terrorism  mercenaries  racism  the plight of refugees  all clamour for our attention. It is with this complex  ever-changing and troubled world that the United Nations has to contend.41.	My Government acknowledges the unsurpassed benefits which the presence of the United Nations has brought to the peoples of our troubled world. The Organization's role in preventing another global conflict within the past 35 years is to be applauded. Its specialized agencies have rendered inestimable services which have not attracted the same attention and publicity as some of the topical issues with which the United Nations has been seized. In sum  if the United Nations did not exist  we would have to invent it.42.	As we look towards the 1980s  let us commit ourselves to finding common ground for the attainment of justice  peace and prosperity."
"18",1064,"BTN",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I have the honour to convey  through you Sir  to all the representatives the good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  King of Bhutan  for the success of this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly in its efforts to promote international peace and stability and the economic well-being of all peoples.298.	On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Bhutan  I wish to express our heartfelt congratulations to Ambassador Salim on his unanimous election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. This is not only a well deserved tribute to him but is a fitting tribute to the United Republic of Tanzania and the continent of Africa.299.	I should like to express my delegation's deep appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Lievano of Colombia  for the excellent manner in which he guided us during the thirty-third session.300.	At this thirty-fourth session we are happy to welcome Saint Lucia  the newest Member from the Caribbean and the region of Latin America. The admission of Saint Lucia adds to the growing universality of our Organization. We believe it is the validity of the principles and objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations which has seen our membership increase year after year and which has put an end to the era of colonialism. Among the many visible successes of the United Nations  the efforts of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples will form an important chapter.301.	We wish to put on record our appreciation to Mr. Waldheim  the Secretary-General  for his active and faithful stewardship of our Organization and the useful initiatives that he has taken towards making the United Nations more effective. We support the Secretary- General's suggestions for improving the work of the United Nations  and we agree with him that a perfectly logical and functional institutional system is probably not within our reach and that we must make the existing one function better.302.	The Kingdom of Bhutan adheres to the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter and those of the non-aligned movement. We are fully committed to eradicating colonialism  neo-colonialism  imperialism  racism  apartheid  power politics and all manifestations of foreign occupation  domination and hegemony. We believe that the quintessence of the United Nations and the non-aligned movement is to safeguard each country's right to independence and self-determination  so as to enable each country and people to determine freely its own destiny without outside interference  pressures or threats of any kind. We seek the opportunity as free people to build a world order based upon justice  sovereign equality  peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial co-operation.303.	In this spirit Bhutan contributes to promoting peaceful conditions in every region and subregion of this world. In our own area  the countries of South Asia  especially India  have taken encouraging initiatives to establish understanding and co-operation based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and sovereign equality. This has enabled the countries of our subregion to resolve some of the major issues which stood in the way of forging closer relations in a climate of trust and confidence.304.	The international community is engaged once again by the serious threat to peace and stability in South-East Asia. The developments in the area challenge the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. They have also resulted in tragic human sufferings. We in Bhutan  a Buddhist country  look at the humanitarian problems with sorrow and compassion. We commend the efforts made by the Secretary- General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to alleviate the immediate sufferings of the hapless people.305.	Recently in Havana  His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  the King of Bhutan  while addressing the Heads of State and Government of the non-aligned countries  said:""We are concerned with the increasing tensions and conflicts in South-East Asia which jeopardize peace and stability in the region. It is our firm belief and conviction that intervention in the internal affairs of States cannot be justified under any circumstances whatsoever  as it goes counter to the sovereign inalienable right of every State to determine its own social  economic and political system  and to manage its own affairs.""Furthermore  as the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States lies at the very heart of non-alignment  any such interference would be all the more reprehensible if committed by a member of our movement. We hope that the aspirations of the countries of the region for peace and stability will be realized on the basis of non-alignment principles of respect for sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  non-interference in internal affairs  non-use of force and non-aggression.""306.	The present political and economic situation in the world makes it apparent that no efforts towards relaxation of tension can succeed through the pursuit of a policy of balance of power and spheres of influence. Such a policy only created the competitive arms race between the power blocs and increased the present threat to international peace and security. There is indeed a pressing need to work towards finding ways and means for establishing lasting security for all States without exception. In view of this  we welcome the signing of the second SALT Treaty between the United States and the USSR. We hope it will lead to a third SALT agreement and will also encourage further measures towards real disarmament.307.	Developments in the area of the Middle East continue to pose a serious threat to international peace and security. A comprehensive and durable solution for peace continues to elude the parties concerned. The resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council remain unimplemented. Lebanon continues to suffer frequent violation of its territorial integrity. We have supported all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations on the problems of the Middle East in the hope that they will be taken into account in any serious negotiations.308.	While we respect the right of every State to enter into agreements in exercise of inalienable sovereign rights  we believe that the rights and aspirations of other peoples or States must not be jeopardized in the process. In our opinion  the problem of Palestine remains at the very heart of the situation in the Middle East. If there is to be a comprehensive and lasting solution of the problem  all parties concerned must be involved in the negotiations. We fully support the rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self- determination and to establish an independent State. At the same time  we respect the right of every State in the area to live within secure and recognized boundaries.309.	The United Nations Charter reaffirms ""faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person""  but the apartheid regime in Pretoria contemptuously continues to flout all United Nations resolutions promoting this concept. The United Nations must make consistent and concerted efforts to eradicate the obnoxious practices of apartheid. The programmes outlined in resolution 33/183 adopted by the General Assembly must be implemented by all  including the multinational corporations.310.	In Namibia  the rights of the people to self- determination are still being denied  despite the efforts of all concerned. Under the circumstances  we must halt further bantustanization in the area and respect the resolutions of the General Assembly by recognizing SWAPO as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Namibia.311.	While the situation in Zimbabwe is no better  we hope that the current peaceful negotiations will bring acceptable majority rule and peace to the people of Zimbabwe in the near future.312.	I share with many delegations the view that the world economy continues to suffer serious crises. These crises are symptomatic of underlying structural imbalances inherent in our global economic relations.313.	Economic developments since the Second World War have been characterized by rapid progress in the economies of the developed nations. Deprived of capital and technical know-how and also burdened with the colonial legacies of the past  the developing countries have barely managed to move away from the serious problems of under-development. The result has been widening polarization between the rich developed and the poor developing countries. These fundamental imbalances cannot be removed unless there is a profound restructuring of the global economic system. It seems even more true today that there can be no real or lasting peace unless an over-all development of all countries creates the conditions for the well-being of all peoples.314.	The negotiations between the North and South brought us limited results. We now realize that efforts towards establishing a new international economic order are moving at a slower pace than expected. The unwillingness  particularly of the rich nations  to face the problems together  is quite apparent from the results of the fifth session of UNCTAD held in Manila and in the recent meetings of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/ 174 and that of the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy.315.	At present  the world economy in both developed and developing countries is characterized by rising inflation  accelerating unemployment and a marked reduction in economic growth. We believe that economic progress everywhere requires more resources and more equitable distribution of those resources at the national and international levels. We are all aware that the widening disparities between the rich and poor nations cannot be reduced and that justice  equality and the genuine independence of all countries cannot be secured  unless there is a fundamental restructuring of international economic relations. If suitable measures are not taken immediately  the economies of the developing countries will continue to be weakened at an even more rapid rate than in the past.316.	This already complicated situation is further aggravated by the present energy-related problems. The dark shadow over the economies of the non-oil- producing developing countries  is a precursor of an even darker future.317.	The situation is at its worst in the least developed and land-locked developing countries as they are faced with paying increasing transportation costs as well as inflation transferred to their imports. The problem is even more critical as inflation and unstable exchange rates have already eroded the value of their multilateral and bilateral assistance. There is  however  a glimmer of hope presented by the decision taken at the fifth session of UNCTAD in Manila to launch a comprehensive and substantially expanded immediate action programme in favour of the least developed countries. The international community will have to find ways and means of implementing the action programme so as to help those geographically disadvantaged and most seriously affected developing countries.318.	The Kingdom of Bhutan is a land-locked country. In our efforts to achieve economic development  trade and transit facilities are vital for the well-being of our people and for the success of our development programmes. Fortunately  so far  we have received much understanding and assistance in this regard from our neighbour  India. The importance of transit facilities for us  however  cannot be overemphasized. We hope this unique problem of all land-locked countries will be viewed with sympathy by the entire international community.319.	In Bhutan  as elsewhere during this International Year of the Child  the welfare of young people is uppermost in our minds. Our hope for the future lies in our commitment to improving the lot of our children. Under the leadership of His Majesty the King  a national commission in Bhutan has drawn up a plan of action. By implementing this high-priority programme we hope to ensure that the younger generation will be able to realize its potential for a full and enriched life.320.	Our objective is to strive for self-reliance while assuming responsibility for the well-being of our people. In dealing with national and international issues we base our relationships with all countries on self- respect and respect for others  however diverse their views. We believe in peaceful coexistence and in furthering beneficial co-operation based on the principles of sovereign equality  respect for territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs. We set aside destructive competition in favour of productive cooperation. Finally  we oppose injustice in favour of creating a new  more just and equitable world order  so that the peoples of the world can live together in peace and prosperity."
"19",1104,"BWA",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  it gives me personally  and the entire Botswana delegation  great pleasure and satisfaction that you  a representative of the United Republic of Tanzania  a country with which Botswana has the most cordial of relations  have been elected President of the thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly. Your election speaks eloquently of your diplomatic experience and attests to your competence. It is a source of pride to Africa. While congratulating you  I also wish to thank your predecessor  whose presidency of the last session was impeccable. To the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  goes our special commendation for the dedication with which he has devoted himself in the past  and continues to devote himself at present  to grappling with the many world problems that face our Organization. His faith in the role played by the United Nations  his vision of its capabilities in the political  economic  social and humanitarian fields  and his determination to translate that faith and vision into a fulfilment of the objectives for which this Organization was created  have been a source of inspiration to many of us. We wish him continued strength and good health.302.	From the outset I wish to reaffirm Botswana's unswerving commitment to the ideals of our Organization. Although the United Nations has not always lived up to our highest expectations  it has proved itself to be the best forum yet  where all nations  regardless of size or economic circumstances  can meet to seek ways of resolving the various burning issues of our time.303.	The United Nations has always aspired to universality in its membership in order to enhance the world-wide exchange of ideas. We are pleased  therefore  to welcome Saint Lucia into this comity of nations. We congratulate the Government and people of that State on the occasion of the admission of their country to the United Nations.304.	The Good Book tells us that in the midst of life we are in death  and we therefore remember with affection our esteemed friend and neighbour Mr. Agostinho Neto  the President of the People's Republic of Angola  a great freedom fighter and statesman. His passing is a loss not only to Angola but to all of us  especially to those in southern Africa who are still struggling to liberate their countries from racism and minority rule  for he was totally committed to their cause. Our condolences go to the family of the late President and to the Government and people of Angola.305.	Multiple aspects of building the New International Economic Order to provide practical solutions for the real problems besetting the world economy have been discussed in various forums. What is required now is a firm resolve to create a suitable atmosphere in which positive results can be obtained towards finalizing the detailed modalities by means of which resolutions may be put into practice at the global  regional and sub regional levels. Only concerted  serious efforts and political goodwill on the part of all concerned will make the New International Economic Order a matter of practical reality. Action in that direction has already begun  but there is still a long way to go.306.	We are happy that an agreement has been reached on the fundamental elements of the Common Fund. We earnestly hope that final negotiations for making this institution operative will not be prolonged by divergent views on the utilization of the facility. The decision that the Common Fund would extend the use of its finances  through its second window  to measures other than for stocking commodities  is a major development.307.	The Second General Conference of UNIDO held in Lima  Peru  in 1975 recognized the low share contributed by developing countries to total world industrial production and declared that efforts should be made to increase their share to the maximum extent possible. Later in the same year  the General Assembly endorsed the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action on Industrial Development and Co-operation and asked UNIDO to organize consultations in the industrial field between developed and developing countries. Consultations on leather and leather products were held at Innsbruck  Austria and interested countries  including Botswana  have since sought assistance from UNIDO in keeping with the decision to encourage participation by developing countries in industrial production. Such efforts to put into practice the intentions of international forums should be appreciated and encouraged.308.	Botswana welcomes the establishment of UNIDO as a specialized agency of the United Nations and hopes it will be provided with sufficient resources to enable it to perform its task.309.	The Second United Nations Development Decade and its International Development Strategy are drawing to a disappointing close. My delegation is rather concerned that that fact has not sufficiently aroused in us  as an international community  a sense both of urgency and seriousness of purpose. We are still talking about protectionism. We are churning out more strategies with an even higher degree of disagreement. In the meantime  the special session of the General Assembly to establish the new international development strategy for the 1980s  to be held in 1980  is fast approaching.310.	Botswana is a land-locked country. Among its serious disadvantages is its geographical position in southern Africa. It is almost entirely surrounded by racist  minority-ruled States which face actual or contemplated economic sanctions and boycotts  the effects of which Botswana cannot escape. We look forward to the forthcoming United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries at which we hope that measures will be taken to lay down rational and equitable criteriaâother than those of gross national product and balance of paymentsâfor that group of countries  and to provide programmes of assistance to increase their self-reliance and strengthen their independence.311.	Botswana is greatly encouraged by the growing awareness on the part of developing countries of the vital importance of developing our collective self- reliance. Our varied resources should go to meet our varied needs. Regional and interregional co-operation should be fostered much more actively  with international support.312.	Fifteen years ago when the first session of UNCTAD was held  shock  dismay and resistance were displayed at the then tentative discussion of revising terms of trade  of identifying a resource gap and of a proposal for a generalized system of preferences. One could take the position after 15 years and endless conferences  when these are still agenda items  that little has been achieved. It is certainly true that  given the needs of my people and of the rest of the world  too little has been accomplished. It gives one some comfort  however  that there is now virtually universal recognition that the international economic arrangements which have evolved over generations are inadequate for everyone  and that modification alone is not what we seek. Those arrangements must be reformed  restructured  recreated and revolutionized. Both the will and the method to regroup are as yet inadequate  but both developed and developing countries are gradually recognizing that they have some interests which converge and that even their divergent interests need not be completely irreconcilable. Nothing much has yet been accomplished  save the basis for accomplishment.313.	Almost two decades ago  the General Assembly adopted resolution 1514 (XV) which heralded the ac-cession of many countries  including Botswana  to in-dependence. That was one of the greatest achievements of the United Nations. It is a sad commentary on our times to have to acknowledge that there remain a few colonial situations where the oppressed are still struggling to free themselves from domination and where oppression still clings desperately to power in a last- ditch but futile stand against the inexorable march of history and inevitable change.314.	The question of Western Sahara remains on our agenda despite the numerous General Assembly resolutions affirming the inalienable right of the Saharan people to self-determination and independence. Botswana has always supported the cause of the Saharan people because we hold sacred the right of any people to determine their own destiny. At its recent sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government at Monrovia  the OAU emphasized the urgent need to enable the Saharan people to exercise that right. We oppose Morocco's expansionism while we applaud the Government of Mauritania for abandoning its claim to Western Sahara and its recognition of the right of the people of that Territory to self-determination and independence. We urge the General Assembly to pronounce itself unequivocally on that issue.315.	We support the efforts being made by the Republic of the Comoros to achieve its territorial integrity and political unity through the reintegration of the island of Mayotte with the rest of the archipelago.â316.	We oppose the occupation of Cyprus by foreign forces and call for their immediate withdrawal. We regret the lack of progress in the intercommunal talks aimed at finding a just and lasting solution based on the Kyprianou-Denktas agreement of 19 May 1979. We urge the parties concerned to enter into serious negotiations so that non-aligned Cyprus can soon be united and live peacefully with its neighbours.317.	My country recognizes the Palestinian question as the core of the Middle East problem and believes that any agreement which fails to take full cognizance of that reality cannot hope to achieve the desired lasting solution to the problem. The question of Palestine should not be seen merely as a refugee problem  but as a question of the recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to determine their own future and to establish their own State. Due recognition should be given to the need for the PLO  as the representative of the Palestinian people  to participate in any dialogue designed to secure peace in the Middle East. Very strong concern should be expressed regarding the provocative act of the establishment of settlements in occupied areas.318.	Botswana affirms the right of all States in the Middle East to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. The search for an acceptable solution is an ongoing process and none can claim to have completed it yet. Botswana therefore urges all the parties involved to continue together to seek a settlement on a comprehensive and durable peace in the Middle East.319.	The aspiration of the Korean people to unite their divided country deserves the continued and objective support and encouragement of this Organization. We respect their expressed desire to have the discussion of the problem left to the Korean people themselves since only by that means can the hegemonistic support of one side or the other be eliminated. We urge the big Powers involved in the Korean issue to remove all the obstacles to the peace and security of the peninsula and exhort the Koreans of North and South to resume  without further delay  the dialogue aimed at unification of their country.320.	Another area of concern to Botswana as Hinterland State of the Indian Ocean is the creation of a zone of peace over those waters. We have observed with great concern the increasing military presence of the great Powers in the Indian Ocean over the past few years. Botswana supports the creation of peace zones wherever and whenever feasible  for we believe that the existence of such zones reduces the number of flashpoints and contributes towards disarmament. We therefore call upon the great Powers and other users of the Indian Ocean to co-operate in creating a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean  in accordance with the 1971 United Nations Declaration321.	The United Nations Territory of Namibia is still illegally occupied by South Africa despite the numerous United Nations resolutions calling upon it to withdraw from that Territory. The General Assembly is aware of the fact that progress in the Namibia issue came to a virtual halt when South Africa disputed the accuracy of the Secretary-General's report  and that the hopes raised by the diplomatic efforts of the five Western Powers for an early solution have been sorely disappointed despite the concessions made by SWAPO in the interest of a peaceful settlement. South Africa delayed progress towards United Nations-supervised elections and Namibian independence by insisting that SWAPO bases in neighbouring States should be monitored by the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and by rejecting the restriction of SWAPO freedom fighters to their bases in Namibia. In the meantime  it was introducing changes in Namibia which cast serious doubt on its willingness to co-operate with the United Nations  the five Western Powers and SWAPO to end the war. The Constituent Assembly was upgraded to the status of a National Assembly with legislative powers. This is a direct contradiction of South Africa's assurances that the bogus elections of 4 December 1978 would in no way alter the status of Namibia and is in defiant contempt for Security Council resolution 439 (1978) which declared them null and void. The harassment and arbitrary arrest and detention of the members of SWAPO continues. This can only be interpreted as an attempt to stifle opposition through intimidation. The appointment of the Chairman of the Broederbond as Administrator-General of the Territory lends itself to diverse interpretations.322.	Attacks launched against Angola and Zambia from this international Territory are a direct challenge to international peace as well as to the United Nations itself. If all these policies do not add up to an attempt to obstruct progressâdespite the assurances of the ""open door""âit is difficult to say what would.323.	The international community should resist any attempt by South Africa to side-track the issue and should continue to support both the struggle of the people of Namibia for self-determination and the initiatives to bring that struggle to a successful end. The Namibian problem must be resolved without further delay if we are to arrest the impending disaster.324.	Botswana congratulates SWAPO on its readiness to co-operate in advancing the course of a peaceful settlement. We welcome the resumption of negotiations to resolve the problem. We hope that the constructive proposal of a demilitarized zone along the Namibian border will be seen as a genuine effort to reassure South Africa of the continued determination of the front-line States to secure honourable independence for Namibia.325.	The war of liberation in Rhodesia continues to exact a heavy toll on the inhabitants of that country. In August the Rhodesia regime conceded that 600 people has been killed that month. This was the highest figure reported for any given month throughout the entire history of the war. On 27 September  the Rand Daily Mail  a South African newspaper  reported that 569 people had been killed thus far in the month of September. Attacks against the neighbouring States of Angola  Botswana  Mozambique and Zambia have also increased not only in frequency but also in intensity and in the degree of adventurism with which they are carried out. In early September military headquarters in Rhodesia reported their having made land and air attacks against troops of the Mozambican army in addition to guerrilla bases. A week ago the rebel regime mounted a five-day incursion into Mozambique as a so-called self-defence operation.â326.	Such attacks not only bring suffering and death  they also destroy much propertyâbridges  hospitals  schools  fuel dumpsâand inflict economic hardships upon innocent people. The number of refugees in the neighbouring countries is also mounting.327.	As a Commonwealth country  Botswana is party to the Final Communique' of the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held at Lusaka in August  which led to the Constitutional Conference on Zimbabwe now being held in London. We reaffirm our commitment to genuine majority rule for the people of Zimbabwe and to all the necessary internationally acceptable steps to be taken to achieve independence for the Territory. We note the optimism for progress expressed by Lord Carrington  the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  while we appreciate the difficulties which still remain. We are hopeful that the hardships  killings  destruction of property and homelessness suffered by the people of Rhodesia will strengthen the resolve of all those involved in the discussions to reach a settlement acceptable to all. In the meantime  and in the interest of progress and peace  Botswana wishes to urge those who are not directly involved in the Rhodesia issue to refrain from making such pronouncements or initiating such actions as can only hinder and frustrate these delicate negotiations. I refer in particular to any talk of the lifting of sanctions either to facilitate trade or for any other reason whatever. Our best service to the people of Rhodesia at this stage is to encourage them to continue negotiations to resolve the dispute and achieve an internationally acceptable settlement.328.	Fundamental to the political problems of southern Africa is the practice of apartheid  a system of human relationships based on a theory of racial inequalities which has been given institutionalized expression in the policy of separate development and which has been entrenched in law.329.	New realities  which even South Africa must acknowledge  have been brought to bear by the United Nations General Assembly and its Charter and commit-tees  the accession of colonial territories to independence  the OAU and its principles and objectives  which are aimed at the liberation of peoples still under racist minority domination and  more recently  by the defeat of Portuguese imperialism in Africa.330.	As a logical extension of its policy of apartheid  South Africa created the so-called independent Bantustans for separate and vertical development. In our view  these divisionsâthis separation of peopleâis designed to arouse and foment ethnic animosities  and to destroy the unity of nationalism. Botswana  with the rest of the international community  does not recognize those Bantustans. We wish that our brothers in those Bantustans could understand the reasons for our position. It is not that we begrudge them independence while we enjoy oursâno. Nor is it for any reason other than that we are opposed to racism  apartheid and the ethnic separation of people which denies them the sharing of political power in their own country. The people of South Africa themselves  whether as liberation movements or even as Soweto schoolchildren  have begun much more actively to challenge the status quo.331.	We are aware of the reported expression of concern by some rulers of South Africa on subjects ranging from the opening of restaurants and the extension of trade-union rights to Africans  to the notorious Mixed Marriages Act and the Immorality Act. But these are peripheral to the central issue  which is: one South Africa for all South Africans  black and white  equal and free. Until this is achieved  the struggle for liberation is bound to continue.332.	Unrest and bloodshed could be rendered un-necessary only if South Africa would engage in dialogue among all its nationals to end racism and apartheid and acknowledge the inalienable right of all its people to citizenship.333.	The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  pointed  as indeed you yourself did  Mr. President  to the human tragedy of displaced persons and refugees and to the positive results achieved at the Arusha meeting on African refugees and the Geneva meeting on South-East Asian refugees and displaced persons held on 20 and 21 July 1979. We note with gratitude the commitment of additional assistance to refugees made by States Members of this Organization.334.	With over 10 million refugees in the world  4 million of whom are in Africa alone  we have a problem of great magnitude which calls for bold  co-operative and imaginative measures. Our first task as Members of the United Nations  and one that lies within our competence  is to create in our own States such conditions as will ensure the security of all our citizens and even guarantee a safe return to those willing to go back to their homes.335.	In countries still suffering from minority rule and racism  refugees must be viewed as part of the liberation process  a result of the people's struggle for the right to self-determination. States Members of the United Nations should therefore match their commitment to the emancipation and liberation of oppressed peoples with the acceptance of their answerability  and therefore responsibility  for their welfare. The burden should not be left solely to the countries of first asylum  among which are the world's poor. Distance from the centres of war and strife should provide no excuse for non-participation.336.	Botswana is grateful for the assistance it has received from individual States  non-governmental organizations and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. For its part  Botswana will continue  to the extent of its limited resources and in fulfilment of its internationalist duty  to give asylum and care to our fellow-men from the minority-ruled countries of southern Africa.337.	In the final analysis  however  the only lasting solution to this problem is the removal of its root- causes: colonialism  oppression  the denial of basic human rights  and conflicts among nations.338.	It may sound strange that an arid  land-locked country such as Botswana should show interest in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Yet it is true not only that we attach great importance to it but that we hope and urge that the interests of developing and disadvantaged States like Botswana will be taken into account in the formulation of the envisaged convention on the law of the sea.â339.	We regret that the final outcome of that Conference is still uncertain and that the modest but essential conditions for the acceptance of the regime of the law of the sea put forward by the developing countries seem to be being used by the industrialized nations to block a successful conclusion to that historic Conference. My delegation appeals to those nations to ensure that the outstanding issues do not frustrate progress.340.	The bilateral and international relations of the Republic of Botswana are governed by its respect for the sovereign equality of States. We recognize that the diversity of ideological orientations among States stems  in many ways  from their varied colonial and historical experience and the means and methods of their liberationâa development from a prevailing set of circumstances at a given time and place.341.	We respect the uniqueness of the circumstances in which political philosophies have evolved and continue to evolve in different countries. We seek and expect respect for the integrity of our own peculiar history and independence as we do for those of others. We value our political and economic system but we do not assume that it should be imposed on others or theirs on us. We are non-aligned and we uphold the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of others  and peaceful coexistence among States.342.	All too often the historical and cultural differences from which a diversity of political  economic and social systems has developed and is still developing are perceived and used as bases for division  and not for the strengthening of the international community. This  in the view of Botswana  is an unfortunate development  for to choose one's position  whether for or against another's ideology  is to risk losing one's own integrity  one's own independence and the opportunity to build on diversity.343.	It is in the light of these principles that the position of Botswana in international affairs should be understood."
"20",1148,"CAF",34,1979,"ï»¿A world in crisis  mankind in disarray  in peril  in danger of being swept away in a general conflagration  in an apocalyptic cataclysm  which it must ward off to make sure that the human race survives  chronic economic and financial disorder based on obsolete theories and definitions  insensitive to the inevitable changes brought by time  which it must redress and rationalize if it wishes to bring peace and justice to the worldâthis  in rough outline  is the picture of the international situation  fraught with dangers and pitfalls  racked by anxiety and anguish  which we should think about and study during this thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly  so as to try to find  in the spirit of harmonious and calm co-operation which has always characterized our Organization  appropriate solutions to the multiple and complex problems besetting the universe that recent developments require.41.	But this thoughtful analysis requires us to go beyond what we already know  beyond the possible and the imaginable. We must go beyond the boundaries of thought to discover the sources which inspired human genius  not to cause the destruction and the disappearance of mankind but  on the contrary  to bring about its happiness and well-being.42.	These thoughts should be pondered by our Assembly during the present session in order to apprehend  encompass and grasp the immensity and the scope  the urgency and importance of the task which requires of our Organization political will and a more decisive and more sustained commitment.43.	This brief introduction at once places the main concerns of my delegation before the present session of the Assembly and is the message of our faith in the destiny of the United Nations.44.	Therefore  at this very late stage in the general debate  I should like to associate my delegation with the heartfelt congratulations addressed to Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim by the eminent speakers who have spoken before me from this rostrum on the occasion of his outstanding and unchallenged election to the presidency of our Assembly. The unanimity of his election does honour to the whole of Africa  a well-balanced continent with a bright future  and to the United Republic of Tanzania  a country which  after a short period of independence  has shown its vitality  its dynamism and its political maturity  and which is seeking to make  with conviction and resolve  a major contribution towards spreading the noble ideals of our Organization and of world peace. The large body of experience of that skilled and seasoned diplomat in international problems is  for my delegation  a comforting augury of success.45.	With respect to Mr Lievano  that writer and statesman whose eminent qualities we have appreciated  his competence and the mastery with which he guided the previous session has merited the satisfaction of my delegation  as well as that of others. We should like to extend to him our sincere thanks.46.	To Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our indefatigable Secretary-General  who is completely devoted to the cause of our Organization  whose tireless efforts to restore credibility and confidence in the United Nations and in world peace  so fragile and precarious  so threatened but so desired by all  are well known to us  I should like to reaffirm the total support of my Government and the people of the Central African Republic in his activities. May the wishes of my delegation for his success be with him wherever he goes in his efforts to strengthen peace.47.	Furthermore  we note with satisfaction that the universality of our Organization  enshrined by the Charter  is being reaffirmed more every day with the admission of new Members  which come here every year to expand and strengthen its activities to bring about the consolidation of its vocation  which  though still Utopian at San Francisco  has now become a dynamic reality and a vital need which mankind has been forced to face.48.	My delegation  therefore  welcomes with great joy and pardonable pride the entry of Saint Lucia to the great family of the international community. We are convinced that the recent struggle that it waged to recover its inalienable rights and the heavy price that it paid  as well as its unquenchable thirst for justice  freedom and independence are valid reasons for my delegation to believe in its profound devotion to peace and its unswerving determination to be part of the common effort to contribute to the full implementation of the will expressed at San Francisco. Therefore  I take special pleasure in welcoming that country to our Organization and in expressing  on behalf of my country  my delegation and on my own behalf  warmest wishes for ever-growing happiness and prosperity for its valiant and courageous people.49.	Since the thirty-second session  our Organization has gone through a very important stage  abounding in events which have marked international life  threatened by the curbing or even the shattering of its vitality and of its resolve for renewed activity  its efforts to adapt to the need for inevitable changes which stem from the requirements of the modern world. That ardent desire for a fresh start  that deep and legitimate aspiration for peace and international security should  in our opinion  be expressed by a more sustained and decisive will and political commitment courageously to face events of all kinds in order to dispel the uncertainty and the threats which weigh heavily on the future of mankind and to break down the contradictions of our Organization which weaken its action and paralyse its momentum.50.	Having said that  I should like to proceed  as briefly as possible  to a retrospective examination of the international political situation. A world-wide approach  which is indispensable for this examination  reveals murky areas as well as bright spots in the world political sky  which we want to be pure and calm. Despite the laudable efforts made by our Organization to maintain international peace and security  to establish a new international economic order  the world situation remains marked by threats of conflict  injustice and socio-economic inequalities.51.	The world of tomorrow  a better world  a world of justice and freedom  of moral values  will not come about through a distorting prism or through preconceived ideas. Intelligence  which has allowed man to make prodigious progress  to push forward the bounds of knowledge  must be placed at the service of his emancipation for the realization of his most legitimate aspirations and his most elementary rights. One of the great acts of courage that will have to be accomplished by the world community in modern times will be the categorical and definitive rejection of those obsolete stereotypes  to bring about a more dynamic future  resolutely turned towards the search for the well-being and happiness of man. One of the traits of modern man is his propensity for new ideas which bring about progress.52.	After that appraisal of this no less important aspect of the responsibilities and political obligations of our Organization  I should like now to undertake an more in-depth discussion of recent world events which  because of their political  military  social  economic and cultural impact  continue to dominate international affairs  raising the spectre of an apocalyptic war and postponing the prospects of true international peace and security to which mankind legitimately aspires. An analysis of these events reveals a pattern of confrontation of divergent interests and the implacable antagonism of established ideological systems. Will mankind succumb to these contradictions  or will it take up the challenge and achieve justice and peace?53.	In truth  the manifestations of that antagonism and confrontation have been felt most recently in Africa and Asia  continents which have now become the favourite terrain for hegemonistic conflicts waged by the great Powers for the dissemination of their ideologies in order to widen their spheres of influence.54.	A cradle of humanism which has managed to resist the pernicious assaults of the vicissitudes of time  Africa has been able  since time immemorial  to make its notable contribution to the universal spread of culture  a source of emancipation. Africa is today a theatre of ideological confrontation manifested in the field by pockets of tension.55.	Heedless of the irreversible winds of independence which have been blowing throughout the world  in Africa  in Asia  and in Latin America; deaf to the desperate cries of peoples fighting tooth and nail for their freedom and independence; and insensitive to the human suffering of the developing countries  those great Powers continue to organize and maintain their ideological rivalries and their political  military and economic competition to delay the advent of total and final decolonization.56.	The fight being waged here and there for the full exercise of people's right to self-determination and to the free choice of their socio-economic systems has always been  and will always be  a liberation struggle. It will always triumph  as it has already triumphed  over obscurantism and imperialist forces  however mighty they may be  because it responds to the deep aspirations of those who wage it  and because nothing can resist that combat. It is a source of hope that victory will finally be won.57.	To say the least  it is regrettable that the Western Powers that still give multilateral support to the champions of one of most abhorrent and barbarous forms of colonialismâloathsome racism which  entrenched in southern Africa  the last bastion of an anachronistic era  has been institutionalized in the name of goodness- knows-what philosophyâcannot learn the lessons of history and face the truth about our modern times.58.	Undoubtedly  Africa is now turning one of the most tragic pages in the history of its decolonization  of which the most recent moving  pathetic  cruel and barbarous episodes are occurring now in its southern part.59.	Hence  regarding the Zimbabwe situation  my Government has  here as elsewhere  had occasion to express grave concern over the threat to international peace and security posed by the situation in that country due to the constant and deliberately abusive violation of the most sacred human rights and by the systematic refusal to transfer power to the majority. Moreover  my delegation has always considered that any final solution aimed at genuine peace must of necessity  and quite obviously  involve the Patriotic Front  the sole representative of the people of Zimbabwe. In other words  any proposed settlement which leaves out the Patriotic Front is doomed to failure. Muzorewa and Smith have just learned this bitter lesson after the rigged elections the results of which were rejected and condemned out of hand by the entire international community.60.	That is why my delegation welcomes with satisfaction and relief the specific proposals adopted at the historic Lusaka Conference.  We are convinced that the Commonwealth Conference will be able to exert its influence in the practical implementation of those agreements  which mark an historic watershed in the history of Africa.61.	By the very nature of the unimaginably far- reaching dimensions and implications of the conflict  the United Nations  that guarantor of total decolonization  which is one of the basic purposes and principles of its Charter  must reaffirm and assume its responsibilities in this matter.62.	As for Namibia  the situation prevailing in that part of Africa continues to arouse deep concern. The more time that passes  the more remote are the chances for a lasting and final solution  and the more critical is the situation. That is why  in my delegation's view  only the strict implementation of relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and especially Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 485 (1979}âcan enable the people of Namibia  under the banner of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  its sole representative  to achieve its deep legitimate aspirations to total peace  freedom and independence within a framework of respect for Namibia's unity and territorial integrity. Therefore  my country solemnly reaffirms its full support for SWAPO  that spearhead of the armed struggle of the Namibian people  as well as the pledge of our continued unreserved support for all efforts to bring about the total elimination of apartheid  that disgrace to ethical behaviour and a defiance of the international community.63.	Along the same lines  I should like to reassure the front-line States of my country's sincere fraternal support. We reiterate to them  with the same faith and conviction as always  our entire solidarity.64.	Concerning Western Sahara  the Central African Republic  in its deep devotion to freedom  peace and independence  unreservedly supports the efforts undertaken here and elsewhere to bring about a just and lasting settlement of this highly volatile issue. We endorse  in a spirit of solidarity  the decisions taken at the Monrovia Conference by the Organization of African Unity [OAU].  In my delegation's view  any just and equitable solution must be based on self-determination. That is why my delegation wishes to pay a well- deserved tribute to the Government of Mauritania  which has just strikingly demonstrated its staunch political maturity by signing the Algiers agreement. That was a courageous and wise decision redounding to the honour of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and  indeed  to the whole continent of Africa.65.	The Middle East  a land of conquest since time immemorial  a haven of refuge and the cradle of the worldâs three great monotheistic religions  a hallowed ground of tolerance and a source of justice and brotherhood is today  as a paradox of history  the theatre of one of the most murderous  abominable wars and one of the most implacable  divisive conflicts weighing on the human conscience. The situation prevailing in that part of the world  which is so close to Africa  is a continuing source of deep concern to my country.66.	Fanned by great-Power struggles for influence  earned on through proxies  and dominated by passion and emotion  the situation prevailing in that region battered by a long destructive war constantly threatens humanity with general conflagration  so enormous are the risks of explosion 67.	In the opinion of my delegation  a just and lasting peace  so ardently desired by the people concerned  can be achieved only in the framework of a comprehensive settlement. Furthermore  we consider that a joint effort among the parties to a dispute is not always incompatible with the goals sought  because any frank dialogue is constructive; but in order for it to be so  passion must yield to reason  which is a source of enlightenment.68.	That is why my country will support all efforts and initiatives taken here or elsewhere to bring about a peaceful atmosphere and a return to calm Leading to real peace. In this respect  my delegation considers that the Camp David agreements are not necessarily negative  for they are based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).69.	In stating this  I wish solemnly to proclaimâ should there still be need to do soâthat the exercise by the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights is one of the prerequisites to a final solution to this conflict. At the same time  the right of the State of Israel to exist within secure and recognized borders should be acknowledged in accordance with the letter and spirit of those same resolutions  to which my country fully subscribed at the time of their adoption.70.	In bringing up the burning and complex problem of the Middle East  I cannot but recall another bloody and odious tragedy which is rending Lebanon asunder. That country is now the theatre of a violent  bloody and destructive confrontation. The national unity and identity of Lebanon  as well as its territorial integrity  are placed in permanent jeopardy by the escalation of the violence in which the parties are locked.71.	It is my hope that once peace is restored to the Middle East all the Lebanese communities will quell their animosity and quarrels to bring about the national reconciliation which is the only guarantee of the security and independence of Lebanon and which would enable its populations to devote themselves to the task of reconstruction.72.	In this same Mediterranean region the situation in Cyprus  which has remained deadlocked for many years  continues to cause us deep concern. Hence the resumption of the intercommunal talks announced during the Secretary-General's mission last June seemed to bring a glimmer of hope for a return to peace for the valiant and dynamic Cypriot people.73.	But the suspension of those negotiations owing to the profound divergences which exist between the parties to the dispute has quickly cast a pall of doubt over the real will of the two communities to expedite a satisfactory solution. In the opinion of my delegation  all efforts must be pursued to reopen the negotiations in order to bring about a final  just and lasting settlement which would preserve the national unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus.74.	Finally  in South-East Asia  Korea is another source of concern to my country  which  faithful to its policy of dialogue and adamantly opposed to the use of force as a means of settling conflicts between States  is deeply convinced that this is a problem which is of concern first and foremost to the Korean people themselves. The division of a people and of a nation is one of the most harrowing  odious and cruel tragedies there are: an identity and culture run the risk of being shattered and of disappearing. This illustrates how deeply my country is disturbed by the tragedy which is tearing apart the heroic  friendly people of Korea. It is why I exhort the two parties not to do anything which might aggravate a situation which is already tense  and where there is a major risk of flare-up and general conflagration. The price already exacted from the Korean people by its division is too great.75.	This is why my country hopes sincerely that the two parties will renew their dialogue as quickly as possible to bring about the national independent and democratic reunification of Korea on the basis of the principles set forth in the joint communique of 4 July 1972. 76.	At a time when the United Nations Disarmament Decade is drawing to a close  it is encouraging to note  without being unduly optimistic  that the tenth special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to general and complete disarmament and was held on the initiative of the non-aligned countries  was an important historic event. For the first time  thanks to the wide-ranging debate to which that session gave rise  world opinion became aware of the gravity of the situation created by the frenzied aims race and of its political implications and apocalyptic consequences for international peace and security.77.	My delegation therefore is justly pleased at the signing of the agreement concluded as a result of the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT].  It considers the agreement to be a major positive contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security  which are so dear to our Organization. The SALT agreement can be considered as a point of departure for the continuation of talks and as an example encouraging the quest for realistic solutions  based on compromise  to disarmament problems and to controversial political problems.78.	Permit me to devote the last part of my statement to the current situation in my country  the Central African Republic.79.	The dawn of 20 September 1979 saw the rise of a new sun  radiant in the Central African skies: a sun unmatched in its splendour except by the new hopes  the indomitable will of the people of the Central African Republic to burst the chains of oppression and tyranny; a sun calling the Central African people to wrest its own destiny from the controlling hands of a power condemned by history; a sun lighting the way for the Central African people towards a brighter morrow  fully devoted to its internal growth and to its positive contribution in its relations with others. For 13 years Central Africa knew weeping and wailing  unspeakable treatment: a veritable nightmare. For 13 years  Central Africa knew torture  assassination and death. For 13 years  Central Africa knew bloodshed: the blood of its many sons and daughters who disappeared into the maw of the night and fell under a hail of machine-gun fire. This is why the people of the Central African Republic today values at its full worth their return to peace and quiet  to liberty and to their role in the comity of free nations. For 13 years Central Africaâaccounted until then peaceful and hard-workingâexperienced a political  social and economic retrogression rarely experienced in the history of nations. Our tentacular institutions were characterized only by confusion and inefficiency.80.	The national party  the Social Evolution Movement of Black Africa  no longer expressed the will of the people  but became the instrument of their regimentation and oppression. It was a party with no political or ideological direction  a party in a quagmire of immobility  unreasonableness and superstition. It freely manipulated the working masses  men  women and children  who served only as conveyor belts to pass along the arbitrary edicts of a despotic power. The party leaders were uneducated  deaf to the needs of the masses and ignorant of public affairs. They were recruited solely on the basis of their ethnic origin  their servility and their greed.81.	Parliamentary power and life were non-existent; the judiciary was in bondage; and governmental responsibilities were confused because they were two- headed  and exercised in fact by a single man surrounded by an entourage which  although superficially respectable  consisted in truth of adventurers and executioners. Decrees  orders and commands were drawn up extemporaneously  amid uncertainty  negligence  inefficiency  intimidation and torpor.82.	Its very substance gone  the administration was paralysed by lack of credit  deficits  and the frustration and under-utilization of its staff  as well as its senior officials  whose careers now faced a precarious future. It was staffed with people recruited on the basis of favouritism and nepotism  who collected State funds while performing no precise function. Drained and in disorder  the administration was totally hamstrung in its various services.83.	Diplomacy was conducted on the basis of alliances which came and went; it was unpredictable  inconsistent and enjoyed no credibility on the international scene.84.	The State police  compliant and corrupt  yielded to a parallel police and guard force that were overstaffed and lusting for blood.85.	The State funds were managed arbitrarily as though they were a private inheritance  for the benefit of a single man.86.	In the social field  all rights and freedoms were suppressed and the individual had an interminable series of duties.87.	Education was elitist  in a state of decline both from the pedagogical and from the infrastructural point of view. Health services were defective and there was an undetermined growth in the mortality rate.88.	These are a few of the main features of our uncertain political and social life which depended on the whims and follies of a megalomaniac who was always and only interested in titles  honours and money.89.	Although gagged  although not enjoying a single moment of freedom  threatened with physical harm  arbitrary arrest  torture and physical annihilation  the people of Central Africa always resisted and fought  proud and upright  against tyranny and arbitrariness.90.	Even the stages of our fight for freedom were marked by coups and attempts at assassination in the years 1969  1973  1974  1975 and 1976. The establishment in 1977 of a monarchic  autocratic and reactionary regime encouraged our people to fight with fresh vigour and new determination in their anxiety to achieve victory.91.	It is with the blood of our martyred children  of the men and women who fell last January and April  that the people of the Central African Republic  inspired by their instinctive attachment to freedom  appealed to the only democratically elected leader  President David Dacko  who was elected in 1964  to bring down the regime which had been repudiated and condemned by Africa and the world.92.	The people of Central Africa did this because they had an overriding duty so to do. They could not remain silent; they could not continue to be subject to a regime which had killed so many of their courageous sons and daughters. They did so because of a moral obligationâ an obligation arising from the support it had received from the international community  in the forefront of which I should mention Amnesty International and various similar non-governmental organizations  as well as France and all those countries who have been friends of the Central African Republic.93.	What could be more natural  then  for a people that had been long in bondage  long deprived of freedom  than to appeal to their friends for assistance to ensure security? What could be more natural than for that people  in resisting a power which had violated even their very conscience  to do what they could to guarantee their own freedom?94.	That is why I wish to tell the community of the United Nations that the outside assistance which the Central African Republic requested from France in the exercise of its sovereignty to maintain security throughout our country was quite proper. It was proper legally because it was provided for in co-operation agreements made between our two States. It is proper politically because it was requested by Central African patriots and democrats. It is also morally proper because it was the only way to avoid needless bloodshed in a country which has already suffered enough.95.	Be that as it may  the presence of the French Army in the Central African Republic is temporary. It will remain there until the Central African armed forces are reorganized. That is the desire which was expressed by the people during the support march for the President of the Republic  which was held on 23 September 1979.96.	The people of the Central African Republic in expressing that desire did not wish to sell their sovereignty or their wealth. The new regime which we are trying to promote in Central Africa is keenly aware of the sacred nature of its sovereignty and wealth.97.	That is why I wish  on behalf of the Central African Republic and its Government  solemnly to thank France and all those countries and international organizations which joined us in our victorious struggle against an oppressive and anachronistic regime.98.	In expressing this gratitude  I cannot conceal the bitter disappointment of my country over the culpable silence of the United Nations and of the OAU regarding the suffering of the people of the Central African Republic in face of the massive and flagrant violations of human rights in the name of the sacred principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States.99.	Those institutions  whose basic principles depend on the protection of human rights and freedoms without distinction as to race  sex  language or religion  will never be able to do anything useful until they stop being a syndicate of dictatorial  oppressive Governments. Those organizations will gain incomparably in stature if they rid themselves of many of their outmoded  obsolete and irrelevant principles  whenever they have to deal with victims of genocide  torture or killing at the hands of brutal or oppressive dictators.100.	The time is ripe for my country  the Central African Republic  to create a democratic State structure. Our goal will be to create a society with no exploitation  humiliation or dictatorshipâa society based on justice and on the full development of every human being.101.	The Central African Government has already overhauled its political  administrative and social institutions and it remains convinced that nothing lasting can be achieved without an effective promotion of fundamental human rights and freedoms.102.	The Central African people have just turned a sorrowful page of their history and have given themselves a provisional government which we trust will give us a fresh start. The Government knows that the task ahead will be long. Everything has to be rebuilt within the framework of our recovered national unity. Our Government has established a dialogue with various groups which were fighting from outside our country against the Bokassa regime and whose main leaders are now meeting in Bangui. That dialogue should lead to a programme of joint action.â103.	The Central African Republic is fundamentally attached to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the ideals of peace  justice and co-operation  which have been laid down in the Charter of the United Nations and that of the OAU. As soon as it was reinstated  the Central African Republic immediately restored all freedoms of which the people had been deprived for nearly 14 years and it declared that it would uphold any earlier agreements entered into with other Powers whose provisions are not contrary to the higher interests of the people of Central Africa.104.	I wish now solemnly to proclaim our faith in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We vow to spare no effort to promote the creation  functioning and effectiveness of the instruments which have been adopted in the United Nations and in the OAU in order to give concrete meaning to this noble objective.105.	The people of Central Africa  whose very con-science had for 13 years been violated  are keenly aware of the size of the job ahead. They are convinced that theirs is a task which is also facing the Governments of the entire international community.106.	In the field of international relations  I wish to say that for the first time in 13 dark years the Central African Republic is happy and proud to make its voice heard in the concert of nations as a free and sovereign State.107.	That is why I wish to proclaim that in its foreign relations the Central African Republic will pursue a new form of active diplomacy devoted solely to its full development. It will try to gain respect for the principles of good neighbourliness  the peaceful settlement of disputes  free co-operation and mutual benefit  non-interference in the internal affairs of States  non- alignment and support for the just struggle of all oppressed peoples.108.	Together with a political situation that had deteriorated seriously  we were facing a catastrophic economic situation. The country was in a state of complete bankruptcy.109.	His Excellency Mr. David Dacko  the President of the Republic  concerned himself with this situation immediately when  after taking power  he stated:""For 13 years the country has been exploited by a person who had himself proclaimed Emperor but who demeaned the country in the eyes of the world by his excesses  his ridiculous behaviour and his megalomania. The country is in a state of ruin. The economy has been destroyed.""There are no more roads  no trade  no production. Public funds and foreign assistance have been misappropriated by Bokassa and deposited in accounts in Switzerland and in Europe.""110.	That statement obviously needs no further comment. But to give members a clearer picture  and to help them better to understand the economic stagnation that Bokassa and his accomplices brought upon our country  I should give the following details.111.	In the area of agriculture  production as a whole started to decline in 1969. In 1978  the decline was 70 per cent of the initial global figure. The production of cotton  our leading export  declined from 60 000 tons in 1969-1970 to 28 000 tons in 1977-1978. That drop in agricultural production can be accounted for in a number of ways 112.	First  there is the fact that in order better to exploit the peasants Bokassa and his accomplices all set themselves up as official purchasers of agricultural products and through unpopular measures that could be contested by no one  had blocked the producers' purchasing prices while selling prices were constantly soaring in the markets of the world.113.	Then there is the fact that the organizations for agricultural credit that had been set up to give loans to peasants or producers' co-operatives were all in the hands of Bokassa and his accomplices. One had to belong to those circles in order to have any right to the services of those institutions.114.	The non-reimbursement of loansâmoney from which had been accumulated and misappropriated by the caste of privileged individuals in the fallen regimeâ destroyed the organizations that could have played an important role in agricultural development in the Central African Republic. Support for the peasants and agricultural popularization campaigns were completely done away with. The disastrous state of the roadsâ almost all the bridges had been destroyedâmade communications between the provinces and the capital  on the one hand  and among the provinces  on the other  very difficult. Credits or subsidies for highway maintenance had been systematically misappropriated by Bokassa and his agents.115.	To these causes we might add the near disappearance of almost the entire social infrastructure in the provinces  and in particular dispensaries  which were in a state of ruin and devoid of medicines. Thus the rural masses were exposed to illnesses of all kinds  which led to a significant increase in the mortality rate.116.	I might also stress that the practice of making payments by cheques that were not always honoured by the Central African Treasury was a source of no solace to the peasants.117.	In mining  one witnessed the plundering of diamonds by Bokassa. Production  which in 1965-1966 was at the 1 500 000-carat level  went down to 300 000 carats in 1977-1978. Bokassa was always parading around with a suitcase full of uncut diamonds  which he used as collateral for his debts.118.	In spite of a chronic budget deficit amounting to more than 4 billion CFA francs  equal to $US 16 million  Bokassa continued to display delusions of grandeur and a propensity for spending on prestige projects. This megalomania attained its height with the infamous coronation ceremony  and  although all businessmen  citizens and foreigners in Central Africa had to make a contribution  that ceremony emptied the coffers of the public Treasury.119.	After that date  the State was  to all practical intents and purposes  in default. Some of our diplomats abroad had to suffer worse forms of humiliation. The size of the external debt increased fivefold  and the contributions of the Central African Republic to the budgets of various international organizations were no longer fully paid. This is a disgraceful state of affairs  but it is the truth.120.	The economy of the country was completely destroyed. It was a country without any financial resources  a country whose schools had fallen into ruin  a country in which epidemics broke out in rural zones because of the lack of medicines in dispensaries and hospitals. Such is the legacy of the bloodthirsty tyrant Bokassa.121.	The Central African Republic  in a state of ruin  now needs reconstruction. It must rebuild its economic infrastructure that was destroyed. It must rebuild its schools. It needs medicines; it needs food assistance. Now more than ever before the Central African Republic feels the need for urgent assistance from the international community for its national reconstruction.122.	As a land-locked country  the Central African Republic feels more strongly than any other the impact of the world economic crisis that has existed since 1973  the worst effects of which were amplified in our country by the unbridled greed of our fallen dictator.123.	The world economy is now in veritable crisis. This crisis stems partly from a deterioration in the terms of trade  from the introduction of protectionist measures by the developed countries  from monetary instability  from the inability of most countries to meet the targets set for development assistance  and  more generally  from their lack of the political courage to implement the decisions of the international community regarding the establishment of a new international economic order.124.	The more serious effects of the crisis have hit the developing countries very hard  especially the least advanced countries  including mine. The fact that the international community has been unable to close the gap between the rich and the poor should encourage it to seek solutions to this problem as a matter of great urgency  because  in the final analysis  the economic well-being of all nations guarantees international peace and security.125.	That is why  to return to my country  I would say that in restoring peace and security my Government needs assistance from the international community.126.	The Central African Republic is a rich and fertile land  and our people  though beaten and battered  are full of talent and imagination. We need financial  material and technological assistance from the international community if we are to mobilize our resources for national rebuilding and reconstruction. We earnestly hope that the United Nations will help us to revive our hopes.127.	Thirty-four years have already passed. They have been decisive years in the course of which the forward march of self-determination of peoples has constantly established the frontiers of many nations of America  Asia and Africa that earlier were in bondage. That is  perhaps  a short period in the life of nations  but it has been an eventful period  with much sound and fury  with crises and successes arising out of the irreversible and explosive change going on throughout the world. There have been crises and sound and fury in the wealthier countries as well as in the poor countries. There has been a crisis of poverty and lack of equipment. There has been a crisis of over-armament. There has been a crisis of identity and sovereignty in many countries that have been victims of the world-wide balance-of-power game played by the super-Powers. Peoples are still deprived of freedom and are crying out. There has been an economic and financial crisis  and a social crisis. And mankind has experienced a profound crisis as it has awakened to its own ugliness  cruelty and moral poverty. There are many evils to do away with  but there are just as many achievements behind us. After all  in spite of its diverse membership  the United Nations has in 34 years preservedâalbeit within rather precarious limits  at times perhapsâinternational peace and security  understanding and dialogue. It has been a bastion for the protection of the sovereignty of newly independent States. It has been a forum for the struggle for emancipation of peoples still under the colonial yoke.128.	This is the pinnacle of achievement of this century. That is the direction our world seems to be taking as this decade draws to a close.129.	Will mankind manage to bring about the changes that are necessary now  as we usher in a new decade?"
"21",1192,"CAN",34,1979,"ï»¿ May I join my colleagues in congratulating the President on his election to the high office he now holds. He is even newer to his job than I am to mine. But with his long experience in this Assembly we are confident that he will be able fully to fulfil the heavy responsibilities he has assumed.74.	Although I am a newcomer to this Assembly  I have been one of its close observers for many years. I have always been an unswerving supporter of the United Nations  of the ideals expressed in its Charter  and of the constructive role it has played in the development of the international community.75.	There are many successes of which all of us  as Members of the United Nations  may be justly proud. The timely intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces has so often brought quiet to a troubled area. Through resolutions and the great conferences of the 1970s  we have identified crucial problems and devised plans of concerted action for solving them.76.	As a specific example  the complex  painstaking negotiations on the law of the sea have now reached the point at which  with one last effort of mutual will  we shall have an agreement of extraordinary significance to us all.â77.	Yes  the record of the United Nations has proved how usefulâindeed  how essentialâit is in world affairs. In the recent past  however  I have become increasingly concerned by the path this body has taken. I see it as my responsibilityâspeaking for Canada as I do now for the first time in this chamberâto tell you frankly what it is that troubles Canadians about recent developments in the conduct of international affairs.78.	The United Nations today is in serious jeopardy of becoming irrelevant to the peoples of the world. Somehow  in dealing with the many difficult issues that have come before this forum over the years  we have lost sight of the very purpose of this Organization. We have lost our grasp of the human needs that the United Nations was established to help fill  and of the human rights that it is meant to protect.79.	Too often  the purpose and content of debate is devoted to the interests and aspirations of Governments and politicians  not of the peoples they represent. Too often the energies and skills of delegations are devoted to the goal of political advantage  not to bettering the human condition.80.	As politicians  we know how important it is to choose carefully the means and even the words we use to promote the goals that we want to promote. But we also know that in so doing we must never lose sight of the true best interests of the people we represent. Once we lose sight of this  we are no longer doing our duty.81.	It is in this light that I look at what has been happening recently in this and certain other international organizations. As I look  I become very worried. The preamble to the Charter of the United Nations begins  as I am sure you all remember  'We the peoples of the United Nations..."". This is an organization of people  not of Governments. Yet  what are the tendencies here? We establish a system of procedure and protocol that begins to rival that of Byzantium. We develop a specialized terminology in which ordinary words are invested with arcane significance. Whole paragraphs of ideological meaning are read into the choice of a single ordinary noun or adjective. We form ourselves into international blocs and support propositions or positions that are in violation of our own declared national policies. How  then  can we be seen to foster the well-being of our peoples? Too faintly  too faintly.82.	Over the years  I have travelled widely across the globe and just since this past June I have had an opportunity to talk with people in 10 different countries. The people to whom I have spoken have strengthened my conviction of the vast reservoir of international goodwill that exists in the hearts of individual citizens around the world. Why  then  is so much of the energy of this Organization devoted to acrimonious wrangling among representatives of Governments? What relevance have the debates in this chamber to the ideals  the hopes and the needs of those for whom this Organization was created: the peoples of the United Nations?83.	Too often the answer to this question is ""little"". We have allowed ourselves to be captured by the self- imposed dictates of this forum. We have lost sight of why we are here. The people of Canada and  I suspect  the people of countries all over the world are recognizing what is happening here. We do not operate in a closed sphere. Modern communications  and an increasingly informed and interested population ensure that what we do is known and understood across the globe. Our credibility is in jeopardy  and with it the very existence of this Organization. For without popular support  we shall be unable to continue. Unless we make our work  our talks  our very motives more relevant to the concerns of the people we represent  we shall lose the support that we need to continue.84.	As I see it  the major challenge facing the United Nations in the next decade is to make itself once again a vehicle for filling the needs and rights of the people of the world. We look to the President to help us begin that task.85.	Thirty-one years ago  when the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  it took a step of great importance to people everywhere. Similarly  the two International Covenants  one on Civil and Political Rights and the other on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  adopted by the General Assembly in 1966  reflected the heartfelt aspirations of the population of this planet. These documents summarize what this great Organization is all about: the fostering and protection of rights.86.	There are three broad areas of human rights that I want to speak about today. The first is the sort of thing that immediately springs to mind when the term ""human rights"" is used. These are the political rights  such as those of freedom of speech and of association  the right to equal treatment before equitable law  the absence of racial  religious or sexual discrimination. The second area is the right to physical safety  the right to peace  the freedom from war. And finally  I want to speak about the rights arising from our natures as human animals  our needs for food  shelter and an appropriate share of the world's riches.87.	One need not look far to find a dismaying number of examples of violations of political rights  all too often committed by a Government against its own people. Indo-China alone provides too many examples. The uprooting  dislocation and often elimination of so many victims in Kampuchea  the desperate plight of the Laotian refugees  the deliberate expulsion of the Vietnamese boat people  all are too well known. The vicious pillage and massacres of the Amin regime in Uganda and its tragic aftermath  the thousands of women and children in refugee campsâone of which I visited last month in southern Africaâare matched elsewhere by the execution without trial of ousted politicians. There is also the sudden disappearance or exile for political reasons of ordinary men  women and children in other countries.88.	These crimes against humanity are common knowledge. The people of the world know what is happening around them. But too often  the international community has been reluctantâor culpably slowâto take steps to condemn and rectify these violations of human rights. Too often  the political convenience of Governments has caused them to remain silent when ordinary people cry out for action. Public opinion today is calling us to account for this lethargy  this disregard for human suffering  this irresponsibility.89.	And yet  there is cause for hope. By no means have all violations of human rights passed unnoticed by the international community. The Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia  held in Geneva in July and convened and skilfully conducted by the Secretary-General  resulted not only in a substantial humanitarian response  in offers of resettlement places and financial aid for refugees  but also elicited a political response by the Government of Viet Nam  which has since been controlling the outflow of refugees. It is still to be determined whether or not the root-cause has been settled  and the whole international community will have to watch developments carefully. Pressure on the Government of Viet Nam must be sustained  but substantial progress has indeed been made.90.	Other investigations hold promise of progress. We are pleased to note the investigation now under way by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights into the situation in Argentina. We also welcome the investigation by respected African jurists into the recent tragic events in the Central African Empire. In addition  the Heads of Government of Commonwealth countries  at their meeting at Lusaka this summer  agreed to consider the setting up of a human rights commission within the Commonwealth. There has been modest progress within the United Nations Commission on Human Rights itself. I refer to the appointment of a special rapporteur to investigate the situation in Equatorial Guinea  and the Commission's contacts with certain Governments as a result of its in camera hearings. All this is gratifying progress indeed. But much more is yet to be done.91.	The United Nations must find better  more certain ways to deal with gross violations of human rights  no matter where they happen. We must be able to take effective action immediately  not years after the abuses begin. That is why Canada has long supported the proposal to establish the office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. This proposal  which could effectively set in place an international human rights ombudsman  has been explored over the years  but as yet not enough Member States have found the courage to proceed with such an office.92.	Let me propose an alternative  then. The General Assembly at this session should agree to establish a position of Under-Secretary-General for Human Rights  and we should appoint an individual of undisputed stature in the international community to that office. This person would exercise the mandate the Secretary-General has under the Charter to use his good offices in the field of human rights. With this  we could have an instrument through which the United Nations could fulfil this fundamental responsibility given to it by the people of the world.93.	Another step that could easily be taken is to devise a way of ending the distressingly large number of disappearances of individuals in many parts of the world. We urge that the Commission on Human Rights be instructed to set up a committee of experts to investigate these unexplained vanishings 94.	But we must not take the progress that has been made as an indication that our job is done. Outrages still exist. Some are long-standing  like apartheid and the situations in Namibia and Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. Others  such as political execution  arise from time to time in various parts of the world. We must find new ways of combating these violations  for world opinion demands it. Unless we can respond  our credibility  our relevance  our usefulness  our very existences are in peril. But our response must be both responsible and timely. The progress being made at this very moment in regard to Namibia and Zimbabwe-Rhodesia  for example  deserves our encouragement and support. It would be irresponsible to pre-empt the satisfactory resolution ' of these problems by precipitous and distracting debate in this or any other forum that some Member States might be inclined to use.95.	A corner-stone of the United Nations is the second type of human right I want to discussâthe right of the people of the world to physical security. Bora from the ashes of the Second World War  this Organization is devoted to the peaceful resolution of differences be-tween nations. To many people this is the sole reason for the existence of this Organization: to ensure the human right to live in peace.96.	Here  too  our record gives little cause for satisfaction. Instances of aggression of one country against another continue. As always  righteous justification is claimed by each party to the conflict. There may be righteous warriors  but there are no good wars. The people have entrusted to us the task of stopping this systematic destruction of the most fundamental of all human rightsâthe right to life itself. And yet armed conflict remains a sorry characteristic of international affairs.97.	Other related threats to our physical safety continue. The arms race  with all its costs and inherent dangers  bounds on apace. The spread of nuclear technology  with all the benefits it can bring  has not been paralleled by an equal commitment to a renunciation of the development of nuclear explosive capability. We know that even today certain States are working to achieve mastery in this field  not for the increased well- being its energy can bring to the people  but for the creation of an explosionâone that will quake the hearts of peace-loving people everywhere. Surely they can expect better of us.98.	Fortunately  here  too  there are reasons for hope. The first special session of this Assembly ever devoted to disarmament  that is  the Assembly's tenth special session  was a success. For those who believe  as I do that modern weapons are as much a threat as a protection to the security of nations  this was an encouraging step. Yet the record since that time is disappointing. The new machinery of negotiation in Geneva is blocked by rivalry and suspicion. The testing of nuclear weapons continues  despite the high priority that the special session gave to the ban. Preparations for nuclear and chemical warfare continue; no agreement has been reached on measures to limit the use of weapons that cause unnecessary suffering; and spending for military purposes grows ever larger.99.	Nevertheless  a hopeful sign of urgency remains. I cite the communique signed in Vienna last June by Presidents Carter and Brezhnev  in which they commit their Governments ""to take major steps to limit nuclear weapons with the objective of ultimately eliminating them  and to complete successfully other arms limitation and disarmament negotiations""100.	Canada has a particular interest in the honouring of this commitmentâwe are the only country that is a neighbour to both the United States of America and the Soviet Union. As such we could not escape the devastation of a strategic nuclear war. Hence  our specific concern.101.	But there is another reason for our deep interest. Canada has been a pioneer in the development of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Our Candu power reactor is an outstanding success both in Canada and abroad. But we are determined that this technology should not be misused. We demand that stringent safeguards be applied by countries buying Canadian nuclear power facilities or materials. We are looking forward to the conclusions of the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation  the international study examining the further means by which non-proliferation standards can be applied to the nuclear fuel cycle. We want to ensure that the continued recourse to nuclear power is undertaken in the most stringent conditions possible  guaranteeing  as far as is humanly possible  against any non-peaceful use.102.	We believe that Governments who accept these conditions  indeed all Governments  have a right to expect that the obligations of nuclear States under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be carried out- including the pursuit of ""negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date""  in the words of its article VI. Yet agreement has eluded the negotiations on a comprehensive test ban for 15 years. Time is running outâand the patience of the people is running thin.103.	Genuine international security is not merely a matter of agreements on arms control and disarmament. Before such agreements can be reached  and certainly before they can have effect  there must be a climate of trust  of decency and justice among the nations of the world. Confidence must be built up by small steps between neighbours  between alliances  and between the nuclear Powers. The United Nations must be allowed to expand its fact-finding and peace-seeking roles if such confidence is to grow. In areas where tensions are too high  concrete steps must be taken to prevent accidents or miscalculations. The people of the world expect no less of us. And the people are right.104.	Finally  as we examine the lessons of the past  and as we assess the challenges of the future  there is one striking fact that dominates all othersâthe singular failure of the international community to solve the problem of poverty. We are still haunted by the spectre of hundreds of millions of people living below the poverty line and in danger of starvation. The right to enough material goods to ensure health and dignity is still denied to far too many.105.	Giving effect to this basic human right is the greatest task facing the United Nations for the remainder of this century. The overriding importance of this work is clear to all. Two years ago this Assembly passed resolution 32/130  which  in paragraph l(i)  recognizes that ""the full realization of civil and political rights without the enjoyment of economic  social and cultural rights is impossible."" It is insufficient for an individual to enjoy full human rights before the law if he or she does not have the basic necessities of life: enough food  health care; education; shelter. Problems of want must be attacked directly and urgently in the 1980s.106.	I welcome the renewed attention being given by the United Nations family to these problems  for here  too  I see reason for hope. There is growing recognition that development assistance does not imply the foisting of one country's social and economic philosophy on another. The true meaning of co-operation is increasingly understood.107.	It is no answer to the problem to set up a sort of international social welfare system to give hand-outs to the poorest. Nothing could be more demeaning to human dignity  nor more guaranteed to perpetuate poverty. Our goal must be to enable people to use their own abilities  and to assist States to develop their own potential.108.	These may sound grand words  optimistic words  easy to say. But  frankly  I am optimistic about the capacity of our international community to work together to solve the problems before it. That these problems are huge  numerous and complicated  there is no denial.109.	What I find worrying is not the fact that we have problems  but the manner in which we approach them. I place enormous personal importance on the North- South dialogue. And yet I fear that our present approach is doomed to failure. Many of the problems with which we are grappling in this dialogue are  after all  the result of changeârapid change  dramatic change and  if we are honest with ourselves  change that is often for the better. The last three decadesâincluding the turbulent 1970sâhave been ones of unprecedented economic growth for the developing world  at rates faster than those of the industrialized countries. The problem is that this growth has been uneven and  in the minds of those whose expectations have been raised so high  not fast enough. As we look into the decade before us  it is the countries at the bottom end of the economic scale that face the bleakest future and the lowest growth. At the opposite end of the scale  in the wealthy industrial countries  the prospects for the 1980s are  for a variety of reasons  also for a relatively slow pace of economic growth. Between these extremes  however  lie countries whose growth has been much more rapid  and who  in spite of immense problems  are likely to maintain a faster pace in the future.110.	This is a very brief outline of what has been happening in the past and what is likely to occur in the years ahead. And yet the international discussions of such matters do not take account of these realities. Of particular concern to me is the increasing note of pessimism that seems to be creeping into the North-South dialogue; the contention that nothing has changed for the better anywhere and is unlikely to in the future; the spirit of confrontation between North and South with verbal barrages across an artificial frontier; the allocation of blame for misfortune  not the search for self- improvement.111.	If there is one message I should like to leave clearly with my colleagues  whether they be of the North or the South  it is that such approaches to our problems and such tactics are likely to be counterproductive. I can tell the Assembly that in Canada they do more harm than good. In Canada we have spent a lot of time and effort and money in developing programmes of economic co-operation  and always with the support of the Canadian people. No democratic Government can act without such popular support. I am confident that this support remains and that we can continue to improve our programmes and adapt our policies to the changing international environment. At present  however  we face important domestic problems within Canada. One of them  the energy issue  we share with many nations. I assure members that we are determined to become part of the solution and not part of that problem. But the efforts that our people will be called upon to make to help solve this world-wide problem will be great. As a result  now more than ever we need to demonstrate that our overseas programmes are useful and efficient and actually do contribute to the welfare of people who need assistance. If we hear through the North-South dialogue that after 30 years of effort nothing has changed for the better  that doom and gloom lie in the future  and that our lack of political will is entirely to blame  I am afraid that the reaction of the Canadian people will be to demand that we spend our efforts and money at home. By all means let us define our problems closely  but let us develop realistic responses. By all means let us be frank with each other  but let us maintain a constructive courtesy. Talk  certainly  but act  too. Let us indulge in technical analysis  but let us never forget that it is the individual we are trying to help.112.	Immense tasks lie before us as we grapple with all the issues now on the negotiating table within the United Nations system. The desperate plight of the people of Kampuchea  for example  cries for immediate international attention. Our ability to act effectively in this regard will be a measure of the sincerity of our commitment to the ideals we all have endorsed. My confidence in our ability to find solutions is based in part on the growing recognition in all countries that interdependence is a fact and not a slogan  and in part on the knowledge that we must all work together if we are113.	This  then  is a partial agenda for the 1980s. The work must begin now  during the President's term of office. Although public confidence in this great international institution is at a sufficiently low level to jeopardize its future  the opportunities to regain that confidence have never been better.114.	With the President's help  we can galvanize this Assembly into a genuine forum for the betterment of the peoples of the world. We can turn away from confrontation between Governments to co-operation among people. When this session is seen to address the rights of human beings rather than the ambitions of politicians  then we shall have the support of people everywhere  and we can use the world's vast resources of riches  energies and intelligence to meet the challenges ahead.115.	May the President lead us in that direction  I can assure him that the Canadian people will follow."
"22",1253,"CHL",34,1979,"ï»¿May I congratulate you  Sir  on the happy circumstance you have just referred to of your presiding over the meeting this afternoon. My country joins in congratulating the people of Panama and warmly greets you personally.136.	May I also  through you  extend to the President of this Assembly the most cordial congratulations of the delegation of Chile on his election to preside over this Assembly. In his election we see a just recognition of his personal merits and qualities  which we have had the opportunity to appreciate throughout his effective guidance of the work of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  of which my country is a member. We see this  too  as a well-deserved honour to his country and as a tribute to the striking individuality with which the nations of Africa join the international community and  with vigour and vitality  renew the strength and the validity of the principles which govern us.137.	May I associate in this tribute that distinguished Latin American  the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for his skilful guidance of the debates of the past General Assembly session.138.	I should also like to extend our greetings and gratitude to the Secretary-General for his endeavours.139.	I am very pleased to welcome a nation in the Caribbean  our sister in America  Saint Lucia  which has joined our Organization.140.	A political writer  who taught in the universities of Germany and the United States  has stated that the intellectual source and  in some cases  even the literal source  of the Charter of the United Nations may be found in a brief paper by Kant   the great German philosopher of modern Europe. The title of that paper by Kant epitomizes one of the major ideals which our Organization professes: it is ""everlasting peace"". Summarizing a spiritual tradition of many centuries of culture and civilization  that philosopher's text  written in the eighteenth century rather as a moral manifesto  has in our century become the inspiration for the political and legal Charter in support of whose ideals the nations of the world have gathered.141.	On the threshold of the new century which we are about to enter  it seems fitting to bring to mind the intellectual and moral sources which were at the origin of our Organization because the principles contained in such sources are those which should indicate its destiny. Throughout its history  the United Nations has been able to gain concrete experience of the real validity of the ideals enshrined as purposes and principles in its fundamental Charter.142.	Those principles  which are the basis of our Organization whose validity has been confirmed by experience itself and which doubtless are unanimously felt by ourselves and firmly supported by my Government  are the following: the sovereign equality of all States; the self-determination of peoples and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States; respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of every State; the prohibition and condemnation of the threat or the use of force; the peaceful settlement of ail disputes and compliance in good faith with obligations entered into; and to crown all this  so that we may approach the everlasting peace of Kant  the political will to make a reality of international co-operation.143.	A realistic analysis of our Organization leads us to observe  alongside the values I have mentioned  which are the true heritage of our Organization  the presence of corrosive factors  of dissolvent principles  which lessen our Organization's effectiveness  break its moral thrust  impair its legitimate force and sometimes radically distort the meaning of its mission.144.	It is not our intention to criticize  nor do we believe that this is the appropriate time to do so. However  just as we emphasize the principles of profound moral and legal content which are the heritage of the Organization and are incorporated in its practice  we also wish to point to some of the negative factors.145.	We believe that the first threat to the role of the United Nations which lessens the natural authority it should have over nations is the use of this forum for purely ideological purposes  for the play of power blocs and at times to give vent to the political pressures prevailing within countries. When these things occur the authority of our Organization is morally lessened because it appears to public opinion to depart from its true purpose in order to serve groups or blocs which the Organization is called upon to moderate  keep in balance and regulate.146.	It then becomes clear to international public opinion that selfish interests have been allowed to prevail over the common good of mankind and that the venerable image of the principles that govern peace has assumed the transitory and distorted mask of ideology and politics.147.	Another definite and grave threat to our institution is the arms race. It is difficult for nations to discuss matters in this forum with trust and truth so long as there is the possibility that in a frenzied arms race their essential possessions will be jeopardized. Thus  instead of lessening international tensions by the use of peaceful means for the settlement of disputes  by respect for treaties and by compliance with the rules of international law  it appears that the world would rather follow the irrational and tragic course of war  the deadly destiny of the arms race. This is even more serious for the economically weak nations since the sinister accumulation of arms also undermines peace because it absorbs financial resources which otherwise would be used for the development and welfare of the people. Let me illustrate this by saying that the cost of a medium- tonnage warship would be enough to allow the WHO to eradicate the scourge of smallpox from the world.148.	A third factor which threatens the effectiveness of the United Nations is the international economic crisis  which has reached such a point that it may even jeopardize the principles of the legal equality of States  international co-operation  and in some cases the self- determination of people 149.	International indexes and the serious concern registered by the majority of the Heads of State  Heads of Government or Ministers who have spoken at this rostrum before me  prove beyond any doubt that the world economy is in a precarious position.150.	The impact of this crisis is  however  felt more keenly in the economies of the developing countries  which are weaker and therefore more vulnerable to external conditions. In this context special attention should be given to the energy problem as a result of which the developing countries are experiencing great difficulties in shouldering the heavy burden of the constant increase in fuel prices which exacerbates their balance-of-payments problems and increases their external indebtedness  with the social cost that all this implies.151.	All the foregoing is not the result of cyclical changes but rather of what we believe to be a structural maladjustment in the present international economic order. This order is unsatisfactory from every point of view  both for the industrialized countries of the North and for the mass of the developing countries concentrated in the South. In fact  although the industrialized countries presumably benefit from the present structure  they are now stricken with high inflation rates  economic stagnation  recession and unemployment  that bring a host of evil social consequencesâall problems that had been considered characteristic of  and even endemic in  the developing countries alone. Therefore  it is obvious that a change in the present economic structure would benefit both sides. At the same time it is evident that such an undertaking can be achieved only by means of vigorous international co-operation.152.	On the other hand  it is fundamentally in contra-diction with the principles of international co-operation for the industrialized countries to follow a policy whereby  in seeking to solve their own international economic problems  they persist in erecting protectionist barriers  thus abandoning free trade  the very system on which those countries built their own prosperity. The developing countries  most of them with small domestic markets  see their growth expectations limited because of the restrictions imposed by the actual opportunities for marketing their raw materials and products. So long as this point is not fully realized by the industrialized nations  the ideals of the United Nations will be threatened by this lack of co-operation as well.153.	In these circumstances Chile is inclined to face the problems of the world economy  not by way of confrontation but rather through co-operation and by a continuing dialogue  because the restructuring of the world economy is a formidable task in which the efforts of all should be combined. For this same reason we unreservedly subscribe to the proposal by the Group of 77 which seeks to establish global negotiations on the outstanding problems relating to raw materials  energy  trade  development  money and finance.154.	Furthermore  my country attaches special importance to the concept of co-operation among developing countries within the framework of national and collective self-reliance. Within the limits of our capacity we have already contributed assistance and credits to other countries. For Chile this form of cooperation has its own dynamics  which is independent and does not replace traditional North-South cooperation.155.	The application of the principles of the United Nations Charter and the provisions that give them effect should extend beyond the strategies of antagonistic groups and power blocs. It should not be subject to the ups and downs of political opportunism and should be free from the constant threat of the arms race and the economic crisis  for which the industrialized nations bear so much responsibility.156.	The principles of the Charter should be applied consistently  without fear or favour  both by the Organization and by all Member States. Tolerance of the violation of those principles and impunity for those guilty of such violation in the end undermine the very foundations of international order and thus deprive the community of States of its ethical and legal basis. Therefore  we must not ask ""for whom the bell tolls"" when a country is the victim of the violation of its essential rights. The bell will toll for each of the Members of the Organization and indeed for the Organization itself.157.	My country is aware of the need to join ranks with all nations of the world  on the basis of cooperation and mutual respect. We have been making constructive efforts with a clear awareness of the solidarity of our interests and our common purposes.158.	With the countries of Latin America we maintain and are working to strengthen ties which go back to our common emancipation and which have as their back-ground an ancient and universal common culture. We are seeking to increase our exchanges with these sister nations  to co-operate in the quest for peace and harmony on the continent  and to strengthen the inter-American system. We are supported in this by the conviction that the nations of the continent must  with a vision of the future  overcome past differences and join their efforts in order to face the historic challenge of our times. It is by surmounting the past and not by repeating it that the countries of Latin America will be able to make their great rendezvous with destiny.159.	Our links with the countries of Europe are deeply rooted in our history and culture  and we therefore wish to cultivate them. Having just returned from a visit to several European countries  may I greet my dear colleagues attending this Assembly who  a few days ago  so kindly welcomed our desire to carry out that task 160.	My country has also continued to develop existing links with the countries of Africa  adding to the relations we have had with many nations of that continent those which we recently established with the Ivory Coast  Gabon and Swaziland. We have a real understanding of the problems besetting the States of Africaâsome of which we have lived through ourselvesâand we believe they must be solved by the Africans themselves  without any external interference. We therefore reject any armed intervention in their continent and proclaim the inalienable right of its peoples to be the architects of their own destinies. Hence we cannot remain silent over the situation of conflict in southern Africa. We note with interest some of the initiatives that are under wayâbasically concerning Rhodesia and Namibiaâand we reiterate our support for decolonization and the self-determination of peoples  as well as our rejection of all forms of discrimination.161.	We have many ties with the peoples of the Middle East  some of whose sons and daughters have become Chilean citizens  contributing their centuries-old values and culture to our own. We view with alarm the situation in that part of the world  but are pleased with some of the results achieved  thanks to great effort and tenacity  in an attempt to bring peace to that region. We believe that those initiatives must be extended to all aspects of this delicate question. To fail to do that would be to turn our backs on reality and perpetuate a hotbed of tension which endangers world peace. Nor is the tragedy of Lebanon alien to us  and we view with growing alarm the tearing asunder of a country with so much potential. We support the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations in that country.162.	Because of its great maritime tradition and its extensive coastline  Chile has opened channels of trade across the Pacific with countries of Asia and Oceania. This past year  we have had the pleasure of establishing diplomatic relations with Singapore and Malaysia  thus adding to those we already enjoyed with several countries on those continents. In this connexion  I would stress my visit to the People's Republic of China last year and the recent visit to Chile of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan.163.	Chile is convinced of the need to enrich its cultural heritage with the legacy of the wisdom of old cultures and civilizations that have flourished in this part of the world and whose international positions are increasingly akin to our own.164. We have stated some of the principles which constitute the fundamental structure of the United Nations Charter. Our country has maintained an attitude of constant respect for them. It is this spirit which prompts the Government of Chile to express reverent satisfaction that His Holiness Pope John Paul II has agreed to mediate the dispute which has arisen between Chile and Argentina in the southern part of our continent. Great tension has prevailed between our two sister countries; but linked as we have been since our independence by instruments for the peaceful settlement of international disputes  that grave threat to peace has been dispelled by the participation of the Holy Father and his special representative  His Eminence Cardinal Antonio Samore  whose efforts led to the conclusion  in Montevideo at the beginning of this year  of two solemn agreements."" The first provided for His Holiness to mediate the dispute over the southern part of our continent; in the other agreement  both Governments  at the request of the Special Representative of the Pope  have  in each other's presence and before His Holiness  committed themselves not to resort to force in their mutual relations  to return to a normal military state of affairs  and to refrain from adopting measures in any sector which might threaten harmony between the two countries. In this atmosphere of relaxation of tensions  our venerated mediator will be able to discharge his noble task of guiding the parties to the negotiations and assist them in the search for a solution.165. On 27 September last  His Holiness Pope John Paul II addressed the representatives of the two States in the process of mediation and  through them  their peoples and Governments. The ideas embodied in the statement of His Holiness constitute a most valuable contribution to the mediation process.166.	Precisely because my country has an honourable tradition of settling its disputes by peaceful and legal means  we view with satisfaction the inclusion in our agenda of an item on the settlement by peaceful means of disputes between States  proposed by the Government of Romania  We shall therefore make every endeavour to see that positive results are achieved in this field. The establishment of effective  mandatory systems for the settlement of disputes would contribute to the elimination of violence and the establishment of the rule of law in international relations.167.	I am pleased to highlight  as an important result of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  the adoption of the principle of a 200-mile exclusive economic zone  which originated in the Santiago Declaration of 1952 on the maritime zone. My country played a major role in the drafting of that instrument  and has firmly upheld the doctrine it proclaims.168.	Accordingly  Chile has continued to participate with special interest in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  particularly in the drafting of a code of conduct for the use of the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The tapping of that area's resources  which constitute the common heritage of mankind  must be carried out in accordance with rational and fair criteria  and for benefit of all countries  particularly the less developed. In no case must those ocean areas and the resources they contain be subject to individual claims of sovereignty or to rivalry among States. Opening the frontiers of the oceans to man's use requires imagination and great effort in order to plan a legal regime which  while encouraging private initiative  will integrate it within the activities of joint bodies.169.	On this occasion I cannot fail to express our concernâa concern shared by many countriesâover the North American announcement that the United States will ignore the maritime jurisdiction of other States beyond the three-mile limit. This attitude is detrimental to the rights of coastal States and impedes the negotiations now under way within the Conference itself. Noteworthy in this connexion is the categorical pronouncement of the member countries of the South Pacific CommissionâColombia  Ecuador  Chile and Peruâissued on 18 August last. 170.	In recent years my country has undergone hard experiences  which a world in confusion and convulsion inflicts on a people wishing to live an open and peaceful life. Ours has been an old and well-balanced democracy  giving opportunities to all forms of political and social structures which the free will of man has forged in our times. However  the nihilist virulence  which cruelly strikes at elementary structures of our civilized life in every region of the world  has seriously damaged our society and threatens the stability of our cultural and historical institutions in a legal and social structure carefully designed to befit our dignity as a nation.171.	It was necessary and unavoidable that a new government be established with heroic determination to assume the responsibility for guiding the country through that grave crisis. After some years of enormous sacrifice and misunderstanding  this Government may say with serene pride that it has succeeded in overcoming economic bankruptcy  given a new and orderly life to the social systems  guaranteed the security of the citizens  initiated a labour plan  adapted educational and cultural programmes to the requirements of our times and drafted a new constitution  among other thingsâall of which are enabling Chile to face the future with optimism. In these circumstances we wish to welcome a broad exchange of ideas  experience  goods and wealth with all nations on the basis of mutual respect  and before this Assembly we reiterate our desire to participate actively in its tasks and to honour and support the lofty mission entrusted to it in accordance with the principles of the fundamental Charter."
"23",1299,"CHN",34,1979,"ï»¿195.	Allow me  first of all  to extend my congratulations to you on your election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I sincerely wish that  under your presidency  the current session may achieve positive results.196.	Allow me also to express  on behalf of the Chinese delegation  our warm welcome to the delegation of Saint Lucia on its admission to membership in the United Nations  believing that it will play its part in international affairs and in the work of the United Nations.197.	The current session is the last session of the General Assembly in the 1970s. We are about to enter the 1980s. Looking back on the past and forward into the future  we feel encouraged and are also aware of our grave responsibility.198.	The past 10 years were no ordinary years. The growth and further strengthening of the third world marked a significant change in the international situation over the period. An additional number of oppressed nations won national independence after waging protracted struggles. The people of the newly emerging States firmly oppose foreign aggression and interference and defend their national independence and state sovereignty. They not only want complete political independence  but are determined to lift themselves from economic dependency and backward-ness. They have worked hard to develop the national economy and build up their countries and have achieved marked successes in this regard. Acting in concert and strengthening their co-operation  they are striving tirelessly for the establishment of a new international economic order. They have waged an extensive struggle for world peace against the ever more intensified arms race between the big Powers and against the imperialist and hegemonist policies of war and aggression and have made important contributions. Strengthening their unity and persevering in struggle  the third-world countries have played an ever greater role in international affairs. They have become a decisive force on the world political scene  and the outlook of the United Nations has undergone a tremendous change. It will be impossible for one or two big Powers to manipulate the destiny of the world as they wish.199.	Along with the awakening of the people of the third-world countries and the growth of their forces  Western Europe  Japan and other developed countries  faced with the hegemonist threat of aggression and expansion  have heightened their vigilance and strengthened their unity and defence capabilities to safeguard their state sovereignty and security. They  too  are exerting a positive influence in maintaining world peace and security and promoting a favourable development of the international situation.200.	But we must not lose sight of the disquieting aspect of the developing situation. In the past decade  the ever fiercer rivalry between the two super-Powers has caused continued turbulence in the international situation. Particularly overbearing is the late-coming super-Power  whose inclination to aggression and adventure is visibly growing. Waving the slogans ""disarmament"" and ""detente""  it is engaged in frenzied arms expansion unprecedented in scale and speed. It is seeking to achieve an overwhelming superiority in nuclear as well as conventional arms and in every sphere  land  sea and air. Relying on its fast growing military strength  it is pushing a global ""offensive strategy"". More and more frequently it is using proxies and organizing mercenaries to launch unscrupulous armed invasions and military coups in other countries. With a view to encircling Europe  controlling strategic routes  seizing strategic resources and speeding up its expansion and strategic deployment for global hegemony  it has increasingly directed the spearheads of its aggression to Africa  the Middle East  the Gulf area and South-East Asia. Facts prove that the late-coming super-Power is the main source of threat to world peace and security and is the most dangerous source of a new world war. In the face of this harsh reality  more and more people are talking about ""the more turbulent 1980s"" and the possibility of a new world war. Such talk is not groundless 201.	Now  this very super-Power which is pushing its policy of hegemonism everywhere has the effrontery to propose at this rostrum an item entitled ""Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"". Obviously  this is the habitual clumsy tactics of a thief crying  ""Stop thief!"" and of gaining fame by demagogic means. Its aim is to pursue hegemonism even more unscrupulously under the guise of opposing hegemonism. However  the term ""hegemonism"" has its precise meaning that brooks no wilful interpretation. In the world today  who is practising hegemonism and who is against it is an objective fact known to everyone. No subtle rhetoric can alter it.202.	We are optimists with regard to the future of mankind. The 1980s pose a new challenge  but also promise new hopes. We believe that ultimately the people are masters of their own destiny. Historical experience tells us that  while it is necessary to face up to reality  it is more important to change the reality. The harsh facts tell us that hegemonism means aggression and war. Peace is not secured by waiting or begging; it can only be secured through struggle and defended by action. Opposing hegemonism and defending world peace are two sides of the same coin. We believe that the just cause of world peace will continue to be victorious so long as all the peace-loving countries and peoples unite and  through hard struggle and solid work  persevere in opposing hegemonism and frustrating its strategic moves. The future of mankind and the world is bright.203.	The broadly-based non-aligned movement is an important force in the contemporary international arena. At the Sixth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which concluded not long ago  the divisive and disruptive schemes were frustrated  and the basic principles of the non-aligned movement and the unity of the movement upheld thanks to the joint efforts of the great majority of the member countries and after acute and complex struggles. This is a significant achievement scored by the non-aligned movement along a road beset with difficulties. In recent years  the super-Power that claims to be the ""natural ally"" of the non-aligned movement has used and collaborated with its agents in an attempt to bring the movement into the orbit of its own global strategy. But their line of action is most unpopular  and their clumsy performance only serves to reveal their true colours more clearly to the non-aligned countries.204.	China has always highly appreciated the independent  sovereign and non-bloc principles of the non- aligned movement and supported its just position of opposing imperialism  colonialism and foreign domination and hegemonism of all forms. The Chinese Government and people sincerely hope that the non-aligned countries will unite and co-operate and eliminate outside interference so that their movement will play a greater role in the struggle of all nations to safeguard sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity and develop national economies and cultures  and in the struggle for the establishment of a new international economic order and for world peace.205.	Indo-China is now one of the centres of world tension that attracts the close attention of the international community and causes it grave anxiety.206.	As is well known  the crux of the Indo-Chinese situation lies in the brutal aggression imposed on Kampuchea. Towards the end of last year  Viet Nam brazenly mounted an armed invasion against Democratic Kampuchea  a sovereign State  occupied large tracts of its territory and set up a puppet regime there  plunging Kampuchea into unheard-of calamities. This naked aggression by Viet Nam is not only an act against the Vietnamese people's desire for recuperation  rehabilitation and peaceful construction after the war but also a gross violation of Kampuchea's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and a direct threat to the peace and security of the South-East Asian countries. It tramples underfoot the United Nations Charter and fundamental principles of international law. Earlier this year the United Nations Security Council held urgent meetings to discuss this grave situation."" At the meetings  the overwhelming majority of the member States strongly condemned VietNam's act of aggression and demanded an immediate withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchea. It was only because of the veto arbitrarily used by one permanent member that the Security Council failed to adopt resolutions and take effective action. Now the best part of the year has passed  but instead of stopping its aggression against Kampuchea  Viet Nam is sending more troops there and stepping up its deployment in preparation for a new massive dry-season offensive to wipe out the patriotic Kampuchean armed forces at one blow and then threaten the whole of South-East Asia  The disaster that today befalls the people of Kampuchea may befall those of other countries tomorrow. How can such practice of power politics be allowed to go unchecked in this contemporary age? We are pleased to note that the Government of Democratic Kampuchea  summing up experience and readjusting its policies  is uniting extensive patriotic forces under the banner of the patriotic and democratic front of great national union and fighting heroically to drive all the Vietnamese aggressors from Kampuchean territory. Historical experience has repeatedly proved and will continue to prove that no foreign aggression and oppression can vanquish a whole nation and that the just cause of a nation against alien domination is invincible 207.	It should be pointed out here that the so-called Heng Samrin regime is nothing but a puppet propped up by the Vietnamese aggressors at bayonet point. Playing the jackal to the tiger  that regime has helped the Vietnamese aggressors to suppress the Kampuchean people in cold blood. Naturally  such a puppet regime is spurned by the Kampuchean people  opposed by the Governments and peoples of the South-East Asian countries and condemned by world opinion. On the other hand  the Government of Democratic Kampuchea  which has been holding high the banner of national independence and persistently fighting a national war of self-defence  is the sole legal representative of the Kampuchean people. Democratic Kampuchea is a State Member of the United Nations. To support and safeguard the legitimate rights of Democratic Kampuchea fully accords with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. It is the solemn and bounden duty of each of us Member States to uphold the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The recent decision taken by the General Assembly on accepting the credentials of the representatives of Democratic Kampuchea is a manifestation of the just position of the international community against foreign armed aggression and another indication that the aggression committed against Democratic Kampuchea by Viet Nam with the backing of its behind-the- scenes boss is most unpopular.208.	While carrying on aggression and expansion abroad  Viet Nam has practised a policy of genocide at home and created the world-shocking tragedy of Indo- Chinese refugees. Over the past year or more  as a result of the massive persecution and expulsion by the Vietnamese authorities  nearly a million innocent people were forced to leave their homes and drift from place to place. Countless refugees were drowned in the sea or perished in the wilderness. Their tragic plight and serious case were something rarely seen since the Second World War. Such actions on the part of Viet Nam not only violate the basic humanitarian principle but have created tremendous economic burdens and grave social problems for the South-East Asian region and affected the tranquillity and stability of the countries there. At the international meeting on the question of Indo-Chinese refugees last July  Viet Nam  under the pressure of world opinion  orally undertook to control the exodus of refugees  but in fact continues to persecute and export them. We hold that the key to a solution of the Indo-Chinese refugee problem lies in a complete change by Viet Nam of its reactionary policy of cruel persecution and export of refugees. If the problem is not tackled at its source  this human tragedy will continue.219. There is a deep-rooted cause for the deterioration of the Indo-Chinese situation to its present state. It is the result of the aggressive and expansionist policies pursued by the big and small hegemonists. As is well now  under President Ho Chi Minh's leadership  the Vietnamese people fought heroically over long years to win national liberation and defend national independence and so won praise and admiration from the people of all countries. But after the passing of President Ho Chi Minh  the Vietnamese authorities betrayed his political line step by step and feverishly pushed a policy of expansion. With Soviet backing  they committed armed invasion and military occupation of weaker neighbours in an attempt to realize their dream of regional hegemony by establishing an ""Indo-Chinese Federation"" totally under their thumb. Exploiting the Vietnamese authorities' ambition for expansion  the Soviet Union has used Viet Nam and Indo-China as its ""strategic base"" in South-East Asia and  through the instrumentality of Viet Nam  has sought to control the region and then establish an ""Asian collective security system"" so as to link up its strategic deployment in the Pacific with that in the Indian Ocean. People have come to realize more and more clearly that Vietnamese invasion and domination of its neighbours are by no means a local issue but an important component of Soviet attempts to establish an ""Asian collective security system"" in furtherance of its strategy of seeking world hegemony.220.	It is also well known that in the course of the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and liberation  the Chinese Government and people  sharing their weal and their woe  firmly stood on their side and gave them all-out support. The two peoples forged a deep revolutionary friendship in their long-term common struggles. But now China is regarded by the Vietnamese authorities as an enemy simply because it does not approve of their present policies of aggression and expansion. They carried out frenzied hostile anti-China activities and even committed incessant armed provocations and made intrusions into China's border areas  so that the Chinese side was compelled to make a counter-attack in self-defence. This just action of ours punctured the aggressive arrogance of the expansionists; it was also in the interest of safeguarding the peace and security of South-East Asia and the whole world.221.	The three Indo-Chinese States are China's neighbours. The Chinese Government and people have consistently supported the people of these countries in their just struggle to win or safeguard national independence and build up their countries. The Chinese Government and people cannot but feel grave concern over the deterioration of the Indo-Chinese situation. We hold that the United Nations has an unshirkable responsibility to take effective measures  first to make Viet Nam withdraw forthwith all its troops from Kampuchea  stop its aggression and military occupation in Kampuchea and then to solve the other related questions. At the suggestion of the five countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  the United Nations General Assembly is going to consider the Kampuchean situation at the current session. We firmly support the just demand of the Association and all other justice-upholding countries for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Kampuchean territory  for this is the key to a solution of the Indo- Chinese question. The Indo-Chinese question must be solved by the Indo-Chinese peoples themselves on the basis of respect for their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and free from all foreign interference.222. The peaceful reunification of Korea has an important bearing on peace in east Asia and the Pacific region. The Chinese Government and people firmly support the Korean people's sacred cause of independent and peaceful reunification of their country and are firmly opposed to acts aiming at creating ""two Koreas"" and perpetuating the division of Korea. The resolution on promoting the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its thirtieth session should be implemented in earnest. The United States should withdraw all its troops and armaments from  and stop its military aid to  South Korea. The ""United Nations Command"" must be disbanded. These steps will help to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. In our view  the proposal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on holding Korea-United States talks and replacing the armistice by a peace agreement is reasonable and should meet with a positive response. As for the discussion of the reunification of Korea through a North-South dialogue  it is purely the Korean people's own business which brooks no foreign interference. We support the three principles and the five-point programme President Kim II Sung put forward for solving the Korean question  and we support dialogue between the North and South and hope that this dialogue will yield positive results.223.	The people of the world are now watching the Middle East situation with anxiety. The developments in the Middle East since the thirty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly show that the crux of the Middle East question still lies in the struggle between the super-Powers for oil resources and strategic areas and the expansionist policy of Israel. One super-Power sticks to its position of partiality to Israel. The other has used all opportunities to carry out infiltration and expansion  split Arab unity and undermine the stability and peace of the Middle East. The Israeli authorities remain adamant in obstructing and opposing an over-all settlement of the Middle East question. They have kept making armed attacks on southern Lebanon and have subjected the Palestinian and other Arab peoples to new war threats and provocations. There is a long way to go towards an over-all and just settlement of the Middle East question.224.	Of late  more and more countries and world opinion have come to agree that  in order to have stability and peace in the Middle East  it is essential to respect the Arab national interests and the Palestinian people's national rights. Such is the truth and the general trend. It should be pointed out that this growing tendency is the result of the just struggle which the Palestinian and other Arab peoples have persistently carried out over long years. The ultimate realization of the national aspiration and objectives of the Arab people mainly depends on the solid unity and sustained struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples. However  the United Nations should also play its due role in promoting a settlement of the Middle East question.225.	Here  we would like to reiterate that the Chinese Government and people will unswervingly support the just struggle of the Arab and Palestinian peoples. We strongly condemn the expansion and rivalry of the super-Powers in the Middle East and are firmly opposed to the sinister super-Power attempt to sow discord among the Arab countries and Israel's peremptory attitude of obstructing an over-all settlement of the Middle East question. Occupied Arab territories must be recovered and the Palestinian people's national rights  including their right to their homeland and to establish their own State  must be realized. We sincerely hope that all parties of the Arab world will show mutual understanding  rebuild their unity and work together to speed up their victory.226.	The people of the African countries are increasingly demanding a speedy end to the racist rule and apartheid in southern Africa. In the past year  with the support of the people of Africa and the world at large  the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and Azania have made new progress in their struggle for liberation and have dealt increasingly heavy blows to the racist forces of South Africa and Rhodesia. In their last-ditch struggle  these racist forces are intensifying their Fascist military repression at home while launching armed attacks against neighbouring countries. They have kept playing political tricks in an attempt to maintain their racist rule in disguised forms and preserve their vested interests.227.	In recent years  various proposals and suggestions for a negotiated settlement of the independence of Zimbabwe and Namibia have been put forward internationally. Many African States have made great efforts towards this end  and their efforts have won sympathy and support from the international community. But so far these negotiations have not made substantive progress because of the intransigence of the racist forces. Facts fully show that the racist regime of South Africa and the racist forces of Rhodesia are the fundamental obstacles to a settlement of the questions of Zimbabwe and Namibia  which is long overdue. All countries which uphold justice should exert effective pressure on the racists and give energetic support to the liberation struggle of the people in southern Africa. An early end to the racist rule in Zimbabwe and Namibia and the attainment of independence based on a genuine majority rule will help to stabilize the situation in southern Africa  exclude external meddling and interference and push forward the struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination in South Africa. The Chinese Government and people will  as always  firmly support the just struggles of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and Azania. The current international situation is very favourable to the liberation struggle in southern Africa Although there may be difficulties and twists and turns on their way to progress  the people in southern Africa persisting in unity and struggle  guarding against external interference and sabotage  and supported by African and all other countries and peoples which uphold justice  will certainly foil the heinous acts of the racist forces of South Africa and Rhodesia and win complete liberation for the whole African continent.228.	We are pleased to note that  since the tenth special session of the General Assembly  which was held on disarmament last year  the role of the United Nations and of the small and medium-sized countries have been strengthened in the struggle for genuine disarmament. This year  in the United Nations framework  there were held the first session of the Disarmament Commission  the Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean and a series of other meetings  at which relevant resolutions were adopted. The convening of these meetings reflected the strong dissatisfaction of the peace-loving countries with the super-Powers' arms expansion and war preparations. It also shows that the control of the disarmament machinery by a few countries is being broken up. This undoubtedly is of positive significance. Chinese delegations took an active part in these meetings and put forward documents  including the Chinese proposal on the elements of a comprehensive disarmament programme.  We have always held that all countries  whether big or small  strong or weak  and whether with or without nuclear weapons  are entitled to take part in the consideration and settlement of disarmament issues on a completely equal footing. It is no longer permissible for anybody to use the United Nations as a platform to sing the praises of certain bilateral negotiations or make the disarmament machinery a ploy at his disposal.229.	Nuclear disarmament is a matter of great concern to everyone. We have always held that the complete prohibition and total destruction of nuclear weapons are the fundamental way to nuclear disarmament and the elimination of the threat of a nuclear war. Pending this  all the nuclear countries should undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries and nuclear-weapon-free zones. As for the way to apply concrete measures of nuclear disarmament  an important principle must be followed  as was rightly pointed out by the representatives of many countries: namely  the two super-Powers with the largest nuclear arsenals should be the first to reduce their nuclear armament.230.	When substantial progress has been made in this regard  the other nuclear countries shall join them in reducing nuclear armaments according to reasonable ratios until finally nuclear arms are totally destroyed. We consider this principle to be fair and reasonable. However  those who cling to their nuclear superiority and are bent on seeking nuclear over-lordship are obdurately opposed to this principle. They are fervently advocating the idea of all nuclear countries ""simultaneously"" reducing their armaments by the same quantity and quality. This is obviously a demagogic trick. Now that the super-Powers enjoy a tremendous nuclear superiority and are in a position to fight a nuclear war at any time with the huge number of nuclear weapons at their disposal  would any nuclear disarmament plan make our world safer if it does not change this state of affairs? It is obvious that only a genuine nuclear disarmament will contribute to international security  and a genuine nuclear disarmament must begin with the substantial reduction of the nuclear arsenals of the superpowers. The second SALT Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States neither calls for a significant numerical reduction of the strategic arms nor provides for a substantive qualitative limitation. No wonder that people have pointedly commented that the treaty has nothing in common with genuine disarmament. We hope that the Soviet Union and the United States will take practical measures to carry out genuine nuclear disarmament  as called for by many other countries.231.	The reduction of conventional arms is another matter calling for attention. In view of the growing danger of a massive conventional war  we hold that conventional disarmament and nuclear disarmament should be given equal importance  and that the two should be carried out in conjunction.232.	This is the last year of the United Nations Dis-armament Decade. Regrettably the objective of the Dis-armament Decade  on which many countries placed their hopes  has not been attained; on the contrary  this past decade has been one of massive arms expansion by the super-Powers. What is the reason? As rightly put by the representatives of some countries  the crucial reason is that the super-Powers have no sincere desire for disarmament. This shows that we still face arduous and complicated tasks in the field of disarmament.233.	So far as China is concerned  we are always for genuine disarmament. We firmly support all reasonable proposals conducive to genuine disarmament and are prepared to make unremitting efforts for its realization.234.	The steady deterioration of the international economic situation is one of the important factors making for international turbulence. Some developed countries  especially the super-Powers  have used various means to shift the consequences of their economic crises and difficulties on to the developing countries so that the latter face worsening trading terms  mounting foreign debts and great difficulties in their economic development. The energy problem is an increasing concern of most countries. Many developing countries have pointed out that the root-cause of all evils of the present international economy lies in the existing inequitable and irrational international economic order. Therefore  they strongly demand a fundamental re-structuring of the international economic system. This demand is entirely just  being in the interest of the overwhelming majority of the people of the world.235.	Five years ago  thanks to the efforts of the developing countries  the sixth special session of the General Assembly adopted the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order which constitutes a basic document guiding economic negotiations and dialogues. Five years have passed  but how much progress has been made in these negotiations and dialogues? Very limited progress. They are mostly at an impasse. The reasons are clear to all. The most important reason is that the two superpowers have set up obstacles of all kinds. The obstacles have multiplied especially since the beginning of this year. At the fifth session of UNCTAD and other international economic forums  many reasonable proposals made by the developing countries on changing the outdated international economic relations have thus been stalled. This unreasonable state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. The developing countries have come to realize more and more that  in order to achieve progress in the negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order  they must strengthen their unity  uphold principles  persevere in struggle and energetically promote mutual economic assistance and co-operation. The Arusha Programme for Collective Self-Reliance and Framework for Negotiations   adopted at the ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 held last February  and the economic documents adopted at the recent Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries provide clear guidelines for promoting the economic co-operation among the developing countries and strengthening their negotiating positions with the developed countries  and they give expression to the common will and desire of the third-world countries. Thanks to the efforts of the developing countries  the recent United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development registered some preliminary results. We believe that the united struggle of the third-world countries will secure continuous progress for the just cause of establishment of a new international economic order.236.	In order to bring about effective solutions to international economic problems  the recognition of the developing countries' full rights and true equality in decision-making in international economic affairs is essential. The correct way to settle pressing economic problems is for the developed countries and the developing countries to sit together for all-round consultation  break the present impasse  explore and adopt effective measures to narrow down the gap between the rich and poor countries and establish a new international economic relationship that is equitable  rational and based on equality and mutual benefit.237.	Having realized the importance of a constructive dialogue with the third-world countries  a number of developed countries have in their bilateral or multilateral relations adopted positive measures  such as increasing their economic and scientific technical aid and supporting the establishment of an Integrated Programme for Commodities and its Common Fund. These measures are welcome. It is in the interest of the developed countries themselves to strengthen their cooperation with third-world countries on the basis of respect for independence and sovereignty and genuine equality. Moreover  this will help advance the common cause of world peace and stability. We hope that more developed countries will understand the situation and favourably respond to the demands of the developing countries.238.	The Chinese Government sincerely hopes that the special session of the General Assembly scheduled to be held in 1980 at the suggestion of developing countries will make an important contribution in helping the economic development of the developing countries  establishing a new international economic order and formulating a new international strategy for development. The Chinese Government will work together with the other developing countries to that end.239.	This year witnesses the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. These days the Chinese people are warmly celebrating this festival of historic significance.240.	The birth of New China terminated once and for all the age of imperialist enslavement and oppression of the Chinese people and ushered in a new era in the history of China. By making arduous efforts in the 30 years since then  the Chinese people have achieved great successes in all fields of national construction and aid a good foundation for future development. Our cause has enjoyed the sympathy and support of many friendly countries and the people of the world. On behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China  I would like to take this opportunity to express to them our heartfelt thanks.241.	China today is vastly different from what it used to be in the old days. However  China is still a developing country  and our industry  agriculture  science and technology are not yet developed. With a view to bringing about a complete change to this state of affairs  we are determined to turn China into a modern socialist country by the end of the century in accordance with the behests of Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. As from this year  the focus of our work throughout China has been shifted to socialist modernization. The task before us is beyond doubt an arduous one. But we are confident that  relying on the joint efforts of the entire people  we will be able to fulfil our historical mission successfully.242.	In international affairs  China has consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace  which is China's fundamental policy in its relations with other countries. The Chinese people are engaged in gigantic socialist construction. China is a country with a large population and a vast territory. To turn China into an advanced  modern and powerful socialist country calls for the hard struggle of several generations. We are thus required to secure a lasting peaceful international environment China has in the past 30 years made unremitting efforts to oppose the imperialist and hegemonist policies of aggression and war and to win or safeguard world peace. In the present turbulent world situation  in which the danger of war continues to grow  China will as always  work together with all other peace-loving countries and peoples of the world to oppose hegemonism and safeguard world peace.243.	The just struggle of the people of all countries support each other and advance the cause of progress of mankind as a whole. The Chinese Government and people adhere to the principle of internationalism  support all the oppressed nations and peoples in their struggle against imperialism  colonialism and hegemonism and for liberation and social progress. We have done so in the past and will continue to do so in the future. We will always stand together with the people of all countries. A modernized China will certainly contribute to the preservation of world peace  to the furtherance of friendship and co-operation among all peoples and to the advancement of the cause of human progress.244.	The People's Republic of China first sent its delegation to take part in the activities of the United Nations in the early 1970s. In the past eight years the Chinese delegation has worked together with the delegations of other Members to enable the United Nations to play its due role in maintaining world peace  supporting various countries in their endeavour to win or safeguard national independence  State sovereignty and territorial integrity  establishing a new international economic order and promoting international co-operation. With the advent of the 1980s  the Chinese delegation sincerely hopes that the United Nations will give full expression to the common will of the people of all countries  faithfully apply the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and play a more effective and active role in international affairs. China is prepared to work to this end together with the other countries which love peace and uphold justice."
"24",1342,"CIV",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  since it is now my turn to speak in the general debate  I should like to say how much I welcome your unanimous election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and I congratulate you most warmly in a brotherly manner  and sincerely wish you complete success in the discharge of this very lofty function.29.	Your election seems to me to be a special tribute paid to your qualities as a skilled diplomat  and it is also recognition by all of the praiseworthy efforts you have always made since you have represented your country with so much distinction at the United Nations with a view to realizing the objectives of the Organization.30.	I wish to assure you that the delegation of the Ivory Coast will co-operate fully towards the successful discharge of your mission.31.	I should also like to express my gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lie'vano  who was good enough to place his eminent qualities at the service of our Organization by presiding over the thirty-third session of the General Assembly to the satisfaction of all.32.	Allow me also to express our gratitude  admiration and esteem to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who in his activities has always seemed to us to be a true pilgrim of peace  and we reiterate our unswerving support of his indefatigable efforts to ensure the triumph of the just cause of our Organization.33.	We are gratified by the admission of Saint Lucia to the United Nations family  which proves once again the universality of the Organization. It gives us pleasure to extend to the members of its delegation our warmest congratulations and most cordial welcome and to assure them of our genuine desire to co-operate with them in the United Nations and to maintain relations of sincere friendship and mutual confidence with their country.34.	In some ways it may be said that peace reigns in the world. Indeed the violent hostility which marked relations between the East and the West after the Second World War has given way to detente. Under the influence of a certain number of factors it seems to have been agreed to have the two concepts of a just order which divide the world confront each other not through recourse to force but through peaceful coexistence.35.	An important factor which promoted this happy evolution in East-West relations is undoubtedly the determination of a large number of States to remain aloof from the two antagonistic blocs and to work to bring about a rapprochement between them for the benefit of peace.36.	A no less important factor was the appearance of new great Powers in the world with a consequent proliferation of nuclear weapons and a redistribution of the power of political decision. The configuration of the international community which was bipolar is now tending to become multipolar.37.	It is undeniable that the threat of an apocalypse presented by the arsenals of the super-Powers has also contributed to a relaxation in relations between East and West. The peace we are experiencing is  then  based on terror and does not protect us from war. It is fragile. An accident is always possible  and there could be an irreparable outbreak at any time as the result of faulty reasoning. Moreover  the great Powers have only given up their direct confrontation. They are in conflict through third countries.38.	The violation of human rights  particularly in the developing countries  is also a source of conflicts.39.	Finally  there are risks of confrontation between the North and the South that threaten peace. The developing countries desperately denounce the inequity of the present economic order which perpetuates their impoverishment  and enables the developed countries which established it to become continually richer.40.	In their desire to redress one of the consequences of this economic orderâthe constant deterioration in their terms of tradeâthe developing countries which are oil producers raised the price of that raw material. This led to an economic crisis in the developing countries that are not oil producers  particularly the most disadvantaged of them  for it is they which feel the effects most severely.â41.	The Government of the Ivory Coast is firmly convinced that the fundamental objectives of the United Nationsâpeace and the well-being of peoples in justice and freedomâcannot be fully achieved until States have abandoned the time-worn principle of the balance of power  which endangers the arms race and war  and instead make a permanent dialogue the basis for their relations. What does this mean? It means that in its conduct each people must look at the intellectual and spiritual foundations of its concept of the world and of its actions through the eyes of others  in sincere and reciprocal confidence and with profound respect for the truth concerning others  putting aside all prejudices  arbitrary simplifications and pre-conceived ideas  which often obstruct a clear and distinct vision of people and things  and seeking positively the points of common ground for a better mutual understanding of the ideals of life which lead us to act as we do.42.	In that way it will be possible progressively to establish harmony among peoples  sort out their differences and create an atmosphere unfavourable to the birth of conflicts.43.	But we believe that it is necessary also to have recourse to dialogue to solve the existing problems and conflicts  of whatever kind  in order to minimize confrontation  wars and their wake of destruction of human lives and belongings  homeless persons  refugees  indescribable suffering and misery  or to prevent a final break between the antagonists and bring about a reconciliation between them so that clashes will not end in irreversible hatred.44.	That is why the Ivory Coast has always been in favour of the negotiations between all the parties to the Zimbabwe tragedy. We welcome with satisfaction the agreement reached between the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth Countries at the Lusaka meeting  which made it possible to convene the Constitutional Conference in London. We are following the work of that Conference with interest. We are pleased by the results already achieved by the parties and we hope that the United Kingdom  the administering Power of the Territory  under whose aegis the Conference is being held  will assume its responsibilities to the full and succeed in reaching a settlement that will satisfy all the parties. For its part the United Nations should  in our view  be prepared to assist  should it consider it to be necessary  m the implementation of any decisions that might be taken for the attainment of the objectives of the Conference.45.	We hope whole-heartedly that the London negotiations will lead shortly to reconciliation between all the inhabitants of Zimbabweâbetween blacks as well as between blacks and whitesâand to conclusions making possible the peaceful and democratic decolonization of the Territory.46.	From all the evidence the course of an internal settlement in Namibia on which South Africa seems to have embarked appears destined to fail. Such a settlement has no more likelihood of success in Namibia than it had in Zimbabwe.47.	I reiterate the support of the Ivory Coast for the plan drawn up by the five Western Powers   which led to the plan of action adopted by the Security Council for the accession of Namibia to independence  that was the subject of its resolution 435 (1978). We hope that the obstacles arising from the interpretation of certain provisions of that plan will soon be surmounted as a result of the persevering efforts of the five Powers and of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.48.	In this perspective  and reaffirming the inalienable right of the Namibian people to independence  we appeal urgently to South Africa to give proof of its goodwill and understanding  and to co-operate with the United Nations  without vacillation or reservations based on narrow interests  in putting the Security Council's plan of action into practice.49.	The history of peoples tell us that any who attempt indefinitely to base a political regime on the inequalities suffered by the majority  and to deprive that majority of its freedom and dignity  expose themselves sooner or later to violent changes and the loss of the very interests they are seeking to protect by such means.50.	Hence we once again urge the Government of South Africa to introduce peacefully  before it is too late  the changes that are imperative in order that the odious system of apartheid and racial discrimination shall disappear forever from South Africa.51.	There are situations in which the blind implementation of rules and principles can be counter-productive and unrealistic. This seems to be the case in Western Sahara. It seems to us  on reflection  that  beyond the right of self-determination  to which we are all deeply attached and which we would like to see applied to that Territory  there are the facts of the situation in the region which cannot be overlooked if there is a real desire to settle the Western Sahara conflict peacefully. We believe that it is by the concerted effort of all the parties concerned  and not by their confrontation  that it will be possible to find the bases of a satisfactory and lasting solution of this conflict. Therefore we must work to bring about an atmosphere conducive to this concerted action  without which we see no immediate hope of a solution.52.	It is unanimously agreed that only a global solution to the Middle East conflict can bring peace to that region. Nor does anyone deny that there can be no over-all settlement without a just and equitable political solution of the Palestinian problem.53.	It seems to us that  despite the criticisms that can be made about the agreements they have led to so far  the negotiations between Egypt and Israel  with the assistance of the United States  have as their objectives the over-all settlement of the conflict and the establishment of peace in the Middle East.54.	But it is clear that these objectives cannot be attained without the participation in the negotiations of the various parties concerned  particularly the Palestinians. This participation will be obtained on the following two conditions. First  recognition by Israel of the Palestinian reality and of the PLO  whose representative is recognized by the great majority of members of the international community. Secondly  recognition by the PLO of the Israeli reality and of the right of Israel to exist.55.	Therefore  we appeal urgently to both Israel and the PLO to change their way of thinking and recognize each other. As long as Israel and the PLO are intransigent and refuse to recognize each other  the chances of an over-all settlement seem to be slim.56.	We would be doing useful work indeed if  instead of turning our backs on reality and condemning the efforts of those who  in good faith and motivated by goodwill  patiently seek a peaceful and satisfactory solution to this conflict  we were to use our good relations and our influence with Israel and the PLO to bring them mutually to recognize each other and thus remove the only major obstacle to the establishment of a climate of confidence conducive to the initiation of a dialogue among all the parties concerned. Such a dialogue could  completely and finally  settle the question of the Middle East and bring peace to that region  a peace which we all so ardently desire.57.	In particular  it is highly desirable for the Security Council to adopt  without farther delay  a resolution sanctioning the rights of the Palestinian people.58.	We reaffirm our full support for Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX)  which form the basis for an over-all just and lasting settlement of the conflict  namely  the withdrawal of Israel from the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967; recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to a homeland; the right of all States of the region  without exception  to live in peace within secure  recognized and guaranteed boundaries.59.	All those who  like us  are moved and saddened by the destruction and suffering in Lebanon cannot but ardently desire a permanent and final settlement of the conflict in the Middle East. Indeed  it goes without saying that such a settlement would at the same time bring peace and national unity to that country which is so dear to our hearts.60.	It would be a grave error to be satisfied with the situation prevailing in Cyprus or to be complacent about it. It has created problems without providing a solution. It carries within it the seeds of a conflict of unforeseeable dimensions.61.	We are pleased with the 10-point agreement providing for a resumption of the intercommunal talks  concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. We hope that the difficulties which have been brought about by the suspension of the talks after the conclusion of that agreement will soon be overcome  as a result of the two communities taking into consideration their own interests  and establishing between them the necessary dialogue for a just and lasting settlement of the Cyprus question  one which takes into account their legitimate aspirations on the basis of Security Council resolution 365 (1974) and General Assembly resolution 3212 (XXIX)  in particular their provisions regarding the withdrawal of foreign forces from that country.62.	The great Powers have found an arena for their rivalry  namely in Kampuchea. We deplore the situation prevailing in that country. We deplore it all the more since it brings into question the very principles which are dear to the United Nations. The situation is  for us  a denial of the policy of non-alignment which both sides to the conflict claim to follow. We believe that in order to attain the fundamental objective  which is peace  the non-aligned countries must apply the principle of absolute neutrality. That can only be possible if there is domestic peace within each non-aligned country  peace among the non-aligned countries  and peace between the non-aligned countries and the rest of the world. Only neutrality thus defined will protect the non-aligned countries from foreign intervention and guarantee their independence from the great Powers  without which there can be no non-alignment.63.	We call on all the parties to withdraw the conflict in Kampuchea from the arena of great-Power rivalry  to place it in that of indispensable peace among the non- aligned countries and to begin talks with a view to a peaceful settlement in accordance with the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and the non-use of force.64.	While it is fitting to rejoice at the signing by the United States of America and the Soviet Union of a second agreement on the limitation of strategic weapons and to hope for its early ratification  we cannot lose sight of the long and difficult road which must yet be travelled to reach our final objective  namely  general and complete disarmament.65.	We should like to express once again our profound concern at the grave danger which the arms race and the mindless stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction pose for mankind.66.	In this International Year of the Child  we should like once again to draw the attention of the responsible Powers to the imperative need to halt the arms race and to place science and technology at the service of the total development of man rather than at the service of his destruction  so that among the millions of human beings born each year  large numbers will no longer be condemned to illiteracy  malnutrition  famine or premature death.67.	To work for the cessation of the arms race and the elimination of the spectre of the destruction of the human species  which loom over us in the form of the arsenals of the great Powers  is to act in favour of human rights  because the first human right is the right to live. That is why we are most indignant at the tortures and massacres of human beings which are the hallmark of certain regimes. We are also concerned by the violations of human rights  because they cause an exodus of refugees and conflicts between States.68.	Ways must be sought that are likely to increase the effectiveness of the role of the United Nations in ensuring respect for human rights. We hope that the establishment of the Committee on Human Rights for Africa by the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  which responds to the wishes of the United Nations  will make it possible to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights on that continent.69.	The violation of human rights  when it deprives society of human resources or prevents them from developing  which is so often the case  constitutes an obstacle to development. Conversely  disease  malnutrition  hungerâto mention only the worst ills that are characteristic of the developing countriesâare obstacles to the enjoyment of human rights. Development therefore conditions the enjoyment of human rights. Hence  it is a fundamental human right.70.	Thus we cannot but welcome the agreement on the fundamental elements of a Common Fund for commodities  and we appreciate  despite their inadequacy  an increase in the quotas and the new special drawing rights of the IMF.71.	But how can we fail to express our deep distress when the official development assistance supplied by the most generous among the rich countries amounts to barely half of the 0.70 per cent of the gross national product set by the United Nations  while military expenditures exceed the astronomical sum of $400 billion and continue to rise? How can we not express our profound disappointment at the meagre results of the fifth session of UNCTAD  the difficulties encountered by the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 in applying that resolution and in reactivating the important negotiations within the United Nations system  and the scant progress achieved by the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy?72.	It is imperative and urgent that the developed countries should be more attentive to the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries and take tangible steps to begin an irreversible process that will lead to the structural changes essential to the establishment of a new  fairer and more equitable economic order.73.	We welcome the efforts to diversify sources of energy in order to meet the growing needs in this field. We hope that this diversification will not prevent satisfaction of the legitimate claims of the oil-producing countries from being met  just as we hope that these countries will take into account the interests of the other countries  particularly the developing countries most affected by the energy crisis.74.	How happy we would be if  by thus clearly revealing the interdependence of peoples  the energy crisis finally proved to be beneficial by making them more conscious of the convergence of their interests and the need to build a more united world by resolving together  through concerted action and dialogue  the problems which condition our common future.75.	The United Nations Organization has a particular responsibility in this noble and exalting task  but cannot fully assume it unless  in accordance with the desire expressed by His Holiness Pope John Paul II  on 2 October last:""... the United Nations ... never [ceases] to be the forum  the high tribune  from which all man's problems are appraised in truth and justice."" "
"25",1379,"CMR",34,1979,"ï»¿Sir  may I be permitted  first of all  to offer you the warmest fraternal congratulations of the delegation of Cameroon upon your unanimous election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are particularly pleased  because we know you well and appreciate your outstanding personal and diplomatic qualities  as well as your commitment and contribution to the struggle being waged by Africa with the rest of the third world for its dignity. Your activities at the head of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  and elsewhere  are a prime example. Moreover  over and above you personally  your election does honour to Africa and is a just source of pride to your country  the sister United Republic of Tanzania  which  above and beyond the cultural ties of our common African heritage woven by geography  history and common aspirations  has relations of fruitful co-operation with Cameroon in the OAU and in our great family of the non-aligned.122.	We are pleased to take this occasion to thank your predecessor in this post  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  for the distinguished way in which he discharged his responsibilities.123.	Finally  we wish to pay a very special tribute and to express our profound gratitude to our Secretary- General Mr. Kurt Waldheim. My Government is grateful to him for his tireless  ever selfless and discreet efforts  in exercise of his difficult functions  to find solutions to the numerous problems besetting our times.124.	May we also welcome among us the delegation of Saint Lucia. With its admission as the Organization's one hundred and fifty-second Member  the universal nature of the United Nations has been strengthened.125.	It is with great sadness that we learned  at the beginning of last month  of the untimely passing of Mr. Agostinho Neto  the President of the People's Republic of Angola. His place in Africa and in the world is well known  as is attested to by the numerous expressions of sympathy and grief addressed to his family and to the Government and people of Angolaâcondolences with which I associate my delegation and myself personally.126.	This thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly is being held in a particularly uneasy international climate  marked as it is by tension and conflict and the suffering and misery they entail  as well as by economic disorders  the principal victims of which has been the third worldâAfrica in particular.127.	The victories over domination and slavery during this past decade had aroused hopes that Africa  upon emerging from a long colonial period of darkness  might finally come to know peace and set out on the path of economic  social and cultural development in solidarity with the rest of mankind.128.	But that noble design is still thwarted by the blind persistence in southern Africa of a racist minority with the complicity of powerful foreign interest groups. This intolerable situation for human dignity endangers not only the peoples of Africa but international peace and security as well.129.	There can be no doubt that no African country can really feel that it is the complete master of its own destiny  free to chart a future of happiness and prosperity  as long as the policy of apartheid and oppression prevailing in that part of our continent persists.130.	The fate of millions of human beings held in bondage in their own country deserves the constant vigilance of our Organization  founded as it is on respect for the principle of the inalienable dignity of all human beings  the equality of rights of peoples  and their right to self-determination.131.	We believe that the General Assembly is the appropriate framework within which to arouse and sustain the active solidarity that the liberation movements are entitled to expect of the international community. We are gratified that the intensification of the struggle they are waging in southern Africa has already induced the Pretoria regime to take actions the absurdity of which is obvious to all. This struggle must constantly  reinforced with firm international pressures upon that regime. In this respect we wish to refer to the new and unanimous condemnation of South Africa by the Security Council in its resolution in connexion with the establishment of a new Bantustan.132.	All are aware that the masquerade of according autonomy to artificial geo-political entities or to ethnic groups is designed merely to create a security belt around the apartheid bastion.133.	My country  which is applying and will continue strictly to apply the decisions of the United Nations and the OAU  has decided to have no relations with either South Africa or those puppet States that have no national base and are doomed to be dominated by South African racists.134.	It is this policy of subjugation that Pretoria intends to perpetuate in the international Territory of Namibia.135.	Last year  during the same period  there was some hope that there might be an early settlement of this question on the basis of Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978). Need we recall that the principal thrust of these resolutions was to make it possible for the Namibian people to exercise their right to self-determination and independence by free and democratic elections under the control and supervision of the United Nations?136.	And yet  since publication of the report of the Secretary-General on practical methods for implementing the United Nations plan  South Africa  which had solemnly accepted that settlement  nevertheless has not hesitated  with its customary bad faith  to reopen the issue.137.	It is clear that in so doing South Africa is once again striving to gain time  substantially to alter the facts of the situation  and to distort the application of an international settlement plan in order  in the final analysis  to achieve the goals of its own domestic settlement plan.138.	In May last  at the resumed thirty-third session of the General Assembly  there was adopted by an over-whelming majority a resolution calling upon the Security Council to meet urgently in order to impose against South Africa the enforcement measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter [resolution 33/206]  but so far it has not been possible for us to emerge from the impasse.139.	We must deplore the fact that  despite the arrogant attitude of Pretoria  which is constantly undermining the credibility of our Organization  certain Powers  in particular those which have decisive means of applying pressure upon South Africa  do not appear to be at all disposed to use them.140.	We must again denounce all the South African machinations aimed at excluding SWAPO  which is the authentic representative of the Namibian people  at rendering virtually inapplicable the international settlement plan  and at justifying an internal solution in the Rhodesian manner  the limits of which are finally becoming evident.141.	Cameroon  which is a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  reaffirms its total support for the struggle of the Namibian people under the direction of SWAPO. We reaffirm that people's right to self-determination and independence within the framework of a united Namibia  including Walvis Bay. We feel that if South Africa continues to obstruct the application of the international settlement plan as the Secretary-General interpreted it  and as it was subsequently confirmed by the Security Council  in its resolution 435 (1978)  the latter has no option but to decree the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter in order to compel South Africa to co-operate with the United Nations.142.	The laxity that has been shown so far by certain Powers in respect of South Africa is  as we have already said  one of the causes of the weakening of our Organization. It is with good reason that in his report on the work of the Organization the Secretary-General notes and deplores the lack of confidence from which the United Nations is suffering as a result of non-compliance with numerous Security Council resolutions.143.	The Rhodesian question is particularly enlightening in this respect. It is now virtually 15 years since a group of racist soldiers of fortune took power in the British colony  thereby depriving 6 million blacks of their most elementary rights. While the sanctions decreed by the Security Council handicapped the development of the Rhodesian economy  they did not succeed in bringing low the illegal regime installed in Salisbury  which owes its survival to the assistance openly supplied by South Africa and the support it receives from several multinational firms.144.	Moreover  we believe the Security Council must decide at the proper time whether or not the sanctions imposed upon the rebel regime should be lifted.145.	My country is pleased with the new approach defined at the last Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  in Lusaka. As we have always said  there is no doubt that the only solution acceptable in Zimbabwe is negotiation with the liberation movements with a view to the effective transfer of sovereignty to the majority on the basis of free and democratic elections under international control.146.	We hope that the negotiations now under way inLondon will make it possible for the United Kingdom to commence the process leading to the effective independence of Zimbabwe. In our opinion  any recognition of the Salisbury regime presupposes a fundamental constitutional re-adaptation that would ensure the predominance of democratic rule by the majority. Let there be no mistake about this. The interdependence of peoples and nations is  as has been demonstrated by the re-percussions of present crises  far from being a myth. It will be illusory to speak of peace as long as Africa is suffering from discrimination and does not benefit fully from respect for the principles of the Charter.147.	For the progress of the whole international community  it is essential that the process of the emancipation of peoples  which was started three decades ago  in particular in Africa and in Asia  be completed through the liberation of the last ghettos of oppression. For the security of States  it is equally crucial that their territorial integrity  their independence and their sovereignty be respected.148.	This key principle of the United Nations Charter is also one of the comer-stones of the doctrine of non- alignment  which provides the basis for the external policy of my country.149.	May I be permitted once again to recall here our concept of non-alignment as it was defined by the President of the United Republic of Cameroon  Mr. Ahmadou Ahidjo?""Non-alignment  for us  means first of all non-interference in the domestic affairs of others.""Non-alignment  for us  means also refraining from the use or threat of force for the settlement of international conflicts.""Non-alignment  for us  means also a state of permanent vigilance in the face of all organized powers  present or future  without any a priori prejudice against any other country  while we keep a hand outstretched in loyal co-operation as long as no vital interest is to be sacrificed thereby.""Non-alignment  for us  means finally tolerance and peaceful  indeed even dynamic  coexistence between States which have different political  social and economic regimes but which are working together for the promotion of a world of equal peoples  reed from domination and fear and practising mutual respect.""In other terms  non-alignment is  for us  not an antonym of but a complement to international cooperation.""That philosophy governs our approach to conflicts with which our time has to contend.150.	First of all  in the Middle East  a region which in three decades has known three of the bloodiest wars  the situation remains unstable and explosive.151.	My delegation has constantly reaffirmed that the Palestinian question is at the heart of the Israeli-Arab conflict and that any solution that neglects that major element will be neither just nor lasting. 152.	It is therefore essential for the Palestinian people to exercise all their essential rights  including that of having a country of their own. The search for an equitable solution implies their effective participation in any peace process and any negotiating machinery  through the intermediary of their authentic representative  the PLO.153.	Israel  which has the right to live in peace within recognized borders  must abandon its expansionist designs and must withdraw from all occupied Arab territories  in conformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  so as to make possible the advent of an era of peace and mutually advantageous co-operation in that part of the world.154.	This is the time and place to refer to the tragedy of Lebanon  which is threatening that State in its very substance. Cameroon supports all efforts aimed at safeguarding the independence and territorial integrity of that friendly country.155.	Next there is Cyprus  where the two communities could find common ground to preserve both their respective interests and also the independence  integrity and unity of that non-aligned country  if the external Powers were to refrain once and for all from interfering in their domestic affairs.156.	Finally  in South-East Asia  where the Cambodian people have been threatened for the past 10 years  the existing situation is at the very heart of the major preoccupations of the international community. The dangerous tensions  the instability  the confrontations that are developing there  the antagonisms  the large- scale violations of human rights  the loss of innumerable human lives  destruction in all its forms and the resultant suffering for the Cambodian people are such that everything must be done quickly to enable the peoples of that region to define their political options and settle their problems without foreign interference  and with respect for their territorial integrity  sovereignty and independence.157.	The coming of peace to those troubled regions would strengthen the process of generalized detente throughout the world and contribute to ameliorating one of the most disquieting elements of our time. I refer  of course  to the arms race.158.	This year again  colossal sums of the order of $480 billion have been devoted to military expenditures  according to the most authoritative estimates  or approximately $ 1 million per minute.159.	In these estimates the share ascribed to the principal military alliances is established at more than 70 per cent.160.	Let us return once again to the principles of non-alignment and denounce the false peace that is based on the precarious balance of terror.161.	It can never be said enough that peace  international co-operation and economic development of the nations which stand in solidarity presuppose general and complete disarmament under effective international control.162.	My delegation appreciates the efforts made by the United States of America and the USSR which have led to the signing of their second agreement on the limitation of strategic arms. We hope that that agreement will be ratified soon. Of course  it is a partial  measure because it is set within a framework of exclusive bilateral negotiations and is intended to bring about a subtle nuclear balance between those two great Powers.163.	The ratification of the SALT treaty after the second round of SALT should open the way to the conclusion of another agreement at the end of the third round and give new impetus to international negotiations aimed at reversing the arms race.164.	Disarmament  decolonization and the reduction of tensions and conflicts throughout the world cannot of themselves guarantee international peace and security. Indeed  they imply also justice and equality in the economic field. And yet the present session is being held during a period of uncertainty  disappointment and profound disturbance in international economic relations.165.	Indeed  the industrialized countries experienced a rapid growth right after the Second World War thanks to the abundance and availability of raw materials coming from developing countries and with the support of technical and financial institutions which were set up to serve chiefly their interests. That system  because of its perverse effects  has finally revealed what its limits are. There followed a constant falling-off in production and growth and an aggravation of inflation  monetary instability and  in short  a generalized recession.166.	This situation  which has a special effect upon the nascent economies of the countries of the third world  has demonstrated the need for setting up the new international economic order.167.	It is from that standpoint that numerous initiatives were adopted during the last 20 years  from the institutionalization of UNCTAD to the establishment of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 and including two special sessions of the General Assembly  the sixth and the seventh.168.	Unfortunately  the results obtained have fallen much below the goals aimed at.169.	The recent fifth session of UNCTAD at Manila  of which so much was expected because of the priority to be accorded to a thorough examination of the problems of structural change in the world economy as well as a study  in terms of their global and correlated actions  of trade  monetary  financial and technical questions  has resulted in the mediocre conclusions known to us all.170.	As for the GATT agreements  our Secretary- General reveals in his report on the work of the Organization that although they ' 'provide a framework for the fight against future protectionism"" they ""give little immediate relief for countries most affected by present protectionist measures""  Similarly  the Secretary-General adds  despite the progress achieved:""Much more needs to be done to establish the common fund and to implement the other components of the Integrated Programme for Commodities"". 171.	The Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 at its recent sessions decided on certain proposals which by and large are minor  concerning the transfer of resources relating to agriculture and food questions. These results  obtained thanks to the new impetus which was imparted to the Committee by the Assembly last year  are still far from living up to our expectations  but they clearly demonstrate that the action of the Committee would be further strengthened if it were based upon sufficient political will.172.	The same can be said of the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy which is now bogged down on the elaboration of a preamble.173.	The negotiations aimed at the establishment of a new convention on the law of the sea  which have been going on for six years  could soon come to a successful conclusion if only governments display firm political will. For this it is necessary to adhere to the time-table adopted at the eighth session for the signing of the convention in 1980. My Government  as in the past  will actively participate in this last phase of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We are convinced that the new concept of the common heritage of mankind  which has given rise to these long negotiations  will be safeguarded and that the essential interests of the land-locked and geographically disadvantaged countries will be protected.174.	The Second United Nations Development Decade is coming to an end. Although it has been marked by intensive negotiations  in the final analysis its only result has been the recognition of the existence of the crisisâof the imbalance  instability and general uncertainty of the situation that we face  as well as of the urgent need to make changes if we wish to ensure our own survival.175.	We are commencing the cycle of another decade. We must prepare for it and embark upon it in a new spirit. For this purpose  the non-aligned countries  at their recent Sixth Conference in Havana indicated quite appropriately that the. .establishment of the New International Economic Order calls for bold initiatives  demands new concrete and global solutions and cannot be brought about by piecemeal reforms and improvisations intended to resolve the present economic difficulties"".176.	Together with the new order for which we yearn there must be a corresponding new moralityâa morality involving a profound sense of justice  equity and solidarity between peoples. It must be a morality  as we said from this rostrum last year  that betokens a real will to go beyond national self-interest for the benefit of the strengthening of the common good  which is supranational and of which peace  collective security and the welfare of all peoples are the governing elements. It is a morality that must call for an increased transformation into reality of decisions which have been or soon will be adopted at various international gatherings. It requires a revision and updating of our plans and our frames of reference  and implies  moreover  an increase of responsibilities and possibilities of action for the United Nations at the same time as a streamlining of its structures and working methods. Therefore  we support the highly constructive initiatives advocated in this respect by our Secretary-General.177.	It is agreed today that States cannot resolve the major problems of our time either individually or even in small groups. They must now operate on a worldwide scale  despite disparities and other divisive factors which continue to militate against the coming about of a better organized and more equitable world."
"26",1421,"COD",34,1979,"ï»¿The delegation of the Republic of Zaire is happy at seeing you  Sir  presiding over the work of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your election to the presidency is a tribute to your personal qualities  to your competence and to your long political and diplomatic experience. And for the United Republic of Tanzania  your country  with which we enjoy excellent relations of co-operation  and indeed for Africa  it is grounds for legitimate pride. We are convinced that under your presidency the work of this session will live up to the new hopes placed in the decade of the 1980s.223.	We extend our congratulations also to Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre on his skill and efficiency in conducting the proceedings of the thirty-third session.224.	Furthermore  we wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General of our Organization  for the tremendous amount of work he has done and the inestimable services he has always rendered to the international community. His awareness of the realities of the world today and his approach to major international problems have won him our whole-hearted admiration. His valuable report on the work of the Organization reflects injudicious terms a climate of uncertainty that marks the evolution of the world situation at the end of the 1970s.225.	Permit me to pay one last tribute to the glorious memory of an outstanding statesman of the world todayâMr. Agostinho Neto  the late President of the People's Republic of Angola  whose sudden death is deeply regretted by Africa and the world. My country was most distressed at learning of the news of the untimely death of a man who  together with his brother President Mobutu  was a great artisan of the policy of reconciliation  detente  brotherly co-operation and good-neighbourliness among the States of Central Africa in general and between Angola and Zaire in particular. The Republic of Zaire will spare no effort to pursue with his worthy successor co-operation which is already under way in all fields in order to attain our common objectives.226.	The thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly  the last of the 1970s  is being held at a particularly crucial time in the history of mankind. During the last few years many threats have been posed both to the principles and ideals of the United Nations and to its actions in various fields  particularly that of co-operation for development  at the risk of reducing the world Organization's credit and seeing a gradual diminution of the hope which was aroused by the Second United Nations Development Decade.227.	And that makes all the more important this thirty-fourth session  which is being held on the eve of the Third United Nations Development Decade  in regard to an objective evaluation of the international political and economic situation and the progress achieved in those fields.228.	The United Nations is 34 years old. That is not a very long time in the light of the immensity of the tasks to be accomplished; but it is extremely significant that an international Organization whose mission is peace  co-operation  progress and the development of the States of the world should have overcome so many obstacles placed in its path.229.	It is not our intention to attempt to take stock of the work done by the United Nations since its foundation. It suffices simply to highlight certain positive facts which have marked its existence in order both to confirm the importance of its role and to determine future action.230.	From the very outset the United Nations set itself the tasks of maintaining international peace and security  settling disputes by peaceful means  decolonizing Territories still under foreign domination  bringing about co-operation among all States whatever their economic  social and political systems struggling against apartheid and eliminating all forms of racism and intolerance  bringing about disarmament and many others.231.	In the field of decolonization  the contribution of the United Nations has been positive; many States have acceded to independence over the last 25 years. It is none the less true that the job has not yet been completed and that there persist serious problems whose solution calls for further efforts on the part of us all and a reaffirmation of political will.232.	Following the collapse of the colonial empires  the liberation of Africa is today entering upon its final phase with the last decisive decolonization battles in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa  in spite of the rear-guard action still being waged so stubbornly by the racists of southern Africa.233.	Developments in Zimbabwe  after the last Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka in August  provide a glimmer of hope that a final solution is near which will set the seal on the effective access of the black majority to power. We are gratified that the decisions taken in Lusaka are similar to those formulated by Zaire at the last Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held in Monrovia in July  and we express the hope that the negotiations going on in London will produce a just and lasting settlement of the Rhodesian crisis.234.	With regard to Namibia  we note with regret that the implementation of the plan of the five Western Powers approved by the Security Council has been blocked by the squalid manoeuvring of South Africa  which has attempted by various means to install a puppet authority in Windhoek.235.	Zaire for its part supports the relevant proposals of the Secretary-General to lead a united and indivisible Namibia towards genuine and total independence. The Republic of Zaire recognizes the South West Africa People's Organization as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Namibia  which  as such  must be associated with all the phases of the process leading Namibia to independence  within the spirit of resolution 1514 (XV) of the General Assembly of the United Nations. At the same time  we reaffirm that Walvis Bay is an integral part of the Territory of Namibia.236.	The national independence movement which began immediately after the Second World War will inexorably be extended to the country of apartheid. This evil and reactionary system unanimously condemned by the international community as a crime against mankind will be condemned by history. We call upon those Powers that maintain various relations with South Africa and have interests there to reconcile the positions they adopt in international bodies with the acts which in practice serve to encourage Pretoria's constant defiance of the international community.237.	We should like to take this opportunity to welcome the efforts of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid. The developed nations of the West must understand that it is in their interest  too  to help Africa to rid itself of this outrage of the century.238.	With regard to Western Sahara  I should like to point out that this question became critical as a result of the imprecise nature of the terms of the opinion of the International Court of Justice  which became a kind of empty room which anyone could furnish to suit himself.239.	Although at the time we expressed regret at the way in which the OAU determined its decision on this affair at Monrovia  we remain convinced that an acceptable solution is not beyond the grasp of legendary African wisdom  in the interests of peace  understanding and unity of this part of the world  which has suffered so much. We fully support the recent proposal of the Sherifian Kingdom on the organizing of a round table under the auspices of the OAU as well as the efforts which the Chairman and the special committee of six OAU member States are continuing to make following the latest developments.240.	Our duty as Members of the United Nations is to help the parties to the dispute to overcome their differences by peaceful means  in accordance with the principles of the Charter of our Organization  and not to fan the flames of discord by taking positions which are liable to aggravate the situation.241.	If there is a problem which poses serious threats to international peace and security  it is certainly the problem of the Middle East and  in particular  Palestine. As old as the United Nations itself  the problem of the Middle East and Palestine constitutes one of the major concerns of our Organization. More than any other question  it must be resolved within the framework of the United Nations. 242.	The United Nations  which was responsible for the creation of the State of Israel by finding a solution to the problem posed by the Jewish people who had wandered the earth because they had been deprived of their lands and their homeland  has also the moral duty and responsibility of giving another people who are today wandering and are deprived of a landâthe people of Palestineâtheir own homeland  a territory and a State like other peoples of the world. One cannot remedy one injustice by another. If the people of Palestine today find themselves in the same situation as that in which the Jews found themselves formerly  it is because the Israelis have occupied their land and driven them out.243.	Suffice it to refer to resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947  whereby the General Assembly decided to create the State of Israel. By means of this resolution  Palestine was partitioned to the satisfaction of some  the dissatisfaction and  indeed  the detriment of others while leaving still others indifferent. For its part Zaire has always taken a clear stand on this question. On 4 October 1973  from this very rostrum  the President of the Republic of Zaire  General Mobutu Sese Seko  defined this position in these terms:""It seems to us both childish and unrealistic to believe in the myth about throwing the Israeli people into the sea. That people exists and it has a right to live. But it is also true that the Palestinian people has the same right as the Israeli people  that is  the right to have a homeland and to live in peace."" 244.	Egypt's peace efforts  which led to the signing of the Camp David agreements  constitute an important step towards finding a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the Middle East crisis. The solution to this crisis entails the participation in negotiations of all the parties concerned  particularly the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people recognized by the international community. However  we deem regrettable the attitude of Israel  which is hindering the peace process and  in spite of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  is establishing Jewish settlements on Palestinian land and has annexed the holy city of Jerusalem.245.	In order to make an effective contribution to the settlement of this question and put an end to the tension which continues to prevail in this region  it is essential for the international community to bear constantly in mind all the real facts of the case.246.	The maintenance of international peace and security is the primary task of our Organization under its Charter. In this field  the United Nations has played an important role which it would be wrong to disregard. Since San Francisco we have not had occasion to deplore a third world war; however  a number of local conflicts have broken out here and there  and have thus signposted the history of the post war period of 34 years. Who can claim today that localized conflicts will not tomorrow become the pretext for or the origin of a universal conflagration? The representative of Singapore in his statement calculated that since 1945 there had been in all some 135 wars  involving some 80 countries and responsible for some 25 million casualties. This terrible toll shows that peace  the ultimate goal of our Organization  is far from having been achieved. We want neither the balance of terror  nor the peace of the cemetery.247.	Of course  direct confrontation between great Powers has given way to the spirit of detente and peaceful coexistence. It would also seem that  by the same token  the battlefield of the cold war has been shifted towards the developing countries. Thus  the partition of the world into zones of influence  decided upon at the Yalta Conference of 1945  has turned out to be the basis of certain situations which we continue to decry  particularly in Asia  Latin America and Africa.248.	The most ardent wish of our delegation is that peace should be restored as soon as possible to these parts of the world  in order to enable their peoples to devote themselves to the priority task of development. Development is only possible in an environment of peace and security for all. That is why our country supports all positive and peaceful initiatives aimed at the reunification of Korea and of all divided countries and States.249.	As to the burning problem of Kampuchea  the delegation of Zaire once again bases its position on objective considerations. For us it is a question of principle and not a matter of judging any given regime. Respect for the principles of non-interference in the internal and external affairs of States and of the peaceful settlement of disputes determines our attitude of non-recourse to force  to military intervention or to armed invasion  and non-destabilization of Governments on any pretext whatsoever. That is why we supported the decision taken by this Assembly to permit the Government of Democratic Kampuchea to take part in our debates.250.	The situation prevailing in South-East Asia is the subject of considerable concern to the whole international community. The serious refugee problem  which is but the consequence of the tensions that persist in that region  can only find a final solution within the framework of the restoration of lasting peace. For as Marx quite rightly said  ""a people which oppresses others cannot be free.'' Freedom can only be conceived of within the framework of human dignity.251.	Apart from the local conflicts just mentioned  I should like particularly to point out the danger represented for mankind by over armament. The disturbing increase in military expenditures  which in 10 years have attained a level four times that of 1969  shows that at the present time there is no genuine willingness to undertake disarmament  particularly on the part of the great Powers.252.	Indeed  one year after the tenth special session  devoted to disarmament  the results obtained in the new organs which have been established are not very encouraging. In both the Disarmament Commission and the Committee on Disarmament  deliberations and negotiations have come up against the reluctance shown by certain nuclear Powers.253.	Non-nuclear-weapon States cannot be content with solemn but vague assurances. They need from the nuclear Powers a formal commitment never to use these weapons against States which do not possess them.254.	Furthermore  the conclusion of treaties limiting certain types of strategic armament do not represent a solution to the thorny problem of disarmament. Accordingly  our delegation cannot share the self- satisfaction of the great Powers after the conclusion of the second SALT Treaty.255.	We reaffirm once again that disarmament is and must be the business of the whole international community  and not the preserve of a few Powers.256.	Measures on disarmament  if they are to be effective  must be accompanied by appropriate provisions for international control as well as strict and effective regional and international control.257.	Finally  the question of general and complete disarmament is intimately linked with that of development in the view of the underequipped countries  and our country is one of these. It is regrettable  therefore  to note that the Disarmament Decade proclaimed by the General Assembly on 16 December 1969 should show a debit balance. Its principal objective was to free resources committed to the arms race for the benefit of economic and social development. But we cannot but note that  instead of increasing  the funds made available to developing countries have decreased  while military expenditures are rising at an insensate rate. This is one of the profound causes of the deterioration of the world economic situation.258.	The world economy is now going through the most serious crisis it has known since the Second World War. The persistent malaise of the international economic system is not a mere cyclic phenomenon; it is  above ail  a symptom of profound faults of structure.259.	The powerlessness of the developed market economy countries to overcome the chronic imbalances of their balance of payments  the rates of inflation and unemployment  which have remained high  the increase in the price of oil and the new rigidity in markets attested to by the rise of protectionism  which has prevented the restructuring so necessary for the effective development of production  are all factors which leave us no grounds for expecting a balanced and prosperous world economy in the next decade.260.	Not only is progress towards a solution of the problems which have so long disturbed the developing countries in danger of being curbed  but the fundamental problems themselves have now been exacerbated by a number of new elements of disequilibrium which have become apparent in recent years.261.	This situation is ominous for the world economy  and particularly for the economists of the developing countries  which depend on the export earnings of their raw materials  investments  and foreign assistance. The problems of indebtedness  of the decline in the prices of raw materials and of the deterioration of the terms of trade are particularly acute for developing countries.262.	As the Second United Nations Development. Decade is coming to a close we cannot but deplore the fact that most of the developed countries have not yet achieved the threshold of donating 0.7 per cent of their gross national product  as proposed by the General Assembly  for public development assistance.263.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1974 recognized that the establishment of a new international economic order depended  inter alia  on the improvement of access to external markets and the stabilization of and guarantees for the main exports of the developing countries  as well as the pegging of prices of primary commodities to those of industrial products.264.	The hopes aroused by the fourth session of UNCTAD were extinguished by the fifth  which was marked by a hardening of position on the part of the affluent countries.265.	The deterioration in the terms of trade obstructs not only the transfer of resources but also the short- term current balance-of-payments position of the debtor countries. The growing current-account deficit has been aggravated by increased external indebtedness.266.	At the same time  we note with satisfaction the recent agreement signed in Geneva on the fundamental elements of the Common Fund  establishing the initial resources of that Fund at a level of $750 million.267.	The inability of the present international economic order to face up to new demandsâboth by the industrialized countries as well as by the developing countriesâcalls for a spirit of unselfishness and self- denial on the part of all of us if we are to adopt a realistic approach to appropriate common solutions.268.	All these questions can be resolved only within a framework of a democratization of international relations. International co-operation must be understood  in the sense of a just and rational organization of the interdependence of States.269.	We must replace the traditional division of labour by the development of a creative self-sufficiency of nations within the framework of a balanced and structured international trade system. It is within this spirit that my country supports all efforts towards positive co-operation  internationally  regionally and sub regionally. It is in the same spirit that the Republic of Zaire and its neighbours Rwanda and Burundi have established an Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries  which is open to participation by other States in the area. This initiative is naturally part and parcel of the co-operation among developing countries which the United Nations should do everything possible to encourage.270.	We take this opportunity to thank all friendly countries and international institutions which have supported the efforts at economic integration in Central Africa  particularly those of the Economic Community of the Great Lake Countries.271.	Zaire  which feels most acutely the effects of the crisis  inflation and world economic recession  remains by the very nature of its trade  dependent on the evolution of the international situation. The efforts made within the country by the adoption of a national rehabilitation plan  called the ""Mobutu Plan"" gives us grounds for hoping that with the co-operation of the international community we shall meet the targets that we have set for ourselves. This plan aims at giving a new impetus to production by improving management methods as well as methods of public financing. It also aims to improve the key sectors such as agriculture  which will be the ""oil"" of the year 2000  and transport infrastructure  and maximize mining output and that of the energy sector.272.	We express our appreciation for the help given by international financial institutions as well as by many friendly countries.273.	If there is one problem that is of particular concern to our country it is that of the environment and conservation of nature in the world. We have increased the number of our full reservations to seven national parks instead of three. These embrace a territory that is twice the size of the Federal Republic of Germany. In order to improve management methods in this field  Zaire has considered the most effective means and principles of conservation. In this regard we have established close co-operation with UNEP and the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.274.	On the occasion of the twelfth general assembly of that Union  held in Kinshasa in 1975  the President of the Republic of Zaire suggested that a world nature charter should be drawn up. The Union thought that this was a good idea  took it up and undertook to study it in close co-operation with the relevant authorities of the Republic of Zaire.275.	Since then many countries have made contributions to drafting such a charter by submitting constructive proposals. In due course and at the appropriate time the Republic of Zaire will submit a draft world nature charter in the hope that it will arouse the interest it deserves among Member States.276.	The picture of the international situation that we have drawn is hardly encouraging. Certainly the United Nations  by many initiatives  has spared mankind many disasters. However we should not allow ourselves to be blinded by unprofitable self-congratulation.277.	The activity we have to undertake demands that we transcend our own narrow  selfish interests for the sake of the interests of mankind as a whole.278.	Many crises would have been solved today had it not been for the existence and retention of outmoded machinery in the United Nations system. We refer particularly to the right of veto belonging to the five great Powersâa right which they sometimes abuse in order to pursue their interests and policies.279.	We shall never cease to recommend the review of certain provisions of the Charter which are no longer justified 35 years after the foundation of the United Nations.280.	The world in which we live today is a world of interdependence. We must create a world of peace and harmonious co-operation in diversity.281.	To the extent that we strengthen the role of the United Nations and transfer its decisions into political terms and into terms of the real national situation in all Member States  to that extent we shall draw closer to a world order which will give us more confidence because it will be more just.282.	The equitable distribution of the world's wealth for international peaceâthat is our appeal to the industrialized world. It is the appeal of the third world coming from the heart of Africa. Will it be heeded?"
"27",1467,"COG",34,1979,"ï»¿Among the events which have shaken the world and especially the African continent in recent days  there is one of which we would like to make special mention: the sudden passing away of President Agostinho Neto  one of Africa's most striking personalities. President Neto  who died on 10 September  was a great patriot and statesman who above all stood for the dignity and independence not only of Angola but also of Africa. The last respects of the People's Republic of the Congo were paid to him by President Denis Sassou-Nguesso when he went to Luanda at the head of a large delegation to bow before the mortal remains of a man who  for the Congolese people  was not only a friend at all times  but also a companion in arms at the most difficult moments of the liberation of Africa.173.	Two years after the death of President Marien Ngouabi  Central Africa  with the death of President Neto  is now deprived of two of its most authentic heroes. However the heritage bequeathed by both is such that both in the People's Republic of Angola and in the People's Republic of the Congo  all those who fight for the liberation of peoples will find additional inspiration to maintain their ardour in the struggle being waged daily against all enemies of African independence.174.	Mr. President  the United Republic of Tanzania  your beautiful country  for us Africans as for all peoples who cherish peace  freedom and justice  represents an example of pride  a symbol of virtue and a safe line of defence for freedom fighters. My country  the People's Republic of the Congo  is pleased to be counted among Tanzania's friends. Therefore I have the greatest pleasure  Mr President  in congratulating you on your brilliant election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. You are indeed a devoted man  convinced both of the usefulness and of the action of our Organization  and whose experience and tact are a guarantee of the triumph of the ideals of peace  freedom  justice and co-operation among nations  which constitute the very framework of the Charter of our world Organization.175.	Ours is an ailing world  plagued by its technical development  by the ambition of some and the selfishness of others and  finally  by its lack of ability to solve the burning and urgent problems which face it. The cry of anguishâthe existential anguish of thousands and thousands of human beings  the cry for survival by millions of human beings whose dignity  human condition and very existence are threatenedâis heard everywhere.176.	This year again we are going to examine the political  social and economic situation of the world  and for more than three months we are going to ponder its future. We have no right to evade this responsibility. It is an undertaking which takes on a new dimension; we are compelled to it by imperatives of time. At the end of this century  at the dawn of mankind's third millennium  everywhere time points to taking stock; but should we just take stock of the United Nations? It seems to us that this would be too tiresome and we would need more than one regular session to do it. However we need to take stock; this need should accompany every attitude and every act in our exchanges with one another.177.	An objective  honest and serious examination of conscience should enable us to put a certain number of questions leading to a better understanding of the out-moded practices which have characterized the United Nations since its creation and to a better awareness of the imperatives of the time. This awareness should not be translated and restricted to a mere recording of the facts; it should enable us to free ourselves from the hold of habits of thought  to be concerned about what is true and justâin one word  to raise ourselves to the point of shaping the world  instead of putting up with it  by following the contours marked out in the Charter of the United Nations.178.	The Charter's aims and principles are clear and remain relevant. But instead of concentrating on their reinforcement and effective application in deeds and in tangible ways  we see a sort of challenge; in fact no day goes by without us seeing them violated  here and there  or emptied of their content through prejudice and hatred. U Thant was right  12 years ago when he said:""When prejudice and hatred dominate the relations of nations or groups of nations  the whole world takes a step backward towards the dark ages . . . When force and military competitiveness displace co-operation  negotiation  law and diplomacy . . . the nightmare of a third world war comes steadily nearer the world of reality."" This vision of this world in which we have the sad privilege of dwelling is very pertinent; it is a world which remains more than ever in a situation of conflict.179.	Indeed  however praiseworthy some of the efforts which our Organization and other international bodies have made may have been  they have changed nothingâat least very littleâin this situation. Mankind remains dramatically split into two parts: the rich and the poor  the affluent and the wretched  the exploiters and the exploited  the oppressors and the oppressed. A minority  consisting of highly developed countries  due to its dominating position  determines alone the distribution of world resources through its own hierarchy. The resulting division of labour means that while they become increasingly richer  other countries languish in poverty. This  alas  is the basis of the world economic situation which we put up with today.â180.	International relations are still dominated by force  in accordance with the age-old law of the ""state of nature"". The need to dominate or to expand still haunts nations; it is always a matter of dominating or neutralizing the adversary. To the spirit of conquest in the traditional sense of the termâi.e.  the use of armed forceâother far more subtle forms have been added: for example  to ensure the supply of raw materials through most skilful trade policies and very well-placed investments; to control the means of production  distribution channels  movements of capital and exchange of goods; to support subversive movements aimed at undermining certain economic policies and destabilizing certain awkward regimes and so on.181.	We should no longer allow ourselves to be lulled by those who benefit from the imbalances and inequalities that increase the incidence of conflicts everywhere  create appetites for power and set up petty chiefs and tyrants in complete scorn for the will of peoples and human rights which  nevertheless  are proclaimed elsewhere. The game is well known; the manoeuvre is skilful: whether it is a matter of destabilizing regimes  encouraging plots or creating spheres of rivalry and hotbeds of war  the more or less avowed purpose is to promote an atmosphere of crisis  a climate of general insecurity  so as to divert free peoples from their essential concerns  by forcing them to be preoccupied with trivia.182.	In these conditions  we feel ill at ease in speaking of peace and security in the world. Our consciousness of these very noble principles is in conflict with everyday reality. The reality is in fact confrontation  war  aggression  generalized violence and military expeditions. These conflicts find their origin in a lack of respect on the part of some among us for commitments entered into freely and in full awareness and in the non-application of principles which we have unanimously accepted and adopted. There are numerous examples; furthermore  they constitute the essential items on our agenda.183.	Decolonization and the self-determination of peoples are among the key principles of our Organization. More than ever they should be made effective in South-East Asia  in Latin America  in the Middle East  in northern and southern Africa  wherever people are dominated  wherever they seek only to free from themselves the yoke of subjection  exploitation and shame and to recover their dignity. This is natural; this is in accordance with the most cherished aspirations of peoples; and yet we observe here and there reticence  opposition  vetoes. These are Machiavellian manifestations of a challenge to freedom  the negation of the development of peoples. Every year our conscience leads us to adopt resolutions on self-determination for the peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe  southern Africa  Western Sahara and Palestine and for other peoples still under colonial domination in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Shortly thereafter doubt is cast on them or they are never referred to again. What happens is that we do not all feel that we are really concerned by the acts to which we refer  and some among us continually allow themselves to be manipulated by the strongest to the point of no longer being convinced of the urgency of the problem of the security of peoples and of the seriousness of the threats weighing upon certain countries of the third world and  more specifically  upon Africa.184.	Africa is indeed the most vulnerable and the most exposed area. This continent  disoriented and in ferment  daily lives the tragedy of the flouting of the most elementary concepts of justice  freedom and sovereignty: Namibia  Zimbabwe  South Africa  Western Sahara  and certain parts of central Africa are the most striking proofs. In those regions entire peoples are daily deprived of their most elementary rights  to the point of becoming dehumanized  transformed with full impunity into vulgar herds of savage beasts.185.	This defiance  this negation of liberty  is felt even in the independent countries themselves. The aggression perpetrated by minority regimes against the frontline States is a manifest example. Every year it brings with it a train of troubles. From this rostrum we denounce a practice which is contrary to the most elementary international law and borders on gangsterism: it is that of Powers outside Africa which intervene directly in the internal affairs of other States to bring to power puppets which are in their pay.186.	It is obvious that such a policy has no other purpose but to preserve colonial interests and privileges.187.	On apartheid and the genocide of peoples every-thing has been said  and very well said  at this rostrum. But it can never too often be repeated. It is imperative that the Namibian people  under the enlightened guidance of SWAPO  must accede to independence. And they will succeed inevitably; that is our firm conviction  the conviction of fighting and free Africa and of all those throughout the world who support their just struggle.188.	Our consistent position in the affairs of Zimbabwe and Namibia has in no way been altered by the changes in events which have recently taken place.189.	Consistency also characterizes our position on Western Sahara and the Middle East. What has been called the ""peace process"" in the spirit of the Camp David agreements can be described as the exaltation of the position of strength of Israel to the detriment of the Palestinian people. For our part  we believe that there cannot be a guaranteed peace in the region without the participation of the PLO in any process designed to deal with the fate of the Palestinian people. In this respect  the idea of an international conference  as put forward by the Secretary-General in his report seems to us to constitute at this time the most positive approach to the problem.190.	The very simple idea which governs our thinking is that freedom cannot be bartered. Thus  the Saharan people can no longer be barred from the right to freedom  to self-determination  to existence itself.191.	We are pleased by the efforts made by the OAU and  above all  by the wise decision taken at Monrovia  recognizing the self-determination of the Saharan people. This is to the honour of Africa; it is an important step in the search for a definite and lasting peace in that part of the continent. We are also pleased with the victory in Nicaragua of the Sandinist forces over the dictator Somoza. This is a ray of hope and a source of encouragement for the peoples of Latin America which are still subjugated and exploited.192.	The world in obedience to its conscience should rise above the level of preparations for war. Throughout the world  peace requires correct solutions to the burning problems of decolonization and similar evils.193.	We are thinking here of the painful tragedy of divided countries: Korea naturally provides an example. It is time that the international conscience should be freed from this burden by an effective promotion of the peaceful reunification of Korea. This is still a matter of justice.194.	We must  of course  inevitably think of disarmament. Certain countries regard the arms race as an indispensable corollary to their industrial prosperity. Despite limited efforts such as those shown by the conclusion of the second SALT Treaty  general and complete disarmament  as advocated by the tenth special session  is still Utopian. Regrettably  we are bound to note that the arms race  the invention of increasingly sophisticated weapons and the perfection of atomic weapons have in some societies become daily practices  to the point where the threat of a thermonuclear conflagration remains suspended over our heads like the sword of Damocles.195.	What vast resources the entire international community would be able to dispose of if the concerns of war could be recycled into activities of peace. Such an approach implies and demands the establishment of a new international economic order. A few weeks ago at Havana  the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries once again proved that close to two thirds of the States Members of the United Nations were concerned with a fundamental change in the structures and mechanisms of the present system of injustice and frustration.197.	The decisions of the non-aligned movement  which is the common denominator of countries with varied systems and degrees of development  constitute in our opinion the minimum basis for all proposals designed to bring about a better economic organization of the present system in accordance with the purposes and principles defined at the sixth and seventh special sessions  and contained in  inter alia  the Charter of Economic Duties and Rights of States.198.	For a long time  Africa has been aware of its state of under-development. We are asking ourselves more and more questions; we are concerned about our future.199.	A symposium organized by the OAU and ECA at Monrovia at the beginning of this year drew up a diagnosis which brings to light the fact that 20 years after the era of nominal political independence  the real situation in Africa today remains painfully disquieting. We have excessive underemployment and unemployment; the lowest per capita revenues in the world; the highest infant mortality rate  the shortest life- expectancy  illiteracy  malnutrition  famine  economic dependence  chronic indebtedness and so forth; in brief  the African continent remains the continent of under-development  destitution and abandonment. That is the painful reality.200.	This situation of imbalance and great dependence is  first of all  the result of the will of the African States to integrate themselves into the international economic system  and into the dominant development structures linked thereto. It is also  unfortunately  the result of mimicry by the young economies which leads them to adopt inadequate development models  because they are centred on the needs of the African masses  and are not designed for endogenous development. The African economy remains  indeed  dependent on the industrialized world  its technology and its proficiency. Development theories are directed towards the export markets and the import of techniques  equipment  services and modern consumer products. The situation is still essentially what it was during the colonial era.201.	This is also the consequence of counter- performances of world development strategies adopted so far. The African continent has never been able to succeed in attaining the development objectives provided for in the first two United Nations Development Decades. The recent session of UNCTAD was more or less a repetition of the previous ones: once again it enshrined the selfishness and stubbornness of the rich world  and confirmed the refusal of the industrialized countries to seek a really new equitable and just world economic order. The other development strategies drawn up within a regional framework met no better fate. Thus  the co-operation begun within the framework of the Lome' Convention  between the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries and the European Economic Community only brought about limited solutions to the redoubtable problem of under-development.202.	Everything leads us to believe that the different economic  political and social instruments used in the various cases have only so far made it possible to strengthen and perpetuate the ties of dependence; in any event  they have brought to naught efforts designed to formulate new models of autonomous development.203.	Nevertheless these are necessary if we want ideas of justice  development and co-operation to continue to have meaning within our Organization. This means we must surpass ourselves; it means also that there must exist a political will to break the resistance to change of those who benefit from present imbalances and inequalities; to break with certain concepts and certain habits of the past and abolish the barriers to mental and social change. Only in these circumstances will we be able to devise measures to transform internal structures and improve the production factors on which an autonomous and self-sustaining development depend.204.	Then  future development strategies  either within the framework of the third United Nations decade or in the more general context of negotiations for the new international economic order  or the Tokyo round  or the law of the sea  and so forth  could be envisaged with some chance of success  as could all resolutions  declarations or programmes of action which we might be led to adopt. It is a problem of survival  not only for Africa but for all mankind; the human species cannot be saved or preserved from the dangers of war unless it directs all strategies towards a self-reliant and autonomous development which would ensure the .well-being and improve the quality of human life  and equity and justice among nations.205.	These are the essential matters on which we should all mobilize now.206.	When we look around us at all these eminent personalities who have come from the four-corners of the earth and are gathered here to speak the language of peace  justice  freedom and equality  it makes us rather optimistic and reinforces our faith in the future of man  and therefore the world. It strengthens our faith in this Organization and its principles  which remain fully valid because they are fundamental and universal.207.	In concluding  I should like to reaffirm here the devotion of the people of the Congo  united in their party  the Congolese Workers' Party  and of its chief  the 'President  Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso  to the tenets of the United Nations. These tenets should be able to guide our steps in this world  which is unceasingly destroying us and destroying itself from day to day. For our part  we are so keenly aware of the danger of a world explosion that it seems to us imperative to reconsider our role in what we conceive  what we produce  and in what we exchange."
"28",1514,"COL",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of my Government  I should like to congratulate Mr. Salim on his election as President of the thirty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly. Our Organization has thereby attempted to acknowledge the debt it owes to his country  the United Republic of Tanzania  and its illustrious President  Mr. Julius Nyerere  in the lengthy struggle for the decolonization of Africa  a task that entailed many risks. In Mr. Salim we recognize the continuity of that tradition of struggle for freedom and self-determination of peoples. In the Special Committee on decolonization  we have seen him as a leader of the decolonization movement and we were amazed at how well he guided the work of the Special Committee at such an early age.94.	On behalf of the Government of Colombia  I should also like to extend a fraternal welcome to Saint Lucia  the beautiful Caribbean island that has just achieved full independence. It enters the United Nations in its own Right  as it has entered our regional group  the Organization of American States. In both organizations  we hope to co-operate with it for the success of our endeavours. We offer it our support in order that its international role may be commensurate with its people's just deserts.95.	The thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly is convening against a background of contradictory signs and of threats to world peace. No one can ignore the efforts this Organization has made to preserve security in various continents and its tireless striving to avert conflicts that would inevitably have led to new hostilities. However  speaking objectively  we should note that the United Nations must seek to recover the initiative in and responsibility for the maintenance of peace on the five continents of the world  lest all that does not partake of the spirit of the Charter and that is undertaken without reference to the competence of United Nations bodies should subsequently occasion fresh difficulties on the road of understanding and concord.96.	This is why in my statement to the Assembly last year I emphasized the importance of strengthening the Organization as the nerve-centre of major world decisions. In pursuit of that policy  I now wish to present some views  on behalf of Colombia  on how the functioning of the world Organization might be strengthened in a creative spirit.97.	First  my country continues to view with concern the ongoing crisis in the Middle East  an area now being shaken by new and disturbing signs of strife. We believe that peace in the region must be sought through the United Nations system and that it must be based on over-all solutions in accordance with the spirit of the oft-reaffirmed Security Council resolutions. These solutions can only lead to progress to the extent that they include the full recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people to a sovereign territory. This situation is analogous in many respects to that which Israel faced in 1947.98.	Accordingly  the initiative of the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  to convene a special conference with the participation of all parties concerned on the basis of equality is a step forward which should be supported and adopted by the present session of the General Assembly. The indefinite postponement of this problem has brought grave difficulties to the countries of the Middle East  and the call for a just solution deserves universal attention  as does the future status of Jerusalem  a city holy to three of the world's major monotheistic religions.99.	Together with the Middle East  we must emphasize with anxiety the tragic condition of the people of South Africa  where a systematic crime against the indigenous populations is being perpetuated in the sys- tern of apartheid  which is unequivocally rejected by all free peoples. Coupled with genocidal violations of human rights  South Africa's nuclear arms policy now poses a threat not only to the peace of the region but also to world security. The decolonization process which the United Nations has so successfully been carrying forward should now be directed essentially to preventing the racist policy of South Africa from being perpetuated and thus jeopardizing collective security. Apartheid  which is perhaps the worst crime of our times  must be eradicated through new and more vigorous policies from the Security Council and the General Assembly.100.	The independence of Namibia and an appropriate solution to the problem of Zimbabwe are also matters of particular concern.101.	Colombia has for some time observed that Article 2  paragraph 3  of the Charter  which makes the Pacific settlement of disputes mandatory  has not yet seen the subject of orderly development offering possibilities for settlement in many conflicts. The world is aware that the problems of our times stem from a combination of economic  political and social factors which do not always lend themselves to solutions by law. Possibly  the branch of international relations in which there has been the least progress is the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. Both the International Court of Justice and the Permanent Court of Arbitration tend to be kept at one remove from the difficulties which they were intended to solve and for which they were established. It would therefore be a proper task for this Assembly  in pursuance of the imperatives of the Charter  to promote a current of world opinion aimed at devising new and imaginative machinery for the settlement of disputes. Colombia views with favour and lends its support to the initiative of the Government of Austria to establish a centre for research and conciliation which could by its flexible character contribute to the direct settlement of disputes which might arise In future. This plan has been discussed previously in the Assembly but  while there might have been doubts in the past as to its desirability  world security today demands more expeditious and manageable instruments which can be resorted to so as to reconcile conflicting positions and prevent the deterioration of relations among States.102.	Colombia has been an advocate of furthering the work on the review of the Charter  efforts on which have yielded only hesitant conclusions. However  without prejudice to continuing this work  a decision by the General Assembly to create new machinery for investigation and conciliation together with new imaginative approaches to the mediation of international conflicts is not only a timely task but also a very promising one.103.	Our country is firmly convinced that the international crisis we are going through is directly related to the stagnation of programmes for a new international economic order  which the United Nations itself has proclaimed as an undertaking of the Organization and made into a norm of conduct for its Member Governments. It is obvious that the North-South dialogue  which began with so much optimism  has only given rise to new frustrations. As its last session in Manila UNCTAD once again brought to light the lack of understanding of the industrialized countries vis-a-vis the demands of the third world  and We must not hide the fact that progress was scant  if we bear in mind the magnitude of the programme which should have been covered. Colombia fully supports the proposal for global negotiations as presented by the developing countries.104.	With regard to the law of the sea  the intransigence of some Powers has complicated the task of drawing up a harmonious and just code for the use of the oceans. Each time the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is convened  we hear in ever stronger terms the voices of those countries which disregard the achievements of the small and medium-sized countries  achievements which had seemed secure  such as the 200-mile limit of sovereignty over economic resources. With respect to the sea-bed authority  the distribution of powers now claimed dampens our hopes that the future treaty could become a true instrument for the decolonization of the seas.105.	With reference to the question of price-support machinery for commodities  such as coffee and sugar  the major consumers are reluctant to support its operation  which  coupled with the new obstacles to trade in commodities from developing countries  is rendering the world distribution of power increasingly unfair. To that we must add the dwindling financial potential of international bodies devoted to promoting cooperation  which earmark disproportionate sums for administrative expenditures with the concomitant decline in aid programmes.106.	The demand by the equatorial countries that the synchronous geostationary orbit should become part of the resources falling within their full competence  a point on which Colombia reaffirms its full solidarity with the countries of the area  has been persistently rejected by certain Powers  which wish in the matter of outer space as with the use of the seas to reserve resources for their exclusive use.107.	This review of developments which point to a grave deterioration of international co-operation in recent times leads to the conclusion that the concept of the new international economic order is still nothing more than an aspiration which is frustrated at every step.108.	To this negative balance-sheet of international co-operation  which sows mistrust in relations between the affluent nations and the third world  we must add the energy crisis  which has dealt its hardest blows to the small and medium-sized countries.109.	At the Meeting of Heads of State or Government held in Caracas during the term of office of the distinguished Venezuelan leader Mr. Luis Herrera Campuis  on the initiative of Mr. Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala  President of Colombia  the following statement was made:""Let us avail ourselves of this opportunity to address an appeal to the petroleum-producing countries and to the entire world concerning the need to establish without delay appropriate machinery to permit a logical application of the price of petroleum and its derivatives. Our position is not one of opposition to the establishment of just prices. On the contrary  we need such prices for our products. But we take exception openly with arbitrary price-fixing and an indiscriminate increase in the price of petroleum  which has been accompanied by substantial speculation on spot-market prices and which deprives our peoples of their prerogatives.""110.	The Caracas declaration  from which I have just quoted  was signed on 12 March 1979 by the Presidents of Bolivia  Colombia  Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic  as well as by the Head of Government of Spain. The views expressed referred to the urgency of seeking  at an international level  machinery to reader less difficult the fulfilment of development programmes for countries which lack petroleum and therefore face critical difficulties.111.	It is worth while emphasizing  in addition  the view expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Venezuela  Mr. Jose Alberto Zambrano  in the statement he made at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Havana:""As countries members of OPEC "" we are fully aware of the imperative need for new initiatives and strategies of preferential co-operation with the developing countries  and this matter will have special priority at the next meeting of OPEC to be held in Caracas at the end of this year"".112.	President Jose' Lopez Portillo of Mexico also discussed the desirability of adopting  within the framework of the United Nations  a new policy with respect to energy sources  especially petroleum. All these statements buttress and underscore the urgent need for the General Assembly itself to take steps and provide guidelines in order to deal with the major problem now burdening the developing world.113.	With reference to Latin America  we must welcome as an important development the creation of the Junta of National Reconstruction as the new Government of Nicaragua established in the wake of the heroic victory which overthrew the Somoza dictatorship  a development that was endorsed by the General Assembly itself at its last session in response to charges of human rights violations brought by the Governments of Colombia and Venezuela. The tragic events which the Nicaraguan people have endured compel us to reiterate the appeal made to all countries to contribute to the task of national reconstruction in a spirit of authentic international solidarity.114.	The signing in Panama on 1 October of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties restoring sovereignty over the Canal Zone to the Republic of Panama should be hailed as a genuine triumph for free peoples.115.	Perhaps the most important political development this year in South America was the strengthening of the Andean sub regional group  comprising Bolivia  Colombia  Ecuador  Peru and Venezuela. This constitutes an important step towards economic integration and encourages joint action vis-a-vis various international organizations. The Andean Group  created by the Cartagena Agreement  is perhaps the best example of horizontal co-operation and of efforts to cope with the unequal conditions under which third-world countries are labouring in the face of the crisis of international co-operation to which I have referred.116.	The appeal I am making on behalf of the Government of Colombia for the creation of machinery to develop the mandate of the Charter in the sphere of the peaceful settlement of disputes  the urgent need for the United Nations fully to exercise the responsibility for the maintenance of peace that rightfully falls to it  the importance of furthering the new international economic order in the domain of possible achievements and the urgency of arriving at a common policy with respect to the critical energy situation are all things that are not only the aspirations of my country but also undertakings of the United Nations  which should understand the new path it must follow so that economic and social conditions in the world will not trigger a new conflagration of unforeseeable dimensions.117.	For confidence in the future of the Organization to be renewed  as it must be  what is required today is steadfastness and boldness in the quest for a new system of international relations. Because of its urgency  this is something that should be the subject of particular attention by all countries  and it is something which Colombia repeatedly advocates.118.	World peace requires that a supreme effort be made to narrow disparities in development among nations and to ensure that policies based on power alone give way to an order in which human dignity and the fundamental rights of peoples are guaranteed by law. To that end  Colombia  as a deeply democratic country  offers its loyal co-operation."
"29",1555,"COM",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  first of all I should like to associate myself with the previous speakers who have extended to you warm congratulations on your unanimous election to preside over this session. The United Republic of Tanzania  which you so well and capably represent in our Organization  maintains with my country more than mere good-neighbourly relations. In fact close historical ties link our two peoples  and today many of the sons of the Comoros have become worthy and loyal citizens of your country. We are particularly proud that the Tanzanian people  under the enlightened leadership of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  is waging a daily and relentless struggle for the total emancipation and liberation of the African continent. There is no doubt that your personal qualities as a gifted diplomat and your unswerving faith in the defence of African interests and international peace will contribute a great deal to the success we all hope for at this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. You can be sure that my delegation will always be ready to make its modest contribution in the carrying out of your delicate and important functions.106.	Permit me also to congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Lievano of Colombia  on his competence and tireless devotion in carrying out his task.107.	We also express our admiration and gratitude to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has been so steadfast in the service of international justice and peace.108.	We should also like to bid welcome to Saint Lucia  the one hundred and fifty-second Member of our Organization. Like Saint Lucia  the Comoros is an island State with a limited area and resources  and these  among other factors  have given rise to an excessive dependence on the outside world and have thus seriously hindered our economic development.109.	Permit me to take this opportunity to describe briefly the difficult  not to say tragic  situation of the developing island countries of which my own is one. Indeed  obvious and particular structural constraints connected with our isolation  our great distance from the major international markets  the extremely small size of our internal markets and also the total lack of natural resources coupled with an extraordinary shortage of qualified administrative and technical personnel  are a heavy burden for our economy to bear. This is a day-to-day reality  something which calls for specific measures to be taken not only by the international community  particularly the relevant bodies of the United Nations  but also by the developed countries  to help us to overcome as best we can the various economic fluctuations and the effects of inflation by which the developing island countries are particularly cruelly affected.110.	The Comorian islands are situated in a part of the Indian Ocean where floods and cyclones every year threaten to destroy crops  thus making even worse an economic situation that is already extremely precarious. So far the Comorian economy has been almost totally based on agriculture and we never have enough resources to diversify production. Perfume essences and vanilla still constitute the bulk of our exports  and the prices of these products  unfortunately  are subject to enormous fluctuations on the international market from one year to another. This is something which  as a consequence  serves to accentuate our state of dependence on the outside world and to reduce constantly the purchasing power of our people. The disaster which recently befell the West Indies reminds us again  if there were any need of this  how vulnerable are the economies of island countries.111.	We can only be gratified  therefore  at the increased measure of concern and the particular attention which our Organization  through its competent bodies  particularly UNCTAD  has been increasingly devoting to the specific situation of island countries such as ours  to enable us to develop and effectively to fight the disasters which constantly threaten our economy.112.	The Government of the Federal and Islamic Re-public of the Comoros is consequently fully aware both of the limits and of the real possibilities of a small island country like our own and we are all the more able to understand the need to pursue a policy of intensive co-operation  open to our region and to the world at large  if we are to overcome our isolation and underdevelopment. It is for this reason that we have chosen to pursue a policy of active co-operation with all countries  based on national sovereignty and equality among States  expressing in this way our sincere wish to establish and consolidate links of solidarity  interdependence and mutual interest.113.	Today  we have welcomed to our midst the one hundred and fifty-second Member of our Organization. More than 100 sovereign States have thus joined the original signatories of the San Francisco Charter  and have committed themselves unanimously to working towards the establishment of international peace  and the bringing about of a more humane and a more just world. All types of regimes are represented in this Assembly. Representatives of all political tendencies and all political and socio-economic systems are sitting side by side. It is our view that this diversity  instead of dividing us and pitting us against each other  can  on the contrary  constitute a factor for narrowing the differences between men and nations  and thus enrich our exchanges on the basis of our respective experience. It is only in this way that our Organization can fully play its role as an organ serving international peace and co-operation.114.	Speaking of international peace and cooperation  if we simply look at the items listed on the agenda of this session  we will see that unfortunately we have not yet made any decisive progress towards the attainment of the objectives or the fulfilment of the aspirations of our Organization. We really must show a little more realism if we are to dare to express any justified optimism or even to attenuate to some extent the feeling of profound malaise which affects the whole world. Indeed  the problem of war and peace is still extremely acute. Economic turbulence  the proliferation of hotbeds of tension as well as futile dialogues on questions which are none the less fundamental  are all evidence of the troubled and divided world in which we live. At the same time  poverty  hunger and disease are gaining ground while inflation is constantly growing  paralysing the efforts of the third-world countries and thus posing a threat to our economies.115.	It is now more necessary than ever  if we really want to bring about peace in the world  for our Organization to acquire the means of putting an end to this situation in order to promote and increase co-operation between the industrialized world and the developing countries. Our peoples expect and call for the establishment and implementation of this new  more just and equitable international economic order  which will bring them a higher measure of prosperity and freedom. There can be no doubt that such an objective  if it is to be achieved  calls for a greater measure of cohesion among us  the development of horizontal and vertical co-operation and  above all  the genuine will on the part of the affluent countries to make concessions so that the North-South dialogue does not become  as it did at the Manila session of UNCTAD  a mere series of failures.116.	My delegation  for its part  will support any attempt at overcoming the present crisis and is gratified at the initiatives taken by the United Nations  which organized in Buenos Aires last year  and also in Vienna this year  conferences to discuss ways of promoting co-operation among the developing countries and of placing technology at the service of development. Similarly  my country welcomes the felicitous initiative of the recent convening of a conference on agrarian reform in Rome. 117.	These important meetings were an opportunity for our countries to pool their experiences and to take thought together as to the most appropriate measures to be adopted.118.	We must now put an end to  or at least limit  the proliferation and spread of weapons of mass destruction  since the arms industry is something which swallows up colossal sums of moneyâmoney which could otherwise be used for the development of international economic co-operation.119.	The coastal States of the Indian Ocean are profoundly concerned by the proliferation of military strategic bases in the area. This is a serious threat to the sovereignty of the States of that region  as well as to international peace and security.120.	My Government therefore will support any initiative to make the Indian Ocean a zone of peace  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI). We strongly favour the convening of a regional conference on the demilitarization of that zone. There can be no true peace or real economic development until claims of hegemony are eliminated from the world.121.	One cannot on the one hand proclaim and welcome detente and the benefits of peaceful coexistence and co-operation while at the same time pursuing a policy involving the proliferation of destructive weapons  the establishment of military bases  the strengthening of strategic bases and the manipulation of armed conflictsâin fact  running the whole gamut of methods of economic domination.122.	True and lasting peace can be brought about only by establishing a climate of mutual confidence and increased international solidarity.123.	In this regard we believe that the agreements reached as a result of the second round of SALT are a step forward towards international peace.124.	I wish now to turn to some of the fundamental questions which rightly are of concern to the international community and require urgent solutions.125.	We are convinced that these solutions can easily be found by peaceful means  no matter what the causes of conflict and tension are  provided that every Member of our Organization affirms by its actions our unanimous commitment to bring about peace in the world.126.	In southern Africa  because we were unwilling to enforce and apply the decisions of our Assembly and to have them complied with by the racists of southern Africa  our brothers have no other choice but to have recourse to armed struggle to bring down the tyranny of the racists in Pretoria and Salisbury. The odious system of apartheid continues to flourish in defiance of our Organization.127.	In Zimbabwe the combined action of the liberation movements  the OAU and our own Organization  finally won out over the racist minority Smith regime. In the face of victories by the Patriotic Front  the authentic representative of the people of Zimbabwe  the rebels had recourse to a monumental farce in the hope that we would believe that they were finally ready to give up their many advantages in favour of those whom so far they have despised and treated as sub-humans.128.	Let us hope that those who wanted to come to terms with Smith will understand that they have allowed themselves to be taken in by illusory promises.129.	We for our part would like to believe that the Powers involved in seeking a solution to this problem will do so henceforth on the basis of equity and equality and in the desire to establish a new and just constitution on the basis of the principle of ""one man one vote"" which will ensure that the black majority effectively exercises power. We express the hope that the London conference will bring about positive results.130.	On the subject of Namibia  not only does the regime in Pretoria occupy the Territory illegally but  what is worse South Africa uses it to launch murderous attacks against the front-line countries  causing casualties among the civilian population.131.	These daily crimes speak for themselves and should suffice to dispel once and for all the least possible doubt as to the truly belligerent intentions of the Pretoria racists.132.	More than ever before  we must take the necessary measures to put an end to this barbarous regime and redouble our support for SWAPO  the legitimate representative of the Namibian people.133.	On the subject of the Middle East  my Government agrees with the consensus which emerged in Monrovia at the sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU.134.	However  we wish to repeat our unreserved support for the Palestinian cause and its legitimate representative  the PLO. We also wish to reiterate our conviction that the question of Palestine is the very core of the problem of the Middle East and that any solution with which the PLO is not associated will not be valid. Peace in this region  if it is to be just and lasting  must be global and must  above all  take account of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people: namely  the restoration of the national and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people; the right of the Palestinians to return to homes; their right to self-determination and to establish an independent State in the land of Palestine; the return of all the territories occupied since 1967; and finally the restitution to Jerusalem of its mission as a Holy City under Arab-Moslem sovereignty.135.	With regard to Western Sahara  my Government is following developments with the closest attention. The Comoros maintains fraternal relations with all the parties to this conflict. The peoples in this part of the world have human and cultural ties which they should make use of in order to lay the foundations for economic and social development in their common interests. My country will support any initiative which could bring about peace and detente in that region.136.	The situation in Cyprus is another source of concern to my delegation. We hope that by means of negotiations the two Cypriot communities will find common ground and arrive at a solution which will respect the territorial integrity  the independence and the non- alignment of Cyprus and which will make possible the peaceful coexistence and the socio-economic development of that country.137.	Another danger that threatens peace is the explosive situation in South-East Asia. There is a food crisis  an influx of refugees  and as a consequence tens of thousands of innocent people have undergone the greatest possible suffering. Our Organization must take the necessary humanitarian measures and make the maximum effort to restore peace in this area.138.	I now turn to a problem which is of the greatest concern to my delegation  and indeed to the whole of Africa. I refer to the subject of the Comorian island of Mayotte. This is an item on our agenda  and when the time comes my delegation will describe the situation and will do its best to assist in the search for a satisfactory solution to the problem.139.	We have asked for the consideration of this item because the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State are at stake. For the Government of the Comoros there can be no doubt that  as long as the island of Mayotte falls outside its effective control  efforts at economic development in the country will be doomed to failure. The Comoros is a small and  above all  an island country  which can make progress only with the commitment of all its citizens to the work of national reconstruction.140.	The search for a solution to the question of Mayotte remains a matter of constant and fundamental concern to the Comorian authorities. Therefore  the particular attention which this Assembly is according to the settlement of this question is a source of general satisfaction and encouragement for us.141.	Throughout the colonial period  the Comoros constituted a single political and economic entity. This is why the decolonization of that country cannot be brought about by dismembering it. Furthermore  it is a cherished principle of our Organization that peoples shall reach independence within frontiers inherited from the colonial period.142.	I do not want to begin a debate on this question  but I wish to recall that the General Assembly in resolution 32/7 called on the Governments of France and the Comoros to solve this problem by negotiation.143.	We  the Comoros  for our part are ready  and we have always been ready  to negotiate with France to put an end to this controversy and to lift the dark cloud hanging over the relations between our two countries. Therefore  it is with the aim of creating a climate favourable to these negotiations and of showing the open-mindedness of the Government of Comoros that we have so far been engaged in a number of specific actions.144.	We have  for example  agreed to resume relations with France  which had been broken off over the last few years. We hope that this act will be properly appreciated and that the French side will recognize the efforts of the Comorian Government to create an appropriate atmosphere conducive to dialogue.145.	It was in the same desire to prepare the ground for negotiations that the Head of State of the Comoros requested a meeting with his French counterpart to talk about the situation in Mayotte. On that occasion  the two parties agreed to re-examine the question and to look for a satisfactory solution.146.	Pending the return of Mayotte to the Comoros  my Government has also decided to provide a new  federal-type constitution for our State which will provide a large measure of administrative autonomy for each island  while respecting the unity of the Republic.147.	That important measure is aimed not only at establishing a decentralized administration  better adapted to the island nature of my country  but also  and above all  at fulfilling the wishes of the inhabitants of Mayotte truly to have the management of their political and economic affairs in their own hands.148.	The Constitution of the Federal and Islamic Re-public of the Comoros  adopted by the Comorian people in October 1978  ensures for the inhabitants of Mayotte  once that island is integrated into the Republic of the Comoros  the enjoyment of the same rights and guarantees as the three other islands of Anjouan  Grande-Comore and Moheli.149.	By these measures  the Comorian Government has demonstrated its active wish  within the limits of its resources and means  to contribute to progress on this question and to provide further momentum to it in order to hasten the advent of a satisfactory solution. All avenues have certainly not been explored and we thus welcome any initiative which would really help us to break the present deadlock.150.	We have kept the OAU and the United Nations  as well as all other international bodies  constantly informed of the development of the situation in the Comoros as well as of the measures adopted by the Government to hasten the achievement of a solution to the Mayotte question.151.	We shall continue to do this in all objectivity  and in a desire to exclude any spirit of contention  so that France and we ourselves can  as soon as is humanly possible  enter into the decisive phase of the negotiations.â152.	The affair of Mayotte is a question of decolonization  an area which undoubtedly constitutes one of the most glorious chapters of the history of our Organization. That at least encourages us to think that  as such  it will rapidly find a satisfactory solution  in keeping with the interests of the people of the Comoros.153.	Finally  I should like to conclude my statement by expressing the sincere hope that this session will mark a decisive turning-point in terms of concrete action and practical understandings  and that it will be an important contribution to bringing about peace in the world."
"30",1595,"CPV",34,1979,"ï»¿About four years ago we came to the General Assembly for the first time  after a long struggle for national liberation which made it possible for the people of Cape Verde to enjoy their inalienable right to stand on their own feet  to think for themselves and in freedom and peace to build their society in accordance with the profound aspirations for justice and progress of all the peoples represented here who constitute the very essence of the United Nations.42.	Imbued with the ideals enshrined in our Charter  the Republic of Cape Verde  on its accession to sovereignty  joined that growing circle of sovereign countries on the basis of wholesome respect for the principles today guiding the international community  aware of its responsibilities as a Member State and truly understanding its role in the concert of nations  and it has always supported and shown confidence in the United Nations. Our Organization is today responsive to the legitimate aspirations of the countries of the third world and open to the demanding winds of contemporary history and less vulnerable than formerly to selfish moves  because we are more realistic and more democratic in our approach to problems. The increasingly important role these countries are playing in our Organization strengthens our convictions and encourages us in our hope that we have taken a significant step towards the establishment of a more democratic order in international relations.43.	We take this opportunity to welcome the Republic of Saint Lucia  which has just joined our Organization  an act confirming us in our view.44.	Four years have passed since we joined this distinguished gathering as an independent country  and since that time we have had an opportunity to test the political maturity of this Assembly and assess the important possibilities for action open to the Organization. The effectiveness of the Organization is constantly being tested by the changing political opinions of Member States  and we must strengthen that effectiveness  as is required by members of the international community increasingly aware of their duties and obligations. This effectiveness will determine whether the major needs of our peoples  the demands of nations that have been plundered and States that have no recourse when faced with the many dangerous problems affecting the inter-national community in the sphere of national development  will be met.45.	The international situation since the thirty-third session of the General Assembly has continued to evolve in a way that we can with difficulty refer to as being positive  especially when one bears in mind the following facts: the worsening of the world economic crisis  marked by inflation which stands in the way of the efforts of the international community and particularly the developing countries to bring about progress; the energy crisis  which has had a disastrous effect on our economies; the persistence of trouble spots which  if allowed to continue  might very well endanger international peace; the outbreak of conflicts with new features that threaten long-standing geo-political balances; and  finally  efforts  which have so far been unsuccessful  to reconcile the views of the industrialized countries with those of the developing countries in major negotiations which should lead to a new international economic order that is more just and equitable.46.	Confronted as we are with this disturbing tangle of circumstances  which it behoves us to approach as objectively as we can  you must try  Mr. President  to apprehend the complex factors behind the interests of States in our day and conduct our debates in such a way as to buttress the efforts of every one in the endeavour to bring about just and lasting solutions which are satisfactory to the people we represent. Here you have our complete support  Mr. President. As a renowned diplomat  familiar with the intricacies of international politics and an indefatigable fighter for just causes  profoundly involved in our struggles for the ideals of the United Nations  you deserve our consideration and respect. When we were fighting for our liberation  the PAIGC needed the support of all its friends in this Organization  and our party always found a supporter in you. You were a brother in arms  deeply committed to our national liberation movement  and you fully identified yourself with our aims of justice and progress.47.	We would like to express our appreciation and our feeling of the profound solidarity between our country and the United Republic of Tanzania  which has  in the interests of our people  built a nation in dignity and courage under the enlightened and wise leadership of their respected leader  Julius Nyerere. The United Re-public of Tanzania is a fraternal country for which we in Cape Verde have great admiration  and we are proud of the bonds which have united us since before our independence.48.	We should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  who  thanks to his political experience and competence  was able to conduct our last session in a successful manner. It was a difficult session in many respects.49.	We should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who continues calmly  responsibly and intelligently to watch over the fortunes of our Organization. During these troubled and eventful times  his wisdom and loftiness of vision have helped him to understand our international problems  and he will surely once again contribute to our debates and help implement solutions to the various difficult problems which are of concern to us. We should like also to express our support to him for his laudable efforts to implement the decisions of our Assembly and ensure respect for the principles contained in the United Nations Charter  and to add that we are constantly at his disposal to give him our support in his many difficult tasks.50.	Last year  our Prime Minister  Pedro Rodrigues Verona Pires  stressed here the importance of our geographical position' 'at the crossroads of peoples and continents'' âa position which means that Cape Verde is destined to make a contribution to the coming together of the people of the world.51.	It may not be in vain to reaffirm here our determination to contribute to the defence of peace and good- neighbourliness among nations. This means  from our point of view  unswerving respect for the fundamental principles of non-alignment  and in particular the principles of non-interference in internal affairs  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of conditions for fruitful and just co-operation among States.52.	We are well aware that these principles and essential rules for peaceful coexistence among nations in our day cannot assume their full significance until there is reciprocity that applies to all and until they benefit all the dominated peoples of the world.53.	In taking up the situation in Africa  we should like to mention the name of one man  a great freedom fighter and chief of State  Agostinho Neto  to whom this General Assembly paid a just tribute at the opening of this session. A convinced militant and indefatigable fighter for the causes of peoples  Agostinho Neto devoted his entire life to the Angolan nation  and participated selflessly and courageously as one of Africa's finest sons in the modern adventure of that continent's search for its true identity. His passing is an inestimable loss to Africa  to the third world and to all peoples who love peace and justice. He was undeniably one of their greatest leaders and bravest defenders.54.	In the southern part of our continent we note with regret and growing concern the many manoeuvres which are being carried out and which have been carried out since our last session by the minority racist regimes with a view to dispossessing the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia of their inalienable right to independence  peace  justice and progress. These manoeuvres  which are of every kind  are aimed at perpetuating a system of domination and exploitation which has been repudiated by the international community and to maintain systems of alliances which will promote that domination 55.	The so-called ""internal settlement"" solution  which consists of placing in powerâeither through a ""government"" or through a ""Constituent Assembly""ânon-representative elements that are totally committed to the interests of the ruling racist minority  has shown itself to be unacceptable.56.	The recent Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity in Monrovia in July provided a stinging denial of these attempts to fool the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia by formulating precise recommendations with regard to the possible recognition of any puppet regime.57. It is to be hoped that the London talks may be able to produce results enabling the people of Zimbabwe to move towards real independence unhampered by the plans and schemes of the neo-colonialists and racists. We would reiterate our confidence in the people of Zimbabwe who  under the guidance of their liberation movement  the Patriotic Front  will prevent any recurrence of these manoeuvres which are aimed at stifling their fundamental aspirations.58.	In Namibia  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAFO] continues to be the sole representative of the Namibian people and deserves the full support of the African countries and of the United Nations. It seems to us essential to affirm once again that the only way to bring about a just solution which corresponds to the real aspirations of the peoples of the area would be to consolidate what has been won in terms of the liberation struggle and to strengthen the liberation movement.59.	The United Nations  whose resolutions have year after year been flouted and ignored by the racist regimes  might very well outlive its usefulness prematurely if this Assembly allowed the present attempts at neo-colonial solutions to take root. It must contribute effectively to overthrowing any illegal and illegitimate power that can never bring about the fulfilment of deep- seated aspirations of the peoples of the region.60.	Enhanced vigilance by the international community is necessary with regard to the development of the situation in these two Territories. The true nature of the racist regimes must be understood  for they are responsible for barbaric murderous acts of aggression against the front-line countries  particularly against Angola  Mozambique and Zambia.61.	The objective of these acts of aggression  which have been perpetrated in arrant defiance of international law  is to destabilize those countries and to create a situation which would force the withdrawal of support for the national liberation movements.62.	In South Africa  which remains the rearguard and active support of the racist regimes of Zimbabwe and Namibia  there still exists an intolerable situation which has been condemned time and time again by the General Assembly. It is a situation where systematic violation of the most elementary human rights has become the system of Government. This bastion of apartheid is pursuing the policy of bantustanization  which has so often been condemned by this Assembly  and is also stepping up its acts of terrorism against the independent countries of Africa.63.	We are profoundly convinced that in the present situation only international action undertaken in unconditional solidarity with the liberation movements of the peoples of southern Africa will make it possible to put an end to a situation which weighs heavily on the con-science of mankind and which might very well lead to explosions of violence  the consequences of which are quite unpredictable.64.	The present situation in Western Sahara is a source of lively concern for all African countries and for the peoples of the world who share a love of peace and justice. In fact  in the face of intransigence  which tends to perpetuate aggression and consolidate the systematic violation of the elementary human rights of the people of Western Sahara  those people  under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO  are waging a fierce struggle for the aims and ideals which the international community has elevated to the rank of principle and embodied in international law.65.	During its Assembly in Monrovia in July  the OAU  acting responsibly and with a keen awareness of realities  was able to open the way and indicate the principles and objectives of a just settlement of the problem  reaffirming the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and independence.66.	It is a matter of concern and regret that the Government of Morocco  defying the efforts and decisions of the OAU has contributed  by its obstinate attitude  to the deterioration of the dangerous climate of tension that carries the greatest threat for peace and stability in the area.67.	We sincerely hope that the parties will see the light  and make it possible to co-operate in implementing the recommendations of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara and bring about a just solution to the problem of the people of Western Sahara  that heroic people which under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO has already suffered too much. In this way  we shall prevent the extension of a conflict which would inevitably assume more threatening proportions thus causing severe moral  material and human harm to all the opposing countries in that area.68.	In the same way  we cannot accept the colonial situation imposed on the people of East Timor which  under the leadership of FRETILIN  continues to fight for the total implementation of their aspirations to freedom and independence.69.	In the Middle East there prevails a situation of aggression and profound injustice against a people who have been expelled from their lands  hunted down and robbed  and against the Arab nation as a whole that has seen its Holy Places defiled and its territorial integrity destroyed.70.	This situation continues to outrage the general feeling of the international community  which has been expressed so often and so unequivocally in this General Assembly and in other institutions of our Organization.71.	We continue to be convinced that peace in the Middle East must be comprehensive  and independence and security for all the peoples of the area must be guaranteed within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.72.	It is up to this General Assembly once again to demand the complete withdrawal of Israel from all the Palestinian and Arab territories it has occupied  and to demand the recovery by the Palestinian people of all their inalienable national rights  including the right to an independent Palestinian State. The Assembly must also consider what effective steps can be taken to induce Israel to respect decisions of the Assembly and to renounce its policy of aggression  expansion and plunder.73.	I should like once again to express our unswerving support for the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole legitimate representative of the heroic people of Palestine  and our conviction that a final settlement of the problem of the Middle East cannot be brought about without the active participation of the PLO  on a footing of equality with all the parties directly involved in the conflict.74.	The General Assembly must do its utmost to safe-guard the territorial integrity of Lebanon and restore peace and stability to that Member country. Otherwise it is to be feared that the situation will become more serious and assume incalculable proportions.75.	In Cyprus  it is high time that the talks between the two communities should  without outside intervention and as soon as possible  decide on specific action to take to meet the profound aspirations for peace and justice of the Cypriot people  and to achieve unity and territorial integrity in the country  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.76.	While the international community as a whole realizes the need to put an end to the arms race and to follow a course leading towards real disarmament as laid down by the tenth special session of the General Assembly  it must be recognized that up to now that community has not used to the full all the means it has to control the present dangerous and costly process  to strengthen security among States and to give to detente a universal and stable meaning  on all five continents.77.	In this context  the recent signing of the Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Weapons reached at the conclusion of the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT]  is a source of satisfaction and should encourage the parties to pursue and extend their scope.78.	The continuance of a system where peace is only the result of an abiding fear of mutual destruction cannot create an atmosphere favourable to the attainment of the conditions necessary for reaching the objectives of general and complete disarmament.79.	In this important process in which the international community is engaged in putting an end to the arms race and limiting weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons with a view to general and complete disarmament  the United Nations has a central role to play  one of growing importance in the achievement of its major objectives 80.	We hope that both the Disarmament Commission and the Committee on Disarmament will carry out the missions assigned to them and create the conditions necessary for fruitful negotiations yielding tangible results  notably in the field of negotiations concerning nuclear weapons.81.	The Republic of Cape Verde ascribes great importance to the relationship between disarmament and development  and hopes that the various bodies of our Organization will be able to propose practical ways and means of devoting a large part of the resources released from the arms race to the satisfaction of the fundamental social and economic needs of the developing countries and  in particular  of the least developed among them.82.	The establishment of a lasting policy of international security should make it possible for countries to devote their efforts to development and to enjoy that well-being that is the unanimous desire of the international community  a desire that should be put into effect  not so much in terms of resolutions  conventions and declarations  as in tangible facts  in international relations and in concrete actions taken within the framework of disarmament.83.	Our country is now occupied with many different tasks: the struggle for national reconstruction  the struggle against drought  the struggle against the remaining after-effects of colonialism; and a struggle to develop our greatest resource  the Cape Verde citizen.84.	In present circumstances austerity continues to be the chief guideline of our economic and financial activities. It will bring about stability and discipline in all sectors.85.	In a country of limited resources  recently emerged from a cruelly neglectful colonial domination and a prey to natural disasters  such as drought  it is difficult to believe in miracles. It is only natural that we should use man as the starting-point of our efforts and of all our hopes. The harsh realities of Cape Verde make it necessary for us to mobilize all our efforts to deal methodically with determination and without unnecessary haste  with these long-standing problems  using strategies and tactics based on scientific principles with a view to the best possible use of the human material and resources which our country has succeeded in harnessing.86.	By specific acts we reaffirm the principle which we affirmed when we became independent: that we are a State of law  a land of peace  tolerance and work.87.	If little by little  like many other countries before us  we are creating conditions that will make it possible for us to overcome our various difficulties  still enormous in a country which has to import almost all its capital and consumer goods and which has up to now been subject to chronic drought  it is because the people of our country participate in our development efforts  supported by international solidarity. While  by overcoming many obstacles  the people of Cape Verde are learning to have not only hope  but also confidence in themselves  faith in the future  and the certainty that their own ability is enough to build a prosperous nation  the profoundly deleterious hazards of the international economic situation and their disastrous effects on the socio-economic problems of disadvantaged countries like our own are of great concern to our Government.88.	The standards of international co-operation  which are unfair in many respects  create situations that are intolerable for developing countries  and distort dialogue which  though based primarily on the responsibility to avoid futile confrontations  may nevertheless  unless due care is taken  become an end in itself and fail to deal with the pressing needs of the developing countries.89.	This is to say that our concerns are based on the serious daily difficulties facing our people  who realize that the economic crisis prevailing in the world acquires a particularly serious and even tragic dimension for the third world.90.	Widespread inflation  aggravated by unbridled speculation in certain areas which dominate the world economic machinery  constitutes one of the major challenges of our time that our Organization should tackle. It is intolerable that the vast majority of the inhabitants of our worldâwho are at the same time the poorestâare forced to bear the brunt of the effects of a crisis for which they were not responsible.91.	The laudable efforts of many Governments of the developing countries to offer their peoples the minimal living standards to which they are entitled are doomed to failure.92.	In these circumstances international solidarity  given tangible form in certain development programmes  is only a placebo and nothing more than a meagre compensation for the trying circumstances in which our people must live.93.	The new development decade which our Organization is preparing runs the risk of not achieving its objectives if we do not go beyond the stage of mere declarations of intention and if we continue to be unable to implement our own decisions.94.	In the course of many international conferences during the past decade  these problems of under-development have been clearly identified. In a word  what we need to do is to establish more just and humane relations between countries  and to do away with the structures of domination  which are a holdover from the days when the majority of mankind had no right to speak and which hampered the development efforts of the peoples of the third world.95.	Above and beyond this distressing vision of today's world  dominated by inconstancy and lack of understanding  we must add that the world economic crisis has apparently brought with it a disturbing return to protectionism  which might well destroy all the efforts at industrialization in the third world.96.	Certain measures have been adopted in this context which suggest that an unrealistic view is being taken of the economic problems and which are unacceptable to the international community either out of simple justice or out of the long-term interests of the world's peoples  especially those of the developed countries.97.	Even more than access to markets  access to technology and the conquest of science seems to us to be a just demand by the developing countries. In this area the industrialized countries  and particularly the specialized agencies of the United Nations  should spare no effort to implement the decisions adopted at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. 98.	While the international community's condemnation of the unjust relations that exist among the Members of the United Nations should not conceal the responsibility that each of our States has to promote the well-being of our peoples and social justice  it is equally true that it is also our duty  as inhabitants of this world  to reject firmly the unlawful profits and situations of domination and exploitation which are constant sources of tension and which constitute a serious threat to the humanistic ideals of our Organization.99.	It is a matter of urgency to proceed to the effective establishment of a new world economic order  the general direction and practical machinery of which have already been defined. It is only the political will of the Member States on which its success depends that is missing.100.	The present session must deal with many questions of vital importance for the whole international community  and all our efforts will be required to consolidate peace  promote detente  realize the objectives of justice and create conditions for progress.101.	Our Organization is an ideal forum for resolving many of the evils of this world  which is going through a crucial period in the torment of which the changes essential to achieving equilibrium among nations and the survival of mankind as a whole are taking shape.102.	The people of Cape Verde have increasing confidence in our Organization and the various bodies which represent it in our country. Our Government is determined to make our modest contribution to the prestige and consolidation of our Organization and to make it an effective instrument for implementing the decisions of the General Assembly.103.	Finally  we wish to express the hope of the people of Cape Verde that the work of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly will be successful and that courageous and practical action will be taken to ensure that development shall not remain a remote myth  but shall become a living reality for our peoplesâ an irreversible process  based on political will and cemented by Solidarity and the enlightened self-interest of the entire international community."
"31",1639,"CRI",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of my country and my delegation  I am pleased to extend to Mr. Salim our most cordial and sincere congratulations for the well-deserved tribute paid to him by the international community represented here on his election to the presidency of the present session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under his able guidance the present session will bear abundant fruit for the good of all our peoples.284.	The 24th of this month will mark one more anniversary in the history of the United Nations  just as the end of this year will mark one more decade in the life of this century. Both dates significantly bring to a close another chapter in mankind's history and oblige us to turn our gaze back over this short period of the past to see whether we have made any real progress along the path of international peace and co-operation or whether we should renew our efforts  to the utmost of the spiritual capacity of our peoples and Governments  to reach the goals which we set for ourselves when we ratified the Charter and  in particular  to spare mankind from a new conflagration which this time would carry the threat of the elimination of human life from the face of the earth.285.	My Government has reviewed the most significant developments in international relations during the present decade and has made the most earnest efforts to draw optimistic conclusions. However  we have had to bow before the facts of the current world situation.286.	These facts are not as auspicious as they should be. To the contrary  they cast a strong shadow of doubt upon the ability of the leading members of this Organization to preserve the international community from the grave crisis that can be glimpsed on the horizon.287.	The report on the work of the Organization by the Secretary-General  to whom I pay a grateful tribute for his dedication in averting grave international conflicts and for his tireless fight to give substance to the values on which our Organization is based  discloses the grave difficulties standing in the way of international society in its advance towards a state of permanent justice that will make possible peace among men.288.	The political conflicts which have arisen during the decade which ends this year  together with the worsening of such problems as the imminent exhaustion of hydrocarbon energy sources and the concomitant disproportionate rise in the price of petroleum and its derivatives  have added new elements to the uncertainty  mistrust and pessimism in international life.289.	If we add to this the fact that the great Powers still do not seem to understand that man in his progress has reached a stage at which he should be seen as a truly free being rather than as a pawn in the chess-game of international politics  a being whose own dignity entitles him to chart his destiny  we have to conclude that it is the realities of life today which lead us to pessimism.290.	Like the Secretary-General of the United Nations  my Government continues to place its faith in the inexhaustible spiritual resources of the human race. Although in absolute terms mankind has not made satisfactory progress in areas vital for international harmonyâsuch as respect for human dignity  improved living conditions for developing peoples  and a fair exchange of raw materials and finished productsâ the relative achievements of this decade  particularly of recent years  in some measure do offset that grave imbalance. They at least hold out a hope that  by mobilizing the goodwill of peoples and Governments to overcome the obstacles to mankind's aspirations  we may yet restore man's confidence in his destiny.291.	In his report to the present session of the General Assembly  the Secretary-General asserts that although the cause of human rights has suffered substantial setbacks during the year  this has been accompanied by the growth of a powerful and stimulating awareness conducive to their observance and from which positive results may be expected 292.	Peoples and Governments such as mine  who have taken as their gospel the observance and furtherance of human rights  are well aware that the best antidote to subversion and social and institutional dislocations is respect for the attributes of the human person.293.	To the extent that men are assured of respect for their inherent rightsâamong which the right to liberty holds pride of placeâand to the extent that they are treated justly and afforded the means and resources to develop their spiritual potential  to that extent will harmony and peace among men prevail.294.	Unfortunately  the progress of the United Nations in developing effective institutional machinery for the furtherance and protection of human rights has not yet attained an acceptable level.295.	My country feels that the time has come for us to fulfil the legal and moral commitment which we undertook as Members of this Organization to respect and promote the fundamental rights of man.296.	It is my country's endeavour to have no debts to pay where the observance and protection of human rights are concerned  and we find no excuse for the systematic opposition raised by some in this Organization  for political motives  to any initiative which seeks effectively to guarantee respect for the dignity and essential rights of human beings.297.	The proposal  which Costa Rica advanced  for the creation of a high commissioner or a like authority to monitor respect for human rights  continues to be shunted from one committee to another  a waiting a final decision. We hope that decision will ultimately be favourable  in view of the goal which the proposal seeks to achieve.298.	The peoples who make up international society cannot continue to endure the privations which are being heaped upon them with no justification whatsoever.299.	This Organization would be remiss in the performance of one of its highest duties if it did not resolutely bend itself to the task of improving the inadmissible political and social conditions to which not a Few of the Governments of its Members subject their peoples. It is most gratifying for my delegation to note that very promising changes have begun to take shape in the Americas  signalling a new awareness along the lines I have just indicated.300.	At the height of the grave crisis endured by the noble people of Nicaragua  the crucial decision of the Meeting of Consultation of the Organization of American States [OAS] to request General Somoza to relinquish power in view of the danger to which his genocidal practices had exposed the peace and security of this continent  constitutes a true revolution in the process of improvement of our inter-American system.301.	The debate that the events in Nicaragua prompted in the First Committee of the General Assembly in December 1978 also underscored the fact that the cause of human rights is intimately linked to international security. The United Nations can therefore ill afford to disregard the human rights violations that continue to occur in countries held under the implacable rule of regimes of the extreme right and the extreme left.302.	On 3 September last  the Inter-American Court of Human Rights was officially established in San Jose  Costa Rica  pursuant to the Pact of San Jose  which was drafted and signed in my country's capital in 1969.303.	The members of the OAS that have acceded to this Convention have given eloquent proof of their readiness to comply faithfully with the international commitments all of us have made to protect and defend the fundamental rights of all human beings.304.	The Court is endowed with effective means to guarantee the life and security of any person victim of persecution who may appeal to it for justice  from which we may infer that this will mark the beginning of a new and stimulating period in the life of America's peoples.305.	In conformity with a long-standing national tradition  one that reaches back to the humanistic spirit of the founding fathers of our nation  my Government has taken up the cause of human rights as the heart of its foreign policy 306.	Costa Rica cannot make great material contributions to the improvement of international relations. Therefore we feel highly honoured in offering our solidarity and our spiritual support to all persons and peoples suffering persecution  imprisonment and exile because of their wish to be free.307.	In this spirit our delegation to the United Nations will continue to sponsor any initiative that may tend to liberate peoples still subject to colonialism and to seek the introduction of all possible and necessary improvements to secure for those living under oppressive regimes the fullest guarantees of respect for their fundamental rights.308.	In conformity with my Government's conviction that peace is not a natural and spontaneous boon but the complex product of factors that are very diverse in character  the President of the Republic of Costa Rica  Mr. Rodrigo Carazo Odio  on 27 September 1978 presented to this forum the initiative relating to the creation of a university for peace  a university at which there could be elaborated a programme of disciplines whose common aim would be the attainment of peace.309.	President Carazo put forward the idea that peace is neither a free gift nor the mere absence of war and that  just as human progress is achieved only through sacrifice; peace cannot be won without a firm resolve to strive for that goal.310.	I should like to recall here that the university of peace would be a great centre for higher education open to all peoples and to all men of goodwill.311.	The proposal also contemplates the establishment of seven areas of inquiry  research  dissemination and analysis pertaining to different aspects of the problems of peace.312.	The longing for peace resides in man's soul  but history leaves no doubt that mankind has not learned how to look for it  let alone find it.313.	If people go to military academies to study war  should they not go and learn peace in a university devoted to that purpose?314.	My delegation hopes that the support shown for the proposal of the President of Costa Rica by UNESCO  UNITAR  the United Nations University  a large number of countries and the Secretary-General himself will open the way for final approval of this initiative.315.	One of the most disturbing facts in the world today  one that darkens the future of international relations and places grave demands upon the capacity of this Organization  is the continuing deterioration of the world economy and the convergence of a number of very different factors that for poor countries such as mine have become insuperable.316. The economic and financial imbalance between the rich countries and the poor countries is of such a magnitude that history provides few examples of so deep and rapid an impoverishment for the majority of States and such disproportionate enrichment for the few.317.	If the United Nations was founded in order to bring about a better world in which the human being could live in material and spiritual conditions consonant with his dignity  those of us who have become the sacrificial victims in this state of affairs cannot remain impassive concerning the fate being meted out to us.318.	The international economy  and consequently the development of our countries  cannot be left to the cunning games of the economically powerful nations. The most elementary sense of human solidarity demands that we put a halt to this escalation  which can plunge international society into indescribable chaos.319.	Since the time when the school of Spanish theologians and jurists laid the basis of our economic society  the inequality in the economic and social conditions of the peoples is the most vicious of the germs that sooner or later cause wars.320.	Moreover  it was by no mere accident that the founders of the United Nations ascribed a role of particular importance to the maintenance of international peace and security to a just economic and trade equilibrium between all States. We can therefore see that it is unethical and completely irrational that our Organization should not mobilize as though preparing for a holy war in order to overcome the dangers that now face our international society.321.	The poor countries have been asking for justice for many years.322.	The terms of trade work more and more against the most elementary principles of equity  while our raw materials  our commodities  are being paid for at prices that are lower than the cost of producing them. The manufactured goods that we must acquire from the industrialized nations are being sold to us at impossible prices  prices that cannot be met because of the poor countries' lack of foreign exchange. Our capacity to pay  if not yet exhausted  is on the verge of exhaustion  and our economies are thus headed for irrevocable ruin.323.	In the present state of affairs our peoples have begun to perceive that there is a new kind of servitude weighing upon them. The inability to service the astronomical debts accumulated against our underdeveloped societies has given rise to a feeling of frustration which runs counter to the harmony which should characterize relations among all members of the international community.324.	Our Organization is bound by the lofty values on which it was founded to give urgent attention to this situation and to support and encourage the worthy efforts of the Secretariat to find a satisfactory solution to the critical condition of the world economy before it is too late.325.	It is fair to recognize that our developing countries bear a substantial share of the blame for the dislocation of the world economy. Under the sway of consumer society  imposed on us for the benefit of large-scale industries which are not our own  we have grown accustomed to a kind of life which is not in Keeping with our insufficient development or  consequently  with our capacity to pay. Whatever may be the solution to the existing disorder in the world economy  we may expect that it will call for major sacrifices on our part if we wish to guarantee future generations the means to survive.326.	I said earlier that the exhaustion of hydrocarbon deposits  upon which the growth of the world economy and hence the progress of the whole international community have in large measure relied  not only has had a grave impact on the world economy but raises very serious doubts about the means to be used in future to replace petroleum and its derivatives as a source of energy.327.	In the realm of facts the steep rise in fuel prices in recent years has disrupted my country's economy so drastically that we have had to make enormous sacrifices to alleviate its effects and ensure that it will not be the poor classes that  as is usually the case  should have to bear burdens for which they are not responsible.328.	Costa Rica is essentially an agricultural country and depends basically on a few agricultural products whose prices are continuously declining on the international market. Add to this the rising cost of petroleum and its derivatives and the prospects for our ability to maintain some degree of development become minimal  not to say entirely negative.329.	My country recognizes the"" legitimate right of the petroleum-producing countries to demand a fair price for their product  but we hope at the same time that preferential treatment will be granted for its purchase by developing countries  since our paying the same price as the industrialized countries is not only contrary to equity but hampers the economic possibilities of our populations.330.	There can be no question that a new international economic order will have to reconcile  on equitable terms  the prices of the commodities which are the life-blood of our peoples and the other elements of the world economy.331.	Costa Rica welcomes with particular interest the proposal made to this Assembly by the President of the United Mexican States  Mr. Jose Lopez Portillo  to establish a world energy plan  My Government enthusiastically supports this excellent initiative by Mexico  as we are convinced that it would provide an effective contribution to the solution of the serious problem of energy which faces all mankind.332.	The situation in the Middle East continues to occupy our attention  as it does that of all members of the international community  in view of the positive or negative influence it has on the maintenance of international peace and security.333.	In relation to this regrettable conflict between two peoples to whom we feel linked by spiritual and even historical affinities  through the cultural heritage left to us by Spain  my country aspires to take an impartial and equitable position.334.	We believe that it is Israel's right that its existence as a State be respected and guaranteed; and we believe that the Palestinian people also have the right to be allowed to organize themselves with all the attributes proper to sovereign parties in an international order.335.	My delegation deeply regrets that no common ground has thus far been found between the aspirations of these two communities and that the necessary conditions have not yet appeared for these two noble people to resolve their differences in an atmosphere of harmony  peace and tolerance.336.	For the good of all  without exception  the international community urgently needs to see an end to the state of permanent belligerence in the Middle East. The area is a source of trouble which threatens at any time to break out into a conflagration of unforeseeable consequences and which daily claims the lives of innocent victims to no purpose.337.	My delegation is grateful to all who have participated directly or indirectly in the effort to find the longed-for solution to the Middle East question and hopes that the progress achieved in improved relations between two of the States parties to this dispute will prompt renewed efforts to restore peace to the whole of the Middle East  so that the peoples that are today suffering the 'scourge of hostilities can look towards a brighter future.338.	My country  which lacks the most elementary experience in the domain of armaments  proclaims itself disqualified  to its credit  from pronouncing upon the complex plans and programmes that have been discussed in this international forum with a view to halting the escalation of the arms race. It therefore holds the moral credentials to express its most vehement repudiation of the senseless armament policy of the great majority of members of the international community. The arms race is an outrage against mankind and an offence against the rational and spiritual nature of man.339.	That those who say they love peace should proceed to accumulate means of mass destruction on a scale exceeding many times that required to annihilate the entire human race is an act devoid of reason  one which casts doubt upon the true intentions of its authors.340.	When we think of the great benefits which mankind stands to gain by reallocating to altruistic ends the astronomical sums earmarked today for the manufacture of weaponry  we cannot help being overcome by a deep feeling of frustration and disappointment.341.	Those of us who trust in international law and in respect for treaties as a guarantee of the sovereign rights of States find it paradoxical that the developing countries themselves should collaborate in this race without reason.342.	Our experience of having abolished the institution of the armyâwhich had existed only exceptionally during the 150 years of our nation's independent lifeâ has taught us that this is the wisest of all political measures to promote peace and harmony. 343.	In the present state of international order it is superfluous for poor States to acquire arms beyond what is indispensable for the normal maintenance of their internal security. My country will never tire of appealing to the goodwill of all Governments to devote these resources to the betterment of the material and spiritual conditions of the world's peoples.344.	The new currents of international law have made it possible for coastal States on all the world's oceans to harbour the hope of claiming preferential rights in respect of the conservation and exploitation of the living resources of the sea  and in respect of the riches of its subsoil.345.	My delegation commends the sustained effort made by this Organization  through the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  to try to regulate this important activity which  for obvious reasons  is becoming daily more vital for the survival of many of our nations.346.	Both through our direct knowledge of the matter and through our reading of the illuminating report of the Secretary-General  we have become aware that the United Nations is very close to finding a definitive and general solution to all the problems pertaining to the use of the sea in all its aspects  as well as the conservation and exploitation of its animal  vegetable and mineral riches.347.	My Government looks forward to celebrating that achievement  not only because of its importance for Costa Rica's interests  for also because it will be an equitable and civilized way to put an end to the abuses of which the developing countries are today the victims.348.	In his report  the Secretary-General regrets that the United Nations is not receiving all the moral support it deserves from world public opinion. This fact  indicative of the scepticism that has gained a hold on the minds of ordinary men faced with very serious problems to which they see no solution  deserves the careful attention of all Members of this Organization.349.	The United Nations will survive insofar as its nations mirror the trust of the world's peoples and their hope for a more just society. To keep that faith without faltering is a task incumbent upon us all  especially upon those of us who believe that this is the last chance the Almighty has granted us to find peace and ensure the survival of the human race.350.	My delegation extends its warmest congratulations to the newest Member of the United Nations family  our Latin-American sister Saint Lucia  and expresses its thanks to that legion of quiet servants of this Organization in the technical  administrative and political domains who  by dedication and sacrifice  are contributing to the worthy task of building a better world for us all."
"32",1685,"CSK",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  allow me1 most sincerely to thank you for the words of sympathy expressed to my country in connexion with the passing away of the outstanding Czechoslovak statesman  our former President  hero of Czechoslovakia and of the Soviet Union  Army General Ludvik Svoboda. The peoples of my country have lost in his person a great  courageous man whose name is linked with my country's national liberation struggle against fascism and for socialism and world peace. His memory shall for ever remain inscribed in the hearts of our people.194.	We should like to take this opportunity to express our sympathy and to share the sorrow of the Angolan people over the loss of its faithful son and passionate fighter for the freedom of the African peoples  President Agostinho Neto.195.	Mr. President  I congratulate you  an outstanding political figure and eminent diplomat of the United Republic of Tanzania  on your election to the lofty and responsible post of President of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are convinced that you will successfully fulfil your mission and  together with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Mr. Kurt Waldheim  contribute to the positive results of our joint work.196. We welcome the admission of Saint Lucia to membership in the United Nations  an event that surely is not only an expression of the advancing elimination of the vestiges of colonialism  but also strengthens the universality of our Organization.197.	If we attempt to describe the international situation in an informed and diligent mannerâas  in fact  we do every year from this rostrumâwe cannot this time lose sight of the fact that we are approaching the end of a decade which  unlike previous ones  has assumed an almost crucial significance for us  the present generation. After all  the annals of the seventh decade of this century and  in a concentrated form  the events of the last year  reflect virtually everything that could be described by the all-embracing term of ""concretization of detente"".198.	What  then  has the past year brought? What has it shown us?199.	In the first place  it has produced proof that the spirit of new faith has been awakened in the ability of mankind to have sufficient perseverance in the struggle for the cause of peace; that the paralysed political dialogue has once more been reanimated; that we have been able to witness a number of ambitious projects representing a significant political contribution to a peaceful future for the world; that  after a certain lapse of time  an encouraging level of global stability has been re-established; that in the space of a single year further anti-popular regimes have collapsed in Asia and in Latin America and that important changes that advance the preservation of peace have been added to the political map of the world. That  then  is first and foremost.200.	At the same time  and this is no less gratifying  we have to a significant degree managed to unblock certain mechanisms impeding international development  to halt the development of certain negative trends and to repel concentrated attacks by the most reactionary forces against progress  socialism  democracy and the national liberation movement.201.	Moreover  although violators of the peace of all types continued their efforts to preserve the vestiges of the cold-war era  they failed to capitalize further on this burdensome mortgage of the past. Although they tried to retain the vestiges of fossilized thinking  they did not succeed in infecting international life with them. Al-though they tried to steer a policy running counter to the general course of events  they did not manage to reduce detente to a servile role. Although  as in the early states of detente  they once again manoeuvred in distrust  suspicion  and lack of understanding  employing intrigues and provocations  they did not reverse the trend. Indeed  despite all the pitfalls  obstacles and discouraging difficulties placed in the way of detente by its opponents  that policy has been developing generally in the correct direction  and they have not managed to limit the scope of that policy  to discard it or to plunge the world into helpless confusion.202.	Thus we can conclude that the past year has been a demanding endurance test from which detente has emerged as mature. Detente gradually has become the fundamental trend during this last decade and it has repeatedly proved itself to be a productive  well- defined choice for mankind's future. It is therefore in mankind's vital interest to show sufficient determination  vision and perseverance to make detente the decisive trend in strengthening the structure of world peace and mutually beneficial co-operation among States with different social systems.203.	If  in saying this today  in 1979  we look back and compare the present time with the cold-war years and the formative years of detente  we see that our statement is justified.204.	We are all the more gratified since in the course of last year as in the past we have had no aspiration other than to continue consistently along the road of peaceful  dynamic policies on which we have started  to open up new horizons of broad international cooperation  to direct people towards what brings them close together  and away from what divides them  and to overcome patiently the conflicts among peoples. Thus  we took the correct course  and historical developments proved us right.205.	We should like it to be possible to say one day that the entire past period was decisive for the fate of detente in what we may call its developing stage and that detente was not exposed to destructive hegemonism  that obvious negation of the peaceful  constructive relations among States which are reaffirmed by the United Nations Charter. To ensure that this weed in international relations was deprived everywhere and once and for all of the soil which nourishes it  the greatest contribution would be made by an effective international agreement  as was proposed yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR  Mr. Andrei Andreevich Gromyko.206.	We therefore fully support the inclusion on the agenda of this Assembly session of an item entitled ""Inadmissibility of hegemonism in international relations"". As a non-permanent member of the Security Council  we support the proposal that this question should also be considered by that highest body of the United Nations.207.	We hope that it may be possible to say one day that the first stages of international detente were followed immediately by a significant deepening of that process characterized by a shift from words to deeds  from tactical temporizing to constructive negotiations and  above all  by a move to military detente. The arms race  after all  has not yet been halted.208.	In that respect  we regard as very promising the conclusion of the second SALT Treaty which is an example of perseverance  determination  mature political will and forward-looking responsibility for mankind as a whole. This most important world event reaffirmed most amply the effectiveness of the untiring and determinedly peace-loving Leninist policy of the Soviet Union  which strives to promote the process of detente  disarmament and peace throughout the world. That is why we also want to stress from this rostrum how deeply we appreciate the contribution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  of the Soviet State  and of Mr. Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev personally to the preparation and successful conclusion of that Treaty. We also appreciate the realism of the American side. We hope that the same sound judgement will prevail also among those who will vote on the ratification of the Treaty.209.	That would again significantly strengthen the great hope of all mankind that the threat of a world nuclear conflict may be averted forever. More favourable conditions would be created for concrete negotiations on the entire range of disarmament proposals relating both to nuclear and conventional weapons  as well as on confidence-building measures among States  including a world-wide treaty on the non-use of force in international relations.210.	We are well aware of the beneficial influence of everything that has been achieved along this road up to now. But so far  it represents but a small fraction of the possibilities offered by the development of detente.211.	To achieve those possibilities  however  we must discard once and for all the illusion that lasting peace and security can coexist with huge stockpiles of the means of mass destruction; that it is possible without disarmament to solve successfully the vitally important problems of concern to the whole of humanity  such as the establishment of a new economic order  the provision of the food so needed by mankind  the development of new sources of energy  the eradication of dangerous diseases  the protection of the environment  the satisfaction of the spiritual and cultural needs of humanity  and the achievement of advances in the exploration of outer space.212.	As a country that knows the price of peace  we are aware that it is not war alone  but the very fear that there might be a war  which diverts mankind from its endeavours to tackle the most pressing tasks of our time.213.	The treaty on the prohibition of radiological weapons  which has been proposed jointly by the Soviet Union and the United States and which we warmly support  provides fresh proof that the problem of disarmament can indeed be tackled and resolved.214.	That is why Czechoslovakia will continue to de-vote priority attention to halting the arms race and to disarmament. We are prepared to conduct negotiations on the broad spectrum of concrete proposals. In the Declaration of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty adopted at the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee  held at Moscow on 23 November 1978  we submitted  jointly with our allies  well-known initiatives  the implementation of which would mark a decisive turning-point in the negotiations on halting the arms race and on disarmament.215.	We shall spare no effort to bring about the gradual achievement of that goal. We intend to negotiate patiently and with perseverance with all partners on our proposals as well as on theirs  at any place and at any level  including the highest. We are ready to make a creative contribution to the honest efforts of States finally to achieve tangible progress in this key area of international life.216.	This determination of ours was expressed by the President of Czechoslovakia  Gustav Husak  when he stated in Prague on 1 May of this year;""States should assume the obligation  preferably in the United Nations  to approach disarmament negotiations constructively and to contribute to the creation of an international climate conducive to the speediest possible achievement of the needed progress.""217.	That is why my country is now submitting a draft declaration on international co-operation for disarmament. We have based the document on a deep and objective study of many years of experience in holding disarmament negotiations and on the need for an all-round intensification of the comprehensive implementation of the objectives  decisions and recommendations that we all adopted unanimously at the tenth special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament 218.	In the more than a year that has elapsed since then  a great deal has been done. This year we shall consider the first report of the Committee on Disarmament working with its new expanded membership  However  the time has come for us to embark on concrete measures and agreements  overcoming all the difficulties that may still arise along this road.219.	That is why we strive to give a new impulse to the creation of a yet more favourable climate for an early implementation of the results of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  and that is also why we stress in the draft declaration the very clear and compelling fact that today the Governments of all States of the world have a truly historic responsibility for eradicating war from the life of man  a responsibility that must be met by agreeing on effective and decisive measures for the achievement of general and complete disarmamentâthat ancient ideal of mankind which was also in the mind of the great Czech thinker of the seventeenth century  John Amos Comenius  when he wrote in his world-famous monumental work On the Reform of the Human Condition:""Weapons must therefore be removed so that there may be no occasion to revert to hostilities and wars  for there is no salvation in war and nothing results from it but the menace of fire  steel and the uprooting of States.""220.	At that time  however  they could only dream of disarmament. Today we are already negotiating  and tomorrow we must act. That was why  in submitting the draft declarationâwhich one could call a code of political principles to govern States in the interests of purposeful  effective  constructive and continuous co-operation in the field of disarmament  we are trying to help to draw up one of the possible operative instruments to facilitate the uninterrupted course as well as the results of both the current and future disarmament negotiations.221.	The purpose of this is by no means a verbal proclamation of good intentions or a mere mechanical introduction of new principles. The purpose that we seek is to harmonize and unify all existing rules in one systematic and well-organized document that would be universally applicable in every disarmament body  at every political level. This would also strengthen the methodological aspect of the analysis and synthesis of what promotes the success of disarmament negotiations and  on the other hand  what hampers or even damages them.222.	We want such key premises of the entire dis-armament process as the consolidation  development  expansion and intensification of international cooperation for disarmament to become basic political and moral law for the behaviour of States  regardless of their geographical position or their affiliation with this or that socio-political system.223.	We are deeply convinced that our proposal is fully compatible with efforts by nations for the establishment of lasting peace and the safeguarding of strong international security  and that it reflects the unanimous will of the world community to find reliable solutions to the pressing problems of disarmament. We trust that at this session the proposal will meet with the constructive support of the States Members of the United Nations.224.	Peace and security throughout the world have always been inseparably linked with the fate of Europe. That is where political detente was initiated and where it made the greatest advance. That is why military detente also should make the greatest possible advance there  so that the dark dens of the alchemists of war may be transformed into useful laboratories of peace and co-operation  where the dials will display but one constantâmutual advantage and an unshakable system of equal security for all.225.	Keeping in mind this very goal  we propose  together with the other States parties to the Warsaw Treaty  the immediate conclusion of an agreement among the participants in the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe a treaty to the effect that they will not be the first to use either nuclear or conventional weapons against each other. We believe that even today it is possible to start preparing a conference on military detente to be held on a political level and with the participation of all European States  the United States and Canada. This important initiative proposed by the Committee of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty in Budapest last May opens up broad possibilities for a matter-of-fact consideration of all proposals designed to reduce the danger of military confrontation.226.	As a direct participant in the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe  we are understandably deeply interested about a tangible progress in these talks. That  however  can be achieved only if our partners re-examine their concept of ""first arming themselves adequately and then proceeding with disarmament"". As it is  for instance  the latest plans for a speedy introduction of the so- called Euro-strategic weapons in Western Europe cannot be seen but as a further tightening of the Gordian knot.227.	Despite these ""atmospheric disturbances"" the European political climate has already become healthier. We are endeavouring to ensure that the second review session of the Conference  to be held in Madrid next year  brings new positive developments particularly in military detente so that we may actively promote the implementation of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference. We hope that the gates of mutually advantageous and equal co-operation among all European countries might open even wider in a manner that was documented by the positive results of the ECE session this year and by the convening of the European congress on the environment under the auspices of the ECE in Geneva in November.228.	Czechoslovakia is trying to make an all-round contribution to this process by developing its bilateral relations. In our view more frequent meetings among representatives of the countries which signed the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference will promote its creative regeneration and a fresh momentum aimed at supporting peace.229.	This awareness  enhanced by our specific geographical position as well as the objective possibilities which have emerged  provided an opportunity for us to normalize the micro-climate of relations in Central Europe  specifically the relations with our Western partners.230.	Our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany are based on the political will of both sides embodied in a joint declaration signed by President Gustav Husak and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt during last year's official visit of our Head of State to Bonn  and are in the process of practical and concrete development. We have deep interest in their future positive and smooth continuation.231.	With neighbouring Austria we have constructively tackled everything that has burdened our relations  being aware of a prospect of many years of stability. The process of restoration of relations on the basis of good neighbourliness culminated successfully in the visit by President Rudolf Kirchschlager to our country last March. We are now translating creatively the results of that visit into mutually advantageous cooperation.232.	Thus for the first time since the establishment of our independent State  we have  after more than six decades  fully normalized relations with all our neighbours including those with a different social system from ours  a development which did not come about even when these differences did not exist  This is our active contribution to the peaceful reconstruction of the situation in Central Europe.233.	In this connexion we are ever more actively enriching the process of detente by expanding mutually advantageous co-operation with many other European countries. As a State member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  which this year commemorates 30 peaceful  fruitful and creative years since its establishment  we actively promote our all-round cooperation with Asian  African and Latin American countries. Our warm sympathies and constructive support go to their endeavours to strengthen their political independence and to achieve their economic independence and for the establishment of just international economic relations that would safeguard their economic and social development. In other words  we are establishing relations that would be a model of equal  democratic and mutually advantageous cooperation among all States with different socioeconomic systems.234.	We welcomed the results of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries held recently in Havana. They reflect new evidence that the source of strength and effectiveness of that movement resides in its unity in the defence of the just cause of the peoples struggling for their liberation from political  economic and social oppression  in their struggle for the strengthening of peace and international security  for disarmament and detente and against imperialism  racism and neo-colonialism.235.	World peace and security are not undermined by the arms race alone. An acute inflammation of detente is caused also by the hotbeds of tension  by painful old and new conflicts in various parts of the world. Czechoslovak public opinion and our Government  along with the entire peace-loving humanity  have condemned resolutely the aggression against socialist Viet Nam  the instigators of which  in complete contravention of the United Nations Charter and international law  tried and are still trying to raise ""military lessons"" to a norm of conduct in inter-State relations.236.	From this high rostrum we once again express our firm support for the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and the People's Republic of Kampuchea  who  after so many years of destructive  aggressive wars  are passionately longing for peace and are striving to build a just and peace-loving society in a calm atmosphere.237.	We regard as most deplorable the recognition of the so-called ""credentials"" of the representatives of the barbaric Pol Pot regime  overthrown by the Kampuchean people  a regime unique in history for its policy of massacring its own people. This goes against the spirit and purposes of the United Nations  undermines its authority and prestige and is fundamentally at variance with political reality  Our position of principle is unequivocal. The seat of Kampuchea in this Organization must be taken by the representatives appointed by the People's Revolutionary Council of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  which is the legitimate government of that country and which alone is able to discharge the obligations of a State Member of the United Nations 238.	Nor are the interests of the Kampuchean people  of the peace and security of the peoples of South-East Asia and of the mission of the United Nations served by the attempts to internationalize the non-existent so- called Kampuchean question and to interfere thus  in contravention of the United Nations Charter  in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.239 We also strongly object to efforts to misuse the artificially produced problem  fanned by propaganda  of the so-called Vietnamese refugees for political aims directed against Viet Nam.240. We welcome the opening of negotiations between the USSR and China on the normalization of their relations. That can be to the benefit not only of those two countries  but also peace in South-East Asia and throughout the world.241. We continue to be concerned about the state of affairs in the Middle East. Every day it becomes clearer that the separate agreement between Egypt and Israel and the attempts to circumvent a settlement in keeping with the legitimate interests of all nations in that crisis area are fraught with most serious consequences.242.	Therefore  we emphasize once again that in the vortex of contradicting events in the Middle East  only one comprehensive settlement has hope of successâ that is the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all territories occupied in 1%7 and the safeguarding of the rights of the Palestinians  including their right to the establishment of their own State  as well as the right of all countries in that region  not excluding Israel  to an independent and secure existence.243.	We are convinced also that the burning problem of Cyprus cannot be resolved in any other way than on the basis of respect for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus.244.	Likewise  we support the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful  democratic reunification of Korea  and we call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the southern part of the country.245.	We emphatically reject the fresh attempts by the colonial and racist regimes in southern Africa to perpetuate themselves and to postpone their historically inevitable elimination. We actively  effectively and consistently support the struggle of the peoples of southern Africa for freedom and independence. We express our solidarity with SWAPO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people. We reaffirm our full and all-round support for the sole genuine representative of the people of Zimbabwe â the Patriotic Front. We advocate a comprehensive intensification of the struggle against apartheid  including uncompromising economic sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  which finally should compel the regime of the Republic of South Africa to respect the United Nations. We shall continue to make efforts to bring our Organization to use its entire authority to prevent the barbaric attacks by the racists against neighbouring States which are still continuing with impunity.246.	I believe there is no need to repeat from this rostrum the well-known truth that if we wish something to be destroyed it is sufficient to fold one's arms and wait  and the rest comes by itself. That is why it is our intention to do our utmost to contribute to an effective joint search for new ways in the struggle against the erosion and devaluation of the values of peace and international security which have already been achievedâespecially so because the time is ripe for finding new initiatives to exclude the possibility of a new apocalypse  to make progress along the path of new  great ideals of peace  detente and co-operation  despite all obstacles  and to shape current history for a peaceful future  so that the United Nations also  this irreplaceable universal forum  might fulfil the hopes placed in it by the whole of peace-loving humanity and thus strengthen the foundations on which the structure of international peace and security grows."
"33",1708,"CUB",34,1979,"ï»¿I have not come to speak about Cuba  I have not come to denounce in this Assembly the attacks to which our small but worthy country has been subjected for 20 years. Nor have I come to wound with unnecessary adjectives the powerful neighbour in his own house.3.	We have been charged by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries to present to the United Nations the results of its deliberations' and the positions to be derived therefrom.4.	We are 95 countries from all the continents  representing the overwhelming majority of mankind. We are linked by our determination to defend the co-operation among our countries  to ensure free national and social development  sovereignty  security  equality and self- determination. We are associated in our determination to change the present system of international relations  based as it is on injustice  inequality and oppression. In international politics  we act as an independent world factor. Meeting in Havana  the non-aligned movement has just reaffirmed its principles and confirmed its objectives.5.	The non-aligned countries stress the fact that it is imperative to do away with the enormous inequality that separates the developed from the developing countries. We are struggling to eradicate the poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy from which hundreds of millions of human beings still suffer. We aspire to a new world order  one based on justice  equity and peace  one that will replace the unjust and unequal system that prevails today in which  as proclaimed in Havana:""... wealth is still concentrated in the hands of a few powers whose wasteful economies are maintained by the exploitation of the labour as well as the transfer and plunder of the natural and other resources of the peoples of Africa  Asia  Latin America and other regions of the world."" 6.	Among the problems to be debated at the present session of the General Assembly  peace is the first concern. The search for peace also constitutes an aspiration of the movement of non-aligned countries and has been the subject of the attention of the Sixth Conference. But for our countries  peace is indivisible. We want a peace that will equally benefit the large and the small  the strong and the weak  a peace that will embrace all regions of the world and reach all its citizens.7.	Since its very inception  the movement of non- aligned countries has considered that the principles of peaceful coexistence should be the corner-stone of international relations  should constitute the basis for the strengthening of international peace and security  for the relaxation of tensions and for the expansion of that process to all regions of the world and to all aspects of international relations  and should be universally applied in relations among States. But at the same time  the Sixth Conference considered that these principles of peaceful coexistence also include the rights of peoples under alien and colonial domination to self- determination  independence  sovereignty; respect for the territorial integrity of States; and the right of every country to put an end to foreign occupation and to the acquisition of territory by force  and to select its own social  political and economic system. Only thus can peaceful coexistence be the foundation for all international relations.8.	This cannot be denied. When we analyse the structure of the world of today  we see that these rights of our peoples are as yet not guaranteed. The non- aligned countries know full well who are our historical enemies. We know whence come the threats and how to combat them. That was why we resolved in Havana to reaffirm that:. .the quintessence of the policy of non- alignment  in accordance with its original principles and essential character  involved the struggle against imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism  apartheid and racism  including Zionism  and all forms of foreign aggression  occupation  domination  interference or hegemony  as well as against great- Power and bloc policies."" Thus  it will be understood that the Final Declaration of Havana linked the struggle for peace with ""political  moral and material support for the national liberation movements and joint efforts to eliminate colonial domination and racial discrimination"" 9.	The non-aligned countries have always attached great importance to the possibility of and the need for detente among the great Powers  and thus the Sixth Conference pointed with great concern to the fact that in the period that elapsed after the Fifth Conference held in Colombo in 1976  a certain stagnation took place in the process of detente  which has continued to be limited both in scope and geographically.10.	On the basis of that concern  the non-aligned countriesâwhich have made of disarmament and de-nuclearization one of the permanent and most prominent objectives of their struggle and which took the initiative to convene the tenth special session of the General Assembly on disarmamentâexamined the results of the negotiations on strategic arms and the agreements reached as a result of the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT]. They consider that those agreements constitute an important step in the negotiations between the two main nuclear Powers and could open up prospects for more comprehensive negotiations leading to general disarmament and the relaxation of international tensions. But those treaties  as far as the non-aligned countries are concerned  are only part of the progress towards peace. Although negotiations between the great Powers constitute a decisive element in the process  the non- aligned countries once again reiterated that the endeavour to consolidate detente and to extend it to all parts of the world  and to avert the nuclear threat  the arms build-up andâin one wordâwar  was a task in which all the peoples of the world should participate and exercise their responsibilities.11.	Basing ourselves on the concept of the universality of peace and on the need to associate the search for peace  extended to all countries  with the struggle for national independence  with full sovereignty and with equality among States  we  the Heads of State or Government who met at the Sixth Conference of non- aligned countries in Havana  turned our attention to the most pressing problems in Africa  Asia  Latin America and other regions of the world. It is important to stress that we started from an independent position that was not linked or tied to policies that might stem from the contradictions between the great Powers. If in spite of that approach  which was uncommitted and objective  our review of international events became an anathema hurled against the supporters of imperialism and colonialism  it merely reflects the essential reality of the world of today.12.	Thus  on starting the analysis of the situation in Africa and after having recognized the progress made in the African peoples' struggle for their emancipation  the Heads of State or Government stressed  as a fundamental problem of the region  the urgency of eliminating from the continentâand especially from southern Africaâall traces of colonialism  racism  racial discrimination and apartheid.13.	It was indispensable that we should stress the fact that the colonialist and imperialist Powers were continuing their aggressive policies with the aim of perpetuating  regaining or extending their domination and exploitation of the African nations.14.	And that is precisely the dramatic situation in Africa. The non-aligned countries could not fail to condemn the attacks on Mozambique  on Zambia  on Angola  on Botswana; the threats against Lesotho; the destabilization efforts that are constantly being made in that area; and the role of the racist regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa. The pressing need for Zimbabwe and Namibia to be completely liberated as soon as possible is not just one of the causes of the non-aligned countries or of the most progressive forces of our era; it is laid down in resolutions and agreements adopted by the international community through the United Nations. It implies duties that cannot be shirked and the violation of which must call for international denunciation.15.	Therefore  when the Heads of State or Government approved the Final Declaration  which condemned by name a group of Western countriesâ headed by the United Statesâfor their direct or indirect collaboration in the maintenance of South Africa's criminal policy and racist oppression and  on the other hand  recognized the role played by the non-aligned countries  the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  the socialist countries and the Scandinavian countries and other democratic and progressive forces in supporting the struggle of the peoples of Africa  it did not involve even the slightest manifestation of ideological leanings; it was simply a true expression of the objective reality. To condemn South Africa without mentioning those who make its criminal policy possible would have been incomprehensible.16.	More forcibly and urgently than ever  the Sixth Conference expressed the need not only to end the situation in which the right of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia to independence is denied  but also to support the urgent requirement for the black men and women of South Africa to attain a status in which they are to be considered as equal  respected human beings and to guarantee conditions of respect and peace for all the countries of the region.17.	Continued support for the national liberation movements  the Patriotic Front and the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] was a decision so unanimous that we could almost have foreseen it. And let us state this very clearly now: this is not a case of expressing a unilateral preference for solutions through armed struggle. It is true that the Conference praised the people of Namibia and SWAPO  their sole and authentic representative  for having stepped up the armed struggle and advancing it  and it requested all- out  effective support for that form of combat. But that was due to the fact that the South African racists have slammed the door to any real negotiations  and the efforts to achieve negotiated solutions go no further than mere strategems and manoeuvres.18.	The attitude towards the decisions taken at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries at Lusaka last August to have the United Kingdom Government  as the administering Power for Southern Rhodesia  call a conference to discuss the problems of Zimbabwe  confirmed the fact that the non-aligned countries are not opposed to solutions that may be achieved without armed struggle  so long as they lead to the establishment of a real government representing the majority and the achievement of an independence that is satisfactory to the fighting peoplesâand that this be done in accordance with the resolutions of such bodies as the OAU  the United Nations and our own movement of non-aligned countries.19.	The Sixth Conference once again had to express its regret that General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  concerning the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  has not been applied in Western Sahara. We should recall that the decisions of the non- aligned countries and the resolutions of the United Nationsâmore specifically General Assembly resolution 33/31âhave all reaffirmed the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and independence. Cuba feels a special responsibility with regard to this problem since it was a member of the United Nations Visiting Mission to Western Sahara  sent in 1975 to investigate the situation in the Territory  which enabled our representatives to verify the total desire of the Saharan people for self-determination and independence. We repeat here that the position of the non-aligned movement is not one of antagonism towards any country. Nothing but the application of our principles and the agreements of the United Nations should be seen in our welcoming the conclusion of the agreement between the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Frente POLISARIO and the decision of the Republic of Mauritania to withdraw its forces from the territory of Western Sahara  as well as its deploring the extension of Morocco's armed incursion into the southern part of Western Sahara previously administered by Mauritania. Therefore  the Conference expressed its hope that the special committee established at the sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU would provide a guarantee that the people of the Sahara would be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination and independence as soon as possible.20.	That same principle and that same position determined the resolutions on Mayotte and the Malagasy islands and the need for them to be reintegrated in the Comoros and Madagascar  respectively.21.	There can be no doubt that the problem of the Middle East has become one of the situations that give rise to the greatest concern and worry in the world today. The Sixth Conference examined it in its twofold dimension. On the one hand  the Conference reaffirmed that Israel's determination to continue its policy of aggression  expansionism and colonial settlement in the occupied territories  with the support of the United States  constitutes a serious threat to world peace and security. The Conference also examined the problem from the point of view of the rights of the Arab peoples and the Palestinian question.22.	For the non-aligned countries  the Palestinian question is the very crux of the problem of the Middle East. Both questions form an integral whole and neither can be settled separately.23.	The basis for a just peace in the region starts with the total and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all the occupied Arab territories and provides for the return to the Palestinian people of all their occupied territories and the restoration of their inalienable national rights  including their right to return to their homeland  to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State in Palestine  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX). This implies that all measures taken by Israel in the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories  such as the establishment of colonies or settlements in Palestinian and other Arab territoriesâwhose immediate dismantlement is a prerequisite for the solution of the problemâare all illegal  null and void.24.	As I stated in my inaugural address to the Sixth Conference. We are not fanatics. The revolutionary movement has always learned to hate racial discrimination and pogroms of any kind. From the bottom of our heart  we repudiated the merciless persecution and genocide that the Nazis once visited on the Jews  but there's nothing in recent history that parallels it more closely than the dispossession  persecution and genocide that imperialism and Zionism are currently practising against the Palestinian people. Pushed off their land  expelled from their own country  scattered throughout the world  persecuted and murdered  the heroic Palestinians are a vivid example of sacrifice and patriotism  living symbols of the most terrible crime of our era."" 25.	Can anyone be surprised that the Conference  for reasons that stemmed not from any political prejudice  but rather from an objective analysis of the facts  felt called upon to note that the United States policy  in aligning itself with Israel and in supporting it and working to obtain partial solutions that are favourable to Zionist aims and to guarantee the fruits of Israeli aggression at the expense of the Palestinian Arab people and the entire Arab nation  played a major role in preventing the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region?26.	The facts  and only the facts  led the Conference to condemn the policy and manoeuvres of the United States in that region.27.	When the Heads of State or Government arrived at the consensus which condemned the Camp David agreements and the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty of March 1979  their formulations had been preceded by long hours of detailed study and fruitful exchanges which allowed the Conference to consider those treaties not only as a complete abandonment of the cause of the Arab countries  but also as an act of complicity with the continuing occupation of Arab territories. The terms are hard  but they are true and just. It is not the Egyptian people who have been subjected to the judgement of the organs of the movement of non-aligned nations. The Egyptian people command the respect of each and every one of our countries  and enjoy the solidarity of all our peoples. The same voices that were raised to denounce the Camp David agreements and the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty eulogized and praised Gamal Abdel Nasser  a founder of the movement and one of those who upheld the fighting traditions of the Arab nation. No one ignores and no one will ever be unaware of Egypt's historic role in Arab culture and development or its merit as a founding nation and a driving force in the movement of non-aligned countries.28.	The Conference also gave its attention to the problems of South-East Asia. The growing conflicts and tensions that have been created in the region are a threat to peace that must be avoided.29.	Similar concern was expressed by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government regarding the situation in the Indian Ocean. The Declaration adopted eight years ago by the General Assembly proclaiming the Indian Ocean a zone of peace has not been fulfilled. The military presence in the region has not been reduced; it is growing. Military bases have reached as far as South Africa and are also serving as a means for surveillance of the African liberation movements. The talks between the United States and the Soviet Union are still suspended despite the recent agreements between the two countries to discuss their resumption. All this led to the Sixth Conference's invitation to all States concerned to work effectively to fulfil the objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.30.	The Sixth Conference also analysed other issues of regional and world interest such as those touching on European security and co-operation  the problem of the Mediterranean and the tensions that still exist there and that now have been increased as a result of Israel's aggressive policy and the support given it by certain imperialist Powers. The Conference also studied the situation in Cyprus  an island still partially occupied by foreign troops  and Korea  which is still divided despite the Korean people's desire for the peaceful reunification of their homeland. This led the non-aligned countries to reaffirm and broaden resolutions of solidarity aimed at fulfilling the aspirations of both peoples.31.	It would be impossible to refer to all the political decisions of the Sixth Conference. If we were to do so  we would be unable to touch upon what we consider to be one of the most fundamental aspects of that Conference  namely  its economic projection  the clamour of the developing countries  who have had enough of backwardness and of the suffering it engenders. Cuba  as the host country  will present to all members of the international community copies of the Conference's Final Declaration and additional resolutions. But  before informing this Assembly of how the non-aligned countries view the world economic situation  which demands they make and which hopes they nurture  perhaps I will be allowed to take a few minutes more to inform you of what the Final Declaration's approach was concerning Latin American issues of the moment.32.	The fact that the Sixth Conference was held in a Latin American country allowed the Heads of State or Government meeting there to recall that the peoples of that region started their efforts to obtain independence at the very beginning of the nineteenth century. They also did not forget  as it is said in the Declaration  that ""Latin America is one of the regions of the world that historically has greatly suffered from the aggression of United States and European imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism"" 33.	The participants in the Conference were forced to point out that in that area of struggle  remnants of colonialism  neo-colonialism and national oppression still remain; thus the Conference spoke out in favour of the eradication of colonialism in all its forms and manifestations; it condemned the presence of foreign military bases in Latin America and the Caribbean  such as those in Cuba and Puerto Rico  and again demanded that the Government of the United States and the other colonial Powers restore to those countries that part of their territories occupied by those bases against the will of the peoples concerned.34.	The experience lived through in other areas led the Heads of State or Government to reject and condemn any attempt to create a so-called' 'security force"" in the Caribbean  a neo-colonial mechanism incompatible with the sovereignty  peace and security of the countries there.35.	In seeking the restoration of the Malvinas Islands to the Argentine Republic and in reaffirming its support for the inalienable rights of the people of Belize to self-determination  independence and territorial integrity  the Conference once again corroborated what its Declaration had defined as the very ""quintessence of the policy of non-alignment"". It welcomed the fact that as of 1 October the Panama Canal Treaties between the Republic of Panama and the United States would come into force; it gave its full support to those Treaties and it called for their full observance in letter and spirit; furthermore it called on all the States of the world to accede to the Protocol of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality of the Panama Canal.36.	Despite all the pressures  threats and flattery that were brought to bear  and despite the obstinacy of the United States Government in demanding that the issue of Puerto Rico be considered an internal problem of the United States  the Heads of State or Government reiterated their solidarity with the struggle of the Puerto Rican people and their inalienable right to self- determination  independence and territorial integrity  and called upon the Government of the United States of America to refrain from any political or repressive manoeuvres tending to perpetuate the colonial status of that country.37.	No more appropriate tribute than this could be paid to the Latin American traditions of freedom and to the heroic people of Puerto Rico who in these last few days have just celebrated another anniversary of the ""Cry of Lares""  which expressed their indomitable will for freedom over a century ago.38.	When referring to the Latin American reality  the Heads of State or Government  who had already analysed the significance of the liberating process in Iran  could not fail to refer to the revolutionary upheaval in Grenada and the remarkable victory of the people of Nicaragua and their vanguard  the Sandinist National Liberation Front  and emphasize the enormous historic significance of that event for the peoples of Latin America and of the world. The Heads of State or Government also stressed something new in Latin American relations  something that sets an example to other regions of the world  namely the way in which the Governments of Panama  Costa Rica and Mexico  as well as the member countries of the sub regional Andean Pact  Bolivia  Colombia  Ecuador  Peru and Venezuela  acted in unison and solidarity to achieve a just solution to the Nicaraguan problem  as well as Cuba's traditional solidarity with the cause of that people.39.	I confess that these considerations on Latin America would alone have justified the Cuban people's efforts and the concern of the hundreds of thousands of men and women of our country who were determined to enable Cuba worthily to welcome the fraternal nations of the movement of non-aligned countries at the Havana Conference  but for Cuba there was much more than thisâthere was something which  on behalf of our people  we would like to thank this Assembly for in this forum of the United Nations. In Havana the Cuban people's right to choose their political and social system was supported  as was their claim to the territory occupied by the naval base of Guantanamo  and furthermore the unjust blockade  with which the United States Government continues its efforts to isolate the Cuban revolution  seeking to destroy it  was condemned.40.	We deeply appreciate the universal acclaim given to the non-aligned movement's recent denunciation in Havana of the hostile acts  pressure and threats against Cuba by the United States  declaring them to be a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the principles of international law. They are also a threat to world peace. Once again we reply to our brothers  assuring the international community that Cuba will remain true to the principles of international solidarity.41.	History teaches us that when a people  freeing itself from a colonial or neo-colonial system  obtains its independence  that is at one and the same time the last act in a lengthy struggle and the first one in a new and arduous battle  for the independence  sovereignty and freedom of our peoples  who are apparently free  are constantly threatened by foreign control over our natural resources  financial impositions by official international bodies and by the precarious situation of our economies  all of which reduce the fullness of our sovereignty.42.	For this reason  at the very beginning of their analysis of the world economic problems  the Heads of State or Government:""...once again solemnly emphasized the paramount importance of consolidating political independence by economic emancipation. They therefore reiterated that the existing international economic system runs against the basic interests of the developing countries  is profoundly unjust and incompatible with the development of the non-aligned and other developing countries  nor does it contribute to the elimination of the economic and social evils that afflict these countries..."". Furthermore they went on to emphasize:""...the historic mission that the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries should play in the struggle to attain the economic and political independence of all developing countries and peoples  to exercise their full and permanent sovereignty and control over their natural and all other resources and economic activities  and to promote a fundamental restructuring of the world economy through the establishment of the New International Economic Order""in order to conclude that:""...the struggle to eliminate the injustice of the existing international economic system and to establish the New International Economic Order is an integral part of the people's struggle for political  economic  cultural and social liberation."" 43.	I do not have to show or prove here how profoundly unjust and incompatible with the development of the under-developed countries the existing international economic system is  The figures are already so well known that it is unnecessary for us to repeat them here. There are discussions on whether there are only 400 million undernourished people in the world or whether the figure has once again risen to 450 million  as certain  international documents state; but 400 million hungry men and women already constitute too heavy an accusation.44.	What nobody doubts is that all the hopes that have been raised in the developing countries appear to have been dashed and extinguished at this close of the Second United Nations Development Decade.45.	The Director-General of FAO has acknowledged that:"". ..progress is still disappointingly slow in relation to the long-term development goals contained in the International Development Strategy  in the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the establishment of the New International Economic Order and in the resolution of the World Food Conference and in several subsequent conferences.""46.	We are still far from having achieved the modest 4 per cent per annum average increase in the developing countries' food and agricultural production which was proposed 10 years ago in order to solve some of the most pressing problems of world hunger and approach consumption levels that are still low. As a result of this  the developing countries' food imports  which right now constitute a factor aggravating their unfavourable balance of payments  will soonâaccording to FAO figuresâreach unmanageable proportions. In the face of this  official commitments of foreign aid to agriculture in the developing countries are falling off.47.	This panorama cannot be prettied up. Certain official documents sometimes reflect circumstantial increases in the agricultural production of some areas of the under-developed world or stress the cyclical price increases registered by some agricultural items  but these are cases of transitory advances and of short-lived advantages. The developing countries' agricultural export revenues are still unstable and insufficient to meet their import needs in food  fertilizers and other items required to raise their own production. The per capita food production in Africa in 1977 was 11 per cent below that of 10 years earlier.48.	If backwardness in agriculture is perpetuated  the process of industrialization has also not advanced. And it cannot advance because  as far as most developing countries are concerned  industrialization is considered a threat by the developed countries.49.	In 1975 the Second General Conference of UN-âIDO proposed to the developing countries that we be responsible for 25 per cent of the world's manufacturing output by the year 2000 3 but the progress made since that time has been so insignificant that  if the measures proposed by the Sixth Conference are not implemented and if a crash programme is not put into effect to modify the economic policies of most of the developed countries  that target will be another failure and we shall never meet it. We now account for less than 9 per cent of the world's manufacturing output.50.	Our dependency is once again expressed in the fact that the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America import 26.1 per cent of the manufactured goods that enter into the world trade current and export only 6.3 per cent.51.	It may be said that there is some industrial expansion  but it does not take place at the required rate or in the key industries of industrial economy. This was pointed out at the Havana Conference. The world redistribution of industry  the so-called industrial redeployment  should not consist of a new confirmation of the deep economic inequalities that emerged in the colonial era of the nineteenth century. At that time  we were sentenced and condemned to be producers of raw materials and cheap agricultural products. Now  an effort is being made to use our countries' abundant labour and starvation wages to transfer the less technologically developed and less productively viable industries to us: We categorically reject this.52.	Developed market-economy countries today absorb more than 85 per cent of the world's manufactured goods  including those whose industrial production requires the highest technology. They also control more than 83 per cent of all industrial exports. Twenty-six per cent of those exports go to the developing countries  whose markets they monopolize. The most serious aspect of this dependent structure is that our importsâ that is  consumer items as well as capital goodsâare all manufactured according to the demands  requirements and technology of the most developed industrial countries and the patterns of consumer societies  which are thus introduced through the chinks of our trade  contaminating our own societies and thus adding a new element to the already permanent structural crisis.53.	The result of all thisâas was noted by the Heads of State or Government in Havanaâis that the gap between the developed and the developing countries not only persists but has also substantially increased. The latter's relative share in the world output decreased considerably during the last two decades  a fact which has still more disastrous effects on such problems as malnutrition  illiteracy and poor sanitation and health services.54.	Some would like to solve the tragic problem of mankind by adopting drastic measures to reduce the population. They remember that wars and epidemics helped to reduce populations in other eras; they wish to go even further  they want to blame under-development on the population explosion. However  the population explosion is not the cause but the result of underdevelopment. Development will bring solutions to the problem of poverty and also  through education and culture  will in turn help our countries to attain rational and adequate rates of growth.55.	A recent report put out by the World Bank paints an even blacker picture. It says that by the year 2000 some 600 million people on this earth may still be submerged in absolute poverty. 56.	The state of agricultural and industrial backwardness from which the developing countries have still not managed to emerge is  as the Sixth Conference pointed out  undoubtedly a result of unjust and unequal international relations  but  as the Havana Final Declaration also pointed out  to this is now added the prolonged world economic crisis as an aggravating factor.57.	I shall not dwell too long on this aspect. Let us state  however  that the Heads of State or Government consider that the crisis of the international economic system is not a cyclical phenomenon but a symptom of the underlying structural maladjustments and basic imbalance and that that imbalance has been aggravated by the refusal of the developed market-economy countries to control their external imbalances  their high inflationary levels and unemployment. The inflation has been engendered in precisely those developed countries that now refuse to implement the only measures that might eliminate it. Let us further point outâand this is something to which we will return later and which has also been set down in the Havana Declarationâthat this crisis is also a result of the persisting inequality in international economic relationsâso that by eliminating that inequality  as we propose to do  we will contribute to reducing and eliminating the crisis itself.58.	What are the main guidelines formulated in Havana by the representatives of the movement of non-aligned countries?59.	We condemned the persistent channelling of human and material resources into an arms race  which is unproductive  wasteful and dangerous to mankind  and we demanded that a substantial part of the resources now devoted to arms  particularly by the major Powers  be used for economic and social development.60.	We expressed our grave concern over the negligible progress that had been made in the negotiations for the implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. We pointed out that this was due to the lack of political will on the part of most of the developed countries  and we specifically censured the dilatory  diversionary and divisive tactics adopted by those countries. The failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD highlighted that very situation.61.	We confirmed that the unequal exchange in inter-national economic relations  defined as an essential characteristic of the system  had become  if possible  even more unequal. Whereas the prices of manufactured goods  capital goods  food-stuffs and the services that we import from developed countries are constantly rising  the prices of the primary products we export are not  but  on the contrary  are being lowered and are subject to constant fluctuations. Trade relations have worsened. We emphasized that protectionism- one of the aggravating factors of the great depression of the 1930sâhad been reintroduced by some developed countries. The Conference deplored the fact that in the GATT negotiations the developed countries belonging to it did not take into account the interests and concerns of the developing countries  especially the least developed among them.62.	The Conference also denounced the way in which certain developed countries had intensified and increased their domestic production subsidies that redounded against the products of the developing nations.63.	The Conference further deplored the shortcomings in the scope and operation of the generalized system of preferences and  in that spirit  condemned the discriminatory restrictions contained in the United States Foreign Trade Act and the inflexible positions adopted by some developed countries  which prevented the adoption of agreements on this issue at the fifth session of UNCTAD.64.	We expressed our concern over the constant deterioration of the international monetary situation. The instability of the exchange rates of the main reserve currencies  together with inflation and the increase in the imbalance in the world economic situation  creates additional economic difficulties for the developing countries and reduces the real value of their export earnings and also further reduces their foreign currency reserves. As a negative factor  we pointed out the disorderly growth of international liquidity  mainly through the use of devalued United States dollars and other reserve currencies. We noted that  while the inequality of international economic relations had increased the developing countries' accumulated foreign debtâto over $300 billionâthe international financial bodies and private banks had raised their interest rates and imposed shorter terms of loan amortization  thus financially strangling the developing countries. The Conference denounced all this as constituting an element of coercion in negotiations that allows those financial institutions to obtain additional political and economic advantages at the expense of our countries.65.	The Conference took into account the neo- colonialist efforts to prevent the developing countries from exercising their full  permanent and effective sovereignty over those natural resources and reaffirmed this right. It is for this reason that it supported the efforts of raw material-producing non-aligned and other developing countries in their search for just and remunerative prices for their exports and their efforts to improve in real terms their export earnings.66.	Moreover  the Conference paid more attention than ever to the strengthening of economic relations and to the transfer of scientific and technological information among the developing countries. The concept of what could be defined as ""collective self-reliance""â that is  mutual support and co-operation among the developing countries  so that in the first place they will depend on their own collective forcesâwas given great importance in the Havana Declaration. As Chairman of the movement and co-ordinating country  Cuba intends  together with the Group of 77  to do everything necessary to promote the programme of action on economic co-operation outlined by the Conference.67.	Nevertheless  we cannot conceive of that ""collective self-reliance' as anything even remotely resembling self-sufficiency. We rather consider it to be a factor in international relations which will mobilize all the means and resources of that considerable and important part of mankind represented by the developing countries and incorporate them in the general current of resources and economies that can be marshalled in both the capitalist camp and the socialist countries.68.	The Sixth Conference rejected the attempts of certain developed countries to use the issue of energy as a means of dividing the developing nations.69.	The problem of energy can be examined only in its historic context  taking into account the fact that the wasteful consumption patterns of some of the developed countries and the role played by transnational oil corporations have led to the squandering of hydrocarbons and noting the plundering role of the transnational corporations  which  until only recently  have benefited from cheap energy supplies which they have used irresponsibly. The transnational corporations exploit both the producers and the consumers and reap enormous and unjustified windfall profits from both  while at the same time falsifying the facts in order to shift the blame for the present situation to the developing countries  exporters of oil.70.	Permit me to recall that my opening address to the Conference contained a definition of the desperate situation of the non-oil-producing under-developed countriesâespecially the least developed onesâand that at that time I expressed the confidence that the non-aligned oil-producing countries would devise formulas to help to alleviate the unfavourable situation of those countries that have already been hit by world inflation and by unequal trade relations and are suffering serious balance-of-payments deficits and sharp increases in their foreign debt. But that does not obviate the principal responsibility of the developed countries  their monopolies and their transnational corporations.71.	When considering the matter of energy from that standpoint  the Heads of State or Government stressed that the subject should be the main focus of global negotiations within the United Nations  with the participation of all countries  and linking the problem of energy to all other development problemsâwith financial and monetary reforms  with world trade and raw materialsâso as to make a comprehensive and global analysis of those aspects which have a bearing on the establishment of the new international economic order.72.	In revising and reviewing the main problems that confront the developing countries within the context of the world economy  we had to dwell on the activities of the transnational corporations. Once again  their policies and practices were declared unacceptable  it was charged that  in their desire for profits  they exhaust the resources  distort the economies and infringe the sovereignty of developing countries; undermine the rights of people to self-determination; violate the principle of non-interference in the affairs of States; and frequently resort to bribery  corruption and other undesirable practices through which they seek to  and manage to  subordinate the developing countries to the desires and plans of the industrialized countries.73.	In view of the inadequate progress which had been achieved in the work carried out within the United Nations for the drawing up of a code of conduct to regulate the activities of transnational corporations  the Conference reaffirmed the urgency of the early completion of the work on the code  in order to provide the international community with a legal instrument with which at least to control and regulate the activities of the transnational corporations in accordance with the objectives and aspirations of the developing countries.74.	In setting forth all the overwhelming negative aspects in the economic situation of developing countries  the Sixth Conference called the special attention of the world to the mounting problems of the least developed  the most disadvantaged  the land-locked countries  and those isolated in the hinterland  and asked that urgent measures be adopted to mitigate and alleviate their problems.75.	That was the far from optimistic  rather sombre and discouraging picture which the members of the non-aligned movement had in mind when they met in Havana.76.	Nevertheless  the non-aligned countries did not allow themselves to be swept into positions of frustration or exasperation  although that might have been understandable. While drawing up strategic concepts for advancing and continuing in their struggle  the Heads of State or Government repeated their demands and defined their positions.77.	The first and fundamental objective in our struggle consists of reducing and finally eliminating the unequal exchange that prevails today and that makes international trade a very useful  helpful vehicle for the hindering of our wealth. Today  the product of one hour's work in the developed countries is exchanged for the product of 10 hoursâ work in the underdeveloped nations.78.	The non-aligned countries demand that serious attention be paid to the Integrated Programme for Commodities  which thus far has been manipulated and shirked in the so-called North-South dialogue. They likewise ask that the Common Fund  projected and planned as an instrument of stabilization to establish a permanent correspondence between the prices they receive for their products and those they pay for their imports  and which has only just begun to be integrated  be given a true impulse and impetus. As far as the non-aligned countries are concerned  this linkageâ which permanently ties the prices of their export items with the prices of the basic equipment  industrial products  raw materials and technology that they import from the developed countriesâconstitutes an essential pivot for all future economic negotiations.79.	The developing countries demand that the countries that have created inflation and that stimulate it through their policies adopt the necessary measures now to control it and thus put an end to the aggravation of the unequal exchange between our countries 80.	The developing countries demandâand will continue their struggle to achieve thisâthat the industrial products of their incipient economies be given access to the markets of the developed countries to put an end to the vicious protectionism which has been reintroduced in the international economy and which threatens to lead us once again into a murderous economic war. They demand that  without deceptive falsehoods  generalized and non-reciprocal tariff preferences be applied  so that the young industries of the developing countries may develop without being crushed in the world market by the superior technological resources of the developed countries.81.	The non-aligned countries consider that the negotiations about to be concluded on the law of the sea should not be usedâas certain developed countries seek to use themâin order to ratify and endorse the existing imbalance as regards sea resources  but should serve as a vehicle for equitable redress. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has once again brought out and stressed the arrogance and imperialist determination of some countries which  placing their technological possibilities before the spirit of understanding and accommodation requested by the developing nations  threaten to take unilateral action in carrying out deep-sea mining operations.82.	The foreign debts of the developing countries have now reached $335 billion. It is estimated that about $40 billion a year go to servicing those foreign debtsâand that is more than 20 per cent of their exports. Moreover  the average per capita income in the developed countries is now 14 times that in the underdeveloped countries. This surely is an untenable situation.83.	The developing countries need the establishment of a new system of financing through which they would receive the necessary financial resources to ensure the continuous and independent development of their economies. These financing methods should be long- range and at low interest. These financial resources should be completely at the disposal of the developing countries  to enable them to establish priority systems in their own economies and in accordance with their own plans for industrial development and to prevent those funds from being absorbed  as they are today  by transnational corporations  which use alleged financial contributions for development to aggravate the distortions of their economies and to reap maximum profits from the exploitation of the developing nations' own resources.84.	The developing countriesâand  on their behalf  the non-aligned movementâdemand that a substantial portion of the immense resources now being squandered on the arms race be diverted for development  which in turn would contribute to reducing the danger of war and to helping to improve the international situation.85.	Expressing the position of all the developing countries  the non-aligned countries call for the establishment of a new international monetary system which will put an end to the disastrous fluctuations to which the main currencies used in the international economyâespecially the United States dollarâare subject today. The financial disorder also hits the developing countries and the latter hope that  when the outlines of the new international monetary system are drawn up  theyâas the majority of the countries in the international community  representing as they do more than one and a half billion men and womenâmay be given a voice in the decision-making process.86.	To sum up: unequal exchange is ruining and impoverishing our peoples and must cease.87.	Inflation  which is being exported to us  is impoverishing our peoples and must cease.88.	Protectionism impoverishes our peoples and must cease.89.	The existing imbalance in the exploitation of sea resources is abusive and must be abolished.90.	The financial resources received by the developing countries are insufficient and must be increased.91.	Arms expenditures are irrational. They must cease and the funds thus released must be used to finance development.92.	The international monetary system prevailing today is bankrupt and should be replaced.93.	The debts of the least developed countries and of those in a disadvantageous position are burdens impossible to bear and to which no solution can be found and they should be cancelled.94.	Indebtedness oppresses the rest of the developing countries economically and should be relieved.95.	The wide economic gap between the developed countries and the countries seeking development  instead of diminishing  is being widened  and should be closed and eliminated.96.	These then are the demands of the underdeveloped countries.97.	Response to these demands  some of which have been systematically presented by the developing countries in international forums through the Group of 77 and the non-aligned movement  would permit a change of course in the international economic situation that would provide the developing countries with the institutional conditions for organizing programmes that would definitely place them on the road to development.98.	But even if all these measures were implemented and the mistakes and evils of the present system of international relations were rectified  the developing countries would still lack one decisive elementâ foreign financing.99.	All the domestic and internal efforts  all the sacrifices that the peoples of the developing countries are making and are willing to make  and all the opportunities for increasing their economic potential that would be achieved by eliminating the inequality between the prices of their exports and those of imports and by improving the conditions in which their foreign trade is carried out  would not be enough. In the light of their true financial situation at present  they need enough resources to be able both to pay their debts and to make the enormous expenditures on a global level required by the jump into development.100.	Here again  the figures are far too well known to require repeating. The Sixth Conference was concerned not only because the debt of the underdeveloped countries was practically unbearable  but also because that debt was growing yearly at a rate that might be termed galloping. The data recently contained in the annual World Bank report that came out while we were holding the Conference in Havana confirmed that the situation was growing worse daily. In 1978 alone  the foreign public debt of 96 of the developing countries rose by $51 billion.  This rate of growth has raised the foreign debt to the astronomical figure already mentioned. We cannot resign ourselves to this sombre prospect. 101.	The most renowned economistsâboth Western ones and those who subscribe to Marxist concepts- admit that the developing countries' system of international indebtedness functions in a completely irrational manner and that its subsistence could lead to a sudden interruption that might endanger the entire precarious and unstable balance of the world economy.102.	Some try to explain away the surprising economic fact that the international banking centres continue to provide funds to countries that are technically bankrupt by arguing that these are generous contributions to help those countries to meet their economic difficulties  but this is not so. In fact  it is an operation for saving the international capitalist order itself. In October of 1978  the Commission of European Communities admitted  by way of clarification  that: the present balance of the world economy depends to a considerable extent on continuing the flow of private loans to non-oil-producing developing countries...on a scale unprecedented prior to 1974  and any obstacle to that flow will endanger that balance.""103.	World .financial bankruptcy would be very hard  in the first place  on the under-developed countries and on the workers in the developed capitalist countries. It would also affect even the most stable socialist economies  but it is doubtful that the capitalist system would be able to survive such a catastrophe  and it would be very difficult for the resulting and dreadful economic situation not to engender inevitably a world conflagration. There is already talk of special military forces to occupy the oil fields and the sources of other raw materials.104.	But if it is the duty of everyone to concern himself over this sombre prospect  it is first of all the duty of those who possess the greatest wealth and material abundance.105.	In any case  the prospect of a world without capitalism is not too frightening to us revolutionaries.106.	It has been proposed that  instead of a spirit of confrontation  we employ a sense of world economic interdependency that will enable us to call on the resources of all our economies in order to obtain joint benefits  but the concept of interdependency is only acceptable when you start by admitting the intrinsic and brutal injustice of the present interdependency. The developing countries will not accept the unjust  arbitrary international division of labour that modern colonialism imposed on them with the English industrial revolution and that was widened and deepened by imperialism as ""interdependency"".107.	If we wish to avoid confrontation and struggleâ which seems to be the only road open to the developing countries  but is a road that offers long and arduous battles whose proportions are unpredictable todayâ then we must all seek and find formulas of co-operation to solve the great problems that  while affecting our peoples  cannot be solved without also affecting the most developed countries  one way or another.108.	Not so many years ago we stated that the irrational squandering of material goods and the subsequent waste of economic resources by developed capitalist society had already become intolerable. Wherein lies the cause of the dramatic energy crisis that we are faced with right now? Who  if not the non-oil- producing under-developed countries  have to bear the main brunt of it?109.	This feeling that an end must be put to the consumer societies' waste of resources is very widely held. A recent UNIDO document states: ""The present way of life  especially in the industrialized countries  may have to undergo a radical and painful change.""110.	Naturally  the developing countries cannot and do not hope that the transformations they seek and the financing they require will come to them as a gift following mere analyses of international economic problems. In this process  which implies contradictions  struggles and negotiations  the non-aligned countries must first of all depend upon their own decisions and their own efforts.111.	That conviction emerges clearly from the Sixth Conference. In the economic section of the Final Declaration  the Heads of State or Government acknowledge the need to carry out in their countries the necessary economic and social structural changes  considering that this is the only way to eliminate the present vulnerability of their economies and to turn the simple statistic growth into true development. The Heads of State and Government recognize that only thus will their people be willing to pay the price required of them in order to become protagonists in the process. As I said on that occasion: ""...if the system is socially just  the possibilities of survival and economic and social development are incomparably greater."" The history of my own country provides irrefutable proof of this.112.	The emerging crying need to solve the problem of under-development brings us back to the problem I mentioned a little while ago and which I should like to make the last that I submit to this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I refer specifically to international financing.113.	One of the most serious phenomena that accompany the accelerated indebtedness of the developing countries  as we have already said  consists of the fact that the majority of the funds received from outside by the developing nations have to be used to cover the imbalance in their balance of trade  to renew debts and to make interest payments.114.	If we take as an example the non-oil-exporting developing countries  to whose situation I referred at the Havana Conference  we note that in the last six years alone they have run up deficits in their balance of payments of over $200 billion.115.	In view of this  the investments required by the developing countries are enormous  and they need themâprimarily  and with practically no exceptionâ in those branches of production that yield low profits and therefore do not appeal to private foreign lenders or investors.116.	To increase the production of food-stuffs so as to do away with the malnutrition that afflicts those 450 million persons I mentioned earlier  we must provide many new land and water resources. According to specialized estimates  76 million more hectares of land in the developing countries would have to be cultivated and over 10 million more hectares of land irrigated in the next 10 years to meet the needs.117.	Irrigation systems for 45 million hectares of land would have to be repaired. Therefore  even the most modest estimates admitâand I refer to aid and not to the total flow of resourcesâthat international financial aid will yearly have to reach between 8 and 9 billion dollars in order to obtain an agricultural growth rate of from 3.5 to 4 per cent in the developing countries.118.	With regard to industrialization  the estimates are far higher. The Second General Conference of UNIDO  when defining the goals for its Lima meeting  stated that at the heart of the international development policy there should stand a target to be achieved in the year 2000 of annual levels of between $450 and $500 billion of which a thirdâthat is  from $150 to $160 billionâwill have to be financed from external sources.119.	But development is not only agriculture and industrialization. Development primarily involves attention to human beings  who should be the protagonists and goals of all development efforts. To cite the example of Cuba  I will point out that during the last five years our country has invested an average of nearly $200 million a year in school construction. Investment in medical equipment and construction of hospitals  polyclinics and so forth is averaging over $40 million a year. And Cuba is only one of nearly 100 developing countriesâand one of the smallest at that  in terms of geography and population. Therefore  it can be deduced that the developing countries will need to have billions of dollars more invested every year to overcome the result of backwardness in education and in public health services.120.	This is the large problem that faces us. And it is not only our problem  a problem for the countries victimized by under-development and insufficient development; it is a problem for the international community as a whole.121.	On more than one occasion it has been said that we were forced into under-development by colonization and imperialist neo-colonization. The task of helping us to emerge from under-development is  first and foremost  an historical and moral obligation for those who benefited from the plunder of our wealth and the exploitation of our men and women for decades and for centuries. But it is  at the same time  the task of mankind as a whole  and the Sixth Conference declared it so.122.	The socialist countries did not participate in the plunder of the world and they are not responsible for the phenomenon of under-development. But even so  because of the nature of their social system  in which international solidarity is a premise  they understand and assume the obligation of helping to overcome that phenomenon.123.	Likewise  when the world expects the oil- producing developing countries to contribute to the universal flow of external financing for development  it does so because of a hope and duty of solidarity among under-developed countries  not because of obligations and duties which no one could hope to impose. The big oil-exporting countries should be aware of their responsibilities.124.	Even those developing countries that are relatively more advanced should make their contributions. Cubaâwhich is not speaking here on behalf of its own interests and which is not defending here a national objectiveâis willing to contribute  in accordance with its means  thousands or tens of thousands of techniciansâdoctors  teachers  agronomists  hydraulic engineers  mechanical engineers  economists  middle- level technicians  skilled workers and so forth.125.	The time has therefore come for all of us to join in the task of drawing entire peoples â hundreds of millions of human beings â out of the backwardness  poverty  malnutrition  disease and illiteracy that keep them from enjoying full human dignity and pride. We must therefore muster and mobilize our resources for development  and this is our joint obligation.126.	There are so many special  multilateral  public and private funds whose purpose is to contribute to one or another aspect of developmentâagricultural  industrial  meeting balance-of-payments deficits  and so onâthat it is not easy for me  in submitting to this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly this report on economic problems discussed by the Sixth Conference  to formulate a concrete proposal for the establishment of a new fund.127.	But there can be no doubt that the problem of financing should be discussed thoroughly and fully in order to find a solution to it. In addition to the resources already mobilized by various banking channels  loan organizations  international bodies and private finance agencies  we must discuss and decide upon a strategy for the next development decade  so that in that strategy we include an additional contribution of not less than $300 billion  at 1977 real value  to be invested in the under-developed countries and to be made in yearly instalments of at least $25 billion from the very beginning. This aid should be in the form of donations and long-term  low-interest soft credits.128.	It is imperative that these additional funds be mobilized as a contribution of the developed world and of other countries with resources to the underdeveloped world over the next 10 years. If we want peace  these resources will be required. If there are no resources for development  there will be no peace.129.	Some may think that we are asking too much  but I think that the figure itself is still modest. According to statistical information  as I stated at the inaugural session of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  the world is making an annual investment in military expenditures of more than $300 billion. With $300 billion one could in one year build 600 000 schools  with a capacity for 400 million children; or 60 million comfortable homes  for 300 million people; or 30 000 hospitals  with 18 million beds; or 20 000 factories  with jobs for more than 20 million workers; or an irrigation system to water 150 million hectares of land which  with the appropriate technology  could feed a billion people. Mankind wastes that much every year on its military spending. Moreover  consider further the enormous amount of human resources of young people  technicians  scientists and the wasting of fuel  raw materials and other items. That is the fabulous price of preventing a true climate of confidence and peace from existing in the world.130.	The United States alone will in the 1980s spend six times that much on military activities.131.	We are requesting less for 10 years of development than is spent in a single year by the ministries of war and much less than a tenth of what will be spent for military purposes in 10 years.132.	Some may consider our demand irrational  but where the true irrationality lies is in the world's madness in our era and in the threats and perils which hover over mankind.133.	The enormous responsibility of studying  organizing and distributing these amounts of resources should be entrusted fully to the United Nations. These funds should be administered by the international community itself  on a footing of absolute equality for all countries  whether they be contributors or beneficiaries  without any political conditions and without the amount of the donation having anything to do with the voting power in deciding when loans are to be granted and to whom.134.	Even though the flow of resources should be measured in financial terms  it should not consist only of money. It may well be made up of equipment  fertilizers  raw materials  fuel and complete factories  valued in the terms of international trade. Aid in the form of technical personnel and the training of cadres should also be considered as a contribution and counted as such.135.	We are convinced that if the Secretary-General of the United Nations â with the assistance of the President of the General Assembly  with all the prestige and weight of this Organization behind them  and further supported from the very outset by the backing that the developing countries  and especially the Group of 77  could and would give that initiativeâwould call together the various factors we have mentioned to initiate discussions in which there would be no room for the so-called ""North-South"" and ""East-West"" antagonisms  but in which all forces would be joined in a common undertaking  a common duty and a common hope  this idea that we are now submitting to the General Assembly could then be crowned with success. This is not a project that would benefit only the developing nations; it would benefit all countries.136.	As revolutionaries  we are not afraid of confrontation. We have placed our trust in history and in peoples. But as the spokesman and interpreter of the feelings of 95 nations  it is my duty here to struggle to achieve co-operation among peoples  a co-operation which  if attained on new and just bases  will benefit all the countries composing the international community and will be a blessing for world peace.137.	Development in the short-term view may well be a task entailing apparent sacrifices and even donations which may seem irrecoverable. But the vast world now living submerged in backwardness with no purchasing power and with extremely limited consumer capacity will  with its development  add a flood of hundreds of consumers and producers to the international economy. And it is only in this way that the international economy can be rehabilitated and can help the developing countries to emerge from the crisis in which they are submerged.138.	The history of international trade has shown that development is the most dynamic factor in world trade. The major portion of the trade of today takes place among fully industrialized countries. We can assure you that as industrialization and progress spread throughout the world  so trade will also spread to the benefit of all.139.	It is for this reason that on behalf of the developing countries we advocate our cause and we ask you to support it. But this is not a gift which we seek from you. If we do not come up with effective solutions  we will all be equal victims of the catastrophe.140.	Human rights are very often spoken of  but we must also speak of humanity's rights. Why should some people go barefoot that others may travel in expensive cars? Why should some live only 35 years that others may live 70? Why should some be miserably poor that others may be exaggeratedly rich? I speak on behalf of the children of the world who do not even have a piece of bread. I speak on behalf of the sick who lack medicine. I speak to you on behalf of those who have been denied the right to life and human dignity.141.	Some countries are on the sea; some are not. Some have energy resources; others do not. Some possess abundant land on which to produce food; others do not. Some are so glutted with machinery and factories that even the air cannot be breathed because of their poisoned atmosphere; and others have only their own emaciated arms with which to earn their daily bread.142.	In short  some countries possess abundant resources; others have nothing. What is their fate? To starve? To be eternally poor? What good is civilization then? Why  then  the conscience of man? Why  then  the United Nations? Why  then  the world? You cannot speak of peace on behalf of tens of millions of human beings all over the world who are starving to death or dying of curable diseases. You cannot speak of peace on behalf of 900 million illiterates.143.	The exploitation of the poor countries by the rich must cease. I know that in many poor countries there are exploiters and those who are exploited. I address myself to the rich  asking them to contribute. And I address myself to the poor  asking them to distribute.144.	Enough of words: now to deeds. Enough of abstractions; we now want concrete action. Enough of speaking about a speculative new international economic order which nobody understands; we must now speak of a real objective order which everybody understands.145.	I have not come here as a prophet of the revolution. I have not come here to ask or to wish that the world be violently convulsed. I have come to speak of peace and co-operation among the peoples  and I have come to warn that  if we do not peacefully and wisely solve and eliminate the present injustices and inequalities  the future will be apocalyptic.146.	The clashing of weapons  the threatening language and the overbearing behaviour in the international arena must cease. Enough of the illusion that the problems of the world can be solved by nuclear weapons. Bombs may kill the hungry  the sick and the ignorant; but bombs cannot kill hunger  disease and ignorance. Nor can bombs kill the righteous rebellion of the peoples. And in the holocaust  the rich  who are the ones who have the most to lose in this world  will also die.147.	Let us say farewell to arms  and let us in a civilized manner dedicate ourselves to the most pressing problems of our times. This is the responsibility  this is the most sacred duty of the statesmen of all the world. Moreover  this is the basic premise for human survival."
"34",1754,"CYP",34,1979,"ï»¿Sir  it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your election not only represents a well-deserved tribute to you personally  but also does honour to the United Republic of Tanzania and its enlightened leader  President Julius Nyerere  and  even more  to the African continent  which has found in you a worthy representative. Your long experience in international affairs and the prestige that your country and you enjoy in the world community will assist you in successfully conducting the deliberations and work of this very important session. I cannot but refer to the close ties between Tanzania and Cyprus and the friendship between our great leader  the late President Makariosâas well as myselfâand President Nyerere.3.	I should like to pay a tribute also to your predecessor  Mr. Lie'vano of Colombia  for the excellent manner in which he successfully conducted the work of the thirty-third session of our Assembly.4.	It is also my pleasant duty to express my high regard and appreciation for the contribution of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose continued determination to make the United Nations an effective instrument for international co-operation and for the establishment of lasting peace and security has earned him the support and gratitude of all Members.5.	I also wish to extend a warm welcome to Saint Lucia  a fellow Commonwealth country  which we had the pleasure of welcoming earlier this year the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries at Lusaka.6.	The agenda that is before the General Assembly at this session includes many issues of major concern to the international community.7.	The present session opens against the grim back-ground of increasing political and economic tensions and deepening crises which could aggravate the frustrations and fears of mankind for its future. The most important and fundamental objectivesânamely  the maintenance of international peace and security through this Organization  and the establishment of a new international economic orderâremain far from being achieved.8.	In this context  I deem it necessary to state that Cyprus reiterates its position that in reviewing global problems or international conflicts we should act within the framework of the United Nations and its Charter. It is in this light that we consider the report of the Secretary-General a most significant document. Its review of world developments and its assessment of situations should be given full consideration and attention as a basic premise for discussions in the general debate. In the face of a sharply deteriorating world situation  the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out that:""Most of the symptoms and problemsare ones which the United Nations  if effectively utilized as the working structure of the world community of the future  could be of unique assistance in solving	This is not a matter of abstract idealism but of practical self-interest. It is also a matter of urgency."" 9.	The third-world countries in particular have amply reaffirmed and supported this premise during the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held early last month in Havana. To my mind  that Conference symbolizes the genuine efforts of the third-world countries to restructure the world's political and economic order through the United Nations. With the great Powers still in a posture of nuclear antagonism  the increasing manifestations of insecurity and anarchy at the international level threaten the very foundations of human society. In this regard  the genuine efforts of the non-aligned countries to arrest these ominous trends assume a more important dimension. As is pointed out in the Secretary- General's report  the non-aligned movement is ""a good example of this positive trend"" [ibid.].10.	No doubt it will take many more concerted efforts before we see the realization of a new international society. But we have come a long way from the time when the voice of the third world was unheard  unnoticed and unheeded.11.	Whatever the developments  one cardinal truth remains unchanged; that recourse to the system of legal order and security prescribed by the Charter is a compelling necessity. To that end  determined steps must be taken to bring into operation the provisions in Chapter VII of the Charter for the effective implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council  thereby restoring the authority of the United Nations.12.	In reference to the non-implementation of the Security Council resolutions  this year's report pointedly notes:' 'What has not so far been adequately developed is a general and consistent support of the aims and activities of the United Nations as a whole  as a working model for a genuine world community. This is particularly obvious in the response  or lack of it  to many of the decisions of the Security Council."" 13.	It is thus clear that mere condemnation of the state of affairs whereby the adoption  often unanimously  of resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council without their implementation will in fact have the effect of discrediting the Organization and of encouraging the party in default to continue its attitude of contemptuous disregard of such resolutions. Therefore my proposal of last year for the holding of a special session of the General Assembly to deal with this so vital issue alone1 is more pertinent than ever before. If the holding of a special session on the question of the implementation of the United Nations resolutions is not feasible for the time being  then at the very least serious consideration should be given to placing this issue on next year's agenda as a priority item. Cyprus is ready to co-operate with any other Member States which would agree with the proposal for the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the next session of the General Assembly. It is an item which is very much of concern to us in Cyprus  but it is evident that it is of much concern to others as well  and to the United Nations as a whole.14.	It is a fundamental truth that this is a challenge that we have to face in our determination to make the United Nations a more effective instrument for international peace and co-operation. If this could be translated into practical actionâand it is for the States Members of the United Nations to do so individually and collectivelyâit would provide the solution to nearly all the problems facing the world today  whether they be problems of international peace and security  problems of economic relations between States  problems of human rights or problems of international law. It is only through the faithful application in practice of the letter and the spirit of the Charter that the world can be made safer  more just and more peaceful than it is today. In its absence  the United Nations is left without the means for establishing the system of international security and order envisaged in the Charter and so indispensable for peace and survival in an organized world society. Therein lies the prime requirement for the creation of an atmosphere of trust and the key to the solution of many crucial problems and more particularly that of disarmament.15.	The question of disarmament has become a universal problem of the gravest concern to the world. The escalating arms race lies at the very core of the problem. Notwithstanding long and assiduous efforts for disarmament in various committees and other forums for over 30 years  very little has been achieved. Meanwhile the antagonistic piling up of armaments has been escalating by leaps and bounds. Thus the arms expenditure  which in 1974 stood at $225 billion  in 1979 is expected to reach the figure of $400 billion and it will continue on an upward course.16.	What has made the spiralling arms race intractable so far is that the world continues to operate under a momentum from the past on the outmoded concept of balance of power which  in a polarized world  has become the balance of weapons. The very effort towards such balance inevitably generates the arms race. A recent significant event has been the conclusion of the Treaty resulting from the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  between the two superpowers  and it is hoped that this event will lead the way to a subsequent stage whereby the regulated arms race will give way to genuine disarmament. It would  on the other hand  be misleading to simplify matters and be over-optimistic in the light of the realities with which the world continues to be faced. Partial agreements on disarmament are positive. They should not remain without a follow-up because unless and until general and complete disarmament is achieved the arms race in one form or another is bound to continue  threatening international peace and security and even the very survival of life on our planet. The goal has been and continues to be general and complete disarmament under effective international control.17.	I now turn to the important issue of peace-keeping by the United Nations and wish to express our gratitude for the excellent contribution made over the years to the cause of peace in Cyprus by UNFICYP under the most difficult conditions. More particularly  I wish to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to the countries that are contributing to the peacekeeping operation in Cyprus either by contingents or materially. I also wish to say how impressed I am with the exemplary manner in which the officers and men of the various contingents are discharging their delicate duties. Finally  I wish to express our deep gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  and his collaborators  both in New York and in Nicosia for their constructive role in relation to the functioning of UNFICYP and for their efforts towards finding a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem.18.	I should be remiss however  if I were not to point out that peace-keeping operations  no matter how successful they are in containing a potentially explosive situation  cannot advance a just solution of problems  unless they are coupled with a tenacious peace-making effort on the basis and in pursuance of the relevant United Nations resolutions. The lack of parallel determined action to implement those resolutions would make peace on the basis of justice impossible. It would only have as a result a mere perpetuation of an unjust status quo.19.	For quite a number of years now  the issue of the establishment of the new international economic order has been included in our agenda. A very considerable amount of the time of our deliberations at various levels is devoted to this very important issue  and justifiably so. There is no doubt that it deserves our full attention and serious concern. For if we are to succeed in getting out of the vicious circle of poverty and underdevelopment  we must first promote the establishment of a more just and equitable international economic order. The present system of international economic relations does not respond to the needs and requirements of the developing countries. It not only maintains the existing inequalities  but further aggravates the disadvantageous position of the developing countries and widens the gap that separates them from the developed industrial nations.20.	The recognition by the United Nations of the necessity of restructuring economic relations on a more just and equitable basis is an encouraging sign. The acceptance by all interested parties of the United Nations as the most appropriate forum for the discussion and advancement of this crucial issue is also a promising development. Yet  despite our efforts and willingness to negotiate with the developed countries  there is much to be desired concerning the establishment of the new international economic order. No real progress has been achieved thus far. This is evidenced by the negligible results of the fifth session of UNCTAD  held in Manila this year. Instead  we have encountered setbacks and the signs of deterioration are increasing year by year. This problem needs attention and concerted action by all the countries of the world  rich or poor  because if the situation is left to deteriorate further  the consequences of such neglect will be unpredictable. The result could easily be international disaster. The dialogue which began with the developed countries must continue and we appeal to those countries to reconsider and readjust their negotiating positions  so that concrete results may be achieved in the shortest possible time.21.	During the recently concluded eighth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  a positive step was taken through the decision of the Conference to approve a programme of work  for the conclusion of a convention on the law of the sea in the course of next year. Cyprus has always advocated the speedy conclusion of a comprehensive and universally acceptable convention which should include just and adequate provisions regarding the delimitation of the maritime zones between States with opposite or adjacent coasts  coupled with an effective system for the peaceful settlement of disputes. Once that convention is concluded and put into effect it will mark a major achievement in global co-operation.22.	In dealing with the question of the advancement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  I wish to emphasize our total commitment to this noble objective. Cyprus was among the first countries to become a party to the International Covenants on Human Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Cyprus is also a signatory to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  We have all along held the view that the obligation to observe human rights is universal and that no deviation is permitted from this course  no matter what reasons are advanced to justify such deviation. A mere glance at the world scene is sufficient to convince us of the existing unsatisfactory state of affairs  as far as the protection of fundamental human rights is concerned. What is more deplorable is the fact that numerous decisions of various competent organs  such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and others remain unimplemented and the agonizing plea for the cessation of such violations goes unheeded.23.	This is true in particular of the situation in my country  where Turkey  for the fifth year running  continues to trample upon every norm of international law and flagrantly to violate practically every basic human right of the Cypriot people. I take it that the world is by now aware of the verdict of the European Commission on Human Rights  made public on 31 August 1979  which found Turkey guilty of countless crimes perpetrated by its troops of invasion and occupation against the people of Cyprus. The official text of the report will soon be circulated to all Members of the United Nations. In contrast to the violations of all human rights in Cyprus by Turkey  and in an earnest desire not only to convince the world of our dedication to human rights and fundamental freedoms but also to prove our goodwill  I wish to repeat what I said in my statement before this Assembly last year. We agree to the setting up of a United Nations body to supervise the application of the highest standards of human rights and fundamental freedoms to all citizens of Cyprus and to report as appropriate to the Security Council or any other competent body. This proposal could easily form part of a solution to the Cyprus problem.24.	With regard to Western Sahara  we maintain that this problem of decolonization requires a political solution in accordance with which  in view of the effort made towards re-establishing peace in the region  the Saharan people should be granted the right of self- determination and independence. Cyprus considers that the creation of the special committee established by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] at the sixteenth ordinary session of its Assembly of Heads of State and Government at Monrovia this year recently should provide a guarantee for the Saharan people's right to self-determination. We also welcome the recent agreement between the Republic of Mauritania and the Frente POLISARIO and Mauritania's withdrawal of its forces from Western Sahara territory  a praiseworthy act which points in the right direction.25.	We in Cyprus are very distressed at the turn of events connected with the just solution of the Middle East problem. We firmly believe in a comprehensive settlement which would ensure the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. We do not believe in partial agreements in this respect. Inasmuch as the Palestinian people constitute the crux of the Middle East question  there can be no real solutionâand let us face it realistic-ally  laying aside questions of principleâwithout the participation of all the parties to the problem  particularly the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  which is the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Such a solution  which  I repeat  cannot be reached in the absence of the PLO  must be based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the occupied Arab territories  as well as the attainment of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including the sovereign right to establish their own independent State.26.	Our Arab neighbours know very well that we in Cyprus have always been on their side defending the just Arab cause long before the events of 1974 brought to Cyprus the same injustice as the one inflicted on them. The fact is that the Middle East and Cyprus  in addition to being situated in close geographical proximity  are facing problems with many points in common. In both cases there has been aggression and occupation; in both cases refugee problems have been created and human rights have been grossly violated; in both cases there have been systematic attempts to create artificial borders and to alter the demographic composition of the areas by the mass importation and settlement in them of an alien population after the expulsion by force of the indigenous inhabitants; in both cases there is an attempt to consolidate the faits accomplis created by the invasion and by the violation of human rights.27.	Cyprus has been following with grave concern the developments in Lebanon and strongly condemns the declaration of a separate ""State"" under the name of ' 'free Lebanon'' in the southern part of the country  as well as all acts of aggression against southern Lebanon  acts which threaten Lebanese independence and territorial integrity and which grossly violate basic human rights. We call for more decisive action by the United Nations to help the government of Lebanon to restore its sovereignty over the whole of its territory and safeguard the unity of the country.28.	In observing the International Anti-Apartheid Year  which ended a few months ago  Cyprus joined those who are endeavouring to wipe out the scourge of apartheid  a crime against humanity and an affront to the conscience and dignity of mankind. Furthermore  Cyprus has on many occasions expressed its opposition to the policy of' 'bantustanization'' because we believe that such a policy is aimed at the institutionalization of the abhorrent policy of apartheid and the continuation of settler colonialism which impairs the territorial integrity of a country and is a mockery of self- determination.29.	The case of Namibia  where the racist Pretoria regime persists in its illegal occupation 12 years after the termination of South Africa's Mandate over the Territory  is one of the most characteristic examples of the failure by the Security Council to proceed with drastic measures in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter in order to bring about the long overdue implementation of its mandatory decisions on Namibia. Indicative of the intention of the racist regime never to withdraw from Namibia  unless it is forced to do so through effective measures by the Security Council  is the fact that it has so far managed through various tactics seriously to undermine and impair the implementation of the plan of action approved earlier by the Security Council. 30.	We in Cyprus fully understand the plight of the people of Namibia who are suffering from the same evils of racism and violations of human rights practised by the forces of occupation as a matter of State policy. Cyprus will continue its consistent support for the just struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of their national liberation movement  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAP0]  until the total liberation and independence of Namibia as a whole is achieved. In this respect  I wish to reiterate our opposition to and condemnation of South Africa's efforts to annex Walvis Bay  an integral part of Namibia  in clear violation of international law  the Charter of the United Nations and  particularly  Security Council resolution 385(1976).31.	The lame attempt to solve the question of Zimbabwe through a so-called internal settlement meets with our total opposition  as with that of many other countries. We stand firmly in solidarity with the leaders of the Patriotic Front and the front-line States in the struggle for genuine majority rule and true independence for Zimbabwe.32.	The recent proposals and ideas which emerged from the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries at Lusaka and led to the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference have strengthened our hopes that prospects for a negotiated solution of the problem have not yet been exhausted. In the meantime  Cyprus will continue to observe strictly the sanctions imposed by the Security Council against the Salisbury regime. In our view  any relaxation of the sanctions will seriously impair and undermine the efforts for a peace based on justice.33.	It would not be an exaggeration if I were to state that the problems of Namibia and Zimbabwe would have been solved long ago had the United Nations  and in particular the Security Council  acted with more determination against the racist and oppressive regimes of southern Africa  We find no justification for the seeming reluctance of the Security Council to proceed without any further delay to the imposition of the comprehensive sanctions provided under the Charter  particularly mandatory economic sanctions  against those menacing regimes.34.	Cyprus stands firmly by the friendly people of Panama for the effective functioning of the Panama Canal  in accordance with the Treaties signed in 1977  and in this respect fully supports the effective exercise by Panama of its sovereignty over its entire national territory.35.	I turn now to the grave problem with which my own country is confronted and which has been holding the attention of the United Nations for more than five years. The relevant United Nations resolutions provide the basis and the framework for the just and lasting solution of this problem; yet  five years later  those resolutions still remain contemptuously disregarded by Turkey. The occupation of 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus by the Turkish army is still continuing; none of the 200 000 Greek Cypriot refugees have been allowed back to their homes; the 2 000 missing persons have not been traced and human rights continue to be grossly violated in the occupied areas and denied to the whole population of Cyprus.36.	Moreover  systematic measures are being taken through the massive implantation of colonizers from Turkey and other measures  such as the introduction of Turkish currency in the occupied areas  the cancellation of all valid Cyprus passports in the hands of Turkish Cypriots  the grant of illegal land titles to Turkish Cypriots and to settlers from Turkey in the occupied areas  and other ominous actsâall constituting evidence that Turkey's aim is the consolidation of partition and  perhaps  the eventual annexation of the occupied part of Cyprus.37.	In its essence  the Cyprus problem is a dispute between Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus  and not  as falsely portrayed by some  a difference between the communities in Cyprus. It is a question of invasion and occupation. The internal aspects of the Cyprus problem could easily be solved if that task were left to the Cypriots themselves to discuss and resolve without foreign presence and interference. We want Cyprus to become a State free from foreign troops  fully independent  territorially integral  sovereign  united  demilitarized and non-aligned.38.	We have accepted federationâalthough in the past such a solution was considered by many constitutional experts as completely unacceptable for a small island like Cyprus. But when we speak of ""federation""  we mean true federation  a federation that would function properly and within which the right to move freely  the right of settlement and the right of property would be safeguarded and where human rights would be fully and uniformly applied and respected.39.	What the other side apparently wants is not a federation but the creation of two separate States with separate borders  separate armies  separate treaty- making capacity and permits and visas to move from one region of such so-called federation to the other. Such ""federation"" would be tantamount to complete partition.40.	We would have been entitled to refuse to negotiate until the occupation forces had been withdrawn. But we did not follow that line  and we repeatedly tried to negotiate in good faith  despite the presence of the foreign troops of occupation during these past five years. Despite the fact that the negotiations could not be free  as stipulated in the relevant United Nations resolutions  because of the continued occupation of 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus and the other circumstances created by the invasion  we did what we could through negotiations with the Turkish Cypriot ""leadership"" to find some common ground for progress. And when one speaks of the Turkish Cypriot ""leadership"" let us not make any mistake about it: in fact  it means Ankara. The Turkish Cypriot leadership  primarily by reason of the presence of the army of occupation  is totally dependent on Ankara and reflects the views of the Turkish Government and the Turkish army rather than the views of the Turkish Cypriots  whose majority live discontentedly in conditions of misery and injustice in the occupied areas  completely dissatisfied with the present state of affairs and longing for a better tomorrow. No wonder  therefore  that no progress has been achieved.41.	Yet  despite the bitter experience and fruitless efforts of the past five years  I agreed to meet with the Turkish Cypriot leader Mr. Denktas in the presence of the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  on 18 and 19 May 1979. During that meeting  we reached an agreement with Mr. Denktas consisting of 10 points  which provide a sound basis for the negotiation of a just solution to the Cyprus problem. I shall not here go into speculation about why Mr. Denktas accepted that agreement. However  any doubts were removed when only a few days later the Turkish Cypriot leadership  backed by Turkey  employed all possible methods to undermine the agreement and frustrate the new efforts. Although the talks formally began on 15 June  they lasted for a few days only and the Turkish Cypriot leadership started putting pre-conditions for the continuation of the talks. Those pre-conditions  if accepted  would have amounted to recognizing partition as a final solution to the Cyprus problem.42.	We continue to stand by the agreement of 19 May 1979  but we cannot accept any pre-conditions  conditions or misinterpretations. As I said before  we repeatedly chose the path of negotiations  although we would have been entitled not to do so. But we do not want negotiations for the sake of negotiations. The other side may want that  for obvious reasons. It would not be fairâand in fact it would be counterproductiveâto carry out a fruitless dialogue for the sake of dialogue and as a way of deceiving world public opinion into thinking that something was being achieved when in fact no progress whatsoever was being made.43.	The stumbling-block to meaningful negotiations is the lack of political will on Turkey's part to abandon its partitionist and expansionist policyâand I believe that that is being widely realized by now by all objective observers of the Cyprus problem. All our attempts throughout the last five years to find a just and lasting solution through negotiations have met the stone wall of Turkish intransigence. But if the opportunity arises for meaningful and substantive negotiations we shall not hesitate to go to the negotiating table again.44.	It is with regret that I report again to the General Assembly this year that no progress has been made towards finding a peaceful and just solution to the Cyprus problem through the implementation of United Nations resolutions. Nevertheless  it is a source of satisfaction for us that at the Commonwealth Meeting in Lusaka and at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Havana the just cause of Cyprus received overwhelming support. We do not reject the method of intercommunal negotiations  but when there has been a deadlock for five years what do you expect a suffering people to do? To sit idle and wait? How can a people suffering for more than five years the devastating effects of foreign occupation be expected to remain idle and forgo its right to present its case to international forumsâespecially the United Nationsâseeking the assistance of world public opinion and a remedy to its plight? That is why it is absolutely essential for us to continue without interruption to seek justice from the international community. We urgently draw the attention of the international community to the situation in Cyprus in view of the fact that for five years now the occupation with all the other consequences and we are entitled  I believe  to demand from the international community more specific action with a view to implementing the resolutions of the United Nations  which contain all the necessary elements for a just and lasting solution. I believe that we have a right to demand justice like the people of Zimbabwe  like the people of Namibia  like the people of Palestine. We ask that the international community become fully conscious not only of the great injustice perpetrated against Cyprus and its people but also of the fact that the situation in Cyprus is fraught with many dangers  dangers for Cyprus and beyond Cyprus  unless a solution is found in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations.45.	We have come once again to the General Assembly to ask in unequivocal terms for the speedy and effective implementation of the United Nations resolutions. In this respect  we believe that the time has come for the General Assembly to recommend to the Security Council the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter  so as to compel Turkey to comply with its obligations under the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. Although we have no illusions about the difficulties  due to political expediency  of securing sanctions  we strongly feel that five years are more than enough for a State Member of the United Nations to ignore with impunity the verdict of this Organization. If concrete action is not taken by the United Nations  it is the United Nations which will fail  and the faith of humanity in the Organization will be seriously shaken at a time when we all want it to become an effective instrument for international peace and security.46.	I strongly believe that the United Nations can do more. Some years ago  a representative international conference under the auspices of the United Nations was proposed by the Soviet Union to deal with the problem of Cyprus and assist in finding a solution in conformity with the United Nations resolutions. We reiterate our acceptance of this proposal because we believe that it has much merit and we hope that the General Assembly will take a decision for the holding of such a conference  which we believe can prove very constructive in tackling the problem of Cyprus.47.	We also believe that the General Assembly or the Security Council should appoint a committee from among their members to co-operate with the Secretary- General towards the finding of a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus problem on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions. The composition and the terms of reference of such a committee should be decided by the General Assembly or the Security Council.48.	Moreover  we are willing and ready to consider any other effective means which would make possible a just and lasting solution on the basis of the United Nations resolutions. As everyone knows it is Ankara which calls the tune for the Turkish Cypriot leadership. We have over and over again proved our goodwill. We fully accept the agreement of 19 May 1979. I have already mentioned what we are prepared to do in connexion with the safeguarding of the human rights of all citizens of Cyprus. And I repeat my proposal for the complete disarmament and demilitarization of the Republic of Cyprus with the presence only of an international police force for as long as necessary to strengthen  if it is necessary  the sense of security of all Cypriots. This proposal was endorsed by the non- aligned countries in the Declarations of Belgrade"" and Havana.  The withdrawal from Cyprus of all troops and the total disarmament of all armed forces in the Republic will in itself pave the way towards a united country and a united people. Without the unity of the country  the unity of the people and the unity of the economy  Cyprus cannot survive as an independent State. Any kind of division is artificial and contrary to the interests of all Cypriots. That is why we on our part shall never accept any divisive arrangement  whatever its title or whatever its terminology. If the foreign intervention and interference cease  Cyprus can become a happy homeland for all its citizensâGreek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike. And when I say this before this body  I am absolutely certain that at this moment I am expressing the views  not only of the Greek Cypriots  but also of the vast majority of the Turkish Cypriots.49.	I have given you today's position with regard to the Cyprus problem. What is before this Assembly is the cessation of occupation of a large part of Cyprus by the Turkish armed forces and the implementation of the United Nations resolutions in all their aspects. The United Nations must do its utmost to ensure for Cyprus the basic right to which every State  every Member of the United Nations  is entitled and first and foremost the cessation of foreign occupation. The Charter provides the way and it is our fervent appeal that all peace- loving countries in the world will help us to this end. We appeal to all States Members of this Organization to help Cyprus safeguard its sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment. Today marks the nineteenth anniversary of the independence of Cyprus. But the very survival of Cyprus is at stake. We want to see a completely free and independent Cyprus. We want to create a safer future for our children. We want to create such conditions in Cyprus where Greek and Turkish Cypriots will be able to work and live and prosper together. We sincerely want to contribute most positively to the re-establishment of stability and peace in our sensitive and highly explosive area. Help us to bring happiness and hope to all the people of Cyprus. Help us to put an end to this untold tragedy which Cyprus and its people have been going through for the last five years. Help us restore the unity of the country and the unity of the people  for that is where happiness and prosperity for all Cypriots lie. Help us restore justice; help us restore freedom; help us to do away with the human agony and drama.50.	How can anyone  at this particular moment  forget the agony of the families and dependants of the 2 000 missing persons  who for five years now have not been in a position to know what has happened to their beloved ones? I appeal to all to join in bringing influence to bear on Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership to honour the agreement on missing persons of 19 May  an agreement that was concluded in the presence of the Secretary-General and announced by him. Is the aggressor really so inhuman as to refuse  five years after the crime  to co-operate on this purely humanitarian issue? Is it impossible for the United Nations to do more in this respect?51.	I wish to stress that  regarding Cyprus as well as all other international problems on the Assembly's agenda  it is of the essence to co-ordinate our efforts so that  instead of being overwhelmed by frustration and inability to act  we may take concrete and effective steps so as to secure complete freedom  complete justice  and respect for human rights everywhere in the world. It is only upon this basis that lasting peace can be achieved  and that is the task and the mission of the United Nations."
"35",1822,"DDR",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  please accept my congratulations on your election to your high office. We are especially pleased that you  being a representative of a country with which we have friendly ties  are in the chair at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I wish you and Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim success in your work of great responsibility.82.	We salute the new Member of the United Nations  Saint Lucia.83.	I should like to express to the delegation of the People's Republic of Angola our deep sympathy on the passing away of President Antonio Agostinho Neto  a' great revolutionary and an outstanding African statesman.84.	At the current session  just as at preceding ones  the General Assembly of the United Nations is particularly concerned with the struggle for peace and security. Conditions for this have certainly become more favourable  yet much remains to be done in order to afford all peoples a peaceful development. Aggression  threats to use force  smouldering conflicts  continuing colonial oppression and an obviously stepped-up arms race are in contradiction with the will of mankind and the purposes of the United Nations.85.	Never should anyone forget that 40 years ago German fascism set the world ablaze  creating a holocaust that claimed the lives of 50 million people. The victory of the anti-Hitler coalition over this barbarism  a victory in which the Soviet people had a decisive share  opened the road to a new beginning. The struggle for peace  in which the German Democratic Republic participates fully  is to protect man's basic right to fife and  at the same time  to foster his right to live in a secure social environment. The Charter of the United Nations postulates peace as the supreme duty of States.86.	The International Year of the Child has  as a matter of fact  brought even closer to the minds of people our generation's responsibility for the peaceful future of mankind.87.	The preservation of peace remains the principal task of the United Nations. In this respect  it can firmly count on the socialist States. The declaration of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty issued in Moscow last November   as well as the meeting their Foreign Ministers held in Budapest on 14 and 15 May 1979  testify to their persevering efforts to achieve effective measures for the advancement of peaceful coexistence.88.	The United Nations increasingly draws strength from the movement of non-aligned States  which  at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Havana  impressively underlined its constructive role in international affairs.89.	International security requires the unambiguous willingness of all States mutually to respect their fundamental rights and legitimate interests and to work collectively so that peace be guaranteed for good. This  in essence  is the categorical imperative of our time.90.	The resulting actions  which are interdependent  are clearly definable.91.	First  the arms race must be stopped and disarmament must be advanced by concrete steps in order for political detente to be backed up materially.92.	Secondly  the political and legal pillars of peaceful coexistence must be reinforced  trust among States must be strengthened and disputes between States must be solved in conformity with the United Nations Charter  that is  peacefully.93.	Thirdly  colonial and racist oppression must be eliminated and the right of peoples to self- determination must be ensured.94.	Fourthly  mutually beneficial international co-operation must be developed as comprehensively as possible and must include the establishment of economic relations on an equal footing. That decision cannot be the prerogative of a few; rather  the United Nations  this world-embracing Organization  is called upon to redouble its efforts in this regard.95.	Also  the world Organization should carefully see to it that no one can threaten or use military force to secure the supply of its energy and raw material needs.96.	As a socialist State  the German Democratic Re-public  aware of the past and present  keeps an open mind on these tasks. The principles of international law are enshrined in its Constitution and determine its daily practical policy. When it was founded almost exactly 30 years ago  the country's first President  Wilhelm Pieck  pledged:""We shall scrupulously fulfil all obligations of the Potsdam Agreement. In that way we want to regain the trust of the world and to rejoin the community of peace-loving  democratic peoples.""97.	On the eve of the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of our State  I can say that the people of the German Democratic Republic have redeemed that pledge. Siding with all peace-loving States  we persistently pursue the course of international security and coexistence in peace. Just like all other peoples  we need peace not only to secure  but also to augment  what we have accomplished.98.	International security requires  first of all  arms limitation and disarmament. The tenth special session of the General Assembly elevated this conclusion to the rank of a maxim recognized by all States. We do not want to  and must not  tolerate tremendous creative potential and huge material resources being used to conceive and manufacture more and more cruel means of warfare. The arms race is no law of nature. It is in the hands of man alone whether to manufacture weapons or produce goods for everyday needs.99.	The socialist States do everything in their power to achieve disarmament. They work hard and systematically for practical measures.100.	We have noted with satisfaction that the non- aligned States reaffirmed at Havana the intention of bringing their growing international weight to bear to this end  And  as the World Peace Council's activities  for example  at the United Nations in New York in 1978 showed  civic forces too have an important word to say in defending the vital interests of peoples. In this way it will be possible to realize  step by step  the old humanist idea of eternal peace as an alternative to war and armament.101.	There are some who  still ask the question whether stable peace and security can be achieved through disarmament or though armament. The answer should be obvious from the history of two world wars  for those two wars  as everyone knows  were preceded by armament programmes. And  as a matter of fact  nobody can really live a secure life today in the face of growing arsenals of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The notion in certain quarters that a political potential for blackmail can be obtained through escalated armament has always been proved wrong. Ethics and reason therefore call for the cessation of the arms race and more security through disarmament.102.	Naturally  the legitimate national security interests of the parties involved need to be taken into account at all stages of disarmament negotiations. However  such interests must not be misused as a pretext for opposing effective disarmament steps  and a declared readiness for arms limitation and disarmament must not be put in doubt by contradictory everyday practice. Thus  as is well known  a long-term armaments programme was adopted not far from here  precisely at the time when the United Nations was holding its tenth special session  devoted to disarmament.103.	Disarmament requires constant and persistent forward movement. A political will for resolute action is needed in order to follow up the demands contained in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly. In the past  promising developments were quite frequently delayed or even interrupted for long periods. All the more significant  in our judgement  is the outcome of the Vienna meeting between Leonid Brezhnev  Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  and Jimmy Carter  President of the United States. It has met with the whole-hearted approval of all people of goodwill and also produced a broad positive response in my country. The world-wide echo produced by the treaty resulting from the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks shows  like a mirror  that genuine steps towards arms limitation do improve the climate and trust among States. May that treaty therefore be ratified.104.	The new treaty to limit the most dangerous strategic offensive aims quantitatively and qualitatively is the most important milestone thus far on the road to curbing the arms race and is also a major step towards improving Soviet-American relations and the international political climate. With its ratification the fabric of bilateral and multilateral agreements on arms limitation and disarmament would be woven closer  the threat of a thermonuclear war diminished  and the path to progress in other negotiations paved. What we have achieved should determinedly be used to take concrete disarmament steps. These include the prohibition of radiological and neutron weapons  as well as other means of mass destruction; the early conclusion of a treaty on the cessation of nuclear-weapon tests; and a strengthened non-proliferation regime for nuclear weapons. At long last  it should also be possible to make headway at the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe.105.	For six years now the socialist States  including the German Democratic Republic as a direct party in the negotiations  have been waiting for a constructive approach on the part of all negotiating parties. Our proposals  which do not impinge anyone's security but on the contrary strengthen that of all and which are comprehensible to anyone willing to see  have been on the negotiating table for a long time.106.	The demand to end the nuclear arms race is be-coming more and more urgent. We call upon all nuclear- weapon States to start  without delay  consultations and negotiations on the discontinuance of the manufacture of nuclear weapons and on the reduction of the stockpiles of such weapons.107.	Following the aforementioned Vienna meeting between the Soviet Union and the United States of America  it is our expectation that the preparatory work for a world disarmament conference will also yield tangible results. The second SALT Treaty has furnished proof that most complex problems can be solved if realism and goodwill prevail.108.	The German Democratic Republic fully supports the initiative of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic which proposes the adoption of a declaration on international co-operation for disarmament. Such a declaration appears to be all the more pressing since the forces which capitalize on arms production and seek to conduct the power policy of an era now irrevocably gone by continue to offer obstinate resistance. Plans to deploy new nuclear weapons systems in Western Europe are cases in point. Using the myth of a threat from the East  they attempt to generate fear and to justify their arms build-ups which they misleadingly label a pent-up need.109.	The people of the German Democratic Republic know from experience that  from the East  from the Soviet Union  come peace as well as the concept and the reality of peaceful coexistence. It is in the socialist countries that the great initiatives to strengthen international security and disarmament have originated in the past  and are still originating today. This is only logical  for socialism is the strongest buttress of peace.110.	Disarmament is the direct and safest way to stable international security. It must be accompanied by treaties and agreements. This is what the States members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization were guided by when they presented their peace programme. Their proposals are aimed at excluding the use of force from international relations  at ensuring the sovereignty of States in every respect and at barring any interference in their internal affairs. Thanks to the efforts of the Warsaw Treaty States  relations among States in Europe have continued to improve in spite of a number of obstacles. This should be an encouragement to seek more; a standstill would be a step backward. This is why the socialist States propose that the renunciation of the use of force should be shored up with a treaty committing its parties not to be the first to use either atomic or conventional weapons.111.	As a result  the international legal principle prohibiting the use of force  as laid down in Article 2  paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter  would be strengthened and related to the principal dangers of our time. When it comes to an issue so vital to mankind  nothing should be left undone and every possibility should be used to exclude force from international affairs. Furthermore  it is necessary to strengthen trust among nations through precisely-worded agreements. For that purpose  the socialist States proposed a specific conference to be attended by the States signatories to the Helsinki Final Act.  The socialist States seek to ensure that the second review session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  to be held in Madrid in 1980  will be held in a constructive manner. The meeting must help to advance detente.112.	The European region  where the Second World War was unleashed  where after 1945 cold war poisoned the international climate and where the biggest military capabilities are concentrated today  has a special need for arms limitation and disarmament and for stable  good-neighbourly relations among all States. For 30 years  there have been two sovereign German States with social systems which are diametrically opposed. The existence of these two States and the recognition of the inviolability of the border between them have become both an important and an indispensable element of the political balance in Europe. This element is one of the foundations of durable security and peace in our continent. Anybody who  under any pretext whatsoever  engages in altering these results of post-war history or substitutes illusions for realities is  wit-tingly or unwittingly  of no good service to European security and world peace as this is encouragement to the forces of revanchism. It is certainly appropriate to recall this once more in view of the fact that Fascist Germany's attack on the borders of its eastern neighbour  Poland  on 1 September 1939  precipitated the most devastating war in human history.113.	The German Democratic Republic  for its part  will not be found wanting in its readiness to develop with Western neighbouring States  including the Federal Republic of Germany  mutually advantageous relations in accordance with the Helsinki Final Act. This constitutes a policy which is not only realistic  but also downright responsible  and which takes into account the interest of European peoples in lasting detente and relies on the well-known set of European treaties  whose beneficial effects on reducing tension are recognized by people the world over. And for that matter  I should like to add the following. Security and cooperation in Europe also presuppose a stable and peaceful situation in and around West Berlin. The gauge with which to measure the will to detente is a strict respect for the status of West Berlin as defined  binding on all  in the four-Power Agreement.  Any intention to alter or circumvent the balance of interests achieved is bound to lead to tension.114.	The German Democratic Republic is aware that stability and confidence-building are not only a regional but also a global concern. For that reason  high priority ought to be accorded to the conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force. If such a treaty could be put into effect  the threat of aggression and military conflict would be diminished. A general prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons would also be conceivable within its framework. The right to self-defence in the event of aggression  as guaranteed under the United Nations Charter  would remain unaffected  since the treaty would obviously have to promote and create a situation i n which it would no longer be necessary to resort to this right. The conclusion of an agreement on the non-use of nuclear weapons against nuclear-weapon-free States and the prohibition of the stationing of such weapons in territories where there are no such weapons at present would no doubt be steps in that direction.115.	The public advocacy  by certain mass media  of war  hatred among peoples and the arms race run counter to the strengthening of international security. Last year's UNESCO declaration on that subject seeks to prevent this. It would be useful if the United Nations Secretariat were to furnish information as to what publicity is given all over the world to arms limitation efforts.116.	The same measure of attention must be paid to increasing Fascist and neo-Fascist activity  a fact which Mr. Erich Honecker  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the Council of State of the German Democratic Republic  pointed out during his talks in April of this year with Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General of the United Nations.117.	Those who seek to terrorize public opinion engage in slander campaigns and preach hatred among peoples and races can easily be identified as the most extreme enemies of peace  international understanding and human rights. They must be opposed with resolve before peoples have to suffer the consequences. Tolerance or even leniency would be dangerous. The birth of the United Nations and its mandate are inseparably connected with the victory over Fascist barbarity. Abhorrence of evils done must include vigilance and determination to nip all new attempts in the bud. The activities of neo-Fascist forces require an adequately vigorous response by the United Nations.118.	We who are committed to preventing the outbreak of a third world war welcome the proposal put forward by the USSR to condemn from this rostrum hegemonic policies in all their manifestations . We view this as a suitable means of strengthening the principles of the United Nations Charter and of urging their implementation. Unqualified respect for the sovereign equality of all States and the protection of their independence are essential for this Organization to be able to fulfil its great tasks. We support the Soviet proposal because we are conscious of the commitment to peace  which our workers' and farmers' State solemnly declared after Hitler fascism  the epitome of hegemonism at its worst  was crushed.119.	Unresolved international conflicts and gross violations of the Charter of the United Nations impair international security. Moreover  there are certain circles which are arrogant enough to claim for themselves a ""right to undertake punitive action"". Aggression was launched against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which is a close friend of the German Democratic Republic. Only determined defence and world-wide international solidarity with those attacked stopped that wanton act.120.	The unending attempts to take advantage of the refugee problem in South-East Asia also cause us concern. This problem was created as a result of the imperialist policy of aggression in order to destabilize the situation in the region. It is obvious that someone has pulled the wires  namely the same forces who want to halt peaceful construction in Viet Nam  Laos  Kampuchea and other States. We express solidarity with the peoples of Indo-China  who are defending resolutely their right to self-determination and peace in their region. The seat of Kampuchea here in this Organization belongs to the People's Republic of Kampuchea.121.	It has been proved over and over again that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations form the appropriate basis upon which to solve problems between States. If that basis is rejected  no lasting solution is possible. Thus  as everyone can see  the separate agreement in the Middle East has only aggravated the situation. The conflict area is being turned into a huge arsenal of most modern weaponry. New aggressive acts against Arab States are threatening. Lebanon's sovereignty is being trampled upon. Israel's withdrawal from all territories occupied since 1967 and the guarantee of the Palestinian people's right to self- determination  including the right to form a State of their own  remain fundamental prerequisites for peace and security of all States in the Middle East. The decisions adopted by the world Organization do not permit of its involvement in separative manoeuvres which  as even their advocates have come to realize  have led into a blind alley  because by such manoeuvres the rights of the Palestinian people are ignored. Our particular solidarity is with the just struggle of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.122.	Also in regard to Cyprus  it is necessary to implement the United Nations decisions  in consistency with its Charter  so as to enable the Cypriot people to live in peace.123 The German Democratic Republic supports the people of Afghanistan in their efforts to build up a new fife for themselves  free from colonial exploitation and foreign interference.124 With the same measure of sympathy and solidarity we have been following the revolutionary events in Nicaragua  whose representative impressed this forum with his statement.125.	The situation in southern Africa is a permanent threat to peace and security  and not only in that region. To eliminate that source of conflict  the unimpeded implementation of the right to self-determination of the peoples in southern Africa  and the complete liberation of that continent from racism  colonialism and neo-colonialism will be needed.126.	No lasting solution of this problem can be achieved until the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia attain genuine independence and power is transferred to their legitimate representatives  the Patriotic Front and the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  respectively.127.	The German Democratic Republic persistently denounces all attempts to set up illegal regimes in those countries  and it calls urgently for the enforcement of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against Rhodesia and for effective sanctions against South Africa to be adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations. The German Democratic Republic emphatically condemns the continuing acts of aggression committed by the racist regimes against Angola  Mozambique  Zambia and other nations.128.	As Mr. Honecker stressed during his tour of some African States earlier this year  the peoples of Africa in their difficult struggle can rely firmly upon the German Democratic Republic and the other States of the socialist community.129.	The resolution of global issues affecting mankind requires a greater degree of co-operation under the United Nations system so that hunger and epidemics may be eradicated  problems of energy supply and environmental protection solved and new areas of activity opened up to mankind. This is closely related to the efforts to strengthen international security. Is it not essentially the same problem that we are addressing ourselves to in restructuring international economic relations on a democratic basis? The perpetuation of the neo-colonialist division of labour in the interests of international corporations is a source of conflict. It is not least because of these fundamental considerations thatâas was reaffirmed at the fifth session of UNCTADâthe German Democratic Republic backs the developing countries' insistence on the removal of old imperialist dependencies. In this context  it is the inalienable right of all States and peoples to exercise control over their natural resources.130.	The Charter of the United Nations  Mr. President  commits the Organization to enhancing its role for the maintenance and deepening of international security. The Security Council bears special responsibility. The composition and operation of this principal organ are up to date and make co-operation possible  indeed necessary  among the permanent members of the Security Council  which are also nuclear-weapon States.131. At a time of sharpening confrontation about the future course of international events  many people have pinned their hopes on the United Nations. This Organization should and can bring its weight to bear for the benefit of good relations among States. The German Democratic Republic  for its part  will make its contribution to that end."
"36",1840,"DEU",34,1979,"ï»¿First of all  I should like  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  to extend to you  Sir  warmest congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. With you as President  this important task falls to an experienced diplomat who  during his many years of service at New York  has rightly won everyone's respect. You can be sure of the full support of my delegation in carrying out the important tasks ahead of you.76.	I also wish to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose untiring efforts on behalf of the world Organization we greatly respect.77.	Crisis of economic growth and development  crisis in the Middle East  in southern Africa and in Indo-Chinaâthese are the subjects dominating international politics and especially politics within the United Nations. In his report  Secretary-General Waldheim speaks of ""deep-seated feelings of anxiety"" 78.	In such times it is more important than ever to look beyond the day and to reflect on the fundamental current of history. That fundamental current was switched to a new course 200 years ago by the proclamation of civil liberties and by the Industrial Revolution. Up to that time oppression and poverty seemed to be the unalterable lot of the great majority of people. But then there opened up a future which gave all men the hope of one day living free from bondage and free from want. Ever since then the worldâdespite all crises and setbacks  despite terrible wars and inhuman crimesâhas been pursuing that goal.79.	The trend towards freedom has gathered momentum dramatically in our age: human rights became a universal idea; peoples living under colonial rule asserted their right to self-determination and achieved independence; the process of industrialization extended to the nations of the third world ; and in spite of the population explosion the per capita income of those countries grew 3.4 per cent annually in the 1960s.80.	But people in many parts of the world are still suffering from hunger; there is still oppression; the problems of economic and social development are still unresolved; and world peace is still not secure. Indeed  today we must face new challenges: growth and development have slowed down  but the armaments spiral is spinning faster; the independence which the third world has only just achieved is threatened by new hegemonic aspirations; and violations of even the most elementary human rights show the great distance that still has to be covered before respect for the dignity of man becomes the day-to-day practice of all nations.81.	Will mankind continue along the road to peace  to freedom from want and oppression  or will it not? The decision lies in our hands.82.	The limits to progress that we have come up against are not insurmountable ones dictated by nature. They are social and political limits which we have imposed upon ourselves  because we still try to master the challenges of our time with the attitudes and methods of the past. A fundamental change in our way of thinking is more urgent than ever. This also holds true for international politics. Peace is no longer the exclusive concern of the big Powers  and economic stability is no longer a task for individual States alone.83.	Safeguarding peace today requires the participation of all countries. The individual country can achieve growth only if the others achieve growth also. This new reality of global interdependence demands of us a different approach  a different kind of action.84.	The power of fact forces nations onto the road of world-wide co-operation on the basis of equal rights. Multilateral diplomacy and international organizations are moving into the foreground. Their focal-point is the United Nations.85.	This Organization has played an indispensable role in the peaceful process of decolonization  in defusing conflicts and in accelerating development. It has thrust the issue of mankind's future into our field of vision and opened up avenues for new dimensions in international co-operation. Its task is still to overcome the disparities in the world by means of co-operation and the reconciliation of interests.86.	Those who want the world to achieve further progress must increase the efficiency of the United Nations. Because of new and wider-ranging activities its methods of work need to be streamlined. The mushrooming of institutions will have to be stopped.87.	But for the United Nations to be able to fulfil its global responsibilities it will also be necessary to keep the principle of universality intact. The exclusion of Member States would affect the United Nations in its essence and deprive it of its ability to foster world-wide co-operation.88.	Active and responsible participation in the work of the United Nations is a major element of the foreign policy of the Federal Republic of Germany. We uphold the principles of the Charter; they point the way to a future for mankind free from want and bondage.89.	Progress requires peace. The policy of my country is a policy for peace  and the basis of that policy is our membership in the European Community and in the North Atlantic Alliance.90.	The Irish Foreign Minister has set out the foreign policy positions of the nine States members of the European Community 91.	Essential to the safeguarding of world peace is the consolidation of peace between East and West. East and West have different concepts and values and  consequently  different political objectives. We cannot erase this fundamental difference  but moderation must prevail. We must find ways and means of developing the co-operation necessary in this interdependent world  notwithstanding the contrasting systems.92.	However  peace cannot be safeguarded unless there is a balance of forces. That balance is the basis of detente. The Federal Republic of Germany has from the very beginning been one of the main contributors to detente. We shall continue to make this contribution  together with our partners in the North Atlantic Alliance and in the European Community. To us  a policy of detente is a long-range policy; it is not just a fair- weather phase. This makes it predictable for all. No one has cause to doubt the unambiguity of our policy.93.	We are constantly developing our relations with the Soviet Union and the other States signatories of the Warsaw Treaty. We are equally active in the multilateral process of detente in Europe  based on the Final Act of Helsinki.  All signatories of the Final Act should prove the sincerity of their will for detente by consistently honouring the commitments they entered into at Helsinki.94.	Of special significance for detente is the relationship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic  since the border between East and West divides Germany. No nation can have a greater interest in detente than the German nation. Our aim is the continuous development of cooperation with the German Democratic Republic.95.	We want to increase the possibilities for Germans on both sides to come to one another. Detente must be perceivable and tangible to the people in exercising their rights and in their daily lives. The German nation is divided against its will. But history has not spoken the last word yet. It remains the declared aim of our policy to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German people can regain their unity in free self- determination.96.	The switches for historical development have been thrown: for the realization of the right of self- determination and for peacefully bridging divisions  not deepening and perpetuating them.97.	The symbol of detente in Europe is the city which in the years of the cold war was so often the scene of perilous tensions which affected the whole world: Berlin. The 1971 Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin has been a decisive feature in reducing those tensions. Its strict observance and full application remain the first essential for the progress of detente.98.	Detente is indivisible. It must also prove itself in the East's and the West's relations with the nations of the third world. The East-West conflict must be kept out of the third world. The right of the developing countries to determine their future in their own way must be respected.99.	The Federal Republic of Germany is opposed to any form of hegemonyâwhether it be military  political  economic or ideological. We do not want to force our form of government or social order on anyone. Rather  we want a world order in which all nations choose their way of life in free self-determination. A policy of partnership based on equal rights is the policy for the future.100.	The movement of the non-aligned countries is of great importance to them in asserting their independence and their right of self-determination and hence in securing global stability. That movement will  however  be able to fulfil its task only if  rather than looking back  it recognizes the dangers which threaten independence and non-alignment today.101. In his speech at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Havana early this month  President Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania said:' 'The non-aligned movement must remain itselfâa group of countries which are proudly independent  which stand for justice and equality between men and between nations  and which refuse to ally themselves with any power bloc or major world Power.""If the movement of non-aligned countries adheres to that principle it will remain a powerful force for peace  stability and progress in the world. Anyone who wants to make that movement the so-called natural ally of the socialist camp is trying to lead it into a new dependence  to paralyse it and ultimately to deprive it of the basis for its actions.102.	Respect for the right of self-determination of nations also means respect for their cultural identity  respect for the right of every nation to go its own way. We agree with the nations of the third world that do not see modernization as the blind adoption of foreign models but as the expression of their own character in the conditions of our time.103.	Mankind needs diversity of cultures if its creative energies are not to peter out. We break a lance for the free exchange of ideas and information based on mutual respect and tolerance. We must promote this exchange and at the same time develop the ability of the third world to play an equal part in it.104.	To be able to safeguard peace one has to settle conflicts by negotiation and the fair reconciliation of interests. I wish to single out the three conflicts which feature prominently in the General Assembly debates: those in the Middle East  southern Africa and IndoChina.105.	In spite of all the efforts that have been made  peace has still not been achieved in the Middle East. The treaty between Egypt and Israel  has aroused hopes of a comprehensive peace settlement after 30 years of seemingly insurmountable hostility; but we know that there is still a hard road ahead and that many serious obstacles have to be cleared away before Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) can be implemented comprehensively and globally.106.	The tragic situation in Lebanon also remains a source of great concern. The efforts by the constitutional authorities in Lebanon to preserve the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of their country deserve the support of us all.107.	The Middle East is a region which has always been closely linked with Europe in many fields. Peace in that region is our peace  and vice versa. Together with our partners in the European Community  we have on several occasions  especially in the statement by the European Council on 29 June 1977  set out the principles for a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The Irish Foreign Minister explained and reaffirmed those principles on behalf of the nine countries the day before yesterday.108.	The nations of the world are becoming increasingly aware that without the inclusion of the Palestinian people in a comprehensive settlement there will be no lasting peace in the region.109.	In the view of the Federal Republic of Germany  Israel's right to live within secure and recognized boundaries  like the other States in the region  is unassailable. The recognition of this right  as well as of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  by all concerned is necessary for a comprehensive  just and lasting peace settlement. We called for the realization of the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people as early as 1974 during the debate on the question of Palestine in this forum.110.	In southern Africa  only the removal of the remnants of colonialism and apartheid can bring peace to Namibia  Zimbabwe and the Republic of South Africa.111.	In Namibia and Zimbabwe  a new approach is being made to the problem of ensuring a peaceful transition to independence. We are actively involved in the Namibia initiative of the five Western States.112.	We welcome the new British initiatives to find a solution to the Zimbabwe problem with the agreement of all concerned; and we hope that the efforts of all participants in the London negotiations will at long last give the people of Zimbabwe the peace they long for.113.	These efforts should not be disrupted by any side. The sooner the Republic of South Africa decides to take the necessary steps for the total elimination of all racial barriers the sooner will it be possible to enable people of all colours to live together in peace.114.	The situation in lndo-China is a threat to peace and stability in South East Asia; it can become a threat to world peace.115.	In Cambodia  peace can be restored only on the basis of that country's independence. That nation  which has undergone such a terrible test  needs a Government which expresses its will and which is recognized by all countries in the region. Neither the murderous Pol Pot regime nor the Heng Samrin regime installed by foreign forces meets this requirement. But the starving people of Cambodia cannot wait until a political solution has been found. They need help at once. The parties to the conflict must make it possible for that help to reach the people in all parts of Cambodia. No more time should be lost  since it is literally a question of a nation's survival.116.	The misery of the refugees from Viet Nam poses yet another humanitarian challenge. Hundreds of thousands of desperate people have left their homeland. ""Boat people"" has become a new  horrifying phrase in the international vocabulary. The Federal Republic of Germany is doing all it can to help the Vietnamese refugees. Although we are a densely populated country  we are offering many of them a new home. We also support the programmes introduced by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the benefit of the refugees in South-East Asia. But  here again  it is necessaryâover and above the humanitarian aidâto get to the root of the problem. The freedom to leave one's own country is a human right; but it is equally a human right to be allowed to stay in one's native country.117.	Starvation and distress still prevail in many parts of the globe  but the nations of the world are expending resources in excess of $400 billion a year for military purposes. The community of nations is called upon to make every effort to stop the armament spiral. The arms build-up is a threat to peace  it hampers development and it impairs the ability to provide development aid.118.	The Federal Republic of Germany welcomes the fact that  with the resolutions adopted at the tenth special session of the General Assembly in 1978  the United Nations has intensified its efforts to achieve disarmament. In a world in which hegemonic aspirations remain unchecked  every country must inevitably be at pains to maintain its security. The Western Alliance is resolved to do so  but it is doing no more than is necessary for the defence of its members. The Federal Republic of Germany is not a nuclear-weapon State  nor does it want to be. Nobody should underestimate the security interests of others.119.	It is therefore essential for the safeguarding of world peace that nations should seek security  not in military supremacy  but in balance. Supremacy creates insecurity. Together with our partners in the Western defence alliance  we want to achieve such a balance  a balance at a lower level of armaments. That is the object of the Vienna negotiations on mutual and balanced force reductions in Europe. Their purpose is to establish an approximate parity of ground forces on both sides in central Europe.120.	The participants in the negotiations in Vienna should now consider what agreements will be possible in the foreseeable future on the basis of reliable data. The agreement reached as a result of the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] likewise derives from the concept of parity. The Federal Republic of Germany welcomes that agreement and hopes that it will soon enter into force. It is a major contribution to stability. It is  moreover  an important prerequisite for progress in other areas of arms control and disarmament. It is also of major significance for the progress of detente.121.	In the context of the third round of SALT  there will also have to be negotiations on strategic medium- range ballistic missiles in Europe. Arms control and disarmament presuppose mutual trust. In Europe  the Final Act of Helsinki envisages confidence-building measures. One of the main tasks of the follow-up conference to be held in Madrid in 1980 must be to consolidate and further develop such measures. This is another reason why the Federal Republic of Germany considers that that conference should take place at the political level.122.	We support the initiative of France for a conference on disarmament throughout Europe  which in the initial phase would concentrate on the conclusion of agreements to strengthen confidence.123.	Confidence-building measures could also make for greater stability in other regions and make it easier to predict military and political conduct. We have  therefore  together with other countries  submitted a working paper entitled ""Elements of a comprehensive programme of disarmament "" which is designed to generate incentives for such measures. We hope that this session of the General Assembly will achieve further progress on the basis of that resolution.124.	This year three major conferences have taken place in the context of the North-South dialogue: the fifth session of UNCTAD  the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development  and the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development . These conferences have brought progress and opened up new areas for the continuing negotiations.125.	It is  however  evident that the two sides have so far not really taken full advantage of the opportunity afforded by the North-South dialogue. The developing countries have proposed a global dialogue in the United Nations.126.	We shall do everything in our power to ensure that this dialogue is structured in such a way that concrete results can be achieved within the foreseeable future.127.	All concerned must negotiate in a new spirit and at long last recognize that in the North-South dialogue it is not a case of one side gaining and the other losing.128.	Our common aim is to make accelerated progress in the developing countries and stable growth in the industrial countries possible again. But to achieve this  the industrial and the developing countries will jointly have to define which policy each side should pursue in order to reach this goal.129.	A key issue is energy. The United States Secretary of State has rightly emphasized this. The challenge confronting us all is how to lead the world smoothly from the age of oil into an era of renewable sources of energy. This can only be achieved through the closest possible co-operation in a spirit of common responsibility. The Federal Republic of Germany  therefore  supports the idea of a world-wide  long-term energy dialogue.130.	The oil-importing developing countries  whose oil requirements grow much more rapidly than those of the industrial countries  have the biggest problems. They must devote all their efforts to the development of their own sources of energy. The Federal Republic of Germany will increase its assistance to that end. We attach great importance to the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy scheduled for 1981.131.	In order to accelerate development  the exports of the developing countries must be increased. The industrial countries will therefore have to resist the pressure of protectionist forces and keep their markets open for increasing exports  especially of manufactures  from the developing countries. This also applies to the Communist industrial countries. Up to now these countries have absorbed less than 3 percent of the exports of the third world  while the industrial democracies account for nearly 75 per cent.132.	The Federal Republic of Germany advocates better access to markets. It is committed to the aim of restructuring the traditional patterns of trade within which the developing countries primarily supply commodities and the industrial countries supply manufactures 133.	Accelerated development requires an increase in the transfer of capital. In the case of developing countries with low incomes  it will above all be necessary to increase official aid. The Federal Republic of Germany will in the three years ahead increase the growth rate of its aid twice as fast as that of the national budget.134.	The main concern of middle-income developing countries is the transfer of private capital. These countries already meet well over two thirds of their external financial requirements from private sources. Direct private investment features prominently in private capital transfers. In order to promote such investment  two conditions will have to be fulfilled: the developing countries must have the assurance that such investment will dovetail organically with their development and that it will not be associated with any attempts to gain political influence. The investors  on the other hand  need legal security.135.	Of major significance is the need to secure a fair balance of interests in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea which will permit us to exploit the great economic possibilities of the oceans for development and growth. This concerns the utilization of two thirds of the earth's surface. A settlement giving fair consideration to all interests is above all necessary for sea-bed mining. It must give all States and enterprises access to the raw material deposits on the ocean floor and  at the same time  establish legal security without which the necessary long-term and large- scale investment will not be possible.136.	However essential it may be that the industrial and the developing countries establish on their joint responsibility the global economic conditions for faster development and stable growth  we must all remain aware that this does not in any way diminish the importance of national economic and development policies. The industrial countries must bring inflation under control. They must conserve energy. They must economize on all raw materials and prevent waste. And they must master the structural change ensuing from the world economy and technological progress. All this requires painful adjustment processes  and we are aware of that.137.	Adjustments will also have to be made by the countries of the third world. New development strategies are necessary so that the masses of the poor can be brought into the development process. In the developing countries  too  it is necessary to prevent a division of the economy and society into a modern  prospering sector and a traditionally stagnating sector. It is a question of creating development strategies designed to achieve growth not merely through capital-intensive investment  but also  and to a far greater extent than hitherto  by mobilizing human labour. The task is to give the millions of underemployed and unemployed the ability and the chance to use their energies for productive employment and self-fulfilment.138.	Such a strategy requires in most developing countries the development of an efficient agriculture. A rapidly growing agriculture will in this process  owing to the demand for fertilizer  agricultural machinery and mass-produced consumer goods  become at the same time a driving force of industrialization.139.	Instead of industrial enclaves there must be industrialization that forms an integral part of the economy of each of the developing countries concerned and at the same time helps those countries to improve their export capability on a broad basis.140.	Only the development of agriculture can avert the threatening food crisis in the third-world countries and free them from the need to import food. This is the only way in which the unemployment problem can be kept within tolerable limits. Finally  only a strategy that links growth and social justice can prevent development from slipping into social unrest and internal chaos.141.	One acute problem is the alarming increase in the number of executions in the world  many of them with a political background. The death penalty should be limited and ultimately abolished  as it was in my own country over 30 years ago  after the bitter experience of history. The next session of the General Assembly should debate the death penalty as a matter of priority.142.	Thirty years ago the General Assembly proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the common standard of achievement for all nations. That standard  more than any other  indicates how distant our goal remains. Human rights have still not been realized world-wideâneither the civil and political rights nor the social  economic and cultural rights.143.	In the United Nations we have created procedures and institutions with the help of which we can actively promote the realization of human rights. These procedures are still weak. None the less  combined with the moral pressure of world opinion  they have already induced many countries to bring about improvements.144.	We must strengthen and develop the institutions of the United Nations for the protection of human rights. Although many misgivings are still expressed about the establishment of a United Nations court of human rights  I am convinced that in the long run it will be generally realized that such a court would be meant solely to safeguard human rights and would not be directed against any country.145.	International terrorism is a challenge to us all. Only by joint action shall we be able to overcome it.146.	Effective measures against the taking of hostages are among the indispensable instruments for the protection of human rights. It was this consideration that prompted me three years ago to propose to the Assembly a convention against the taking of hostages.  That proposal met with support from the General Assembly. We are now all gratified that the Ad Hoc Committee appointed to elaborate a convention has completed its draft. I hope that this session of the General Assembly will adopt it.147.	The future of the world has its beginning in man's consciousness  a consciousness that is today imbued with belief in the inalienable rights of the individual and the right of nations to self-determination. The will of the individual and the will of nations to assert those rights are the prime movers of our time. It is not possible to halt them  not even by force. In this certainty  the aim must be to work with determination and by peaceful means for the world-wide assertion of human rights and the right of self-determination.148.	All men must be enabled to live in peace  free from fear  free from hunger  and free from want."
"37",1878,"DJI",34,1979,"ï»¿I should like  Sir  on behalf of my people  my Government and my President  Hajji Hassan Gouled Aptidon  to congratulate you most sincerely upon your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Because of your personal qualities  your long experience and your wisdom  I am convinced that you will successfully discharge the onerous tasks that have been entrusted to you. In appointing you to this important function  the States represented here have paid a unanimous tribute to your people and to your country for the important role it is playing on both the African scene and the international scene under the wise and enlightened leadership of President Julius Nyerere. I can assure you that my delegation will always be ready to give you its unconditional support and active co-operation.2.	I should like to express my gratitude and admiration to your predecessor  Mr. Lievano of Colombia  who directed the work of the thirty-third session with dedication and political skill.3.	It is also a great pleasure for me to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his outstanding competence in managing the affairs of our Organization  for his dedication and for his constant and tireless endeavours in defending the goals and fundamental principles for which our Organization was founded in order to promote peace and understanding among nations.4.	The delegation of Djibouti is also happy to congratulate the State of Saint Lucia upon its accession to independence and we warmly welcome its admission to the United Nations family. We wish Saint Lucia every success.5.	A few days ago Africa lost one of its sons. We wish to express our deep sorrow and profound sadness upon the untimely death of our brother  Agostinho Neto. His loyalty to his people in their struggle for independence  his unceasing battle against imperialism for the liberation of Africa and his qualities as a statesman have earned him the recognition and respect of all peoples  and those of Africa in particular. I should like to express our profound condolences to his dear family  his Government and his people.6.	As we begin this thirty-fourth year  we are once again gathered here in order to seek solutions to the many questions which continue to confront the conscience of the world with all their political  economic and social complexities. The international community could not have chosen a better place than the United Nations  where the combined efforts of countries may be exerted in order to improve man's conditions as he seeks to fulfil his potential.7.	Aware of its responsibilities and of the increasing anxieties that weigh upon the world  my country firmly supports the noble principles of the United Nations Charter. In this respect  my country is anxious to offer its co-operation and to make its modest contribution to the international effort aimed at bringing nations closer together in a world of peace and justice and at promoting co-operation based upon mutual respect and the principles of interdependence in equality and dignity.8.	With respect to the non-aligned movement  my country has since its independence joined in the defence of the principles and objectives of that movement. The work of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which met at Havana from 3 to 9 September  demonstrated to the world that the member countries  in spite of their differences  have decided to preserve their unity. We fully support the movement's initiatives aimed at establishing a new international economic order.9.	The commitment of my Government to follow the objectives of national unity  equality and peace  strengthened by our will to remain neutral in our foreign relations  is a corner-stone of our policy  not only in order to maintain and preserve our sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence  but also to make more harmonious our hard-won independence in a genuine spirit of co-operation and understanding with all nations. The young Republic of Djibouti has firmly decided to build the foundations of its economic development.10.	In acceding to international sovereignty on 27 June 1977  my country found itself confronted by various economic and financial difficulties  including  among others  the serious reduction in harbour and rail activities  our principal source of revenue. Apart from those difficulties  my country is particularly affected by the rapid increase in the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods.11.	The trade situation has deteriorated especially since Djibouti does not export any goods  which further aggravates our trade-balance deficit. Indeed  we import most  if not all  of our needs. This economic dependence on foreign countries  coupled with the rising cost of transportation  places us in a difficult position and slows down our economic development. I do not wish to dwell on these points  but my country would like to be included in the list of the least developed countries  in view of its difficulties. My country is very appreciative of the support  both material and moral  that it has received from friendly countries since its independence. We should like to express our profound gratitude and appreciation for that help.12.	One can only view the question of respect for human rights with bitterness and disappointment since these rights are not being respected in most countries. Our world  unfortunately  has not yet rid itself of this evil  which runs counter to the principle of respect for man. The essence of respect for human rights means that each person should enjoy political'  social  economic and religious rights as a free person. It is for that purpose that the advocates of human rights should work  instead of for political or propaganda purposes. The right of people to fight for their most fundamental needs  to fight against ignorance  disease  the domination and exploitation of human beings  both abroad and at home  the pursuit of justice against racism  racial discrimination and apartheid must be a source of inspiration  respect and attention. Greater priority should be accorded to morality and to the exercise of moderation by all political figures. It is high time that all those who support peace heeded the appeal for help from the millions of victims who are living in abject poverty  the tens of millions of homeless refugees  the human beings in distress but receiving no help in Palestine  Lebanon  southern Africa  South-East Asia  the Horn of Africa and Latin America  before it is too late.13.	How can we explain that virtually one third of the world's population suffers from famine  abject poverty and total wretchedness  crying out for help while some nations display their supremacy and power by spending billions of dollars on military prestige  thus accumulating an arsenal of armaments? How is it possible to explain this fact while the whole world is seeking peace and security?14.	We find that some of us are bent on manufacturing and accumulating mountains of dangerous weapons  which are then sold to the countries of the third world. As a result our already limited resources are exhausted  our courage weakened and our unity shattered. In this unhappy state of affairs  the advantage always lies with those who manufacture these weapons.15.	My country is proud to have directed its national policy towards providing for the well-being of everyone  within the limits and abilities of its resources  by protecting the fundamental social  economic  political and religious rights of all. It is by this sense of duty and by its contribution to the world action on human rights that the Republic of Djibouti  a land of exchanges and encounters  has legitimately assumed its part of international responsibility by offering hospitality to 30 000 refugeesâbetween 10 and 15 per cent of its populationâwith whom it willingly shared its resources  though these may be limited  and this is done without any regret and in dignity. On this occasion  I should like to thank the countries and organizations which have given us their assistance and support. But in view of the economic difficulties which my country is experiencing and in the light of the increasing number of refugees  we wish to make a vigorous appeal to the international community to seek a final solution to this humanitarian problem.16.	The Palestinian Diaspora has been a source of suffering for too long. The Palestinian is a man equal to any other. He has the right to a homeland. How can it be possible to settle this conflict or how is it possible to claim to have achieved a peaceful solution of the Middle East problem if this man  this Palestinian who is suffering  is ignored? Peace will come to the Middle East only if the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people are fulfilled and if the Palestinian people find their land and their home again.17.	The separate agreements between Egypt and Israel have been condemned by all the Arab countries because no peace is possible without the participation of the Palestinian people and their sole valid representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]. On numerous occasions  the international community has condemned the illegal occupation of occupied Arab territories. It must require Israel to withdraw from all these territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  which must be surrendered unconditionally to Arab sovereignty. But since Israel  it would seem  possesses nuclear weapons  it is time for the Security Council to adopt a decision along these lines; it is time for world consensus to be translated into action.18.	The problem of Lebanon cannot be isolated from the Middle East crisis. Continued acts of aggression by Israeli forces  the increase in the number of atrocities in southern Lebanon  the violent bombings and the heavy losses as a result of the infiltration of Israeli forces are all acts which flagrantly violate the United Nations Charter. It is disturbing to note that the international community  which is in favour of peace  remains passive before these gratuitous and deadly acts of aggression. It is therefore our duty to support our brothers  the people of Lebanon  in their struggle to defend their sovereignty and their national integrity.19.	The policy of my Government has always been opposed to any form of racism  racial discrimination and apartheid. In this respect  it is with all our hearts that we give our support to the measures adopted by the United Nations to eliminate these evils. The international community should not lose its momentum in the moral and material support it gives to the objectives of the Declaration and Programme of Action to combat racism and racial discrimination adopted in 1978.' It is with satisfaction that we observe that these efforts have been crowned with success in some regions  where aggression has been resoundingly defeated. It is indeed satisfying to note that  through concerted efforts  the forces in favour of peace that are fighting for self- determination and national independence will always be victorious.20.	The present situation in southern Africa has become for us all a source of concern and a disgrace to mankind. My Government has constantly denounced and condemned the policy of apartheid and of bantustanization  which is nothing other than a hideous attempt on the part of the South African regime to perpetuate its racist policy. The resolutions approved by the States Members of the United Nations for the purpose of imposing economic sanctions against South Africa have turned out to be ineffective  especially since several Member States are violating those resolutions for selfish reasons and do not live up to their commitments.21.	The States Members of the United Nations which are in favour of peace should under no circumstances hesitate to exercise pressure on these racists. It is high time for the United Nations to consider more effective methods to weaken and wipe out the odious system of apartheid.22.	My Government condemns and declares null and void the South African minority regime's unilateral decision to set up elections in Namibia from 4 to 8 December 1978 in violation and in disregard of Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 439 (1978)  and its rejection of the Secretary-General's proposal to organize elections supervised and controlled by the United Nations.2 The constant South African defiance of world public opinion  by refusing to give to the Namibians their legitimate right to self-determination  is an act which constitutes a serious threat to world peace and security . My Government deplores and condemns the acts of violence perpetrated by South Africa against the Namibian people  and its policy of intimidation as well as the arbitrary detention of the leaders of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. In order to be valid  any and every agreement must take into account all the conditions proposed by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] with regard to the decolonization of Namibia. These are: respect for territorial integrity  the liberation of all political prisoners  the return of all Namibians in exile  the withdrawal of all South African forces from the Territory  the recognition of SWAPO as the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia  and the holding of free elections under United Nations control.23.	In Zimbabwe  the freedom fighters are engaged in a bitter war against the forces of domination and exploitation. The blocking of the transition and the transfer of power from the illegal and rebellious regime of Ian Smith to the puppet Government of Bishop Muzorewa was nothing more than a disguised and deliberate plan by the white minority  whose principal purpose was to divert world public opinion in order to perpetrate its supremacy over the overwhelming African majority.24.	We do not see any prospect of success as long as the racists occupy more than a quarter of the seats in Parliament and retain control of the political machinery of power. Any proposal for constitutional changes in Zimbabwe must be designed to reduce the power of the white minority by bringing it to a proportionate level  which would result in a transfer of control to the hands of the people of Zimbabwe.25.	In conformity with the resolutions of the OAU  we invite all States not to recognize the Government of Abel Muzorewa  and to refuse him any material or moral support. The overwhelming majority of African States  which has identified itself with the struggle for liberation and human rights in southern Africa  is opposed to such recognition. That majority is also opposed to any peace solution in Zimbabwe which does not include the full participation of the Patriotic Front. It is indeed regrettable that the unfortunate retention of Ian Smith as a minister  the state of martial law covering most of the country  the ill-treatment inflicted on hundreds of political prisoners  and the opposition to a genuinely democratic rule by the majority constitute serious factors blocking the way to a peaceful solution.26.	As regards the question of Western Sahara  my Government reaffirms its position: the Saharan people have the right to express their opinion and their will in the exercise of their right of self-determination. We commend the Republic of Mauritania for its wise decision in the pursuit of peace in the region. We believe that an effort towards relaxation of the present tension in the region  in the quest for peace  is an act of wisdom. All the parties concerned should respect the resolutions of the OAU and of the United Nations.27.	In conclusion I should like to say that we come here every year with the firm intention of participating in the efforts of this Assembly in order to find solutions to the numerous problems which preoccupy the entire world. It is in this spirit that we are gathered here in order to listen and exchange views in the hope of taking a step ahead in relation to last year. This is an encouraging start towards a goal which has yet to be reached. Thus  the latent desire to find the means of bringing about global peace and security should manifest itself in harmony here in this Assembly. Let us join our efforts for the fulfilment of our aspirations."
"38",1907,"DMA",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  the Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and to wish you well in your new office. That you were elected to that office by this body is ample evidence of the Assembly's faith in your capacity to live up to the high expectation of that responsibility. The commonwealth of Dominica also salutes the United Republic of Tanzania for producing so able a diplomat.3.	The Commonwealth of Dominica also congratulates the Secretary-General for a comprehensive and instructive report on the work of the United Nations over the past year. The report gives us confidence that there is some hope for the continuation of the fine work that the United Nations has been undertaking and for the continued projection of the spirit of peace and security and brotherhood that inspired its foundation. We note that the report also very realistically lets it be known that all is not so well in many areas of the Organization's endeavours  one of those being the area of peace-keeping. It is to be hoped that each of us will examine his conscience in respect of the principles of the Charter and by so doing reaffirm our commitment and allegiance to those principles.4.	The Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to congratulate our sister State  Saint Lucia  which became the one hundred fifty-second Member of the Organization during this current session of the General Assembly  and we look forward to welcoming the State of Saint Vincent in the not-too-distant future. We are confident that we shall find it easy to work with every Member of the Organization. We wish also to thank all those Members which have promoted and greeted our admission to the United Nations and which have promoted and defended our interests in that forum.5.	It is said that what is obvious and well-known bears purposeful repeating at certain times and in certain places. Hence  permit me to observe with emphasis that the Commonwealth of Dominica is a small country. I am pleased to be reminded of the saying  too  that good things come in small packages. We trust that the representation here of our country will be a shining example of the tradition of this Organization and of the international community as a whole  and that  further  this bears testimony to the fundamental rights of all free and independent nations  irrespective of size  to participate and contribute in the deliberations of this Assembly.6.	The emergence on the world scene of a large number of small States or mini-States  particularly in the Caribbean  is one of the phenomena of the second half of the twentieth century. But while the world community has recognized this phenomenon  yet very little has been done in concrete terms to come to grips with the very real problemsâsuch as a lack of economic viability and an undue dependence on metropolitan Powersâconfronting these States. Note is taken with much concern of the threatened confrontation of two of the world's super-Powers on the very doorsteps of the Caribbean archipelago. The implications of this can be very far-reaching  especially in terms of the future development of our countries and the stability of this region as a whole  and therefore we hope for an early resolution of this situation in the best interest of the Caribbean basin.7.	It is well known that the Commonwealth of Dominica became a legally  politically independent and sovereign State on 3 November 1978  which is less than a year ago. The chequered constitutional  social and political history of our State up to that date makes for some interesting reading. However  we are aware that many other States Members of the United Nations are not familiar with that history in its intimate details. Our country is a Caribbean State  situated at longitude 61 degrees west and latitude 15 degrees north. It is only 289.5 square miles in area and has a population of approximately 80 000. It lies between the two departments of the Republic of FranceâGuadeloupe  which is some 30 miles to the north  and Martinique  which is some 30 miles to the south. This geographical proximity has resulted in an ongoing and dynamic cultural closeness which is reflected in the fact that a large number of Dominicans still speak a French patois.8.	The basically export-oriented agricultural economy of our country has rested mainly on bananas  which constitute about 60 per cent of our exports and 80 per cent of foreign-exchange earnings  and a small quantity of citrus and coconuts. Our tourist industry has been slowly getting off the ground  but this trend has now been tragically reversed  as has so much else in Dominica  since the onslaught of Hurricane David on 29 August 1979.9.	The story of third-world countries can be a fascinating and painful drama  but ours would certainly be in the running for first place if there were prizes to be awarded. Towards the latter part of 1978 and during the early part of 1979  the dreadful leaf-spot disease wreaked havoc with the banana industry of the Commonwealth of Dominica. The self-evident story of the implications of such an occurrence for an economy whose efforts are based mainly on the tourist industry and  of course  on agriculture is  in fact  too difficult to go into in detail. The impact may be grasped  however  if we say simply that the banana industry  which is largely labour-intensive in the Commonwealth of Dominica and which employed several thousands of persons  was responsible for the bulk of our exports and foreign-exchange earnings  as has already been noted. This has linkages and interfacings that permeate the economy as a whole and  consequently  the life and livelihood of the entire population. The leaf-spot disease and the disaster were hardly over when the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica embarked upon a 24-day constitutional and democratic struggle to replace without violence and within the framework of their independence Constitution  a Government that they considered high-handed and dictatorial. There was a high economic price to pay for the 24 days during which the popular struggle lasted; but the unprecedented constitutional end to the struggle  which resulted in victory for the people and the preservation of democracy  the integrity of the Constitution and respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica  have lessons for States Members of the United Nations and  indeed  for all who are genuinely interested in the preservation of democratic constitutions and in the universal struggle for the preservation of the fundamental rights and freedoms and the downtrodden at home and abroad.10.	The Commonwealth of Dominica had not recovered from the shock and rigours of that struggle when a completely unexpected and deadly stroke by the forces of nature wreaked havoc with the economy  infrastructure and other aspects of life in my country.11.	The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization makes interesting  but not really surprising  reading in most respects. The remarks contained therein with respect to the political and economic state of the international community  though largely dismal from the immediate point of view of the less developed countries of the world  is a good barometer of the state of the human spirit in an age when there is so much talk  so much discussion and so much journalistic fulmination about human rights and a corollary  the New International Economic Orderâa good indicator  indeed  of the sincerity of an unproductive North-South dialogue.12.	Dominica  along with other Caribbean States  continues to deplore the apartheid policy of South Africa. That foolhardy policy must fail in time. The dynamics of international exchange and intercourse dictate this. Our own experience has taught us  quite recently  that a suffering and deprived people will always revolt against their oppressors. What is to be hoped is that it will not be too long before the abomination called apartheid is ended and that the price for ending it will not be too costly in terms of human life. In the meantime  those countries which continue to bolster  directly or indirectly  the racist  inhuman system for economic and other reasons  in violation of United Nations sanctions and of conscience  good faith and human decency  must be severely condemned. It is only by the imposition and meticulous observation of the severest sanctions against the evil system of human degradation and exploitationâbe such sanctions imposed by individual nations or by the international communityâthat the system will be brought to heel. All countries whose disposition and persuasion in this matter are similar to ours come in for the highest commendation from the Government and entire people of the Commonwealth of Dominica.13.	We think  perhaps from the point of view of a country not long since cast into the arena of international politics  that the answer to the underlying theme of continuing disturbances in the Middle East lies in the recognition and implementation of the rights of all peoples of the area to a secure homeland which can be enjoyed with dignity. Unless this basic principle is observed and pursued with vigour  with a view to genuine realization  the situation in the Middle East will continue to deteriorate  with increased adverse consequences for the international community.14.	We in the Caribbean do not wish to see the region become a pawn in the international power play. The Commonwealth of Dominica believes in the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of independent  sovereign States. We also believe in the concomitant sovereign right of independent States to choose their allies. It is for this reason that we express reservation about uninvited interference in any form in the internal affairs of other independent States.15.	Mr. President  my Government is fully aware of your record as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  and being fully cognizant of the imperative nature of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960  we wish to recommend that member States  and the Special Committee on decolonization  should keep a keen eye on the Powers which  by subtle means and by use of euphemistic terminology  perpetuate the process and system of colonization in its old form and in new forms either by economic or ideological means. The Commonwealth of Dominica is further aware that there are many territories and peoples which are still labouring under the yoke of colonialism  which want political independence and an opportunity for self-determination  and whose wishes are being balked in one way or another. To resist submission to the wishes  the will and the determination of such peoples is to court disaster. By the same token it ought to be a moral and human obligation  spelled out in international law  that a colonizing  metropolitan Power  should adequately prepare those colonized to face independence  and that such preparation should not be an excuse for the perpetuation and prolongation of colonial status. Such preparation should also include at least the provision of a sufficiently basic and sound infrastructure. A colonized  enslaved people can never be compensated for the material  physical  social  cultural and resource exploitation which colonization represents  but at least this would enable them to ""take off over a reasonable period. In that regard  the Commonwealth of Dominica certainly would be hypocritical if it claimed to be a blessed  uncomplaining beneficiary of any largesse on the part of the United Kingdom. Indeed  even to this day  we cannot claim to have had great  if indeed any  success in gaining access to a token independence gift offered by that country. If the reason for such failure is attributable to the Commonwealth of Dominica  as some would suggest  that is  nevertheless  a strident indictment of colonialism.16.	The literature on international economic issues is of old and also of current vintage  voluminous and increasing  and the verbal debate and recrimination continues almost ad infinitum. As we all know  the stark fact is that the rich and advantaged  generally  are getting better off  while the poor and disadvantaged  at east in numerical terms  are getting worse off. Now  to the delight of some  we have coined a new escapist phrase: 'New International Economic Order"". That there is need now  and that there was need before  of such an order is beyond question. What appear to have always been at issue and in question is the will and the determination to institute that Order.17.	The Commonwealth of Dominica is mindful of the whole range of important domestic and international factors that can militate against the speedy realization of the much-needed tilting of the inequitable international economic balance. We find it difficult to accept the short-sighted psychology that perpetuates the use of those plausible factors as a means of continuing and reinforcing an economic system that is unquestionably both unjust and exploitative  explosive and ultimately self-destructive.18.	To complicate matters  the world is faced with an energy crisis which we seem unable to solve. Again  I must emphasize the Commonwealth of Dominica's understanding of the domestic and international imperatives and 4'polities'* that complicate the problem of oil. For example  we understand the need in some quarters to make good the losses suffered as a result of exploitation  and we also understand the counter reaction not to allow former colonies to use oil as a weapon or for blackmail. What we  like the Secretary-General  find difficult to accept is the forced and artificial divorce of the energy issue from the rest of the international economic issues. We are not impressed because we are sceptical about the ultimate consequences of that divorce on the economies of ""innocent"" countries and the lives of millions of ordinary citizens of the world. That is why we think that the advice of the Secretary- General in his report on the Organization bears repeating:""We need to organize our efforts to bring the negotiations on the implementation of the new international economic order out of their present state of stalemate;We need to deal vigorously with the area of energy  which is a major challenge  and to launch a co-ordinated and imaginative effort by the world community in this field;""We need to address the urgent problems of the oil-importing developing countries in a concerted and effective way."" 19.  From the foregoing views on international politics and the economic scene  I wish to revert to the situation at home.20.	I should like to present in some detail the devastation which was wreaked by Hurricane David. If there is one disaster that appears to have brought international attention to the Commonwealth of Dominica  it is this catastrophe. That is not surprising. The hurricane was the worst in 100 years  bringing winds of up to 175 miles an hour. It changed course and headed for Dominica quite unexpectedly and nearly unpredictably. Before the hurricane  the economy of the Commonwealth of Dominica  like that of the rest of the Caribbean was an open economyâimports equalled about 70 per cent of the gross domestic product. It was predominantly based on agriculture and it was monopolized by bananas  which accounted for approximately 80 per cent of our foreign-exchange earnings  Added to this was the susceptibility of that crop to external fluctuations in prices and the vagaries of nature  uncontrollable by the Dominican producers.21.	During the past few years  the island faced continued balance-of-payments deficits. The economy grew during the 1960s but underwent prolonged contraction during this decade  with a real annual growth in its gross domestic product of 3.5 per cent  concurrent with population growth of 1.6 per cent and aggravated by decline in banana output and per capita income at an average annual rate of 6 per cent. In addition to a fall in the gross domestic product by 12 per cent by 1974  the economy faced severe problems.22.	At this time the oil crisis reared its head and sent prices and production costs catapulting. Fertilizer price rises outstripped increases in farm gate prices  agricultural exports fell by 15 per cent  manufacturing stagnated with the closing down of pumice and timber industries in 1975 and tourism fell  owing to world recession and bad publicity for the island. The trade account contracted  with real imports falling by 30 per cent and exports by 10 per cent. Imports of machinery and manufactured goods fell by 50 per cent  reflecting a stagnation of investment and a reduction in local consumption. The Government was unable to eliminate continuous current deficits  despite the imposition of successively higher taxes. Revenues could not be maintained in real terms  and the economy declined throughout the period  reducing the potential revenue base. Budgetary grants  together with commercial bank credit and financing by the social security fund  were insufficient to cover growing deficits.23.	By the end of 1977  the situation had worsened. A six-week strike by the civil service in September 1977 paralysed the economy. The severing of air and sea links put an end to imports for the period. The 1977 current account reflected a deficit of $4.5 million from the emergency assistance programme administered by the Caribbean Development Bank. The finances for 1977-1978 saw further deterioration with the settlement of the civil servants' strike by payment of $5.4 million  which was equal to 27 per cent of the previous yearâs current revenue.24 Further  in 1978 banana production continued to fall with 4 000 acres having to be destroyed during November and December of 1978 owing to the ravages of a disease that caught the industry flat-footed. The only sector of the economy that experienced some success was soap production  which doubled due to the importation of palm-oil. The coconut industry also saw some economic growth owing to the demand for coconuts in Europe and the Caribbean as well as the shortage of vegetable oils and fats on the world market.25.	It was in the light of that bleak situation that the Government  in stating its aims to achieve economic development  saw them as being to improve the quality of life of the rural population to raise the standard of living of the entire population by increasing the level of economic activities  thereby providing greater opportunity for remunerative employment for the people of the country  to meet the nutritional requirements of the population  and to provide greater economic flexibility by the diversification of agriculture. Up to 29 August of this year every possible avenue had to be exploited to realize those aims.26.	However  Hurricane David made the foregoing sad tale dismal. In the Commonwealth of Dominica  as of 29 August 1979  there were no coconuts  no bananas and hardly any citrus and ground crops. In addition  Hurricane David blew and washed away our already weak infrastructure: our port facilities are almost completely destroyed; we have no hydroelectricity or other electricity; there is no internal telephone communication  and the villages cannot be reached by that means of communication; several of our main and agriculture feeder-roads have been severely damaged or washed away and will not be repaired for a considerable time; nearly every school and other government building has been structurally damaged or destroyed. To date  we are having difficulty instituting the semblance of a resumption of class-room activities  and our school population is consequently adrift  either at home and out of school  or abroad in school away from home.27.	Some 60 000 of our population are at the moment homeless  except for temporary improvised shelters which are not necessarily structurally sound or even healthy; the others who are homeless live in tents and public buildings that had not been blown away or badly damaged. Our already high incidence of joblessness is phenomenally aggravated.28.	In brief  Dominica stands destroyed and in need of all the international assistance it can get. But our spirit and our sense of pride and fair play have not been daunted by the experience. We remain unwilling to allow opportunists to exploit our situation of need for the purpose of making international or regional ideological capital to the ultimate detriment of the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica.29.	And so  the four aims which the Commonwealth of Dominica had set itself have assumed greater paramount urgency and immediacy. We have the greatest faith  a faith that is as clear and unambiguous as far as we are concerned  that the international community will listen to our plea. We therefore make a special appeal in the clearest languageâthe language of the heartâfor over-all assistance in this our hour of suffering and need. The Commonwealth of Dominica is in need of complete reconstruction.30.	We hope that whatever further assistance may be forthcoming in response to the present appeal and as a result of the study of our situation at home undertaken by ECLA âwhose findings we trust will be circulated through this Assembly to Governments throughout the Worldâwill be consistent with the genuine needs of the Commonwealth of Dominica  as signified by our Government. We wish this fact to be generally known and recognized. I have used the expression ""further assistance"" in the fullest awareness  because our boundless gratitude must go to the many Governments and agencies which rushed so quickly to the rescue of our country and people in an effort to provide immediate relief assistance  and to so many others that have made pledges of assistance which  we hope  will materialize as a matter of urgency.31.	I wish to thank publicly all those Governments  organizations and agencies which have assisted or offered to assist. To those which have already assisted  we say we would appreciate any further assistance  if they are in a position to give it. To those who have not yet offered or have not been given an opportunity to make an offer  we say that we are still in need and can do with any assistance compatible with that need. To the United Nations itself and its administration we say  ""sincerest thanks for your expressions of sympathy and your assistance."" We have every confidence that the Organization will continue to make tangible demonstrations of its concern and solicitude.32.	To all we say that the immediate and paramount task that lies ahead for the Commonwealth of Dominica is the over-all reconstruction of our country in the wake of a natural disaster over which man had absolutely no control  despite his technological and sophisticated advances.33.	Reconstruction effort is therefore only primarily Dominica's responsibility; but in a ""global village"" and in the spirit of brotherhood  international peace  stability and co-operation  we hope the international community will not leave it to the Commonwealth of Dominica and Dominicans alone. The Commonwealth of Dominica is down  but not out. We are confident that  by the grace of the Almighty and the help of our friends  we will rebuild our country.34.	We conclude with a reiteration of our congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to that position of grave responsibility and our expression of hope for a fruitful and successful term of office.35.	As a new Member of the United Nations  we wish to let it be known that we stand by the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every nation  large or small. We respect each nation's sovereign right to make its own decisions  and we stipulate the concomitant duty and obligation of other States to respect that decision. A compelling corollary of the principle of territorial integrity is the sovereign right to control ownership by the State of its natural resources. We deprecate any attempt  overt or covert  to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign States. International indications appear to be that the majority of the world's peoples  particularly in the third world  are for equitable international intercourse in the economic and other areas  without pressure to align with one antiquated ideological bloc or the other. The Commonwealth of Dominica identifies with that mood and feels that any attempt from any quarter to counter or reverse it may well be foolhardy at best and disruptive of international peace.36.	I am aware that I have not dealt with any problems which confront our Organization today  and more especially those which are of particular importance to the Commonwealth of Dominica  such as the proposed convention on the law of the sea  and that much time has been taken in bringing to the attention of this body the singular problems of the Commonwealth of Dominica. However  this is not through an oversight  but rather because I am guided by the need to expose to the world community the abject constraints which impede our ability as a recently independent mini-State to stand up to the economic and political winds that are storming throughout the third world.37.	It is our expectation that the constant and ceaseless expressions of good faith and good intention of Member States will now find an available repository in the Commonwealth of Dominica.38.	We look forward to our continued and permanent participation in the affairs of this Organization. We wish to maintain and justify the confidence of all free and recently independent nations that  in our newly found relationships with our former masters and expected brothers in the community of nations  all the resources available to the world will shortly be harnessed for the common good  realizing as we do that equity is the foundation upon which the era of the 1980s will allow for the universal solution of problems that will be resolved through peace  goodwill and solidarity."
"39",1988,"DOM",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  permit me  in these first words  after congratulating you on the assumption of your important office  to express the confidence that we have in your wisdom and exceptional experience in the matters which affect the States which constitute the United Nations. Also permit us to extend  on behalf of the Government of the Dominican Republic  our congratulations and thanks to the General Committee of our Assembly over which you preside for the spontaneous initiative  which does it credit  of including item 125 in the agenda of this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. This item relates to measures for providing assistance to my country and to the Commonwealth of Dominica  a small country which  like our own  was cruelly battered by the fury of the hurricanes of this season of cyclones in the Caribbean.2.	We must admit that this  too  represents a contribution to the peace for which the United Nations is fighting so heroically  a contribution which takes into account in circumstances like these  not only the scourge of war  but also the destructive force of nature. This tragedy  which afflicts the peoples suffering from the results of the hurricanes  inevitably gives rise not only to hunger and destruction  but also to all the upsetting results produced when economies are disrupted and when human suffering reaches such depths that it bears comparison with what happens when war  an apocalyptic figure bent upon uprooting the constitutional instrument of the United Nations  is unleashed.3.	Our country was the victim in less than five days of two cruel hurricanes which spread tragedy  horror and chaos among its inhabitants  who were hoping for a future of peace and labour in a climate of democracy  and when the Dominican Government had already set up action programmes for the economic development of the nation and had been mobilizing all the forces of production  in many scientifically new and revolutionary areas  in order to make the best use of all the resources at our disposal.4.	These adversities have suddenly interrupted and damaged everything we had managed to achieve during the past year.5.	A report by ECLA circulated to the representatives of the States Members of this Organization  reflects the extent of the damage caused in our country by the fury of these hurricanes. For the benefit of all the delegates here present  we should like to draw attention to the assessment contained in that document  which is available to all and which illustrates with reliable accuracy the disastrous situation from which the Dominican people is now suffering.6.	Like Dominica  we are now confronting the unavoidable challenge of having to repair the tremendous damage which we have sustained and which has set back the process of development in which we were so earnestly and zealously engaged  while we continue to perform the difficult task of providing aid to the thousands of victims and survivors who are now in shelters and who are urgently calling for transfer to adequate  permanent housing. Many of them still urgently need medical treatment in order to survive the catastrophe  which has given rise to hunger  poverty and other cruel sufferings.7.	In the calamitous situation through which the Dominican Republic is now passing  because of the devastation and damage caused by the hurricanes which passed through Dominican territory in the months of August and September  causing so much damage to the inhabitants of the country and to private property  we must recognize that this world Organization  its specialized agencies and the regional system  as well as many countries in the region of the Americas and other parts of the world have come to the assistance of our country. That permits us to say that we are not alone in the formidable ordeal which the Dominican nation is experiencing. We should also like to mention  in particular  UNDP  the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordinator [UNDRO]  the World Food Programme and others which took such prompt and efficient action during the very first moments of the emergency.8.	This experience  arising from the destructive force of nature  prompts us to recall that the United Nations has not only done what it is authorized to do in accordance with the constitutional principles by which it is governed  but has even gone beyond its sphere of competence on many occasions  in order to mitigate the effects of critical situations through humanitarian programmes  including assistance in the crises which from time to time afflict the territories of the States concerned.9.	Nevertheless  these events have given the Government of my country an idea which could bring a certain tranquillity and confidence to the islands such as our own  which are at a natural disadvantage  being right in the path of tropical hurricanes and being their first victims. This devastating danger threatens the economic structure of those countries  inevitably  each year  during the period of dangerous weather.10.	The plight of the Antilles archipelago has led us  as we come to this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  to inform the Secretary-General of the proposal of the President of the Dominican Republic  Don Antonio Guzman  whereby  its characteristic spirit of affording protection and assistance to peoples  particularly to its Member States  in its programme for peace  the world Organization should decide to create a permanent specific fund  which would make it possible to render assistance to the islands in the Caribbean in the tragic circumstances which unfortunately seem to recur every year without fail.11.	The Dominican Republic's spirit of international co-operationâwhich prides itself on having been one of the founding Members of this Organization and of the American regional systemâwas highlighted recently in the peace-making efforts which it undertook  together with the Republic of Guatemala and the United States of America  in order to find a solution to the conflict in the Republic of Nicaragua  which was on the point of spreading to other countries. This mission of mediation  carried out on a basis of equality and mutual respect which are essential elements of the law of non-intervention that is constitutionally guaranteed by this Organization as well as by the inter-American legal system  exhausted our utmost efforts in that very difficult task which was throughout inflamed by the emotions aroused by a policy with heavily dynastic overtones.12.	The negotiations to find a constitutional formula which could put an end to the fratricidal war were blocked and  finally  peace had to be imposed by force of arms. Nevertheless  the Dominican Republic does feel satisfaction at having taken the part of a mediator in that conflict in the search for a less distressing solution for the sister Republic of Nicaragua.13.	Moreover  we must recognize that the establishment of Nicaragua's Junta of National Reconstruction has rescued democracy in that territory and we trust that it will be maintained in a lasting fashion. The problem of Nicaragua is one of freedom  the cause for which countries fight that have adjured slavery and condemned it as an anachronistic phenomenon which has no place in present-day civilization.14.	In the same spirit of international co-operation  the Dominican Government supports the world energy plan proposed by Mexico for all the countries of the world  without discrimination  whether or not they produce oil. The objective of that plan would be to provide for a progressive transition  in an orderly and just fashion  from the present historical process towards a new one which would provide many more realistic prospects for the progress of mankind.15.	By speaking of these things  the Dominican Government is performing the duty it has to pursue effective international co-operation  in the conviction that  despite the inherent competence of the Organization of American States [CMS]  there is a constitutional link between our two organizations  the justification for which is the preservation of peace and the prevention of war as a method of solving disputes and conflicts among States.16.	The world Organization  whose creation as a con-sequence of the Second World War is one of the greatest historic events of the century  has not been able to escape criticism  some of it malicious  which branded it as incapable  in spite of the means it possesses  of preventing armed conflicts which have broken out and continue to break out in various parts of the world. Those who make that judgement tend to overlook how difficult it is to maintain peace in a world which has not yet been able to free itself from the material and moral wounds inflicted on man and his ancient race by the two world wars.17.	Nations reflect man's imperfection  and therein lies the root of the evil which will last until the last judgement  but which we might perhaps avoid if  instead of accumulating nuclear weapons  multiple- warhead weapons and guided missies  man is able to redeem himself in the centuries to come from the negative repercussions of his origins. We may rest secure  however  in the fact that our Organization will be able to fulfil thoroughly  within a framework of indisputable realism  all the requirements for it to achieve its fundamental objectives.18.	The not entirely satisfactory events which have occurred since the signing of the Charter 34 years ago have been events which could be described as isolated  directly ascribable to the imperfection of men and nations. We must admit  however  that these accidental and sporadic aberrations have been caused  in large measure  by the very States which founded the Organization. These States are responsible for the controversies and disputes  misunderstandings  lack of international co-operation and  above all  the lack of trust which prevails throughout the greater part of the world.19.	If this state of affairs is acceptable  what is no less acceptable is the fact that it is important to draw up an inventory of these imperfections of the historic process of the world Organization which will demonstrate to us that one of the reasons for its existence is to prevent war and preserve peace. And this is something which has obviously been done  although international tensions  the cold war and geo-politics have succeeded in causing certain erosions in the advantages of peaceful coexistence for the benefit of all peoples who are fighting in the spirit of convictionâor conventionâfor the predominance of peace  and although in certain periods detente has succeeded in bringing about an easing of the anxiety generated by the arms race.20.	Over the past year we have felt that the degree of progress achieved has yielded great relief for situations still awaiting solution which have been dragging on for several years. Many cases of this kind could be cited as examples where in actual fact isolated  armed conflicts have not been able to degenerate into a war of aggression which has extended to such a vast scale as did the First and Second World Wars.21.	I think we would not be mistaken if we were to say  with a feeling of justice  how much more precarious the peace enjoyed by the world would have been if our Organization had not existed. It does have defects  some of them congenital  such as the right of veto  which was essential to the very foundation of the Organization  so much so that it was said at San Francisco that if there had been no right of veto  there would have been no Charter.22.	In recent years we must feel glad at the fact that several conflicts have not broadened into true war situations and that a careful  evolutionary diplomacy has succeeded in freezing these critical situations. Just to mention two examples  let us recall the case of the Middle East and that of Central America  which is so recent in our memories.23.	Nor can we refrain from alluding also to the spirit of Camp David as well as the great and active sense of diplomatic patience displayed by the United Kingdom in its peace-making efforts in the anomalous situations in Africa now on their way towards solutions conducive to political equilibrium at the African summit.24.	On the other hand  in considering the progress made in finalizing the implementation of the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel signed on 26 March 1979  we cannot disregard the aspirations of the Palestinians or fail to respect the solidarity of the Arab nations  which have made such great contributions to the history of civilization. Efforts must continue to be made  however  to find appropriate and honourable formulas for the restoration of peace within secure and permanent frontiers in this area of controversy.25.	A fact of the utmost importance which will go down as a new chapter in the history of the Americas has just been written in Panama City when  pursuant to the agreement between the United States of America and Panama to finalize the status of that inter-oceanic canal which separates the two Americas  one of the fundamental parts of the agreement has been complied with  leading in time to the total exercise of Panamanian sovereignty over this maritime route.26.	This solution is indeed an example of how much can be achieved within the framework of justice and goodwill among States when far-sighted men  united by the most lofty ideals  come to an agreement in their decisions face to face with the challenge of history.27.	In the midst of the tidal waves and storms of international politics  we must also concede that this world Organization has made progress in many areas where international tensions and the cold war have kept today's disturbed world in a state of expectancy. I am referring to the growing progress that is being achieved in the various areas of human rights.28.	The wisdom and good judgement of the Commission on Human Rights  as part of the machinery of the United Nations  should not be overlooked. This assertion would be incomplete if special reference were not made to an event of the utmost importance  affecting as it does human rights in the region of the Americas and coinciding with violent explosions in certain areas where an entire freedom-loving people was plunged into a blood-bath before it succeeded in winning back its freedom. This was indeed the case with Nicaragua  as has also happened in other countries where it has still not been possible to control this evil  which seems to be on the decline at times but at others seems to be causing a new crisis.29.	With these references  we must recognize that the creation of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights  which has its seat in the non-militaristic capital of Costa Rica  completes the evolutionary process of human rights  which had already been initiated by the appropriate commission within the framework of the OAS. And although it is true that it has brought to human rights an institution like that of the Inter- American Court of Human Rights  it is none the less true that the accelerated changes in the political outlook of the Americas require that a new injection of vigorous blood be given in order to adjust to the imperatives of our time in this part of the world.30.	We are sure that many Member States will agree that this is an imperative necessity if they do not wish to see this regional organization languish in semi-statism and decadence.31.	The Court of the regional system is an innovation and an admirable experiment which should lead to beneficial experiences which will perhaps one day make it possible for there to exist in the world Organization an organ of justice of the same kind but of wider scope.32.	As far as the Dominican Republic is concerned  we are in a position to assert here that we have made important progress in this area  as a projection of the integrated programmes of the Dominican Government for the development of the country. These programmes  now more than ever  require international conditions not likely to have an adverse effect on the efforts  which the Head of the Dominican State proposes to redouble  with vigour and energy  in all the country's area of activity.33.	Furthermore  the Dominican Republic wishes to reaffirm its support for the fundamental principles of international economic relations as expressed in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. Here  as is the case with all the Latin American countries and particularly those which produce commodities and raw materials  we would ex- ort the developing countries to conduct their economic relations in such a way as to take into account the interests of other countries  particularly in order to avoid any action detrimental to the interests of the developing countries.34.	There exists an initiative which without doubt could be taken through dialogue within a framework of equality and mutual respect and adapted to the delicate conditions of the particular case  one that could serve to attenuate the risk to international security engendered by flash-points of crisis. I refer to the establishment of a new international economic order in such a way as to provide the present era of civilization with what it clamours for.35.	There is also a well-tested and extremely effective method for contributing to the solution of the problem of security. It is enshrined in the Charter of this Organization  and its application has produced positive results. This is the principle relating to the self- determination of peoples. This is precisely the essence of the item relating to the ""Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples"".36.	Over the years events have shown that the policy that has satisfied such aspirations of countries which have come to the end of an evolutionary process has proved to be correct and has justified their aspirations to become free and independent. The Dominican Republic  like all free countries of the Americas  has had to go through that process. Hence the situation prevailing in the region of the Americas today. In the circumstances  the Dominican people have lived and suffered through this experience and  whatever the vicissitudes to which we have been subjected by our destiny  absolutely all the sons of our land are also sons of liberty.37.	No matter how strewn with pitfalls is the life of free peoples  this is the road of peace and concord among men and nations. In this conviction we must recognize  in line with the thinking of the martyr of Cuban independence  Jose Marti  the truth of the statement: ""Our wine may be bitter but it is our wine"".38.	Therefore let us welcome with open arms that small island in the Caribbean  Saint Lucia  as we see it entering the United Nations as a Member. In spite of its small size its spirit is broadened by its acceptance of the obligation imposed on it to proscribe war and to maintain peace in the world  and its dedication to the principles governing us all.39.	This idea of peace should be inculcated as a mystic teaching every day among men and nations  so that perhaps in the course of time it will cease to be a Utopian idea and man can then say that he has achieved the impossible. Therefore the Dominican Republic joins in the most recent initiative of Costa Rica for the creation  within the United Nations system  of a University for Peace. 40.	Finally  permit me to invoke on this solemn occasion that provision of the Charter which calls on all States Members of the Organizationâand this is the comer-stone of our policy for avoiding the scourge of war and is perhaps the synthesis of all the objectives justifying the very existence of the United Nationsâ ""to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours""."
"40",2035,"DZA",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  a well-deserved tribute has unanimously been paid to you and  through you  to your country  by your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Algeria would like to be fully associated with that tribute  since it is a matter of great pleasure to us that you and your country  with which we have so many ties of friendship  have been so honoured. Through this election we have tried to pay a tremendous debt of gratitude which has been contracted by the community of oppressed peoples towards the Chairman of the Special Committee on decolonization  who has made an enormous contribution to conquering what is the most precious possession for a people  namely  liberty. Through this election we also felt that we were expressing to you the respect that we have for the United Republic of Tanzania  that worthy country  to its responsible President and to its courageous people.343.	If traditionally our session opens with a general debate  it is undoubtedly in order to encourage some thinking about the state of our world. We should take this opportunity to take a good look at the turbulence which has shaken our planet.344.	Economic problems have often been the root- cause of the conflicts and tensions which have been a feature of the history of mankind. Unfortunately  this still remains true today  and probably more so than ever.345.	For us  the developing countries  whose daily concern is to try to satisfy the vital and the most elementary needs of our peoples whose very survival is threatened  prosperity remains a theory. At a time when man's capacity to influence nature in order to remove the evils which afflict him is prodigious  such a situation is intolerable.346.	A system of international economic relations which sacrifices  as it were  two people for the rather precarious happiness of a third is fundamentally reprehensible and has in fact been condemned. The law of the jungle  the ""law"" of the strongest  the spirit of domination  the policy of conquest or reconquest  and expansionist greed continue to be rife in our world  unfortunately  despite the most exalted affirmations of principle  despite window-dressing  and despite the grievous inadequacies of our Organization.347.	Colonialist forces are once again sharpening their rivalries and  in a state of military preparedness which is at our expense  they measure their relative strength by the way in which they are able to nullify our power to manoeuvre  our margin for decision  and  in a word  our independence and our development.348.	A lot is said about detente. But we cannot thereby disregard the liberation movements of peoples in Africa  Asia and Latin America. Equilibrium between the great Powers alone does not mean balance throughout the worldâa balance which cannot be brought about by disregarding the freedom of other peoples  because without the freedom of peoples there is no liberty or justice for the entire world  and because equilibrium can only be the result of everyone's enjoyment of the fruits of the earth  and not the result of the economic  political or military domination of one side by the other.349.	In the face of this world-wide disorder  the countries of the third world are pursuing their struggle  both political and economic  approaching the problems both by way of challenge and participation.350.	First the challenge: the rich are being challenged by the poor. This challenging will only cease when the present oligarchic system  which is based on the exploitation of the largest possible number of people  gives way to the advent of a new international economic and political order which is more just and which is based on the coherent and integrated development of the entire world and on the right of all peoples to progress.351.	Secondly the participation: it is the participation of all our countries in bringing about the better happiness of the world. We wish to cease being the fulcrums for alien economic  political and military strategies. We wish no longer to be the prey of those who are stronger and wealthier. We wish to regain our legitimate right to participate in our own history and in the history of the world. We wish to contribute to the elimination of waves of political instability in various parts of our globe; we wish to struggle against areas where power is concentrated; we wish to expand the representative nature of the decision-making centres in international relations; in other words  we seek to make international relations as a whole more democratic.352.	The ""status of second-class citizen"" which is accorded to the countries of the third world in world affairs is not in keeping with the immensity of their natural wealth  their considerable demographic weight or the importance of the markets which they represent. It is this institutionalized gap created by an oligarchic systemâa danger to the security of the worldâwhich justifies our challenge and calls for our participation. The developing countries consider that all world affairs are of equal concern to them as they are to the great Powers and that nothing which affects their future should be considered  examined  debated or  a fortiori  decided without their participation.353.	Among the major problems which will affect the future of mankind and whose satisfactory solution must involve the participation of the entire membership of the international community we must necessarily include the building and safeguarding of peace  which is the key problem of our time. Our countries  whose weakness makes us the first victims of war  attach genuine importance to peace. Furthermore  it is a question not only of safeguarding ourselves and our development in all areas  but even  in certain circumstances  of preserving mankind as a whole.354.	Peace is indivisible. Peace within the boundaries of the developed world does not necessarily mean peace for the world as a whole  just as detente should not simply consist in eliminating tensions in the developed northern part of the planet in order to transfer those tensions to the third world  to the detriment of those who are weakest and poorest in it.355.	We cannot bring about global and lasting peace without profoundly questioning the present system of international relations  a system which is the root-cause of war  if only by reason of the fact that it was established by a small number of States for their benefit and to the detriment of all the others.356.	It is abundantly clear today that international economic questions must be seen in terms of world security and that  conversely  world security must be seen in economic terms. The recognition of the predominance of economics is further borne out by the awareness of the impact of ""economic factors"" on the security of the world.357.	The crisis which has prevailed since the beginning of the present decade could have brought about a restructuring of the world economy in keeping with the imperative need for a balanced development of the entire planet. That would have been the case had action been taken on the declarations adopted by various special sessions of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to development and to disarmament. But the blind intransigence and  I would even say  the unrepentant selfishness of the wealthy countries have unfortunately ruled otherwise.358.	In the face of a situation which is becoming intolerable  the international community  as if beset by impotence  seems resigned to events. In this connexion the paralysis which is a characteristic feature of present international economic negotiations stands in stark contrast with the professions of faith in dialogue  the regularity of which can no longer disguise their Platonic nature.359.	Is it not in fact the logic of confrontation which continues to predominate? Growing protectionism with regard to the products of the South and the manipulation of gold  of reserve currencies and of the monetary system generally speaking in order to serve the sole interests of the wealthy countries  not to mention the devising of doctrines of military intervention towards certain countries of the South  can hardly be said to reflect a spirit of co-operation.360.	Now  therefore  can we be surprised at the legitimate reaction of those developing countries in a position slightly to offset the effects on their economies of imported inflation and the depreciation of reserve currencies?361.	We are forced to note that  to say the least  awareness is lagging behind actuality. Indeed  at a time when interdependence among nations  although it is still unbalanced  is now becoming a reality  the developed countries continue in their own contexts to seek solutions to their own problems without really being concerned about the impact which those solutions might have on the economies of the countries of the third world.362.	The joint search for solutions to international economic problems should not be confined  as certain countries have suggested  to the question of energy alone. Far be it  for us to underestimate the importance of this matter  whether it be a question of its trade aspects or the imperative need for us all to ensure a smooth transition to the utilization of new sources of energy. But it would be mistaken to believe  or even to give the impression  that a selective approach of this kind could have any chance of success. Indeed  if it is true that international co-operation is necessary in this area  as in others which are of fundamental importance such .as development  world trade  raw materials and financial and monetary matters  the very interdependence of these problems means that this co-operation can be effective Only in terms of a global approach and on the basis of equity and mutual interest.363.	On the basis of this premise  and having learned from past experience  Algeria at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Havana  proposed conducting with the developed countries global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development. Representatives are now familiar with this proposal  since it has already been officially introduced by the Group of 77 at the last session of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/ 174.364.	Global negotiation by its very nature makes it impossible to give precedence to any particular topic over the others which have to be considered. This type of negotiation necessarily means that there has to be a concurrent consideration of all the subjects that have been identified  whether in the area of energy  financing and currency  raw materials  or trade and development  in order to achieve a concrete and coherent set of results affecting all of these questions.365.	Nor is it a question of proposing new machinery or a new forum. The existing bodies of the General Assembly  which allow of universal participation which is the only guarantee that the interests of all Stales  large and small  are served  could as we see it be the framework for such negotiation.366.	It will thus be the first time that a substantive discussion can be initiated under the aegis of this Assembly on topics that are normally dealt with outside or on the fringe of this Organization and in terms of the other components of the new order from which they can no longer be dissociated. After initiatives of restricted negotiation proved fruitless in the absence of a genuine mandate conferred upon the negotiating countries by the rest of the international community  these questions will be taken up in an integrated way also for the first time by the community of nations.367.	In doing this  we will only be recognizing the obvious fact that a global problem demands a global solution  since no country is free from its obligation to contribute  according to its means  of course  to bridge the growing gap between opulence and destitution which is endangering the survival of us all. 368.	The success of these planned global negotiations will of course be far from having been achieved simply by reason of any decision taken on the subject by the present session. It will essentially depend on a positive change in the attitude of the developed countries  or even an actual conversion in certain cases vis-a-vis the ideals inherent in the new international order.369.	We can never overstress the fact that the new international economic order is fundamentally a political objective. It is a question of forging a more just and more equitable world  without which the sources of friction and even confrontation will only grow apace. Our global negotiation is a first genuine step towards establishing new relations between men  thus providing future generations of this earth with a calmer future.370.	In our world which is so grievously in need of justice  development and freedom  a structural revolution should therefore be set under way. This structural revolution put an end to political and economic ""order' ' which the inequities inherent in it have completely condemned. This structural revolution will get our world out of this aberrant system which belongs to a stone-age mentality. The community of the poor  those who have been perennially forgotten by history  are clamouring for the advent of this new structural revolution. But we would also appeal to the community of the wealthy  also and above all  to work to bring this about so that it can be part of the history of mankind. The task undoubtedly requires changes  even far-reaching upheavals.371.	We must all be the architects of this change  the extent of which is unprecedented in the history of mankind. The road is long  in keeping with such a gigantic goal. However  we are condemned to work together. Although today our world consists of the wealthy and the deprived  of takers and taken  our humanity will not be advanced by our building the worldâeven were it possible to do soâon the basis of an inverted equation in which the rich would be relegated to the status of the poor and vice versa. On the contrary  all men must work towards integrated  balanced and genuinely concerted development.372.	In this task for the good of all mankind there is no place for short-term solutions. It is to the benefit of all to initiate a permanent and sincere dialogue and to inform it with a constructive spirit in order that the just interests of each of us can be clearly perceived and be given legitimate satisfaction.373.	The international community is more than ever aware of the extreme gravity of certain situations in the world and of the serious risk of their spreading. It is encouraging  however  that in the face of the continual denial of the rights of peoples  international solidarity is growing ever stronger. The legitimate representatives of struggling peoples have been recognized and acknowledged by an ever-growing majority of the international community.374.	In this connexion  SWAPO and the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe were recently received in Havana as full members of the family of non-aligned nations. The PLO  apart from the natural solidarity it has long enjoyed from the non-aligned countries  is today recognized as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people by a growing number of countries. The Frente POLISARIO  whose struggle has attested to the national existence of the people of Western Sahara  has gained international acceptance  as borne out by the recognition by many States of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic in recent months.375.	These political and diplomatic successes are of course highly significant of the vitality and youth of the struggle of peoples for recognition of their rights  but they also remind us that the world in which we live is still marked by an antagonism that pits the forces of domination and enslavement against the forces of liberation and emancipation.376.	In this connexion  southern Africa is a gigantic base from which racist regimes and imperialismâ whose faithful agents they areâare launching their offensives against our freedom  our dignity  our independence and our resources.377.	The corner-stone of the imperialist strategy is made up of the desire to set up a system of power that gives the appearance of change but leaves the foundations intact. In Rhodesia and Namibia  an attempt is being made to impose a uniform policy to the detriment of the rights of the peoples of that region  whose legitimacy has been firmly recognized by the international community.378.	Our duty today is not only to affirm our solidarity and give concrete expression to our support for the peoples of southern Africa. Our duty is to go even further and to take the necessary steps required by the exceptional seriousness of a situation that has been going on for more than 30 years in the form of an arrogant defiance of the international community as a whole. Our Organization must take historic decisions on this matter here and now. The Charter  as we know  provides ample means for doing so. Along with the solutions provided to us by the Charter  we must solemnly remind the Powers that are directly or indirectly supporting the racist regimes of their grave responsibilities and take vigorous initiatives to forge in a definite way the destiny of southern Africa.379.	The strategy being employed in Africa finds its logical extension in the Middle East. In both regions  the same forces that are hostile to genuine emancipation are pursuing an identical goal: the strengthening or reestablishment of imperialist domination in order to ensure control over the flow of wealth.380.	The continuing plot of imperialism and its Zionist tool is designed to misrepresent the realities of the problem that lies at the very heart of the entire Middle East question: the right of the Palestinian people to a national existence in their own homeland. And at a time when this plot is spreading and is being implemented from an unexpected sourceâa fraternal front-line countryâwe in this Organization must be more than ever aware of the fact that  if we are to remain faithful to our ideals of solidarity and commitment to just causes  any solution to this problem must necessarily involve the restoration to the Palestinian people of all their national rights that have been recognized and solemnly proclaimed by the entire international community.381.	Realizing the seriousness of the threat hanging over the future of the Palestinian people  the Arab nation  Africa  the Islamic peoples  the non-aligned action not only of safeguarding ourselves and our development in all areas  but even  in certain circumstances  of preserving mankind as a whole.354.	Peace is indivisible. Peace within the boundaries of the developed world does not necessarily mean peace for the world as a whole  just as detente should not simply consist in eliminating tensions in the developed northern part of the planet in order to transfer those tensions to the third world  to the detriment of those who are weakest and poorest in it.355.	We cannot bring about global and lasting peace without profoundly questioning the present system of international relations  a system which is the root-cause of war  if only by reason of the fact that it was established by a small number of States for their benefit and to the detriment of all the others.356.

It is encouraging  however  that in the face of the continual denial of the rights of peoples  international solidarity is growing ever stronger. The legitimate representatives of struggling peoples have been recognized and acknowledged by an ever-growing majority of the international community.374.	In this connexion  SWAPO and the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe were recently received in Havana as full members of the family of non-aligned nations. The PLO  apart from the natural solidarity it has long enjoyed from the non-aligned countries  is today recognized as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people by a growing number of countries.The Frente POLISARIO  whose struggle has attested to the national existence of the people of Western Sahara  has gained international acceptance  as borne out by the recognition by many States of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic in recent months.375.	These political and diplomatic successes are of course highly significant of the vitality and youth of the struggle of peoples for recognition of their rights  but they also remind us that the world in which we live is still marked by an antagonism that pits the forces of domination and enslavement against the forces of liberation and emancipation.376.	In this connexion  southern Africa is a gigantic base from which racist regimes and imperialismâ whose faithful agents they areâare launching their offensives against our freedom  our dignity  our independence and our resources.377.	The corner-stone of the imperialist strategy is made up of the desire to set up a system of power that gives the appearance of change but leaves the foundations intact. In Rhodesia and Namibia  an attempt is being made to impose a uniform policy to the detriment of the rights of the peoples of that region  whose legitimacy has been firmly recognized by the international community.378.	Our duty today is not only to affirm our solidarity and give concrete expression to our support for the peoples of southern Africa. Our duty is to go even Further and to take the necessary steps required by the exceptional seriousness of a situation that has been going on for more than 30 years in the form of an arrogant defiance of the international community as a whole. Our Organization must take historic decisions on this matter here and now. The Charter  as we know  provides ample means for doing so. Along with the solutions provided to us by the Charter  we must solemnly remind the Powers that are directly or indirectly supporting the racist regimes of their grave responsibilities and take vigorous initiatives to forge in a definite way the destiny of southern Africa.379.	The strategy being employed in Africa finds its logical extension in the Middle East. In both regions  the same forces that are hostile to genuine emancipation are pursuing an identical goal: the strengthening or re-establishment of imperialist domination in order to ensure control over the flow of wealth.380.	The continuing plot of imperialism and its Zionist tool is designed to misrepresent the realities of the problem that lies at the very heart of the entire Middle East question: the right of the Palestinian people to a national existence in their own homeland. And at a time when this plot is spreading and is being implemented from an unexpected sourceâa fraternal front-line countryâwe in this Organization must be more than ever aware of the fact that  if we are to remain faithful to our ideals of solidarity and commitment to just causes  any solution to this problem must necessarily involve the restoration to the Palestinian people of all their national rights that have been recognized and solemnly proclaimed by the entire international community.381.	Realizing the seriousness of the threat hanging over the future of the Palestinian people  the Arab nation  Africa  the Islamic peoples  the non-aligned countries and many other States have denounced the Camp David and Washington accords. This unprecedented surge of solidarity is continuing to spread to other parts of the world where the resistance of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the PLO  their sole legitimate representative  is scoring brilliant successes  as befits the justice of their cause and the noble ideals of their struggle.382.	The remarkable recognition accorded to the PLO is the most concrete proof that such accords run counter to the tide of history because they ignore the national rights of the Palestinian people  their right to self-determination and their right to return to their homeland.383.	The situation in the Middle East is already explosive enough  without the serious events that are so dangerously affecting the sovereignty and integrity of Lebanon. What has been going on for so long in that afflicted country also bears the imprint of Zionism.384.	Israeli plans for aggression and the plunder of the Arab nation are in fact evidenced by the serious events occurring in Lebanon. Israel is pursuing a dual goal there  as we all know.385.	In the context of its policy of controlling the entire region  Israel is occupying part of Lebanese territory  violating the sovereignty of that State  fomenting secessionist trends and continuing to create  promote and support every disruptive factor in Lebanon. At the same time  it is seeking to wipe out Palestinian resistance and is attacking the Palestinians who sought refuge in Lebanon.386.	The international community must shoulder its responsibilities in order to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon and to put an end to the Israeli acts of aggression against the fraternal Lebanese people. In order to be successful in this endeavour  we must realize that only a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East can restore peace. This is the obvious lesson to be drawn from the repeated events in Lebanon.387.	The file on the Western Sahara has now been spread before the entire international community; the facts are clear to everyone by now: it is a problem of thwarted decolonization  and no one can any longer question this glaring fact.388.	The issue of Western Sahara involves a national liberation struggle waged by a valiant people resolved and prepared at all costs to liberate this occupied home-land and achieve recognition of its legitimate national rights.389.	In view of the grave events which have continuously beset that region for four years  the Western Sahara question is now clearly perceived in the light of all its effects on the peace  stability and security of all the peoples inhabiting that part of the African continent.390.	Mindful of all the dangerous consequences inherent in a conflict between the people of Western Sahara and the occupants of its national territory  the OAU two months ago assumed its full responsibilities during the sixteenth ordinary session of its Assembly of Heads of State and Government in Monrovia  and identified the principles and effective measures for attaining a just and final settlement of this problem  in keeping with its goals and traditions 391.	The recommendations of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara and the decision taken by the OAU Assembly at its sixteenth ordinary session on 20 July last are a new and important component of the history of this issue and at the same time mark a decisive stage in the search for a just political solution to this problem.392.	The agreements concluded on 5 August last between Mauritania and the Frente POLISARIO are another decisive contribution to a peaceful and just solution to the conflict  and the military occupation of the part previously administered by Mauritaniaâ ""Tins-El-Gharbia""âby the military forces of a neighbouring country can in no way stem the implacable course of history.393.	Noting that turn of events  the non-aligned movement  in the Final Declaration of the Sixth Conference  in Havana  unambiguously endorsed the right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and independence  and expressed its deep disapproval at the fact that Morocco had extended its military occupation.394.	Considering all the dangerous consequences of a conflict between the people of Western Sahara  under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO  and the occupiers of its national territory  our Organization is in duty bound to assume its full responsibility for maintaining peace and security. Following the lead of the OAU and the non-aligned movement  it should make its full contribution to the achievement of a just and final settlement in keeping with the purposes and principles of its Charter and with resolutions it has already adopted. Here again  the spirit of the times demands that we make such a contribution  thus signifying our faithfulness to the ideals of our Charter  and at the same time rendering justice to a valiant people struggling for its legitimate rights.395.	Many other problems beset our world and prompt the concern of our General Assembly  as is borne out by the number and variety of items on our agenda. They all reflect the fact that our community is embarked on a long and arduous course  one in which the political will to reach a solution to all the problems which concern us and often directly affect the very future of our world is not always evident.396.	The United Nations  a valuable tool for universal dialogue  and an irreplaceable channel for the progress of our world  should remain the guarantor of a future filled with hope.397.	The elimination of conflicts and tensions  and the solution of our problems  require decisions in keeping with our Charter in order for us to take up the challenges to the international community in all areas affecting the search for peace  security and genuine co-operation for the development and well-being of all nations."
"41",2082,"ECU",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  on behalf of Ecuador  I greet that distinguished citizen of the United Republic of Tanzania  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  the President of this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I take this opportunity to reaffirm the solidarity of my country with the peoples of Africa and  in general  with all the peoples of the third world  who will in the not-too-distant future constitute the most representative international forum in the history of mankind. I also greet that eminent Colombian  Mr. Indalecio Lie'vano Aguirre  who so skilfully presided over the work of the General Assembly at its thirty-third session. And I extend a most cordial welcome to the new State of Saint Lucia which  as a member of the Latin American group of States  has joined in the activities of our Organization.196.	I express our condolences on the death of the President of Angola  Agostinho Neto  a man of letters and a statesman of great significance in the history of the liberation of the peoples of Africa.197.	I am pleased to mention the solid democratic position which Ecuador has been enjoying since 10 August 1979  following an overwhelming popular vote in which the participation of the youth and the women of the country was extremely high. The new Government guiding the destiny of my country has  at the culminating point of a long period of transition from dictatorship to freedom  not only re-established the full validity of political rights but also opened up an era of authentic popular participation in Ecuadorean democratic institutional life.198.	The Constitutional President of Ecuador  Jaime Roldos  governs under the guidance of the 21 philosophical and pragmatic points advocated in his electoral campaign  thus bringing into play the full authority of the State in the cause of national economic development without impairment of any kind but  rather  with a considerable enhancement of social justice always in keeping with the full respect of human rights. This is as befits a pluralistic democracy which is living through a process of change and for that very reason requires international justice in harmony with the principles of the United Nations.199. In order to provide delegations here with more information  I should like to quote the following paragraphs from the message to the nation delivered by the President of the Republic of Ecuador upon assuming his high office:""The State in isolation has no destiny. The international policy of the country will be based on the principles of non-intervention  self-determination  the legal equality of States  the defence of human rights  respect for ideological pluralism  the opening of relations with all countries  the repudiation of all forms of aggression and intervention and the use of force  the rejection of colonialism and neo-colonialism and the peaceful settlement of disputes. My Government will so animate its foreign policy as to make it an instrument that will effectively help internal development and  within the framework of international organizations and instruments  I will advocate the exercise of justice and freedom.""While acknowledging the fundamental differences that may separate us  my Government intends to strengthen our international relations  since it is by learning to coexist with different countries and thus discovering beneficial elements of progress  cooperation and friendship that we gain a better understanding of the world we live in.""The violation of human rights and constitutional guarantees creates focal-points of resistance at home and threatens peace in the hemisphere. Peace-loving Ecuador therefore sought a way of solving an epidemic political problemâthat of dictatorshipâ which is alien to the true democratic vocation of the Latin American peoples. The experience of history teaches us that regimes of force make economic development and social justice impossible. On the contrary  rather do they become factors of stagnation or retrogression  which we democratic men must do away with. I am awareâand my country knows itâ of the great challenge that lies ahead   not only facing us but also the other peoples of America  My Government will prove that economic development and social justice are the fruits of the orchard of democracy and not of terror.""200.	Having just quoted President Roldos  I must say that  in connexion with the defence of the historic and irrevocable rights of my country over the Amazon  I shall try to give practical effect to the guidelines that he has enunciated. In its present friendly relations with Peru  Ecuador will not cease in its search for a peaceful solution to its rightful claim.201.	I believeâand I do so most firmlyâthat there is no problem in international relations which cannot be solved by peaceful and legal means. The use of violence  which international law strictly prohibits  is resorted to only when a party or parties to a dispute lack any real desire to ensure harmonious coexistence and friendly co-operation among peoples. I feel that I have a particular responsibility in giving effect to this principle in relations with the countries of the Latin American region and particularly with those that are closest to us geographically.202.	The principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes is closely related to the matter of continental constancy in the field of human rights  since violence in the domestic political life of a country is nearly always the result of social inequities and tensions and tends to spill over national borders  as history has shown a hundred times over.203.	With a just concern for such constancy  the Presidents of Ecuador  Colombia  Costa Rica  Venezuela and the Prime Minister of Spain  along with the Foreign Ministers of Peru and Bolivia  signed the Declaration of Quito on 11 August 1979  in which they reiterated their purpose of continuing to strive for the Latin American institutionalization of freedom and democracy  becauseâin the words of the Declaration  such a purpose"". . : invigorates our own institutional life  stimulates recognition of freedom and the continent and contributes to the establishment of the most desirable method for realizing the aspirations of our peoples for social justice.""204.	It is necessary that  on the principle of inescapable solidarity  the international community respond swiftly to the need for participation in programmes for the reconstruction of Nicaragua so that that country  a victim of brutality and genocide  may receive both the emergency bilateral humanitarian aid it needs and the contributions to the International Solidarity Fund for the Reconstruction of Nicaragua  as well as the technical co-operation it requires to solve its present dire predicament and spur its development.205.	However  the distressing conditions in which the peoples of the third world live are not merely the results of the rather unfortunate workings of their internal policies; they are also  and more specifically  due to the injustice of an international economic order that is daily making the rich countries richer and the poor countries poorer  particularly now under the spiralling inflation brought about by the industrialized nations.206.	I do not believe that nowadays  in the latter part of the twentieth century  anyone disagrees with the establishment of a new international economic order that entails deep changes in social life  in technological and scientific life and profound alterations in the sphere of information and communications. Above all  it implies that the large industrialized countries of the world must come to a new awareness of what is beneficial to all mankind and of the urgent need for justice and solidarity among all the inhabitants of the earth. This is the only available way to avoid the catastrophe that seems to be drawing nearer with the approach of the coming century. That century is already present in our fears  but also in our hopes  if only human conduct can manage to adapt personal wishes to collective needs.207.	With the vision of a future that must be described as uncertain  Ecuador maintains the urgent need for countries to take concrete steps in the framework of the North-South dialogue and for that dialogue  within the United Nations to be continuous  however laborious it may be; for I believe that the countries of the third world are prepared to carry on the discussion and the struggle for positive forms of universal justice.208.	In another area  my country trusts that the negotiations of UNCTAD will continue in the most effective way possible in the climate that has been created by the now universal feeling that the new order is beginning to attract the best minds of our time. Indeed  this climate has sprung from the yearnings of all the peoples that form the undercurrent of history  but who are left outside it as far as surface events are concerned.209.	In connexion with the new international economic order  I cannot fail to mention the problem of energy that so besets the world  and particularly the poor countries with no fuel. My country is a small producer of oil and its rate of domestic consumption is increasing from year to year  which means that the already reduced exports of today will be notably affected. Yet Ecuador has suffered less than other sister countries. In any event  the problem of high fuel prices marked the first step on the road to the recovery of the developing countries that produce raw materials  above all non-renewable resources. Even so  whatever benefits such an increase may have brought fell into the traditional pattern of a blatantly unequal distribution of income. There can be no doubt of the fact that stable and fair prices for the commodities of the developing countries represent the soundest basis for the safeguarding of universal peace and international justice.210.	There must not be the slightest hesitation  either in thought or in deed  about making certain that the coming years of economic development are beneficial to the countries of the third world. This will only be possible  however  through the establishment of the new international economic order  which must reflect the increasing interdependence of peoples. I should like to think that in the end the developed countries will be unable to avoid responding to this historic challenge of justice  since such a response implicitly involves their own sense of survival and their moral duty to participate in building an equitable world. It is the only way of reducing tensions and of at least attenuating the overwhelming economic and social contrasts that prevail  as stipulated in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  for this is the only means of ensuring the maintenance of peace 211.	My country does not believe in miracles  and for its part it is making the necessary efforts on the domestic front to gear the conditions of its economic and social life to the times. This is being done within the provisions of a strict planning process designed to mobilize its natural resources in order to assimilate the transfers of technology and to benefit from cooperation with developing countries  as well as from such co-operation as the developed countries may offer.212.	For these reasons  Ecuador has great hopes for the new methods of UNDP  the universality of which must be preserved  while taking due account of less favoured countries.213.	It is an incontrovertible truth that the world possesses more than enough resources in active circulation to eliminate starvation and want. Some resources  however  are improperly distributed; others are being squandered on the arms race  euphemistically called a ââsystem of defence"". It is totally incomprehensible that the innocent citizen should be shown the astronomical figures that are being invested at every minute in funds for slaughter  when with lesser amounts we could prevent an enormous number of children from dying of perfectly curable diseases  prevent old people from living in solitude and poverty  prevent young people from suffering the pangs of hunger and cultural deprivation  and in general keep human beings from treading the road of life totally without the material and spiritual goods they were born to enjoy. Add to this immense sorrow the nightmare of nuclear arsenals  and the least perceptive eye  the least attentive ear  will clearly discern the gigantic proportions of that most useless of catastrophesâthe disappearance of the human race.214.	It is comforting to recall the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  which prohibits nuclear weapons in Latin America  and the signature and ratification of the Declaration of Ayacucho  which promotes the peaceful settlement of disputes and arms limitation  thus allowing for greater resources to be devoted to the economic and social development of the countries of the region.215.	The sea and outer space are inherent dimensions of the well-being of mankind. Whereas the former holds the greatest reserve of resources of our planet  the other is essential for life to continue. That is why we must preserve them for peaceful uses. Ecuador reiterates its inalienable right to its 200-mile territorial sea  but that does not mean any disregard for the jus communicationis  or other legitimate uses by third States  nor any breach of international norms. Consequently  we reject any threat directed against our sovereignty.216.	The exploitation of the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction must strictly conform to the principle of the common heritage of mankind proclaimed by the General Assembly. Likewise  the exploitation of outer space must not be allowed to serve military purposes or those of cultural alienation.217.	As regards the synchronous geostationary orbit  Ecuador reaffirms its right to the corresponding segments and hopes their utilization will open up wide possibilities for co-operation for the benefit of developing countries.218.	Consistent with the wishes for peaceful coexistence professed by the Government and people of Ecuador  I express the hope that tensions will be reduced in the Middle East so that Israelis and Arabs  with whose countries Ecuador maintains cordial relations  may share in exemplary accord in the urgent task of peacefully developing the region. To this end  my country believes that it is indispensable to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the restitution of the territories occupied by force  and to reaffirm the legal existence of the State of Israel  which was brought into being by the United Nations.219.	Likewise  Ecuador hopes that the occupation by force may cease to mar the coexistence of the sorely tried population of Cyprus and that the negotiations between the Cypriot groups concerned may progress  with the presence and co-operation of the United Nations.220.	My country is also concerned at the defiant behaviour of the rulers of the Republic of South Africa  and as a signatory to the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid it once again places on records its repudiation and rejection of all forms of racial discrimination.221.	In like manner  I believe that the problem of Namibia should have been solved by now and consider it is high time that the self-determination of its people should have swept away the last traces of colonialism in that area  which is  moreover  being maintained in defiance of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. Ecuador also hopes for the successful outcome of the efforts aimed at giving Zimbabwe a legal regime  with the participation of the Patriotic Front in the negotiations  so that the regime that emerges may be truly representative of the will of the people.222.	It remains for me to say that Ecuador attended the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries held in Havana and that  together with the other nations of the Andean Group  it declared its support for the principles which inspire the non-aligned movement.223.	On this occasion  the Government of Ecuador  which I represent  reaffirms its faith in the United Nations and the hope which the peoples have vested in it that it will be possible to establish the new international economic order and give effective validity to a right that is truly in keeping with the times in which we liveâfor it is now quite useless to try to mask injustice and aggression with any kind of euphemism. Thus will nations be able to fulfil the foremost of their duties: human solidarity."
"42",2127,"EGY",34,1979,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure at the outset  Mr. President  to express to you  on behalf of the Government of Egypt  our heartfelt congratulations upon your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. You  Mr. President  are the perfect embodiment of the struggle waged by the third world in its pursuit of freedom  justice and a better future. In the name of Africa  you  Mr. President  have championed for many years Africa's struggle through the United Nations for the triumph of its causes. You have always adopted  and still do  noble attitudes in the name of your great country  the friendly United Republic of Tanzania  under the leadership of Africa's revered son  President Julius Nyerere  in upholding justice everywhere and pursuing the struggle for its sake.113.	It is also an added pleasure for me to express through you  Mr. President  Egypt's sincere gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for the outstanding role he played while presiding over the General Assembly at its last session. He was the ideal representative of his great country  Colombia  as well as of all Latin America and its deeply-rooted traditions.114.	I should also like to seize this opportunity to express the congratulations of the Egyptian people to the people of Saint Lucia  on the occasion of their independence and their joining the international com-munity at the United Nations. I also convey the congratulations of the Egyptian people to the people of Panama on the occasion of the recovery of its sovereignty over the Canal.115.	The present session of the General Assembly is taking place while the world stands at the threshold of the 1980s and amidst international developments that point towards stirrings of change affecting the whole world. The winds of change have not as yet gathered their full momentum. Nevertheless  international developments indicate that the world community is approaching a new stage in its evolution  a stage that is marked by the four following characteristics: first  serious  persistent and ever-increasing efforts for the elimination of racism and minority rule  the eradication of the remnants of colonialism  a confrontation with aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and the strengthening of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory through war and the upholding of the right of self- determination; secondly  action for the achievement of just  comprehensive and peaceful settlements in areas of tension in order to ensure suitable conditions conducive to the solution of the genuine problems relating to economic and social development; thirdly  the identification of the economic problems that plague the developing countries on the one hand  and those which face the developed countries on the other  as well as efforts aimed at the establishment of a new international economic orderâwhich should remedy the dangerous deficiencies inherent in the present system that have caused the present shaky economic order from which we are all suffering; and fourthly   efforts to intensify and promote global detente  which should entail the reduction of nuclear armaments  the pursuit of general disarmament and the underscoring of the importance of international co-operation in the political  economic  social and cultural fields  whether on land or in the ocean  on our planet or on the moon or other celestial bodies  within the context of the common heritage of mankind  in a common endeavour and for the common benefit to all.116.	Perhaps these main elementsâand others  if we choose to dwell on particularsâconstitute a picture which may appear somewhat optimistic. In highlighting these factors  my intention was to present a framework for the picture as I see it or  may I say  as I wish it to be  for by accurately identifying the problems  and by planning the appropriate solutions to them  together with constant hope  unwavering conviction and faith in our capacity to confront these problems appropriately and effectively  we shall have taken the first step in the right direction  long hoped for by the thinkers and aspired to by dreamers among mankind.117.	Let me hasten to emphasize that  although this framework may be the right one  it is also correct to state that important obstacles still obstruct the road to our objectives and goals. The whole world witnesses this situation whether in southern Africa  South-East Asia or the Middle East  and in the political as well as in the economic fields  not to mention social problems arising in many countries in the world. This places on our shoulders a great responsibility  which we must assume for ourselves and for future generations. It is therefore incumbent upon us to proceed with courage  initiative and vision and pull down all barriers  the symbols of despair  and free our minds from all constraints and hindrances with a view to opening up new horizons that will usher in a new era and a better future.118.	My country  Egypt  on whose behalf I am proud to speak today  has a long history  the roots of which go far back in the history of human evolution. That history has left unmistakable marks on each and every facet of human evolution and progress. Egypt's contribution to the progress of civilization has rarely been matched  in religion  science  art  thought  life  war and peace.119.	In this context  Egypt's policy is based on unshakable foundations and solid principles  which in essence stress that man was not created to exploit his fellow man  but rather that we should all co-operate for the realization of the noble objective of achieving a better future for all. Consequently Egypt's opposition to all forms of exploitation  colonialism and neo-colonialism is an irrevocable fact. Furthermore  its opposition to racism  racial discrimination  foreign occupation and settler colonialism is a matter of principle. Its struggle to bring to an end these unjust conditions  is relentless. As an integral part of the third world and one of its pillars  Egypt has in various phases of its long history suffered from these injustices. It has struggled against imperialism and colonialism for many years. The events of June 1967 represented a culmination of colonialist aggression against Egypt in its role in the vanguard of the struggle for a better future for the Arab nation  for Africa and for the whole of the third world.120.	Throughout the past 12 years  Egypt has been engaged in a continuous struggle for the establishment of a just settlement of the Middle East problem. This problem has taken a heavy toll on Egypt  costing her tens of thousands of martyrs and many billions of dollars  all at the expense of its progress and to the detriment of the welfare of its people. In addition to all this  it has had widespread adverse effects on the right of its people to proper education  to adequate medical care and to work opportunities. In the Middle East  no one has endured what the valiant Palestinian people and the people of Egypt were able to sustain. No single people m the Middle East has suffered as much as they have suffered.121.	Egypt's record in war is matched by its struggle For peace. It has accepted Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and has co-operated closely with Ambassador Jarring in its implementation. It has used its right to self-defence by resorting to the war of attrition in 1969 and 1970 and it has also welcomed all peaceful initiatives that have surfaced during the first six years of the occupation of its territory  foremost among them the Committee of African Heads of State. When it became clear that a conspiracy to impose the fait accompli and an attempt to perpetuate the state of ""no war  no peace'' was being carried out  Egypt waged the glorious October Ramadan war.122.	In both instances  Egypt was committed to peace. Its co-operation with the peace initiatives was not for tactical purposes in an attempt to score temporary propaganda gains  but was motivated only by its firm belief in the principles advocated by the United Nations Charter and its commitment to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which has inflicted upon our area untold sorrow and suffering. Egypt's position was also consistent with the provisions of the United Nations Charter concerning the peaceful settlement of disputes. Egypt did not resort to arms as an end in itself; rather  it took that course as a means of shattering the stalemate that had been imposed upon our region  of resisting all attempts at consecrating the ""fait accompli"" and at perpetuating occupation  and of challenging the calls that were being made for military relaxation. In reality  Egypt pursued that course to impart momentum to a just  peaceful and comprehensive settlement. Representatives will no doubt recall that at the time when Egyptian armed forces were shattering the Bar-Lev Line  undertaking the historic crossing of the Suez Canal during the October war and clearing its vicinity of occupation  President El-Sadat called for the convening of an international peace conference with the participation of all interested parties  including the representatives of the Palestinian people  to seek a just and durable peace. It was the October Ramadan war that made it possible for the Palestinian question to occupy its rightful place at the heart of the conflict and at the core of the struggle.123.	Egypt was committed to peaceâboth through its peaceful endeavours and its military battles. It has based its approach to the settlement of the Middle East problem on a single  consistent and well-thought-out policy. We have never adopted a two-faced policy: what we proclaim in public we do not repudiate or alter in private. The general lines of this policy are to be found in Egypt's reply of 15 February 1971 to Ambassador Jarring's aide memoire. In that reply Egypt declared its willingness to enter into a peace agreement with Israel should Israel honour all its obligations as provided in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). That is exactly what we did when we signed the Camp David agreements in September 1978 and the peace Treaty in March 1979.124.	It should always be recalled that the commitment within the framework of the Camp David agreements was that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in all its parts  the United Nations Charter and the principles of international law and international legitimacy were to be the keys to negotiations for a comprehensive settlement restoring to each party its rights. Egypt would thus recover its occupied territories; Syria also would recover its territories; Lebanon would recover its territorial unity; the Palestinian people would regain their rights to own their land in Palestine and to exercise their inherent right to self-determination; and Israel  Likewise  would ensure its own security  within the framework of reciprocal security.125.	In this context  the Egyptian-Israeli peace Treaty is simply an important first step towards the achievement of a comprehensive peace in the area  in order to solve all aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).126.	The Framework for Peace in the Middle East Agreed at Camp David has come under attack and criticism from some quarters; consequently we feel historically committed to place it in the right perspective. The Camp David Framework is the first document signed by Israel in which it pledges to negotiate with the representatives of the Palestinian people the settlement of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects. The Camp David agreement is also the first document in which Israel pledges to respect the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and their just claims. Israel pledges to withdraw its military armed forces from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israel pledges to withdraw the military Government and civilian administration from the occupied Palestinian territories. In addition  the agreements provide for the establishment of a Palestinian self-governing authority in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as part of defined provisional transitional procedures.127.	In other words  part A of the Camp David agreement concerning the West Bank and Gaza consecrates an Israeli commitment to resolve the Palestinian problem by negotiating with the representatives of the Palestinian people  and to establish transitional arrangements which constitute by their nature the bridgeâor the separation markâbetween the current situation  namely the occupation  and the ultimate situation in which the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people should be recognized.128.	Egypt would not have embarked on this arduous task had it not taken the following basic facts into account.129.	First  the Palestinian issue is the crux of the problem and the core of the conflict. Consequently its solution is the sine qua non condition for a just and durable settlement of the Middle East problem.130.	Secondly  the Palestinian issue is a complex multifaceted one that requires us to leave no stone unturned and no possibility unexplored so as not to participate once again in a policy of missed opportunities.131.	Thirdly  the agreement reached concerns transitional arrangements which pave the way for a solution and for the alleviation of some of the sufferings of our brethren in the occupied land. It also provides the opportunity for mutual recognition and opens the door to negotiations between the parties concerned.132.	Fourthly  in all this Egypt does not speak on behalf of the Palestinian people; it is not entitled to do so and never claimed to do so  for it is the Palestinian people alone who have the right to discuss their future and destiny or choose their own representative.133.	Fifthly  the Palestinian people have in all cases the final word with regard to the form and substance of the Palestinian question.134.	Basing itself on the aforementioned considerations  Egypt accepted the Camp David Framework concerning the West Bank and Gaza. It was also owing to those considerations that Egypt entered into negotiations for the creation of a self-governing Palestinian authority in the occupied territories. Our consistent goal  let it be known to all  is to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their inalienable right to self- determination and to restore their full national rights and to see to it that  where such a Palestinian authority is set up  it should be a genuine and not a fictitious power and should be a government issuing from the Palestinian people  governing in its name and safeguarding its interests. It should not be just an image or form  or a council concerned merely with subsidiary or partial matters. Consequently  Egypt has insisted on the importance of guaranteeing the freedom of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and the right of return for the displaced Palestinians and the need to study the modalities of resolving the problem of Palestinian refugees. We also insist upon the necessity of conducting the elections in an atmosphere of political freedom under appropriate international supervision.135.	Egypt is aware that the Camp David Framework does not constitute the final settlement of the Palestinian problem. However  there is no doubt that the agreement has shattered the stalemate that had paralysed the Palestinian problem and has wrenched from Israel concrete commitments for the benefit of the Palestinian people. It constitutes the first constructive step towards the sound resolution of the Palestinian problem.136.	The Palestinian cause is dear to each and every Egyptian. It is central to Egypt's policy and forms the crux and goal of that policy. We are committed to its support. Egypt will accept no alternative to the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. The Palestinian people should not be denied the right to which all peoples are entitled. The people of Palestine have an inherent and absolute right to recover their territory; to have a State of their own; to have security and to raise their own flag. Egypt cannot accept  after all the sacrifices of the Egyptian people  any infringement upon the genuine rights of the Palestinian people.137.	When the League of Arab States was created in 1945 with its permanent headquarters in Cairo  it was at the behest of Egypt that an annex on Palestine  which affirmed its independence  was attached to the pact of the League  although the external aspects of that independence were not yet in existence.138.	Egypt has engaged in four wars for the sake of Palestine and has never refrained from tendering assistance to the Palestinian people in all fields  whereas it has refrained from any interference in Palestinian affairs. Egypt has no organization that can be called its mouthpiece  or any group which could be considered as devoted to it or financed by it. Egypt sets no faction against another  nor does it sponsor a group that serves its interests to the detriment of Palestinian interests. Egypt has consistently condemned the massacres to which the Palestinian people have been subjected in certain Arab countries. Egypt has always refrained from all this  in the hope of maintaining the unity of the Palestinian people  and the Government of Egypt was alone in supporting PLO until the vast majority of the international community recognized it as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  upon an Egyptian initiative. In this context President El-Sadat has  since 1972  called for the creation of a Palestinian Government in exile. The PLO became a full-fledged member of the League of Arab States at Egypt's request. It was decided  upon an Egyptian proposal   to invite it to address the Security Council on an equal footing with all members and  in accordance with a resolution of the General Assembly  issued following an Egyptian initiative  the PLO was to be invited to participate in all Middle East peace conferences. Furthermore  Egypt extended an invitation to the PLO  as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  to participate in the Cairo meeting held in December 1977  following President El-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in November 1977. Egypt extended the invitation because it was convinced that the time had come to start a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue that would pave the way towards negotiations on the Palestinian issue. Egypt is always ready to extend its support to the PLO and to stand by its side. The time has come for serious work  without rhetoric or polemics. Let us unite our efforts to establish peace in the Middle East on the basis of respect for the rights of States and people  mutual respect and mutual recognition.139.	With respect to the issue of Jerusalem  the Holy City revered by the three revealed religions  1 wish to put on record  in very clear terms  the position of Egypt  which may be summarized as follows: Arab Jerusalem is an integral part of the West Bank and should be under Arab sovereignty. Egypt calls for the implementation of relevant United Nations resolutions with respect to Jerusalem. This has been Egypt's consistent position over the years and it will not be altered. Neither the slanders and abuse of rejectionist States nor the intransigence of Israel and its obstruction of peace will make Egypt abandon this course.140.	Egypt will pursue the peace process  issuing the challenge of peace to all parties  the rejectionists and the silent  Israelis and Arabs alike. The Middle East cannot continue in the same way as in the past 30 years  serving the interests of a minority to the detriment of the real interests of the majority and in this way letting the Palestinian people suffer at the hands of gamblers for high stakes who play with destiny  and letting the people of Egypt  Lebanon and Syria make sacrifices  while others indulge in endless overreaching  using the Palestine issue to serve their objectives. The time has come for a radical comprehensive solution to all the problems. Otherwise let those who have a personal interest in the persistence of these problems bear the consequences.141.	We have told the rejectionists  whether among our Arab brethren or not  that we are prepared to join their efforts if they present a viable alternative or if they have a better defined proposal or concrete idea on how to achieve a comprehensive peace. Yet all we hear are loud voices and we are subjected to endless humiliation  abuse  insults and rude rebuffs. May I seize this opportunity to give them a piece of advice. Egypt has suffered much slander. This is not the first time that we have been exposed to their insults. The slanders and insults launched against Egypt at the Shtoura Conference  held in the wake of Syria's break-away from the United Arab Republic in 1%1  are still to be remembered. It was also there that we heard insults  recriminations and foul words far beyond what we are exposed to now. And then  I must add  there was no Camp David at that time and there was no treaty with Israel.142.	Therefore  I must state in all sincerity  that the issue at stake does not relate either to the Camp David agreements or to the Palestinian problem. It is simply that some countries in the Arab region are under the illusion that an opportunity has presented itself to realize their long-coveted dream of taking over Egypt's natural and historical role in the Arab world. They have forgotten  it seems  that such a role is not the result of a conspiracy or a coincidence; nor was it attained by polemics or manoeuvres. It is the natural outcome of Egypt's intellectual and cultural contribution over the centuries. It is the result of sacrifices of generation after generation of Egyptians in upholding the cause of the Arab nation  in maintaining its unity  in defending its dignity and in protecting it 143.	On Israel we have much to say. We extended to Israel the hand of peace  saying that for peace to be just  lasting and comprehensive the Palestinian problem must be resolved in all its aspects. Despite Israel's signing of a document that clearly stipulates that the resolution of the Palestinian problem is the crux of the settlement  we find Israel once again indulging in the creation of new settlements on the occupied Palestinian territories. Israel has also permitted its nationals to purchase land in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Such an action reveals intentions that cannot and should not be tolerated  for it is the application of the policy of illegal colonial settlement. It is also aimed at altering the Arab character of Palestinian territory and at the creation of artificial conditions to obstruct the full restoration of the Palestinian people's right to and full recovery of their territory.144.	In this connexion I should like to reiterate a statement issued by the Prime Minister of Egypt strongly condemning this unabashed policy that is considered a serious violation of international law  a clear contravention of United Nations resolutions  and an obstruction of the peace process  which calls for respect for the rights of all parties  especially those of the Palestinian people.145.	Egypt categorically rejects Israel's policy of building settlements  and will never consent to it. It categorically rejects Israel's policy on Arab Jerusalem  just as it rejects Israel's policy of altering the geographic features and the demographic composition of the occupied territories. Egypt does not  nor will it ever  accept any attempt on the part of Israel to evade its obligations under the Camp David agreements concerning the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. Egypt categorically opposes all attempts to negate the inherent right of the Palestinian people to their land in the West Bank and Gaza. It categorically rejects Israeli aggression against the sovereignty of Lebanon and against the Palestinian people living in Lebanon. The pretext of ensuring Israel's security cannot justify the repeated violation of the sovereignty of States and the killing of the Palestinian people.146.	Israel must refrain from these policies and practices if it wishes the peace process to progress and be consolidated. Also  the Palestinians should reconsider their refusal to join in the peace process.147.	We hereby call upon both Israel and the PLO to recognize one another. We also demand that Israel halt the establishment of settlements and all related measures. Israel should also refrain from all actions that violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon. Furthermore  we call upon Israel and the PLO to initiate a peaceful dialogue. To advance this long- awaited objective  Egypt is fully prepared to extend all the necessary assistance. In this context I wish to declare that Egypt is ready to call for an enlarged inter-national peace conference with the participation of all parties concerned  to ensure the realization of a comprehensive peace in the area.148.	To this end  Egypt would be happy to participate in the international conference mentioned by the Secretary-General  whom it wishes to thank and praise for his untiring personal efforts with a view to contributing to the establishment of a just and durable peace in the Middle East.149.	As you  Mr. President  rightly pointed out in your opening statement  all States have emphasized their commitment to respect human rights. The United Nations has  in its declarations  resolutions and binding international agreements  similarly emphasized and developed the necessity of upholding human rights. Notwithstanding all these international documents  the cause of human rights still requires continuous efforts. It is universally acknowledged that the denial of human rights is the denial of the essence of peace and poses a serious threat to the chances of peace  and it is on that premise that our African policy is based. We therefore completely reject the colonial racism that prevails in South Africa  and we shall continue to spare no effort to support the persistent struggle against its racist policy. It is our conviction that this struggle must continueâand continue it willâuntil equality  dignity and freedom are established in southern Africa.150.	Apartheid in South Africa  foreign occupation in Namibia  attempts at procrastination in Zimbabwe and the continual aggressions committed by the forces of racism and colonialism against Zambia  Mozambique  Botswana and Angola should be met on our part by a joint and resolute stand in order to bring to an end those repugnant manifestations that have come together in this region with a view to exploiting Africa and the Africans. We Africans who have brought about the downfall of colonialism and freed our countries from its vestiges are capable  with our determination and solidarity  of terminating the perilous and dangerous situation in southern Africa.151.	A part of the African consensus on the question of Zimbabwe  Egypt wishes to reiterate the importance of supporting the Patriotic Front  the sole legitimate representative of the people of Zimbabwe. Egypt appeals to all countries to withhold recognition from the Muzorewa Government.152.	Egypt firmly believes that all arrangements relating to the bringing about of peace in Zimbabwe should be under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.153.	We also reiterate our rejection of the December 1978 elections in Namibia  the intent of which was to impose a fake regime against the will of the valiant people of Namibia under the leadership of SWAPO  their sole legitimate representative.154.	Egypt  with its impressive input in the struggle for the liberation of the African continent from racism  colonialism and foreign domination  once again renews its commitment and its pledge to the people of southern Africa that it will continue to extend its unwavering support to the heroic struggle waged by their national liberation movements in Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa.155.	At the same time we condemn equally all forms of foreign presence and intervention in Africa  regardless of their origin. Africa is for the Africans and is not an arena for cold war  international competition and opposing blocs. It is not a dumping-ground for the refuse of international detente. The African continent  having rid itself of the old forms of imperialism and colonialism  will also liberate itself from all forms of neo-colonialism.156.	As I stated earlier  Egypt is an integral part of the third world  and it is totally committed to the principles of non-alignment. Egypt is one of the founding members of the non-aligned movement and was responsible for developing its ideals. It was one of the group that contributed to enhancing the effectiveness of the movement until it became a towering edifice dedicated to safeguarding the independence of developing countries and small countries in general against the tyranny of international blocs and the perils of spheres of influence. It also opposes with all its force foreign domination and colonialism  all forms of encroachment on sovereignty  and intervention in domestic affairs.157.	In this context  Egypt steadfastly supports national liberation movements and consistently strives for the safeguarding of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and the natural rights of peoples. Egypt opposes all forms of foreign intervention and the threat or use of force.158.	Egypt will continue to work for the preservation of the non-aligned movement and against all attempts at deviation  reorientation or derailment of its course which adversely affect the interests of its member States  peoples and nations.159.	Non-alignment is a vigorous and dynamic movement. Its principles  objectives and initiatives are channelled towards the welfare of mankind. We must not forget that the fact that the non-aligned movement called for the recent tenth session of the General Assembly on disarmament also ensured its success. The movement's contribution in all fields of international activity is an established fact. That movement will continue to play this noble role in world affairs as long as it meticulously adheres to its original principles and objectives and does not permit power blocs to impair its effectiveness or to steer it away from its natural course.160.	In the light of recent evolution within the movement  Egypt calls upon all its member States to be aware of manoeuvres that endanger non-alignment and to reject any foreign meddling so that it may safeguard its original principles  its objectives  its unity and its solidarity.161.	Let us remember the words of Julius Nyerere  the President of the United Republic of Tanzania  at the Sixth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement. He said:""We could not form another power bloc  even if we wished to do so. If this movement tried to be another power bloc  or to be aligned to a power bloc  it would cease to exist or to be an influence for peace in the world.""162.	Contemporary international economic relations are passing through a critical phase  in which inflation  debt accumulation  trade-balance deficits and protectionism are endemic. This has direct adverse effects on the rate of development of the developing countries.163.	The failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD to solve effectively the fundamental problems confronting the developing countries is a source of great pessimism. Similarly  the limited results achieved at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development and by the Committee of the Whole  established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  concerning the establishment of a new international economic order have been disappointing to the developing countries and have failed to create an atmosphere conducive to the pursuit of a fruitful dialogue in various economic fields.164.	The Second United Nations Development Decade is drawing to an end. At present we are in the process of drafting a new strategy for the third development decade  a strategy that should be designed to accelerate the development of the developing countries and to bridge the present increasing gap between the advanced and the developing countries. It is therefore imperative that the developed countries should manifest a sincere political will for the radical changing of economic concepts and a true political desire to see economic realities in their correct perspective  and to achieve this end without just agreeing verbally with what the developing countries ask for.165.	While progress towards the establishment of the new international economic order depends to a large extent on political commitment by the developed countries  it is also true that the developing countries shoulder the primordial responsibility for the development of their peoples. It is therefore of paramount importance that they intensify economic co-operation among themselves and achieve collective and individual self-reliance as a principal tool in restructuring international economic relations.166.	Allow me in concluding my statement to reiterate once again that the United Nations is the greatest assembly of nations devoted to the achievement of international peace and security for the peoples and countries of the world. The United Nations shoulders a special responsibility for bringing the world back from the precipice to which it has been led by the frightening arms race and from the escalation and proliferation of nuclear armaments.167.	It may be true that the two super-Powers have come closer to each other on central issues; however on other issues they have agreed to disagree; the expressions ""international detente"" and ""international entente has stemmed from that. Yet we should not lose sight of the fact that the peace resulting from this detente is a fragile and precarious one. The threat of nuclear war still exists  the dangers of regional and local wars are real dangers from which we suffer. Consequently the importance of general and complete disarmament  and particularly of nuclear disarmament under effective international supervision  increases. Only through disarmament can mankind achieve genuine peace and the resulting savings of huge expenditures on arms would accelerate the process of development and consolidate international security.168.	Nevertheless  it can be noted that the easing of international tension has made a significant contribution to the progress of disarmament and to a decrease in arms. It is beyond doubt that the efforts of the United Nations in this field represent a positive contribution to paving the way towards a future era in which mankind will be able to enjoy the fruits of peace. These efforts have been manifested in the form of deliberations  negotiations and study  especially on matters concerning nuclear armaments and on the establishment of zones of peace such as that in the Indian Ocean  and of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa and the Middle East.169.	Peace  as you rightly stated  Mr. President  is indivisible. For peace to be durable it must be just  total and comprehensive. Therefore disarmament and respect for human rights and the principles of economic equality  as well as decolonization  constitute the fundamental elements of peace  which will remain a fragile structure unless we put an end to the arms race and to the shameful violations of human rights  and until such time as we establish the new international economic order based on sovereign equality  common interests  and respect for the rights of all States and peoples  rich and poor  large and small.170.	As long as there are men and women who strive for the good of mankind  who tirelessly pursue the quest for peace  who continue to work towards saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war and who contribute to speeding up economic development and social advancement  the beacon of peace will continue to shine bright over our planet and to guide the steps of mankind towards a better future for all."
"43",2197,"ESP",34,1979,"ï»¿This year we have the good fortune to have as President of the General Assembly Mr. Salim  a veteran of multilateral diplomacy who  in this Organization  has tried his skills with good fortune and effectiveness in the service of various causes  but especially in the noble endeavour of decolonization. In congratulating you most sincerely on your election  Mr. President  may I pay a tribute  through you  to a country  the United Republic of Tanzania  with whose noble people we have maintained excellent relations  as well as to a continent with which we are united  not only by geographical proximity  but also by historical links  common interests and the struggle for the legitimate causes of the African peoples  with respect to whom we have affirmed a growing will for understanding and co-operation.111.	My congratulations also go to Mr. Indalecio Lie'vano Aguirre  under whose wise and prudent guidance this Assembly was able during its last session to deal with many and very difficult questions. His presidency bore witness to the ancient culture and the modern vitality which distinguish his country  Colombia  and which do honour to all the peoples of Ibero- America.112.	I also wish to reaffirm my admiration for the work done by our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who  in the course of this last year  has given us an example of devotion to the Organization  placing his enthusiasm and his prudence  his skill and his tenacity at the service of the United Nations and of the cause of peace.113.	I am pleased to welcome to this Organization Saint Lucia  that most enchanting island  which captured the imagination of Spanish sailors and to whose people I wish to transmit today on behalf of my Government an expression of our will to consolidate those historical links with the most cordial relations of friendship and co-operation.114.	The year which has elapsed since I last addressed this Assembly has not been an easy one for anybody. The international economic crisis has relaxed neither in its causes nor in its effects; on the contrary  in many countries there has been growing unemployment  rising inflation  and continued economic stagnation. New armed conflicts and hotbeds of tension have been added to those already in existence  while the technological abyss and the imbalances in development between the privileged and less-favoured peoples have done nothing but grow  and it has not been possible to reach an agreement to set in motion an effective machinery for the correction of these inequalities.115.	But in the disturbing international panorama which surrounds us we also observe some positive events which permit us to open the door to hope. Prominent among these is the momentum given to the European Communities which  leaving behind doubts and scepticism  have taken decisive steps towards enlargement and the consolidation of their institutions. For the first time in history  parliamentary elections transcending national boundaries have been held. I cannot but see in this a most meaningful step towards the desired goal of the integration of Europe. Millions of men and women directly and immediately participated in the election of their own representatives to the European Parliament so that Europe might proceed apace in affirming its consciousness of unity and solidarity; so that  as Mr. Suarez  the President of the Government  said in Strasbourg  ""Europe will not continue to be the medium of national compromises  but rather the supranational result of common efforts and deliberations.""116.	On 5 February last negotiations began for Spain's accession to the Communities. In making this choice  with the support of all the political forces of my country  the people of Spain wished with one voice to add their strength to the task of building a more complete  united  better balanced Europe  and one more open to the possibilities and problems of the Mediterranean area; a Europe more sensitive to the needs of the developing countries and  above all  to the problems of Ibero-America  an area in which Spain is prepared to make a major contribution; a Europe able to make its own response to the challenges of our time; a Europe firm in its beliefs  faithful to its destiny  and in the vanguard in the defence of democracy  human rights  justice and freedom.117.	In the Ibero-American area  with whose countries we feel ourselves to be united by so many and such close links  there have also been positive events which I am pleased to note. We are witnessing a process of affirmation of the Ibero-American world  whose growing role in world events represents one of the Fundamental developments in the area of international relations. Spain  maintaining as it does ties of special solidarity with these countries  will continue to make its relations with Ibero-America one of the fundamental dimensions of its foreign policy  the better to serve our respective peoples. Our firm European vocation  to which I have just referred  will never be a barrier in our relations with Ibero-America. On the contrary: the two dimensions mutually enrich and complement one another.118.	This special relationship has been strengthened with the entry of Spain  as a full member  into ECLA. This will permit us to experience the problems of the region from within and to broaden the channels of cooperation among our countries. We seek no starring role here; on the contrary  we intend to increase our efforts to contribute to the equitable  dynamic and harmonious development of Ibero-America.119.	But co-operation with Ibero-America does not end in the economic and social fields but lies in a broader and more profound context: that of harmonizing efforts to defend a model society based on democracy and human dignity; of an understanding of life as freedom  solidarity  as a collective endeavour to satisfy the requirements of justice. In this spirit Spain signed with the countries of the Andean Pact and Costa Rica the Quito Declaration of 11 August last. In it we ex-pressed the hope that the process of providing freedom with an institutional framework would continue on the American continent ""... being convinced that the struggle for democracy gives impetus to our own institutional life  encourages the recognition of freedom on the continent and contributes to the organization of the political form best suited to the attainment of our peoples' aspirations to social justice.""120.	My Government has not confined itself to expressing wishes and proclaiming principles but  as is proved by the example of Nicaragua  we have acted on our beliefs with absolute consistency  thus proving our will to contribute to the enormous effort of international co-operation required by that country  a co-operation which is essential so that a people first oppressed and then devastated by war may rebuild in freedom.121.	It was with enormous hope too that we witnessed the conclusion of the treaties on the Panama Canal  which put an end to a situation for which there can be no justification today and which provide the best example of how two countries can  through peaceful and constructive negotiation  solve an old territorial dispute which had cast a shadow on their relations.122.	In his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General points out the need to persevere unswervingly in our support for the United Nations  for which there is no valid alternative. Today more than ever we need clear guidelines and sound criteria for action to do away with injustice  poverty  the violation of human rights and the threats to peace and security which persist in various areas of the planet. We must renew our confidence in the principles of the Charter and provide the Organization with effective means to see to it that they are complied with. But the ultimate responsibility falls on the States themselves  and it will not be possible to advance towards peace and detente in the multiple conflicts which concern us unless there is the political will to accept dialogue and negotiation as means for solving conflicts  thus reconciling positions in a spirit of give-and-take and compromise. To maintain rigid attitudes  expecting total victory and the humiliation of the other party will contribute to nothing more than to perpetuate tensions and confrontations and  ultimately  the suffering of peoples. History is full of examples of that kind of victory  which have served only to nourish a spirit of revenge in a tragic spiral of resentment and sterile and destructive violence.123.	Among all the conflicts and tensions that still persist  Spain is particularly concerned with those which affect the Mediterranean  which is today the object of covetousness  threats and confrontations that jeopardize its security and stability. From this rostrum have emphasized the importance of detente and security in the Mediterranean  as well as the need for the coastal peoples to struggle in solidarity to defend their common interests and increase their reciprocal co-operation so as to lessen the existing imbalances between the northern and southern shores and strive to create a complementary security system. We must avoid the trend to internationalize the tensions and conflicts of the Mediterranean area and prevent it from being used as a testing-ground for influences and pressures at the service of political and economic interests that are foreign to the Mediterranean countries  which thus become pawns in a game over which they have no control.124.	In the last few months it has seemed to us that there is a greater understanding among the Mediterranean countries  more consultation in the defence of common interests and a certain decrease in tension in some of the more burning conflicts. This modest progressâwhich we must encourage and supportâis as yet not enough. The fact is that the old problems of the area remain there.125.	Security in Europe is closely linked with security in the Mediterranean and in the Arab world. Spain  which is linked with those countries by deep historical and cultural bonds and geographical proximity  believes that the European-Arab dialogue should continue and be given greater substance  so that relations between both groups of countries may become closer  new channels of co-operation may be opened up and a positive contribution be made to detente and peace.126.	The Middle East conflict is a grave destabilizing factor in the Mediterranean which has led to confrontation between Israelis and Arabs in four wars and continues to represent a constant threat to international peace and security  with potential risks of incalculable consequences at both the regional and world level. Spain  which has supported the resolutions granting the Palestine Liberation Organization observer status at the United Nations as the representative of the Palestinian people  reiterates its conviction that the recognition and exercise of the national rights of that people  including its right to a country  and the principles contained in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) must constitute a basis for a just peace which will give satisfaction to all the parties concerned.127.	We believe that it is time for the conflicting parties in a confrontation which has caused so many victims and so much suffering to realize that they cannot pursue as an objective the annihilation or humiliation of the adversary. Israel cannot keep the Arab territories it conquered in 1967 in the belief that the passage of time and the presence of the illegal settlements will create a fait accompli; because an illicit act cannot be the source of right  nor can the passage of time legitimize an unjust situation established in violation of the principle of the territorial integrity of States  which has been established by this Organization. On the other hand  we cannot deny Israel's right to exist  because the United Nations has recognized the right of all States in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. When both sides give up their unattainable objectives and realize that there is no other course than that of negotiation  on the basis of respect for the principles established by this Organization  it will be possible to arrive at an authentic peace  which will make feasible coexistence and fruitful co-operation among all the peoples of the area.128.	The peace initiatives which led to the agreements between Egypt and Israel do not yet constitute the global solution which the Middle East needs. Essential questions remain to be solved  such as those which affect the future of the Palestinian people. Although efforts have been madeâwhich we hope will not be- proved vainâwe believe it necessary to respect the principles stated by this Organization to make possible a just solution.129.	We must enter into a clear political commitment to safeguard the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon  support the efforts of its Government and the peace-keeping work of this Organization and prevent foreign influences from transforming that country into a pawn in the power play in the Middle East  thus threatening its survival as a free and independent State.130.	Another hotbed of tension in the Mediterranean area is the situation in Cyprus. We were hopeful at the resumption of the intercommunal talks  which was due in large measure to the efforts of the Secretary-General  who  with perseverance and discretion  managed to overcome not a few difficulties. We regret the interruption of those talks and hope that that dialogue will be resumed and lead to a negotiated settlement that will respect the territorial integrity and political independence of Cyprus and make possible peaceful coexistence and the economic and social development of the Cypriot people.131.	A persistent element of conflict in the Mediterranean region is the situation created by the continued British presence in Gibraltar. At the beginning of my statement I referred to the President's decisive participation in what is perhaps the most relevant aspect of United Nations tasks: its decolonizing work. It will be readily understood that I cannot pass over in silence the injustice that the perpetuation on our territory of a colonial presence represents.132.	Spain continues to be prepared  as it always has been  to negotiate with the United Kingdom to find a formula which  while restoring the territorial integrity of Spain  will make it possible to put an end to this dispute on the basis of respect for the principles and guidelines contained in the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations. We shall go to these negotiations with an open mind  with a desire to find solutions to all the problems and accommodation for the legitimate interests of the Gibraltarians  being confident of the possibilities of a dialogue between two European democracies having so many common interests. It is not possible to continue to turn one's back on the need to solve by friendly negotiations this anachronism which disturbs our relations.133.	The Government of Spain continues to pay special attention to the situation in the Maghreb  where in the recent weeks events have occurred which affect the situation in the area.134.	Our position regarding the Western Sahara is clear. Spain  which put a final end to its responsibilities as an administering Power in February 1976  deems it essential that a just and satisfactory solution for all the parties be found on the basis of the principles and resolutions of the United Nations and of the (OAU)  and on the basis of respect for the right of the Saharan people to self-determination.135.	We are aware of the importance of maintaining and developing the momentum of peace which began last year. Accordingly  we have sought to co-operate in the work of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara by contacts with its member countries. In this context  we received the visit of the Administrative Secretary-General of the OAU. At the same time  we have spared no effort in respect of all the parties to contribute to the establishment of an atmosphere of dialogue and conciliation which will make it possible to pave the way toward a solution 136.	We saw as a hopeful sign the approval by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU at Monrovia of the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee which  as we see it  open up a course which  when developed in co-operation with the United Nations and all of the parties  could serve to bring us forward towards a final settlement.137.	Nevertheless  the latest events in the area cast a pall on the scene and increase the risks of extending the conflict surrounding the Territory.138.	It is our earnest hope that a just  political and lasting solution of this problem will pave the way for peace  stability and understanding among all the peoples of a region bordering on Spain  with whom we wish to maintain and develop our relations of friendship and close co-operation  consistent with the historical ties and profound affinities which unite us.139.	The Government of Spain is making a major effort to plan and implement a policy of greater closeness with the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Both bilaterally and at the level of international organizations  our action with African peoples is based on the following guidelines: first  and above all  resolute support for the United Nations in the struggle against colonialism  apartheid  and racial discrimination; secondly  strict observance of the principle of non-intervention at a time when we are witnesses to a growing participation of forces outside the continent in affairs which only Africans are competent to settle; and  finally  a policy of technical assistance and of economic  financial and cultural co-operation which  seeking mutual benefits  will always respect the uniqueness and the personality of countries which need methods and techniques for the development of their peoples and to reaffirm and safeguard their values  their traditions and their own identity.140.	These are the principles which have guided our co-operation with Equatorial Guinea  today reborn for the African community and for the international community. The Government of Spain  so sensitive to the problems and concerns of the people of Guinea  has thus wished to bear witness as to how we view cooperation in the world today: on a footing of equality  with no interference in internal affairs  far from any shadow of neo-colonialism  and with solidarity  taking on the sacrifices which co-operation demands.141.	My Government  which has been supporting the need for a peaceful transition which will guarantee the complete independence of Zimbabwe on the basis of majority rule  and with the agreement of all parties concerned  viewed with hope the results of the Commonwealth Meeting at Lusaka  at which a will for negotiation was made manifest  thus giving proof of an imaginative effort. We trust that the initiative of the United Kingdom Government to convene a constitutional conference will open up a positive course for a final solution of the problem on the basis of United Nations principles and resolutions  to a solution which will ensure respect for democracy and guarantee the defence of the rights and interests of the various parties involved.142.	Spain considers that the active presence of the United Nations and the application of the provisions of this Organization through an international administration are needed to find the solution required for the problem of Namibia. Guided by these considerations  we voted in favour of resolution 33/206  which the General Assembly approved on 31 May last  because we believe that the illegal occupation of the Territory by South Africa must come to an end and because we support the right of the people of Namibia to self- determination  to freedom  and to independence within a united Namibia.143.	We are concerned at the situation in South Africa and the persistence of a policy of apartheid and of territorial segregation  which gravely injures human rights and is a challenge to the international community  while it is equally a source of grave tensions which affect peace and security in the area  thwarting reconciliation and a peaceful change which will make possible an orderly coexistence among all the South African communities.144.	To the conflicts and tensions in the Mediterranean and in southern Africa has been added the alarming situation in South-East Asia  and particularly in Kampuchea  which is so important for peace and stability in the entire area. My Government considers that these situations gravely affect the fundamental rights of every human being and of peoples  and that a solution must be found on the basis of the principles of territorial integrity  sovereignty  political independence and non-intervention  which it is our duty to respect.145.	A great Spanish philosopher once said that war is not an instinct but an invention. Nor is peace a fact  but an achievement  the result of action by peoples and Governments which  in the final analysis  create or destroy it. Hence  to build peace requires a renewed and permanent effort to establish the conditions of justice  development and freedom which will make it possible. There can be no more noble aim for the collective task of a people than to contribute its hopeful effort to the cause of peace.146.	Domestically and internationally  my Government maintains its genuine and resolute will for peace  convinced of the possibilities of dialogue and negotiation as means of solving conflicts and tensions. For us  true peace  which must be one and indivisible and therefore the work of all  can be achieved only when the conditions which will make it just and lasting are established. These conditions include a reaffirmation of the process of detente to bring relations among all peoples closer on the basis of respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Final Act of Helsinki;  a general and complete disarmament which will enable us to build a less insecure world  liberated from the economic  social and political servility created by an unchecked arms race; a greater and more perfect system of international social justice which will make possible a better distribution of resources and eliminate the existing inequalities between the world of affluence and the world of poverty; and an effective defence and protection of fundamental human rights  which is the final objective and ultimate foundation of any just  free and democratic order  without the universal respect for and effective safeguard of which peace would be devoid of content.147.	The Government of Spain has articulated its foreign policy in terms of the basic concept of international peace and security. We are opposed to threats  to the use of force and to all forms of violence in international relations and we shall spare no effort to settle by peaceful means the conflicts which do persist in the world and to reduce tensions which cast shadows over the international scene.148.	Spain participated actively in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the Final Act of which we signed at Helsinki  and the provisions and principles of that document  having been fully accepted by my Government  inspire our actions. It is now our responsibility to prepare for the next session of the Conference  which is to be held in Madrid in the autumn of next year.149.	Being aware of the importance of the Madrid session  my Government is working actively to make adequate preparations for it. It is true that there are divergent views on the order of priority of items  on how they are to be dealt with and sometimes on their very content. But there are also broad areas of agreement  which we must consolidate and expand. Detente is in a process of continual advancement. It calls for our continued action and solidarity to strengthen international security  reaffirm confidence  dispel suspicion and promote better mutual understanding and closer relations among peoples  superseding past confrontations and advancing along the path of dialogue  co-operation and respect for human rights. It is therefore very important that  with the combined effort of all concerned  we take steps to guarantee the success of the Madrid Conference.150.	Disarmament is the inexorable responsibility of this Assembly. It is a corner-stone in the building of peace and it is one of the essential objectives of our foreign policy. We support nuclear disarmament  under strict and effective international control  because we do not believe in the alleged virtues of an armed peace. Rather we are convinced that arms races have always ended in confrontation  and the nuclear arsenals  being subject to the growing risks of an accident or of the madness of an irresponsible person  have created the objective conditions for the destruction of mankind whenever our vigilance should weaken or  simply  when our good luck comes to an end.151.	Further  the degree of sophistication of weapons absorbs enormous technological  economic and human resources which are diverted from national budgets  sometimes to the detriment of the most elementary needs of the people. The present figures of that waste have attained scandalous proportions. It suffices to say that our world  which needs the means to combat hunger and wretchedness  is devoting almost a million dollars every minute to the manufacture of weapons  yielding to the voracity of power and to the cause of the destruction of resources which unjustly and blindly are denied to the peaceful development of peoples.152.	We have followed with great interest the second round of the SALT negotiations and we are pleased that the Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union have been able to reach an agreement  which we hope will shortly be ratified and come into force. We believe that putting an end to the strategic arms race is a positive factor in the relations between the two superpowers. It strengthens their mutual confidence  contributes to consolidating detente  and opens the way for the third round of the SALT negotiations  which would take up the limitation of tactical nuclear weapons and weapons of intermediate range  which especially affect the countries of Europe. As a European country  linked by treaty with the United States to the Western defence system  and because geography has placed it in a strategic position at the entrance to the Mediterranean  Spain cannot be absent from a negotiation which so directly affects its security.153.	But it is not only nuclear arsenals which must be controlled and eliminated; we must also maintain within reasonable limits the growing increase in conventional armaments  with the objective of genuinely moving towards the desired goal of general and complete disarmament  without undermining our right to security. My Government is alarmed at the development of these arsenals and  above all  at the recent increase in the fraudulent and uncontrolled trade in weapons. Therefore  consistent with our purpose of moving forward to the adoption of effective measures for disarmament  even though they may be of limited scope  we intend to submit to this Assembly a specific proposal  namely that the United Nations  which has established the need to arrive at general and complete disarmament  draft  in so far as it is possible to achieve this objective  a code of conduct  with clear  precise and universal validity  to govern  under the strict control of the United Nations  the sale of conventional weapons to third party countries.154.	These rules would establish the cases in which trading in weapons would not be allowed; they would establish by means of a certificate of final destination and other relevant requirements the necessary guarantees that those arms would not be the subject of later uncontrolled trade; and they would call upon the United Nations to set up the necessary machinery to ensure strict compliance with these provisions.155.	This action would effectively control the trade  so that Governments would assume their responsibility and adequately regulate this branch of their commerce and thus eliminate the figure of the uncontrolled trafficker and fraudulent merchant  who are the true enemies of mankind.156.	My Government has made respect for and universal protection of human rights one of the fundamental dimensions of its foreign policy. I have explained in detail before this forum the principles which guide our action in this field and the concrete measures which  in our opinion  should be adopted by the United Nations to ensure that they are protected and safeguarded and that the means for control are broadened and perfected. There can be no genuine peace unless there is efficient machinery to safeguard and control the protection of human rights. That has very often been reaffirmed in this forum and enshrined in declarations and conventions of universal scope  but not complied with in practice by Governments which  before the international community  have entered into a solemn commitment to observe them.157.	My Government  which condemns the violation of fundamental human rights wherever it may occur  participated in the Geneva Meeting on the refugees from Indo-China and has joined in the efforts of other countries to assist the victims. But we do not confine ourselves to this humanitarian task; we have condemned this mass violation of human rights and denounced the causes which have forced millions of human beings to abandon their homes and their countries.158.	In the month of December last  Spain  by the solemn will of its people  adopted a constitution which represents the culmination of our aspirations to achieve  within a legal context  a peaceful formula of national accord. The Human Rights Committee  in the month of April last  had an opportunity to consider its provisions m depth when our Government submitted the report requested under article 40 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It notedâand I am proud to be able to place this on recordâthat in the field of human rights it is one of the most advanced  balanced and progressive constitutions of our time.159.	Consistent with our guidelines  we have ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms  and we are making progress towards ratifying the European Social Charter  the European Convention on Extradition  the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and the European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. We are thus integrating ourselves fully in the juridical structure of instruments of the Council of Europe with respect to human rights.160.	It is discouraging that in this field the United Nations has been unable to find an effective formula for fighting terrorism. In our view the chief feature of modern terrorism is its international character. Therefore  the reaction of our free and democratic societies must be concerted at the international level so that we may in solidarity defend our institutions and guarantee the first right of our citizensâthe right to live.161.	The United Nations cannot remain paralysed in the face of this new form of totalitarianism which  disregarding both reason and law  tries to impose by force its own violent and desperate solutions. Spain has signed the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and has joined with the members of the Council of Europe in efforts to combat this evil. From this rostrum it reiterates its appeal that the United Nations should overcome the difficulties and prove itself capable of formulating a concrete plan of action to fight effectively this last remnant of irrationality and barbarism.162.	I do not wish to conclude this section of my statement without urging this Organization to adopt effective measures to protect emigrant workers  ensure the exercise of their political and social rights and their rights as workers  and offer them the education and social assistance they and their children need. My Government will always favour any initiative to improve the living conditions of emigrant workers  foster the preservation of the ties that bind them to their respective national communities and facilitate their return to their countries of origin whenever they so desire.163.	In order to build peace  finally  a new impetus must be given to international co-operation based on the principles of solidarity  equality  participation and mutual benefit as an essential element in the integrated and harmonious development of peoples.164.	Spain  situated geographically in the immediate vicinity of Africa and historically within the framework of the rich tapestry of the Ibero-American world  is determined to maintain and increase its co-operation with all developing countries  especially those in Africa and Ibero-America.165.	In contrast to the mechanical interpretation of development as the automatic result of investment  whether financed from external or internal resources  the experience accumulated in recent years has highlighted the decisive importance of human resources and the technological and organizational level of society at a time when we are formulating a new strategy and defining a more just and more humane international model for development with greater solidarity.166.	The attitude of the developing countries in gradually opting for aid in the form of technical assistance and the transfer of technology is consistent with this new conception. International technological co-operation thus becomes a fundamental factor in development and therefore a key element in the new international economic order. It cannot be reduced to the simplistic dimension of mere economic assistance. It must be a richer and more complex reality which includes a profound transformation of international economic structures  a real transfer of technology  particularly intermediate technology  and finally the establishment of both quantitative and qualitative objectives. Thus the concept of development will transcend the idea of simple economic growth to include the full development of the human being.167.	In this spirit  Spain attended the fifth session of UNCTAD  held in Manila from 7 May to 3 June 1979  and the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held in Vienna from 20 to 31 August. We must realize that in these areas and in the more general field of the North-South dialogue the activities of the United Nations have met with varying success. Spain shares the concern expressed by the Secretary-General at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Havana from 3 to 9 September  when he spoke about lack of progress in this field. We hope that the relations between industrialized and developing countries can progressively be placed in a more institutionalized context so that we may single out those areas where a new impetus can be given so that closer co-operation can be achieved. This will satisfy the need for special and differential treatment for the less favoured peoples.168.	We believe that to attain the objectives of the North-South dialogue within the institutional framework to which I have referred will mean closer co-ordination of national economic policies  which will lead to greater economic interdependenceâviewed as a political commitment to co-operate. We view with particular interest the proposal of the Group of 77 with regard to global negotiations on international co-operation for development169.	The difficult economic times the world is experiencing prove that the grave problems cannot be solved by protectionist barriers and nostalgic dreams of autarchy  by actions devoid of solidarity that seek to satisfy narrow nationalistic goals and obtain fragile advantages. The economic problems of our times are clearly international; they affect us all and require the co-operation of all for their solution. No country today is strong enough to do without the markets  the manpower  the technology  the financial resources or the raw materials of others. I said last year that we are in urgent need of practices of international solidarity  for it is not enough to bring about apparent solutions which  based as they are more on self-interest than on any sense of solidarity  may perhaps benefit some countries  but do not eliminate the deepest causes of poverty and under-development.  Today as I survey the scene I have briefly described I can only reiterate those same concerns.170.	That lack of solidarity is particularly grave in relation to energy. We cannot continue to be subjected to the uncertainties of supplies and the fluctuations in the price of oil which ruin all short-term and medium- term economic plans and demand intolerable sacrifices of the weak economies of the developing countries and of countries such as Spain that are struggling to lessen these burdens which become heavier every day. We must persevere in a renewed effort to avoid a spirit of confrontation and to co-ordinate the actions of producers and consumers of energy so as to co-operate in the search for alternative sources of energy  stabilize prices  ensure supplies and clear up a market in which the intermediaries continue to impose their harsh laws.171.	The energy problem has ceased to be simply an economic and technological question. It has become a political issue of major importance. It puts to the test the developed countries' reaction capacity  the real chances of economic take-off in the developing countries and the solidarity of members of the international community  for all are attending to their own concerns and are gradually becoming indifferent to the fate of the rest. Therefore  Spain supports the preparation and convening of an international conference on energy under the auspices of the United Nations.172.	Solidarity in action seems to us essential for the establishment of a new order for the use of maritime areas  which is the ultimate objective of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We reject the idea that this new order may be vitiated either by the requirements of the maritime super-Powers or by their selfishness in ignoring the legitimate rights and interests of all the members of the international community.173.	The Government of Spain is in favour of making a new negotiating effort  so that we may be able to go to the final session at Caracas with a balanced draft capable of winning universal acceptance. To that end  this draft must safeguard the fundamental rights of States without undermining their sovereignty  respect the legitimate interests of their nationals which deserve protection and contribute to shaping a new international economic order.174.	Peace based on justice and freedom is an objective cherished by mankind since time immemorial. Our Organization was founded to try to make it a reality. All the Governments represented here have as their first and unavoidable task to contribute to creating new conditions leading to the establishment of that peace which has been sought for so long. Our guidance will always come from the principles of the United Nations  which we have all accepted and which we are obliged to observe. The principles are there  but something more is required from us. We need imagination in order to adjust them to the needs of a world in transformation. We need to have faith in them in order to overcome setbacks and scepticism. We require the political will that will further common action in an interdependent world.175.	On this will  this faith and this imagination depends the future of the Organization  and so does our own future."
"44",2269,"ETH",34,1979,"ï»¿It is with a sense of both pride and satisfaction that I congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Your unanimous election is not only a timely recognition of your personal qualities as an able and experienced diplomat  but also a fitting tribute to your country  the United Republic of Tanzania  and indeed to its eminent leader  Mwalimu Julius Nyerere 69.	The constructive role you have played in the various international forums  especially in the efforts of the United Nations in the decolonization process  is a matter of record and needs no elaboration on my part. The United Republic of Tanzania  which you so ably represent  is well known for its championship of the just cause of the oppressed peoples everywhere  especially in southern Africa. It is in awareness of these facts that we embark upon our task at the current session of the General Assembly  confident that the explosive and dangerous situation currently obtaining in the southern part of the continent of Africa will receive a thorough examination that will lead to substantial progress in the eradication of the evil systems of apartheid and settler colonialism.70.	I should also like to take this opportunity to convey to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the warm sentiments and appreciation of my delegation for the able manner in which he presided over the work of the last session of the General Assembly. Our gratitude and appreciation go also to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the dedicated and competent manner in which he has guided the Secretariat of our Organization. His sagacity and perseverance have enabled the United Nations to enhance its role in the search for global peace and prosperity.71.	At this juncture I should like  on behalf of the Ethiopian delegation  to welcome the newly- independent State of Saint Lucia into this ever-growing family of nations.72.	Africa  the motherland of one third of the membership of the United Nations  has been the scene of the worst forms of racial degradation  economic exploitation and political oppression. Much has been sacrificed by preceding generations so that we might reach the stage at which we find ourselves today in the continuing struggle for continental liberation. It is true that much of colonial Africa has gained political independence. The last two decades  however  have demonstrated to us that the independence we enjoy today will soon become empty of substance if Africa continues to be divided and exploited for the benefit of a handful of multinational corporations. So will the dignity of Africans remain incomplete as long as the deprivation  degradation and subjugation of the masses in southern Africa is allowed to persist.73.	A gallant and able leader in the struggle for continental unity and liberation has been Mr. Agostinho Neto  the first President of the People's Republic of Angola. The untimely death of this revolutionary leader and eminent statesman is mourned by the struggling masses of Africa with a deep sense of loss and a stronger commitment to his life-long objective of total African liberation.74.	The total liberation of Africa is the responsibility not only of the present generation of Africans  but also of humanity at large. The current situation in southern Africa is marked by the escalation and intensification of the struggle for liberation  on the one hand  and the war of repression and aggression  on the other. The national liberation movements of Zimbabwe and Namibia  with the full backing and support of the African population of those Territories  are actively engaged in demolishing the colonial and racist edifice of Salisbury and Pretoria. In a desperate attempt to arrest the march of history  the racist and illegal regimes in southern Africa are for their part intensifying the repression of the African masses in all territories. The cold-blooded murder of freedom fighters as ""terrorists"" and the arrest and incarceration of the innocent civilian population as ""guerrilla sympathizers'1  as well as the blatant armed aggression carried out against neighbouring independent African States  are becoming daily occurrences.75.	While the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and the Patriotic Front  the sole and legitimate representatives of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe respectively  as well as the national liberation movement of South Africa  are gaining increasing support and assistance from peoples all over the world that love freedom and peace  the collusion and collaboration of certain Western Powers with the racist regimes in Pretoria and Salisbury are also being strengthened. Despite the imposition of mandatory and comprehensive sanctions against Rhodesia and a total arms embargo against South Africa  economic and military collaboration between certain Western countries and the racist regimes continues unabated.76.	In parallel with these developments  both regimes are trying to hoodwink the international community by setting up puppet administrations  composed of the most treacherous and reactionary elements of the black population  in a vain attempt to win international recognition. The freedom fighters are  however  foiling these devious attempts by closing their ranks and exposing the true nature and ultimate objectives of those illegal and puppet organs in Windhoek and Salisbury.77.	The independence of Zimbabwe and Namibia and the emancipation of the African masses from the shackles of apartheid has been for far too long on the agenda of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Now is the time for more concrete and meaningful actions by the international community. To this end  the leaders of independent Africa  at their last summit meeting in Monrovia   resolved further to intensify their assistance to the liberation struggle in southern Africa.78.	In this connexion  I should like to reaffirm revolutionary Ethiopia's unswerving commitment to the just cause of the suffering masses of southern Africa. While saluting all those who have contributed to that liberation struggle  Ethiopia would like to call upon all freedom-loving peoples and Governments to increase material and financial assistance to the liberation movements and to the front-line States  so as to hasten the day of liberation.79.	It is a well-known fact that  without the racist regime of South Africa  settler colonialism in Rhodesia would have long been eradicated. It is equally true that  without We stern collaboration and collusion  the illegal occupation of Namibia and racial subjugation in South Africa would also have long been closed chapters of history. When tackling the situation in southern Africa  we should therefore not lose sight of these facts  and the measures we place should be commensurate with the problems posed.80.	As regards Namibia  the United Nations has a special responsibility. South Africa has slammed the door on all attempts at the peaceful decolonization of Namibia. Abusing the goodwill of the international community  South Africa has indeed attempted to use the negotiating period of the last two years to evolve and establish illegal and puppet institutions to ensure a neo-colonial hold over the economic resources and future developments in Namibia. Though the United Nations has condemned and rejected Pretoria's manoeuvres  these measures by themselves have not altered the situation. It is thus incumbent upon the United Nations to take the necessary measures to implement its decisions so as to ensure the speedy emergence of a free and united Namibia. My delegation therefore reiterates its call to the Security Council to convene immediately and consider the imposition of mandatory and comprehensive sanctions on the racist regime of Pretoria. We hope that the Western permanent members of the Council  namely  the United States  the United Kingdom and France  will heed this call of the overwhelming majority of mankind for the immediate imposition of sanctions.81.	Inasmuch as permanent membership of the Council entails greater responsibility  we had hoped that some of the permanent members of the Security Council would faithfully discharge the obligations they assumed under the Charter of our Organization. To our regret  however  it is in those same countries  particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States  that governmental action is being considered wilfully to violate international obligations and unilaterally lift economic sanctions. We view these developments with the utmost concern. It is obvious that the mere change of colour does not in any way constitute a change in the illegal and colonial nature of the Salisbury regime. That settler domination is still intact in Rhodesia and that  as a result  the struggle for genuine independence  freedom and equality has intensified  needs no further elaboration. In our view  that struggle has to continue unabated until the dignity of the African is fully restored and final victory achieved.82.	If that final victory could be achieved through peaceful means  we would be among the first to welcome it. It is in view of this that socialist Ethiopia and indeed the whole of Africa follows closely the current London Constitutional Conference on Rhodesia. Despite our bitter experience with the series of manoeuvres which have served more to prolong than to expedite the process of liberation  we earnestly hope that the results of the London Conference will lead to a speedy transfer of effective power to the African majority in Zimbabwe.83.	The achievement of majority rule in Zimbabwe and progress in the elimination of racism and apartheid in southern Africa require immediate and determined action by the international community. It is therefore imperative that the decision of the Security Council with regard to the arms embargo on South Africa be fully implemented. In view of the grave threat posed by South Africa's nuclear weapons capability  the Security Council is in duty bound to pronounce itself on the mandatory cessation of all types of nuclear collaboration with South Africa.84.	While discussing the total liberation of Africa  I cannot fail to reiterate my Government's full support for the heroic struggle of the people of Western Sahara for self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the recent decision of the sixteenth session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] 85.	In this connexion  Ethiopia lauds the wise and courageous stand taken by Mauritania in renouncing its claim over  and relinquishing its occupation of  a part of Western Sahara. It is our hope that Morocco will also reconsider its present position and follow the commendable example of Mauritania so that the people of Western Sahara will regain their independence and peace  and security in the region will thereby be ensured.86.	Turning now to the general international scene  we note that the year has been marked by rising tensions and conflicts in Africa  the Middle East  Asia and Latin America  each gravely endangering global peace and security. The world has also witnessed the end of one tyrannical regime after another  a further testimony  if one were needed  to the fact that nothing can stand in the way of a determined people struggling for freedom  equality  justice  democracy and peace. The victory of the Nicaraguan people over the Somoza tyranny and the neo-colonialist regime was secured at the cost of indescribable sacrifice and as the direct result of the heroism of the fighting forces under the leadership of the Sandinist National Liberation Front. In this connexion  the Government and people of socialist Ethiopia warmly congratulate the Latin American and Caribbean countries on the high sense of responsibility  determination and firmness they have so courageously demonstrated in opposing all forms of intervention  particularly military intervention in Nicaragua.87.	We also support fully the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean in their just struggle to attain their legitimate rights over their natural resources and to conduct their political life without foreign interference so as to establish just and equitable social and economic systems.88.	The Middle East situation continues to make the maintenance of international peace and security increasingly difficult. The cleverly orchestrated manoeuvres and betrayals which we have witnessed of late have succeeded only in highlighting the fact that the question of the rights of the Palestinian people is at the core of the Middle East problem.89.	The Camp David agreements  and the subsequent treaty between Egypt and Israel  have not only ignored and circumvented this important and central issue but have also made Israel more arrogant and intransigent. This has been amply demonstrated by the continued establishment of illegal settlements in occupied Arab territories and has increased Israeli aggression against the unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon.90.	Furthermore  the separate deals between Egypt and Israel have increased tension and conflict among the States of the region. For these reasons  socialist Ethiopia rejects these separate deals and maintains that there can be no lasting solution to the Middle East problem unless it is sought within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant United Nations resolutions which require the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories and the full exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights to self-determination and the establishment of their own independent State. To this end  the participation of the PLO in all negotiations on the question is also of crucial significance. Therefore  Ethiopia extends its full support to the just cause of the Palestinian people and the Arab States whose territories have long been occupied.91.	Socialist Ethiopia also urges all the parties concerned to exert the efforts necessary for the resumption of the intercommunal talks among the people of Cyprus with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable solution on the basis of the principles and resolutions of the United Nations. Once again we reiterate our support for the struggle of the people of Cyprus to maintain and consolidate the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and the non-aligned policy of their country and  thus  we call for the cessation of all foreign interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus.92.	The situation in South-East Asia is no less grave today than it was last year. The heroic Vietnamese people have been subjected to yet another foreign armed aggression  but once again they have successfully repulsed the aggressor. However  the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Viet Nam and Laos continue to be under imminent threat.93.	Having overthrown the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary genocidal regime  the Kampuchean people  who are currently engaged in the arduous task of reconstructing their devastated country  are facing the concerted manoeuvres of international reaction and imperialism  which are trying again to impose on the people that discredited and murderous regime.94.	In this regard  I cannot fail to express our deep dismay at the decision by the General Assembly to seat in the United Nations  as representatives of the Kampuchean people  individuals who have been disowned by their own people and discredited by their very actions. This decision will neither contribute to the maintenance of peace and security in the region nor will it enhance the prestige of our Organization. Such an outright denial of reality and justice will rather  in the long run  jeopardize the credibility of the United Nations  an organization which certainly deserves abetter fate than that of its predecessor  the League of Nations.95.	It has been repeatedly confirmed that the cessation of the arms race and progress towards genuine disarmament constitute the most urgent and pressing problem in contemporary world politics. It cannot be over-emphasized that the early cessation of the arms race  particularly in the nuclear field  and the collective realization of the long-cherished objective of general and complete disarmament under effective international control would not only strengthen international peace  security and co-operation  but would also release substantial resources which would benefit the peaceful development of mankind.96.	The newly re-established Disarmament Commission and the Committee on Disarmament have held and concluded their 1979 sessions with some degree of success. Yet the arms race is increasing at a pace which outstrips by far all the efforts to put an end to it. It is  therefore  imperative that all States should muster the necessary political will and strive to use with greater efficiency the newly-established deliberating and negotiating bodies which provide the basis for promoting the programme of disarmament as adopted by the tenth special session of the General Assembly.97.	Last year the General Assembly stressed the urgency of concluding agreements on a comprehensive an of nuclear tests and chemical weapons  Regrettably  not much progress has been achieved during the year and  once again  we wish to underline the responsibility of the Committee on Disarmament for completing negotiations on these important matters. It should also be underlined that any failure on the part of the nuclear- weapon States to meet their responsibility and obligation to halt the arms race and to proceed to genuine disarmament measures will mean that the world is faced with the danger of the continuing erosion of the efficacy of the non-proliferation regime.98.	Obviously  this trend is ominous and it has been further highlighted at the recent Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean. Aware of the dangers of the extension of the nuclear arms race into the Indian Ocean region  the littoral and hinterland States have long striven  individually and collectively  to promote conditions that will ensure the preservation of their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  and also enable them to resolve their political  economic and social problems in conditions of peace and tranquillity.99.	The Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean  which was convened pursuant to the Declaration adopted by the General Assembly in 1971  clearly demonstrated the urgent need for the elimination from the area of the competitive escalation in the military presence of the nuclear-weapon States. Regrettably  and despite the expressed wishes of the littoral and hinterland States  recent developments in the region point in the direction of expanding existing military base; and the deployment of more naval units  which indicates the intensification of the nuclear arms race and thereby gravely endangers the independence  security and stability of the States of the region .100.	At this juncture  I should like to emphasize that the clarion call by the OAU for the denuclearization of Africa can have no effect so long as certain imperialist Powers continue to collaborate in the nuclear field with the apartheid regime of Pretoria.101.	A significant development that has taken place this year in the field of disarmament was the signing  at the conclusion of the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT]  of a treaty by the leaders of the USSR and of the United States of America. There is no doubt that this Treaty is a step in the right direction inasmuch as it contributes to strategic stability and to the reduction of the risk of nuclear war. Since the main thrust of the SALT negotiations is the limitation of the levels of strategic weapons of the two major nuclear Powers  the Treaty can assume global importance only if it constitutes a step in halting  and eventually reversing  the nuclear arms race.102.	It is obvious that any progress in the field of disarmament and the maintenance of global peace and security would essentially require international cooperation  confidence between and among States  and strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We are therefore satisfied to note that two of the new proposals submitted to the current session of the General Assembly are of direct relevance to the furtherance of the objectives of disarmament and the strengthening of international security. We refer here to the proposals submitted by Czechoslovakia and the USSR and entitled  respectively  ""Adoption of a declaration on international cooperation for disarmament""  and ""Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"". These two items are not only timely but also of crucial importance for the maintenance of international peace and security  and the Ethiopian delegation is pleased to extend its wholehearted support to them.103.	I should like to turn now to a subject which is no less vital and pressing: that of economic co-operation and development.104.	As we are al I aware  the international community finds itself at present in the midst of important negotiations in the economic field  which will have a critical bearing on our endeavour to create a just and equitable world economic order. The demand for equity and justice requires fundamental changes in the international economic system to assure to all nations a fuller participation in international economic life and an equitable share of benefits accruing there from. Although this perception found its expression in the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of the New International Economic Order which was adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  the results obtained so far leave much to be desired.105.	The negotiations conducted until now between developed and developing countries in various international forums to bring about structural changes have reached a stalemate. This lack of progress is due  evidently  to the absence of a genuine political will on the part of the large majority of developed countries to engage in meaningful dialogue. That was apparent during the fifth session of UNCTAD held last May in Manila  in the meetings of the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy  and at the recently concluded session of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  where the industrialized countries demonstrated increasingly inflexible positions towards the legitimate demands of the developing countries.106.	The inward-looking policies adopted by the developed countries have not only rendered the process of negotiation more difficult but have also made elusive the attainment of the goals set out at the seventh special session of the General Assembly. We are not simply concerned at the lack of political will to expedite those negotiations. If the dialogue between North and South is to succeed  a political vision is required  a vision which is inspired by the promise of a just future  rather than one marred by the desire to cling to the short-term privileges of the present. So long as the developed countries persist in their old ways  no realistic solution can be worked out for the major issues which affect the developing world.107.	My delegation firmly believes that the international community should seek a new initiative and a dynamic approach to achieving concrete results which would enhance the establishment of the New International Economic Order. In that regard  we subscribe fully to the proposal of the Group of 11 that global negotiations on international co-operation for development be launched at the special session of the General Assembly in 1980. We believe that this approach  which was initiated at Havana by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  will be innovative and bring about a break-through in the present stalemate.108.	We should exert our efforts to demonstrate a change in attitude and to embark on a new approach to bringing an end to the present climate of uncertainty and disenchantment in international economic relations. It is thus the view of my delegation that international economic relations built on the status quo will produce an adverse trend in the international economic situation which  in our opinion  will not augur well for peace and security.109.	My delegation is of the view that the international community should share a vision of the world in which justice and equality prevail. It is equally of the view that an equitable world economic order can and must be based on an equitable economic system within each nation. Being strongly committed to the achievement of social justice at the national level  we are at present carrying out basic and fundamental structural changes in our country in all socio-economic fields.110.	The Government of socialist Ethiopia has embarked upon a genuine economic development programme in a determined effort to raise the standard of living of the masses which for centuries languished under an archaic feudal system. In that regard  a proclamation has been issued providing for the establishment of a national revolutionary development campaign and a central planning supreme council  the main objective of which is the reconstruction of the national economy  which has been ravaged by wars of aggression  repeated natural calamities  and by acts of sabotage instigated and assisted by the forces of reaction and anarchy.111.	In his address to the nation on 3 February 1979  on the occasion of the inauguration of the short-term plan of the national revolutionary campaign. Comrade Chairman Mengistu stated the following about the options open to our people:. . . it is a historical day on which a choice has to be made between a country where the broad masses of Ethiopia would forever remain hungry  deprived  alms-seekers  illiterate  etc.  or a country  a socialist one  proud and strong  in which equality  justice  peace  happiness and collective prosperity prevail"".112.	The Provisional Military Government of socialist Ethiopia  cognizant of the fact that the nation's economic destiny lies first and foremost in the hands of its own people and resources  has mobilized the country's human and natural resources to increase the productive capacity of the nation  primarily in the agricultural and industrial sectors.113.	Stressing the expedience of improving the food supply of the nation during the campaign  Comrade Chairman Mengistu also said:""Our campaign will chiefly concentrate on the agricultural  industrial  commercial and social fields  with special emphasis on the question of finding a solution to the current food-shortage problems. Our first and foremost task  therefore  is to save our fellow countrymen from the scourge of hunger  to which they had been subjected for so long.""âThus the current phase of the campaign gives priority to the settlement of people who have been uprooted as a result of the recurrent and prolonged drought and other natural disasters  from marginal areas to potential agricultural sites in different regions of the country.114.	This undertaking has beyond any doubt put a heavy strain on our meagre resources. The financial burden has been shouldered so far by all Ethiopians who look on the campaign as a part of their sacred duty to help their less fortunate brothers and sisters. Since the sacrifice and contribution of our people alone would not be sufficient  we believe that the international community  which made a worthy contribution towards our relief efforts in the past  will equally demonstrate its humanitarian concern in the resettlement and rehabilitation effort currently under way  by coming forward with generous contributions.115.	My delegationâand  indeed  the great majority of this Assemblyâis guided by the thorough analysis of the international situation and the historic decisions adopted at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries  which was held in Havana  Cuba  only a few weeks ago. It would therefore be appropriate to make a brief reference to that historic Conference  if only in order to refute the self-appointed critics of our movement who  for their own selfish ends  are desperately trying to divide the non-aligned countries.116.	It is to be recalled that  prior to the Havana Conference  imperialism and international reaction were feverishly engaged in a well-orchestrated campaign of vilification directed against the host country of the Conference with the aim of thwarting its proceedings. Nevertheless  their efforts failed and the movement emerged stronger and more united than ever. Cuba  as the host country  and its revolutionary leader  Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz  therefore deserve our deepest gratitude and appreciation for the important role they played in making the Conference a great success.117.	The pronouncements made at the Conference by most of our leaders  the Final Declaration  the Programme of Action  and the resolutions that were unanimously adopted were not only indisputable evidence of the outstanding success achieved at Havana but also a clear demonstration of the solidarity and the unity of purpose of the non-aligned countries. At Havana  the movement strongly reaffirmed its vigorous opposition to imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  apartheid and racism and charted a viable programme of action for the years ahead.118.	It is precisely because of this fact that imperialism and big-country chauvinists with expansionist and hegemonistic ambitions persist in their concerted efforts to hamper the implementation of the decisions adopted at Havana and to undermine the unity of the non-aligned countries. These devious attempts should be condemned and rejected with the contempt they deserve.119.	As we enter the new decade of the 1980s  we see the world faced with new challenges while existing problems still remain to be solved. It is recorded in history that each decade and each century has posed its own challenges  and more often than not humanity has mustered its ingenuity and resources and has met such challenges with courage and determination. It is our firm conviction that the issues and problems of the 1980s will be faced with the required vision and determination. We are also confident that the United Nations will play a more constructive and active role in the creation of a world order based on peace  justice  freedom  equality and prosperity."
"45",2315,"FIN",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I congratulate you on your election to the office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly . We know you as a greatly respected representative of a country with which Finland maintains a particularly close relationship  Under the leadership of the eminent statesman  President Nyerere  the United Re-public of Tanzania has played a major role in African and in international affairs. Let me pledge you the full support of the Finnish delegation in your important task.213.	May I also extend a warm welcome to the newest Member of the United Nations  Saint Lucia.214.	We come to this rostrum to speak in the name of our Governments. We do so because the United Nations is an Organization of sovereign States. Yet Governments represent peoples  and it was in the name of those peoples that the United Nations was founded. As representatives of Governments  we should base our action on the hopes and aspirations of our peoples.215.	Individuals  today's youth in particular  perceive the future as uncertain  even as frightening. Despite the efforts to achieve progress in arms limitations and disarmament  the arms race continues. Although there is consensus about the imperative need to solve the problems of under-development and poverty  the gap between the poor and the rich is widening. The wasteful use of scarce natural resources and the deterioration of the human environment endanger the basic living conditions of the present generation and of future generations.216.	There is a widespread feeling today that the world is adrift  and time does not seem to work for us.217.	First of all  this uncertainty is increased by the fact that the positive trends of detente and disarmamentâonly recently so clearly discernibleâseem to be losing their momentum. Disarmament  while yielding some significant results  is put in jeopardy by the concomitant intensification of the arms race. This threatens the results achieved in terms of enhanced security for the parties themselves and for the world at large. At the same time  it represents an added economic burden on nations and individuals. Patterns of peaceful cooperation based on detente are in danger of being eroded. The use of force is on the increase between nations as well as within them.â218.	Secondly  in the world economic system  it has become evident that the old order no longer functions. Yet there are no new mechanisms ready to take their place. Problems of underdevelopment are recognized  but consensus about solutions is yet to emerge. The resulting confusion and uncertainty are something that none of usâwhether developing or developedâcan afford.219.	Thirdly  industrial growth threatens to lead to an increasing use of non-renewable resources  putting a heavy burden on the environment. Energy in particular is a case in point; all available energy alternatives that are quantitatively significant have detrimental effects on the human environment.220.	Since they are faced with this situation  the be-wilderment and deep anxiety of individuals in all our countries is not only understandable  it is justified. This is a reality that the Governments here at the United Nations have to take into account.221.	What we need is a clear sense of purpose and direction. To control its future  the world community must have an effective international machinery. Because of its universality  the United Nations is in a unique position for harmonizing the action of nations on the key issues of our time  whether political  economic  social or environmental.222.	In view of the vast challenges before us  we must ensure the efficiency of the world Organization. There-fore we must be prepared to examine ways to improve both the structures and the procedures of the United Nations system  its peace-making and peace-keeping capabilities in particular.223.	The signing of the SALT Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States is an encouraging development  although it is a partial and limited measure. It should be implemented without delay. If it is succeeded by subsequent qualitative and quantitative limitations of nuclear weapons  the Treaty will be a significant step towards making the world safer from the outbreak of a nuclear war. The Talks are an indispensable contribution to the process of detente. We hope that the SALT Treaty will prove a further contribution to that end  and particularly to the relations between the two leading nuclear Powers.224.	In all disarmament negotiations  new approaches are needed. As weapons become ever more sophisticated  negotiations to limit them face danger of getting trapped in a morass of analyses and comparisons of their technical properties. The use and purpose of a weapon and its impact on over-all security  rather than its technical qualities  should be given more weight in negotiations.225.	My Government is a consistent supporter of all efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and has made several initiatives in this field. We have voiced our concern over developments that we have considered contrary to these efforts. We have been particularly concerned about the prospect of nuclear weapons in regions where peace and security are already in jeopardy. Recent indications that an increasing number of Governments in the world's areas of conflict might be pursuing a nuclear weapons capability are a forceful reminder of this danger. We believe that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is the best instrument to avert the danger of the spread of nuclear weapons. We have noted with satisfaction the recently increased adherence to the Treaty. We look forward to the second Review Conference on the Treaty  which we hope will further contribute to the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime.226.	The General Assembly has repeatedly called for a comprehensive test ban  as it has for a treaty on chemical weapons. We regret that  despite certain advances  neither of these important goals has yet been reached. In spite of these disappointments  there is reason to welcome the recent steps towards a treaty on radiological weapons.227.	Our own continent  Europe  seems perilously close to yet another  even wider  round of arms build-up  both nuclear and conventional. All efforts should be made to avert this danger. Thus  the talks in Vienna should be intensified. Further  the recent initiatives to approach disarmament in Europe on a continental scale should be given more consideration than they have received.228.	The negotiations  whether regional or global  should be urgently broadened to deal with weapons  particularly nuclear weapons  at present outside their scope. As a contribution to the solution of arms- limitation problems in Europe  Finland has pursued the suggestion that President Kekkonen made in May 1978 on a Nordic arms control arrangement designed at the same time to keep the Nordic region outside nuclear strategic speculations.229.	In Europe  despite uncertainties in many fields and areas  the community of interest in security and co-operation has generally remained stable and balanced. The process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  highlighted by the signing of the Helsinki Final Act over four years ago by the high representatives of 35 participating States  has continued. The recently growing interest of States participants in the Conference in confidence-building has focused the attention of Governments on more direct and immediate factors of security. These signs of interest and political will  together with consistent efforts towards the full implementation of the Helsinki Final Act  would give reason to approach the second follow- up meeting to be held in Madrid in 1980 with expectations of substantial results.230.	The future of Europe in a changing world cannot be founded on power politics and continuing armament but must  rather  be founded on tolerance of diversity and willingness to compromise and to seek solutions based on co-operation. This pattern  represented by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  cannot  perhaps  constitute a model in a larger international context. But the basic spiritâan approach based on the indivisibility of security and mutual interdependenceâreflects a broader trend in the nature of international relations in which responsibility is shared and a common interest is jointly recognized. This spirit is needed in the United Nations also.231.	This thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly was preceded by the Sixth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held at Havana from 3 to 9 September. Finland has remained outside power blocs of all kinds  like the members of the non-aligned movement. Recognizing that movement's importance in world affairs  Finland has attended its meetings since 1964 as an invited guest. At this time we hope that the non-aligned movement  which comprises the overwhelming majority of the Members of the United Nations  will continue to play its traditionally constructive role in this Organization.232.	The goal of the United Nations in the Middle East is to establish a just and lasting peace. This presupposes that all Governments and parties concerned will commit themselves to the search for peace in the region. Time itself does not work in favour of a just and durable peace in the Middle East. The Finnish Government had expressed the hope that the Treaty of Peace between Israel and Egypt would promote the achievement of a comprehensive settlement. Such a settlement alone can bring a just and lasting peace to the region. It is the well-known and unchanged position of my Government that a comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Further  the solution requires recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  including their right to national self-determination. The Palestinians must be fully involved in any settlement and be able to participate in its negotiation. Israel has to withdraw from Arab territories occupied in 1967. Likewise  it is imperative that the right of Israel and its neighbours to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries be guaranteed.233.	It is essential that all parties to the conflict demonstrate a spirit of accommodation and moderation and avoid measures that would further complicate the peace efforts. The Finnish Government deplores in particular the failure of the Government of Israel to abide by United Nations resolutions with regard to settlements in occupied Arab territories.234.	The cycle of violence in southern Lebanon has seriously endangered the safety of the civilian population and has hindered implementation of the mandate of UNIFIL. The Finnish Government fully supports restoration of the authority and sovereignty of the Government of Lebanon over its territory.235.	While the search for peace goes on  the United Nations peace-keeping forces in southern Lebanon  on the Golan Heights and in Cyprus continue to play an invaluable role in the maintenance of international peace and security. Their presence  which must not be a substitute for the peaceful settlement of these conflicts  should be fully utilized by the parties for peace-making. These operations put a heavy burden on the Organization  and particularly on the troop- contributing countries. The General Assembly should therefore bear in mind the need further to strengthen the peace-keeping capabilities of the United Nations. This would also help the Organization to respond more efficiently to new demands that it carry out peacekeeping operations 236.	The situation in southern Africa is perhaps the gravest challenge to the capacity and  indeed  to the very credibility of the United Nations. The policy of apartheid is at the core of the problems in the area.South Africa is the only country in which racism is an official State philosophy. During recent weeks we have seen fresh examplesâsuch as the creation of a new Bantustanâof the South African Government's defiant pursuit of the practice of that doctrine in the face of universal condemnation. Systematic violations of human rights within South Africa itself and acts of aimed violence against neighbouring countries are inherent in that policy. As long as it continues  the United Nations has no alternative but to increase international pressure against South Africa. The Nordic countries will continue their active involvement in this work.237.	As for Finland  we still maintain a degree of hope for a negotiated settlement aimed at majority rule and genuine independence in both Namibia and Zimbabwe. This is so not only because of our general conviction that international conflicts should be solved by peaceful means but also because we sincerely believe that negotiations are the best and most realistic method of seeking independence for those countries in a way that is acceptable to the international community. It is obvious that the sanctions imposed on Rhodesia by the Security Council must be maintained until an internationally acceptable solution has been reached.238.	It is against this background that we continue to give our support to the ongoing efforts to implement the Security Council plan for the independence of Namibia and welcome the initiative of her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom  endorsed by the Commonwealth countries  to bring all the parties directly involved in the Rhodesian issue to the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London. These recent developments are encouraging but  at the same time  they may very well be the last chance to achieve peaceful solutions. Were it not for the patience and statesmanlike flexibility shown by the front-line States and other African countries  there would exist no such chance at all.239- Finland  together with the other Nordic countries  has declared its readiness to assist in the process of transition towards the independence of Namibia and Rhodesia. That commitment stands.240.	The Government of Finland  on the basis of its Nordic traditions of freedom  solidarity and justice  stands ready to support effective international respect for human rights. I have had the occasion to state from this rostrum the view of my Government that human rights are a matter of importance for peace and good relations between States. This applies with equal emphasis to all human rights  civil and political as well as economic  social and cultural. It applies also to the work being done  particularly now  during the International Year of the Child  to secure the enjoyment of human rights for children  the generations of the future.241.	The plight of refugees is one aspect of the general question of human rights  which has recently been at the centre of attention because of events in South-East Asia. It is encouraging to note that the international community has been able to take action quickly with respect to the situation of refugees and displaced persons in that region  particularly as a result of the Geneva Meeting in July of this year. This shows that co-ordinated steps can be agreed to on a large scale and that they can produce concrete results in matters of international human concern.â242.	At the same time  we must not lose sight of the fact that only partial solutions have been achieved. The total dimensions of the problem derive from the fact that there are as many as 12 million refugees in Southeast Asia  Africa  the Middle East and Latin America who are deprived of their basic human rights  Their suffering should serve as a constant reminder to all Governments of the need to share the responsibility both forgiving immediate relief and for reaching peaceful solutions in situations of political crisis that may cause flows of refugees.243.	On the threshold of the 1980s the international community seems to have accepted the fact that there can be no return to the old economic order which has prevailed since the Second World War. Despite its obvious short-comings  that order at least bore the semblance of being based on a set of established ground rules. At present  rampant inflation  the threat of worldwide recession  the glaring contradictions of waste and want  all point in one direction. The current turmoil in the world economy must be resolved by the establishment of a New International Economic Order reflecting these new economic realities. Otherwise  we shall run the risk of losing whatever control we may still have over the international economy. But the New International Economic Order must also reflect long-term considerations of central importance  in particular with respect to the rational use of the world's finite natural resources and the preservation of man's environment  which are the key questions in all global economic and social planning.244.	The world community is also beginning to realize that the establishment of such a new order is not possible without necessary adjustments in the production and consumption patterns in all countries. It is important to perceive these inescapable adjustments as a continuous process. In Finland  adjustments to changing conditions in the international economy through structural changes in production remain an essential element of our economic tradition  which is based on a market economy. Against this background  my Government approaches with an open mind the new situation  in which our relations with the economies of the developing world occupy an increasingly important place. Yet  efforts by individual Governments are of little avail  unless a degree of accord exists among the nations of the world on the general direction and purpose of structural change. We look to negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations system to provide the international community with such guidance.245.	The proposals which emerged from the recent Conference of non-aligned countries and which were further considered in the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 are  in our view  a valuable contribution to this process of negotiation. My Government has repeatedly stressed that global issues  such as energy  should as far as possible be debated in global forums. The time has indeed come to formulate instruments of economic and social policy for the rest of this century. The main instrument in the United Nations must be the international development strategy for the 1980s. In this context we welcome all initiatives which sincerely aim at an open and universal dialogue on the most pressing and immediate problems of the world economy and which hold the promise of providing the international community with unity of purpose on economic matters.246.	The most important task of the United Nations in the 1980s will be the promotion of detente and disarmament  and the realization of a New International Economic Order in accordance with sound ecological principles. We must focus our action not only on ourselves but also on the coming generations.247.	Our principal concern should be the individual human being  his welfare  his dignity and the quality of his life. In short  our task is to implement the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations."
"46",2360,"FJI",34,1979,"ï»¿Our association with Ambassador Salim in his capacity as Chairman of the special Committee on decolonization gives me added pleasure as I offer him our congratulations on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly.197.	I take this opportunity also to thank his predecessor  Ambassador Lievano  for the manner in which he conducted the previous session of the General Assembly.198.	Early this year I had the honour and pleasure of representing my country at the independence celebrations in Saint Lucia. It is therefore a matter of particular pleasure for me to welcome it to our Organization and to extend our co-operation to it.199.	Nine years ago today  Fiji became a Member of the United Nations. The intervening nine years have for us been full of excitement in our endeavours to build a nation based on tolerance and mutual understanding. We have had our successes  and our disappointments also. However  the experience of being independent  of being able to decide things for ourselves  has been exhilarating and challenging.200.	We have during this same period enlarged our circle of friends  first within the region. We have witnessed the emergence of new nations in the South PacificâPapua New Guinea  Tuvalu  the Solomons  and Kiribati. We look forward to the New Hebrides next year assuming its rightful place  and we also hope that others too in the South Pacific will join the expanding group of independent States in the region.201.	Since becoming independent we have tried to foster regional co-operation because we believe that for us in the South Pacific  scattered  as we are  over a large expanse of ocean  there are problems that are best resolved on a regional basis. Arising out of this belief  we have encouraged and participated very actively in the establishment and development of several regional institutions: the University of the South Pacific  the South Pacific Forum and its executive arm the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation  the South Pacific Commission and  the most recently created  the South Pacific Fishery Agency.202.	Speaking of widening our circle of friends  we have been more than encouraged by the wide range of assistance we have received from many since we became independent. In particular  we are grateful to our near neighbours Australia and New Zealand  to the United Kingdom and the European Economic Community  among others  and  finally  to the United Nations itself and its specialized agencies. The fact that we are a party to the Lome Convention has provided us with a unique opportunity to forge new links with Africa. It has also given us a better perspective and insight concerning Africa and its aspirations to social  economic and political betterment. Moreover  this membership has enabled us to continue our contacts with the Caribbean countries with which we share certain common characteristics and development objectives.203.	In the United Nations itself  the most important benefit we have derived is the opportunity to be heard. No other international forum exists which treats States of different sizes  wealth and power on an equal footing  as does the United Nations. It is vital that this important characteristic remain intact. It would in our view destroy the universal character of the United Nations if Member States were categorized on any basis other than that of sovereign equality.204.	Equally  another most important advantage of being a Member of the United Nations is the opportunity it affords us to participate in the discussion of a wide range of issues many of which affect us nationally  regionally and on the international level. Again  our participation on an equal footing with many others who are better endowed with resources is an advantage that we value very greatly. In this regard we have attempted to play an active role  especially through our membership of the Special Committee on decolonization  UNDP and  of course  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  to name but a few areas. These are very positive elements in our experience as a Member.205.	An area in which we have always had great interest and concern is that of human rights. We are concerned because our own society is a multiracial  multicultural and multi-religious one  and  in our view  in such a society great care and sensitivity are needed to ensure that no segment of the community is deprived in any way.206.	We are of course saddened and discouraged by the continued violations of human rights in many parts of the world. We feel that violations  especially those that take place under the pretext of national security  diminish and lower the esteem in which our Organization should be held.207.	What makes it more disconcerting is that there are some who are ready to stand on the prosecutor's chair and point at others when their own record will not stand up to close scrutiny. At times  elements within our Organization have taken it upon themselves to be both judge and jury at the same time. Furthermore  the disparities and the wide gulf existing between the rhetoric uttered in the conference halls and what takes place on the ground has led many of those who are well disposed towards our Organization to lose their sense of equanimity. We also find a tendency for some to go by the letter of the law  so to speak  and to ignore certain realities. Speaking from this rostrum on 21 October 1970  our Prime Minister  the Rt. Hon. Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara  observed that:""the setting of standards must not assume that there are universal solutions to problems in all parts of the world. There must be particular diagnoses of the problems and special treatment for special cases.""12208.	We have followed with interest and concern the anguish of the boat people. We are encouraged by the bold and courageous initiative taken by the Secretary- General to convene an international Meeting in Geneva to deal with this refugee situation. While the actions and assistance that flowed from the Meeting are to be com-mended  we believe that  if a permanent and durable remedy is to be found  clearly the root-causes of why so many people risk their lives to leave their own countries must be determined and resolved. Yet only too often we sense a reluctance on the part of our Organization to come to grips with such situations  particularly if the major Powers are involved.209.	While major international political difficulties remain unresolved  we are encouraged by some actions and movements of late. On Zimbabwe  for instance  we hope that the meeting now being held in London will lead to a happy and satisfactory conclusion for all concerned.210.	The resolution of the complex Middle East issue is urgent because genuine peace has remained elusive for the last 32 years. Speaking from this rostrum last year  the representative of my delegation welcomed the bold initiatives that led to the Camp David agreements and the signing of the peace' treaty between Egypt and Israel.  We have continued to follow closely the turn of events  including such developments as the recent Israeli withdrawal from some occupied territories  such as the Egyptian Sinai. But much remains to be done  for there are still Arab areas under Israeli occupation. If a just and enduring solution is to emerge in this long-troubled region  it is imperative that continued efforts be directed towards the attainment of a comprehensive solution  embracing all aspects of the question  including the national rights of the Palestinian people.211.	There is a wide consensus that the matter of Palestinian rights is at the heart of the Middle East question. It would therefore seem important to bring the Palestinian representatives into the negotiating processes. Recently  there have been some signs of contact and dialogue. We believe that such dialogue and discussions offer encouraging prospects for the peaceful solution of the entire problem. However  it needs to be reiterated that a just and lasting peace in the area could result from the recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to their national homeland  as well as the acceptance of the rights of all States in the region  including that of Israel  to exist within secure and recognized borders.212.	While we have been encouraged by the Camp David initiative and the subsequent discussions between the parties involved  we have nevertheless noted with dismay the recent decisions concerning Israeli settlements and the sale of occupied Arab lands. We view these actions as counter-productive to the ongoing negotiations.213.	We continue to note with concern the inevitable effects  on Lebanon  of events in the Middle East only too often with tragic consequences. For Lebanon's once thriving multicultural society seems almost to have lost the peace and stability it once enjoyed. The reality of the situation is that a sovereign State Member of the United Nations finds itself increasingly the victim of situations emanating largely from beyond its borders. And faced with this reality  my delegation feels it vital that the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon be respected.214.	Following a spate of violence  from which the practice of the so-called pre-emptive strikes cannot be divorced  a fragile peace appears to exist in Lebanon today. We are concerned at the continued attacks on targets in southern Lebanon  particularly when these affect civilian populations. We therefore appeal to all to exercise maximum restraint and thereby allow full normality to return to the area.215.	It was because of our firm commitment to inter-national peace and security that we decided to contribute to the United Nations peace-keeping efforts in Lebanon. I need not dwell on the importance of the United Nations efforts in this regard  for the Secretary- General has treated this subject with his usual eloquence in his annual report to this Organization. What must be recalled  though  is that peacekeeping responsibilities need not be the exclusive domain of some. For  after all  the maintenance of global peace and security remains the dominant preoccupation of this world Organization  and our practical contributions towards this end should  we believe  correspond with the solemn pledges that we undertook in accepting the provisions of the United Nations Charter.216.	Fiji remains committed to its participation in the United Nations peace-keeping operations in Lebanon. However  it would be less than honest of me not to mention the drain on our limited financial resources as a result of our participation. We are sure that other troop contributors to this most difficult peace-keeping operation  especially those from developing countries  also feel the financial strain. Yet  this would not be the situation if Member States adhered to their obligation to contribute to the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. We call on the General Assembly to make a bold decision on this question during this session. The responsibility of peace-keeping is an international one and should not be left to the few. We hope that the rhetoric displayed by most of us on the question of peace will be matched by positive action. The Secretary-General  who is carrying out the direction of the Security Council in this regard  is placed in an impossible position when some refuse to honour their obligations.217.	We are encouraged to note that the formal adoption of a convention by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is envisaged for August 1980. Such an accomplishment would give a tremendous uplift to international co-operation within the United Nations system at a time when other multilateral negotiations now taking place within the framework of the United Nations are clearly facing difficulties. It is essential that all States should take urgent heed of the dangers of any further delay and reassess their positions to complete the long-sought convention. Any delay will not only jeopardize a rational use of the seas and its resources but will also cast a dark cloud on the ability of the United Nations to act as a forum for multilateral negotiations.â218.	Many of the carefully negotiated and generally acceptable provisions of the negotiating texts of the Conference have already found recognition in much national legislation  thus allowing many States to claim appropriate jurisdictions and to assume appropriate ob-ligations  particularly with regard to living resources of the sea. The development of the law relating to resource jurisdiction has been particularly significant to developing countries  such as my own  which are small islands. Under the protection of the newly recognized jurisdictions  fishing has become a significant export industry for my country. There is promise of substantial growth of this industry. However  like many others  we require assistance to develop these resources and co-operation in their rational use.219.	The most important species of fish that our fishing industry is dependent upon is tuna  and we call upon all States to recognize our sovereign rights over that species and other migratory species in our 200-mile exclusive economic zone. Such a recognition by all would be in accordance with the accepted norms of the law of the sea and is vital to our new industry. No form of assistance can be a substitute for the legitimate recognition of our sovereign rights over our own resources. In this respect  we look forward to the cooperation of distant-water fishing countries which have fleets in the region. We hope that it will not be necessary to ask the General Assembly to request an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on this issue.220.	In order to secure an orderly development of new jurisdictions over the living resources of our seas  Fiji has joined in regional co-operation with other South Pacific countries to set up the South Pacific Fishery Agency  whose main function is to harmonize fisheries policies in the region and to adopt a co-ordinated approach in their negotiations with distant-fishing countries. Although the South Pacific Fishery Agency is restricted to the countries members of the South Pacific Forum  a study is being made of the desirability of setting up a wider organization to include countries from outside the South Pacific with fishing fleets in the region to co-ordinate the conservation of highly migratory species such as tuna. It is our hope that our aspirations to develop a rational regime for the living re-sources of our region will acquire the full support and co-operation of all the countries concerned.221.	It would be superfluous and time-consuming were I to repeat the litany of outstanding economic issues which remain unresolved. Suffice to say that my delegation is hopeful that the ongoing international negotiations  some of which unhappily have come to a dead stop  will eventually lead to mutually satisfactory conclusions between the developed and developing countries.222.	Yet  one problem remains to be singled out because of the heavy burden it has imposed on economies such as ours. I refer to the ever-increasing cost of imported fuel.223.	Apart from the immediate needs of finding the necessary funds to pay for imported fuel  the long-term effects of this on development can be catastrophic. As we are a non-producer of oil  the high cost of imported fuel has severely eroded our slender balance of payments. This  we believe  is an area which requires urgent international action if total disaster is to be avoided.224.	The problems faced by Fiji  and indeed our neighbours  in providing energy at a reasonable cost are similar to those of other developing countries  though perhaps exacerbated by our extreme dependence upon imported oil and the high cost of shipping it. As in most countries  efforts have been made since 1974 to conserve fuel and to exploit indigenous energy resources in order to reduce dependence upon costly and increasingly uncertain oil supplies. However  we cannot say that any of the various policies or activities adopted to reduce consumption of oil have had a measurable impact on total fuel imports  the over-all pattern of energy use or energy supplies to rural areas.225.	Within the Pacific Islands  the South Pacific Bureau of Economic Co-operation is being asked to establish a regional alternative energy programme and to monitor the terms under which we buy oil. On the global level  we feel that the international community will need to deal vigorously with the energy issue and launch a co-ordinated and imaginative effort in this field and  in particular  to address itself to the urgent problems of the oil-importing developing countries. In this regard  we also look forward to participating actively in the preparatory work of the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy scheduled for 1981.226.	We also wish fully to associate ourselves with the declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 calling for specific action to overcome economic problems arising from the handicaps facing the land-locked and island developing countries as well as the economic problems facing the most seriously affected countries.227.	Consistent with the need to overcome the impact of our special problems  Fiji actively participated in the negotiation of the new Lome Convention between the European Economic Community and African  Caribbean and Pacific States. We have  of course  received relief from its STABEX scheme and  despite its many shortcomings; the scheme is tangible and operational. For countries such as Fiji  which depend greatly on their export earnings  the establishment of a scheme of stabilization of earnings will help the achievement of our development goals. Under its Sugar Protocol  Fiji  like other ACP sugar producers  has benefited greatly from the guarantee of a stable and reasonably remunerative market.228.	The Lome agreement is an important beginning. It is a model of compromise and accommodation. It is  we think  a symbol of what can be achieved by positive and purposeful negotiations. But above all  it is a tangible instrument for the reordering of the economic relations of more than one-third of the Members of the United Nations.229.	This session marks the end of a decade and foreshadows what the world is likely to meet in the 1980s. It is so easy to become discouraged or to be complacent. Though no major war took place  proxy wars continue to be fought in many parts of the world. And in many parts of the world also  peace often remains as ephemeral as ever. Though the number of countries which have achieved independence has increased considerably since the decade which is now coming to an end  the quality of life of the many millions of men  women and children remain at an unacceptably low level. In our view  freedom and independence can only be meaningful if and when the living conditions of the poor and dispossessed are improved to a level in which they can live with dignity.230.	We believe that  in the coming decade  the United Nations itself must redouble its efforts in order to break what Pope John Paul II described as""...the cycles of despair in which are imprisoned all those that lack food  shelter or employment; the cycles of under-development that are the consequences of international mechanisms that subordinate the human existence to the domination of partially conceived economic progress; and finally the inhuman cycles of war that spring from the violation of man's fundamental rights and produces still graver violations of them."""
"47",2406,"FRA",34,1979,"ï»¿The sole aim of our General Assembly is to serve peace  and yet session after session here we note the consequences of disaster. To us  as leaders  one year means a great deal of diplomatic activity. But for some peoples one year means a great deal of suffering. There are 1 million refugees and 250 000 victims of war  and some 15 of our Member States are embroiled in armed conflicts.â86.	However  serious and distressing though these conflicts may be none of them has so far jeopardized the global peace that the world has known since 1945. It is an inadequate peace to be sure  but it is peace just the same. Without it  all efforts towards progress would be destroyed in the general calamity. This peace is not based on terror and immobility. Despite its shortcomings and its failures  our world has made more progress during the final third of this century than it did during the three preceding centuries. I shall take just three examples. The old nations of Europe have been able to forget their age-old conflicts and to join together in a process of reconciliation; that vast country China  which had so long been kept aside  has taken its rightful place once more in the community of nations; and  lastly  more than 100 States have become independent and are now able to make their voices heard in this forum  which has truly become a world forum.87.	These examples prove mankind's ability to change. They are evidence of the fact that catastrophes are not inevitable as long as human will is exerted.88.	The community of nations has been able to demonstrate its unanimity on one point  a negative point to be sure but one that will henceforth be a fact of history  I am referring to the avoidance of a world war for more than 30 years. Why not go even further now  and express that unanimity in a positive manner by uniting our efforts against the other threats to peace?89.	Thirty years without a general war: we have shown that that is possible. Thirty  years to ensure the survival of humanity: that is the very concrete problem that faces us  because between now and the year 2000 there will be another 2 billion human beings to feed â 2 billion. In 1925  that was the entire world population.90.	If a world divided into antagonistic blocs quarrels over limited resources instead of uniting to develop them  living in interdependence will pose a threat. Instead  the world should organize its interdependence into solidarity so as to enable it to achieve greater security and genuine organization  which are the three components of true peace.91.	That is why I shall discuss these three points in turn: first  a world of greater solidarity  one that will succeed in settling for the benefit of everyone the two problems on which the future of each of our peoples dependsâpoverty and energy; secondly  a more secure world that will undertake disarmament; and  thirdly  a better organized and a more human world  in which  alongside an Organization such as ours  whose role can only grow  the new kinds of regional solidarity will become organized.92.	Concerning a world of greater solidarity  without for one moment forgetting the moral duty that gives solidarity its full significance  I intend to show that solidarity is also essential for the survival of mankind  for in fact we shall survive only if we resolve two problemsâpoverty and energy. Poverty is the failure of progress and hence the failure of us all. Energy is the key to progress and therefore an imperative common to us all.93.	It is difficult to describe the scourge of poverty without lapsing into abstract figures and the demagoguery of sentimental platitudes. And yet we have to acknowledge an obvious fact that our minds reject: poverty is not on the decline. Development has succeeded in keeping it in check  but not in reducing it. The poorest regions are becoming poorer still. A half billion souls are going hungry. At least a half billion can neither read nor write. More than 1 billion have access neither to drinkable water nor to basic medical care. Poverty has not relinquished its hold. It scoffs at the modern world. It is no longer the humble  silent poverty that once escorted mankind throughout its history and all over the globe. It has borrowed from the modern world its violence  its clamour and its great surges. The poverty of shanty towns  the poverty of homeless people  the poverty of frustration that is at least as great as hungerâthat is the face of the world  and we must not avert our eyes from it.94.	We must  on the contrary  confront this poverty  and together we must all declare war on it on several fronts. Concerning the food front  a major rural development effort at the national and international levels must take up where the 'green revolution'' of the 1960s left off so as to improve the growth rate of agricultural production  especially in low-income countries in Asia and Africa. In the field of unemployment  a massive drive to create productive jobsâ550 million between now and the year 2000  according to the World Bank  is crucial to the battle against poverty. In the matter of financing  all countries have a stake in preventing the constraints of financing from halting the progress happily already under way towards world economic integration. Now  the debts of the developing countries have more than doubled since 1974 and at this point debt-servicing costs are increasing faster than the debts themselves. France will therefore support measures designed to augment the financing capacities of the IMF regarding balance-of-payments adjustments  in the hope that the action taken will be specifically directed to the needs of the most impoverished countries. France also advocates greater efforts on behalf of those countries in the area of public development aid. I should like to recall that France has cancelled the debts owed to it by some countries.95.	All countries should contribute to this aidâ which  by the way  does not exempt us from giving our help to other developing countriesâin particular by opening their borders to manufactured products from the most deprived countries; by allowing them access to natural resources  especially those from the sea; and  lastly  by increasing the volume of multilateral aid. France for its part has decided to double its contribution to UNDP between now and 1981  with an increase of more than 50 percent this year.96.	As to energy  the anguish of tomorrow's world will arise from the sudden changes which we now see threatening us: the population explosion and the scarcity of resources  which would jeopardize growth and therefore the increase needed in employment. There will be neither growth nor new jobs without more energy  even if the advancement of technology and organization were to make growth possible at a rate faster than that of the increase in energy needs.97.	True  and we all know this full well  countries in the different categories do not have the same interests or make the same analyses of this energy problem. To solve it  let us begin by understanding one another and accepting the validity of our respective concerns.â98.	The producer countries are legitimately concerned with preparing for their future development and therefore with securing the foundations of their future growth in a prosperous economic climate by managing carefully their non-renewable resources and maintaining the value of their assets.99.	The industrialized countries  for whom oil is still a basic resource  want the volume and price of supplies to remain stable  so that they can guarantee the growth  which  whatever happens  is necessary to the world economic balance.100.	The developing countries that do not produce oil  and especially the most impoverished ones  are in a paradoxical position: they feel the effects of tensions in the oil market more severely than others  even though the place they occupy in that market is small. Nevertheless  their economies are more seriously affected by increases in oil prices.101.	We must  I affirm  understand each other and move closer to each other's positions. There is nothing impossible about the quest for coherence among the policies of the three categories of country. Only that quest can help us to pass from the interdependence to which we are subject  to an organized solidarity.102.	Let me say unequivocally that it is up to the industrialized countries to take the initiative in instituting stricter policies  because it is they who are the largest consumers. The decisions taken in Tokyo last June were a major turning-point. I emphasize that they were based on an initiative of the European Economic Community  which thereby in the circumstances demonstrated its sense of economic responsibility at the world level. The pledges made there to set ceilings on oil imports are significant in two important ways.103.	On the one hand  they would break the link be-tween the pursuit of economic growth by the industrialized countries and the growth of oil imports. Sustained but sober growth on the part of the industrialized countries will henceforth be fuelled by energy sources other than oil.104.	On the other hand  these pledges indicate that the oil energy so indispensable to the developing countries will be available for their use.105.	France  for its part  has committed itself to a policy of conservation of energy and development of new energy sources that will enable it  I assure you; to achieve the goals it has set itself.106.	I am confident that the oil-producing countries recognize the importance of this major change. Once the industrialized countries actually set out on the path of controlling their energy imports  the producer countries will be able to take into consideration the effects which their decisions have on the world economy  as they manage their resources. Any breakdown in supply  any reassessment of the price levels reached to date  would have disastrous consequences for the world economy.107.	But oil is not solely the concern of the oil- producing and industrialized countries. In the interests of solidarity  the new energy needs of the developing countries must be met. To that end  a world programme of investment is indispensable. France supports the World Bank's plans in that regard  but feels that they should be further expanded. France is already making a substantial effort to provide technical assistance in regard to oil.108.	Finally  we must work together more closely to ensure that the decisions made by the different parties are consistent. The 1981 United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy will assuredly bring progress in an area as yet largely unexplored  but one that is of capital importance for the future.109.	We must do more. In this regard  France has taken note with interest of the proposal made by the Group of 77 to start new  comprehensive talks within the framework of the United Nations.110.	Concerning a world of greater solidarity  and  at the same time  a more secure world  let us not deceive ourselves. To reduce the poverty of the poorest and to overcome the energy crisis  a conceited effort is needed. This will not be readily agreed to and will not produce results except in a climate of security and trust. When suspicion  mistrust and fear reign  we immediately see hallowed self-interests placed first  before all other considerations. When armed conflicts break out  the work of several years is reduced to nothing in a few days.111.	We shall build a world of greater solidarity only if we work together to make it more secure.112.	 That is why France sets such great value on the progress of detente and has made it one of the major and permanent lines of its policy. It welcomes  in this respect  the favourable development of its relations with the Soviet Union and with the other socialist countries in Europe  especially Poland.113.	In Europe  detente has not only made it possible to defuse the most visible causes of confrontation. It has paved the way for dialogue and co-operation. It has made  and is continuing to make  an essential contribution to world peace.114.	I mention the progress of detente  not to encourage complacency and passiveness  but rather to urge new efforts to expand detente and make its effects felt more deeply. Detente has probably been a contributing factor in containing flash-points all over the world  although it has not yet succeeded in dousing them completely. It has certainly put a brake on the excessive Build-up of arms  although it has not stopped it altogether.115.	It is time for us to attack these two problems. The results achieved give us the means; they therefore also show us our duty.116.	A review of the situations of crisis and tension that persist in the world shows that these fall into two categories. Some situations are linked to the process of decolonization  of which they are an anachronistic survival. This is the case with Namibia and Rhodesia. Others result from military faits accomplis and shouldâbe neither endorsed by the peoples concerned nor recognized by the international community. I refer to the Middle East and to South-East Asia. However  in all these instances  the crisis situation can be attributed to the fact that deeply rooted realities are being ignored or misperceived; that needed changesâneeded because they are natural and legitimateâare being opposed or blocked; and that in some quarters the mistaken conviction that 'might is right"" still persists.117.	In Namibia as in Rhodesia  the deep-seated reality is the legitimate aspiration of the peoples involved to accede to genuine and internationally recognized independence. In this respect  hopeful signs are beginning to emerge. It is up to us to encourage them. For this reason  France has welcomed the agreement reached at the Meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in Lusaka in August and places its hopes in the success of the talks that have opened in London under the aegis of the United Kingdom Government. For this reason also  in the case of Namibia France is participating activelyâtogether with four other States and in close liaison with the Secretary- General of our Organizationâin the five-Power initiative  with a view to achieving a solution for that territory that is consistent with the principles of our Charter.118.	Turning to the Middle East  I come to a conflict that is quite different. It is as old as our Organization. Thirty years have elapsed  and with them how many hopes have gone unfulfilled and how many paths have been explored in vain in an effort to find the key to peace.119.	My country makes no claim here to define a new framework for negotiation or to devise  in the wake of so many others  some new procedural skill. That is not where the problem lies. There has been too much passion and too much suffering for it to be possible to hope to be able to build peace on ambiguities.120.	Here again  what is needed is recognition of the realities instead of escape from them  tackling the problems instead of evading them.121.	The realities in this case are: the right of the Arab States to recover their territorial integrity; the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland; and the right of all the States in the area  the Arab States as well as the State of Israel  to live in peace within secure  recognized and guaranteed boundaries.122.	These three realities form a whole. They cannot be dissociated without being forsworn; they are valid for all the parties concerned  includingâas the nine countries members of the European Economic Com-munity have just stressedâthe PLO.123.	This presupposes that both sides at last make the effort to look the facts in the face; these two great peoples  the people of Israel and the Palestinian people  will not be able to postpone indefinitely the moment when they recognize one another. It will be necessary to enlarge the dialogue  to cease insisting on exclusive rights; all the protagonists must agree to talk to each other. Certain indications lead us to hope that the timeis approaching. France is following the situation attentively and will make every effort to see these signs multiplied  because they point towards the only real path of peace.124.	In speaking of peace in this area  I also have in mind Lebanon  which has so many ties to my own country. In recent months  Lebanon has been the object of attacks whose repetitive and excessive nature prompted the Security Council to convene. France condemns these attacks that strike at the unity and independence  as well as the territorial integrity  of Lebanon  They affect the Force sent by the United Nations to the southern part of the country; they put in jeopardy the very existence of one of our Organization's Member States.125.	Lastly  South-East Asia and  more specifically  the situation in Cambodia. Last year  at this very rostrum my predecessor stressed the grave dangers of the situation. The events of the past 12 months have unfortunately confirmed our fears.126.	The oppression and bloodshed of an inhuman regime have been superseded by the tragedy of a foreign invasion. The Indo-Chinese peninsula has once again been thrust into a state of war.127.	My Government asked at the time  together with others  for the withdrawal of the forces to the international boundaries they had crossed; I note that the withdrawal has not been general.128.	France cannot acquiesce in Cambodia's becoming a prize in and an arena for a confrontation that dwarfs it and that is in fact utterly alien to it. Cambodia has the right  like any other State  to see its independence and integrity respected. Its people  whose very existence is threatened even as I speak  has the right to live and to determine its destiny as a sovereign nation in peace and friendship with all its neighbours by acquiring a Government representative of the different political tendencies in the country. The exercise of its rights is indispensable to the reconstruction of this ravaged country and to the safeguarding of peace in the region. It is not compatible with the presence of a foreign army on its soil.129.	Flash-points ignite violence in the world  but it is the incredible build-up of arms that could at any moment transform a local explosion into one of cataclysmic proportions. If we want our world to be more secure  it is not enough to defuse the causes of violence. We still have to control the inordinate quantity of instruments of violence; in other words  we must aim for genuine disarmament.130.	All of us here know how arduous the task is  and we are familiar with the consistent way in which technological progress and the complicated mesh of mistrust can thwart the aspirations of peoples and the intentions of Governments.131.	France for its part is too old a nation to imagine that disarmament is easy. But it believes too much in the future of humanity to think disarmament is impossible. Rejecting illusion  which is misleading  and resignation  which leads to despair  France is convinced that concrete progress can be made  providing that these three conditions are fulfilled: clarity and realism in objectives; continuity in action; imagination in initiatives.132.	The President of the French Republic sought to meet the first of these conditions when he came here last year to set forth the main lines of the new approach France is proposing. 133.	First  there is the right of each State to security. This right is the corollary  in disarmament terms  of what is  in the context of detente  the right of each State in sovereignty to decide on its internal options and its international alliances.134.	Secondly  there is the idea that disarmament is first and foremost a universal problem: no State  no group of States  may arrogate to itself the right to determine the rules unilaterally and for all. The entire international community must share in the implementation  benefits and controls of disarmament.135.	Finally  there is the need to bear in mind what I will call the ""geography of security"". The regional level would in fact be the easiest level at which to make concrete progress in this area.136.	Once these principles have been accepted  they still must be put into practice  and this is where continuity of action enters the picture.137.	Since the tenth special session was held in the spring of 1978  some progress has been made. We must not  however  relax our efforts.138.	The new Committee on Disarmament  which together with others we helped to establish  has begun its work. The results of the first session show that broader and more equitable participation aid the progress of the discussion where bilateral debates might lead the talks to become bogged down. At this point we should take care not to disappoint the expectations that have been expressed. France for its part will work actively in the Committee in the hope of reaching concrete results at the next session  particularly in the area of chemical weapons.139.	The United States and the Soviet Union have signed the second SALT agreement.  France is well aware of the importance of the step that has recently been taken. It considers the agreement to be balanced as a whole and hopes that it will enter into force soon. The fact remains that even with this agreement we are still only at the preface to true disarmament. The level of nuclear weapons held by the two signatory Powers is not only high now  it is to go still higher in the next few years. The future negotiations  for which the second round of SALT has paved the way  will  I hope  bring this level down very substantially. As for France  it would take appropriate action on the basis of such reductions only if there were a change in the extent of the disparity persisting between those two arsenals and its own arsenal  which France keeps at its disposal to ensure the security and credibility of its deterrent.140.	In Europe  finally  France has proposed the convening of a conference on disarmament. By linking confidence-building measures and effective disarmament  by making a distinction between arms that serve deterrence and security and those that might fuel threats and intimidation  by defining a cohesive and significant geographical framework  its proposal aims to take into account the specific facts of Europe's situation. The positive reactions that have been forthcoming from various quarters have strengthened our conviction that this approach corresponds both to a real need and to a real possibility  thus encouraging us to proceed.141.	In a field as difficult as that of disarmament  determination needs the help of imagination.142.	With a view to stimulating reflection and imagination  we proposed the founding of an international disarmament institute. At the tenth special session  we also advocated that the most modern technology be made available to the international community by proposing the establishment of an international satellite monitoring agency. In both cases  we would be mobilizing science and scientists for the cause of disarmament.143.	To this same end I should like to announce today that France is proposing to organize an international symposium in Paris on the theme 'Science for disarmament' This symposium  which could serve as a kind of preface to the work of the institute  would seek to involve the scientific community more closely with disarmament by demanding an intellectual and moral contribution from it.144.	A world of greater solidarity  a more secure world  but also a more organized world is what we seek.145.	The world we live in  if we reflect upon it  has two essential characteristics: diversity and disparity. There is diversity in political regimes  philosophical and religious creeds and national traditions and cultures. The disparities lie in power  wealth and access to knowledge.146.	Diversity brings people closer together because it encourages them to participate in dialogues and ex-changes. Disparities separate them  on the contrary  because they divide people and set them one against the other.147.	How can we act to preserve the former and to eliminate the latter?148.	Allow me  as a European  to draw upon my experience. Thirty years ago the nations of Europe were emerging from world conflict  drained and in ruins. Where they had once been among the most powerful and wealthy of nations  now they did not even have the resources needed to set themselves back on their feet.149.	Thirty years have gone by. Now those same nations have regained their place in the world thanks to the aid they received  thanks to their own efforts  but thanks also to the close co-operation they forged among themselves. Without relinquishing their identities or compromising their independence  they have formed a Community which  by the very fact that it exists and that it has demonstrated its ability to act  today constitutes an essential element in international equilibrium.150.	There may have been fear in some quarters that the Europe of six  and later nine  countriesâand undoubtedly tomorrow of twelveâby organizing itself  would become inward-looking. The experience of what is now more than 20 years has shown the opposite: among groups of comparable size  the European Community is without a doubt the most open to the world. This applies equally to its trade  to its part in aid for development and to its contribution to solving major world problems. Nor is it an accident that detente  throughout the entire European continent  has advanced at the same pace as has the organization of Western Europe.151.	By increasing their co-operation and strengthening their cohesion  the countries of Europe have not created a bloc. Quite the contrary; they have introduced a new type of regional grouping. Because this co-operation is founded on the natural affinities of history  geography  culture and human values  it protects diversity and helps to attenuate disparities.152.	The case of Europe is significant  it seems to me  but it is not an isolated case and is becoming less and less unique. Everywhere we are witnessing the advance of regional solidarity. There is growing vitality at the level of continents and subcontinents in geographically oriented organizations such as the Organization of American States  the OAU  the Andean Group and the Association of South-East Asian Nations. The phenomenon is too widespread for it not to be a response to a universally felt need. In my opinion  it reflects an aspiration on the part of each of our nations to reconcile two fundamental requirementsâthe need to assert themselves without becoming isolated and the need to participate without becoming subservient.153.	The pluralistic  multipolar world that this aspiration heralds will be different from the world of yesterdayâprofoundly so. The conviction of France is that it will be a better world. So long as there are only two camps  the gains of one will inevitably appear to be the losses of the other. The logic of their relationships is confrontationâthe only possible compromise is the status quo  in other words  immobility. In contrast to this  the multiplication of poles allows for more flexibility in the general equilibrium. It encourages necessary changes and makes it easier to resolve local conflicts. The positive role played by the Organization of American States in the evolution of events in Nicaragua and the decisive assistance provided by the African States in achieving a peaceful solution of the problem of Chad are telling examples.154.	The recent events in central Africa provide a new and clear illustration of this. It was the Africans themselves who  by the decisions made at the Kigali conference  substantiated and condemned the atrocities perpetrated. It was the former President of the Central African Republic  the Prime Minister in office and other leaders who took the initiative of liberating their country. France  which had suspended its aid as soon as the Committee of African Magistrates presented its conclusions  gave an affirmative response to the request made of it on the spot by the new authorities. Thus it was possible to eliminate a tyrannical rule without bloodshed.155.	There need be no fear that the strengthening of these regional organizations is likely to infringe on either the individual identities of national sovereignties to which we are attached or the universal nature of the international community. Quite the opposite; it cannot fail to protect the one and to enrich the other.156.	This can be seen quite clearly  even here within our Organization. The existence of regional groupings has never prevented us from examining the great questions of our time. Indeed  it has made such examination easier and more productive.157.	It is indeed characteristic of regional organizations that there is no better way of affirming their identity than through dialogue and co-operation 158.	It is in order to take into account this new dimension of today's world that France has renewed its interest in the Latin American continent and  on this subject  I should like to recall the two visits made by Mr. Giscard d'Estaing to Brazil and to Mexico respectively. It was with this same idea in mind  too  that the French Head of State put forward the concept of a ""trialogue"" between Europe  Africa and the Arab countries. By giving substance to this project  these three groups will not only underline the obvious complementaries that unite them; they will also place them at the service of progress and peace. They will help to construct the foundations of a more balanced  more open world  where the old temptations of hegemony will have made way for the call to solidarity.159.	The world of greater solidarity  security and organization that France hopes to see and which it is working to bring into being will have meaning only if it serves mankind  its dignity and its rights.160.	Owing to the universality of our Organization and to the legitimacy conferred upon it by the membership of almost all nations  it has in this respect a crucial role to play. Our Organization is the expression of the universal conscience and  at the same time  of the diversity of cultures. More than ever  the Charter is the indispensable reference that will allow us to live together better and to render more effective and more widespread the dignity of man that it proclaims and that is defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The dignity of man must be expressed through the equality of all. Together with the entire international community  we condemn regimes that are founded on racial discrimination  such as apartheid.161.	The United Nations is a decisive safeguard for the peace of the world and for the dignity of the individual. It has shown this in a great many situations  whether by recalling the principles and spelling out the law or through its actions and calls for the assistance of States. In the tragedy of the South-East Asian refugees  for example  our Organization  by acting in accordance with its peaceful and humanitarian purpose  has fulfilled its unique role. France  as is well known  has given the Organization its full assistance. As a country of asylum and refuge  it has opened its doors wide to those who have been exiled and will continue to receive all those to whom it is able to offer a future commensurate with their hopes.162.	The efforts of our Organization and of States to respond to urgent and desperate situations should not  however  make us forget the silent hope of millions of individuals imprisoned by poverty. No man  no leader  can ever rest easy so long as suffering  fear and contempt for the law reign on this earth. This is one battle that we should all wage together  regardless of our differences  for it is the battle for peace on earth."
"48",2476,"GAB",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  Gabon and its President  His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo  whom I have the signal honour to represent at this session  are moved by your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We are moved first of all because as Africans we are gratified that once again it is to our continent that the formidable but exalting honour has fallen of presiding over this international forum. We are moved also because Africa  which today more than in the past has become the scene of rivalries and great Powers hegemonisms  could not make a better contribution to the search for solutions that are liable to reduce the poverty and suffering in the world and to bring about a greater measure of security and happiness for its inhabitants. Finally  and above all  we are moved because of the close links of fruitful friendship  multifaceted co-operation and active solidarity which unite our two peoples and our two brother countries  both bilaterally and within the framework of international organizations. And that is why your election  Sir  constitutes for Gabon  my country  more than just a symbol. It is indeed testimony to the well-deserved tribute which  through you  Sir  the community of nations has paid to your great country  to its illustrious head of State  and also to the whole of Africa. My delegation is convinced that your distinguished qualities as a skilled and far-sighted diplomat and the long and rich experience which you have accumulated in the United Nations are a guarantee of the success of our work.239.	I also wish to convey my congratulations to the other officers of the Assembly  who  I have no doubt  will actively assist you in the success of this session.240.	I should like to take this opportunity to include in these congratulations Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the President of the thirty-third session  whose tact and perfect knowledge of the great problems of the day made it possible for the work of that session to succeed and make appreciable progress in the search for solutions to our constant concerns.241.	To Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General of our Organization  I should like to repeat the great appreciation of my delegation for the tireless efforts which he has constantly put forth towards the same end.242.	My delegation believes that  in spite of differences and reluctance  our work will be carried out in an atmosphere where the keynote is hope  a hope which will do away with the partisan selfishness which has generated so much conflict and conflagration. The world we live in needs this hope because it has too often fallen victim to those constantly resurging scourges which afflict humanity and which it must rid itself of through the indispensable solidarity of the international community.243.	These scourges include  in the first place  hunger  which affects three quarters of humanity and kills off millions of human beings. I should like to stress here the preponderant role of our Organization in the effort to do away with hunger throughout the world  and at the same time to congratulate the Secretary- General and the Director-General of FAO on their unremitting efforts to achieve this objective. Indeed  we can never repeat too often the fact that man does not live by ideology alone  still less by cannons which rob him of his life  but by bread and water above all.244.	Let us hope that the powerful of the world will do even more to contribute to the elimination of this scourge. In fact  nothing more remains to be said on this subject. And the last time that it was debated was in the course of the World Food Conference   which showed that all that was needed was good will on the part of everyone for those who primarily suffer from hungerâ that is children  to whom this year has been dedicatedâ to find themselves not only recognized at last but also given the right to existence so that the world can live tomorrow because  as the head of State of Gabon loves to say  ""the surest hope of the world is its children"".245.	So hunger is the first scourge  and after hunger comes poverty  which is the lot of three quarters of mankind  condemned to be ever poorer while the rest of the world awards itself the bulk of the wealth that exists to become ever more prosperous.â246.	When the group of developing countries clamours for the establishment of this new and more just international economic order that would nowadays embrace such diverse fields as information and cultureâthe purview of the World Administrative Radio Conference  which has just begun work in Genevaâthis is a warning signal which the industrialized countries would do well to heed  instead of turning a deaf ear as they did in Manila at the time of the fifth session of UNCTAJD  which yielded the most disappointing results because of the reluctance of those countries to do more for the cause of the developing countries.247.	It is true that at the end of two years of hard bargaining there is good hope that agreement can be reached on the broad lines of the statutes of the Common Fund for the stabilization of primary commodities.248.	It is true that an agreement was also arrived at in Vienna at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  on the adoption of an over-all Programme of Action  aimed at strengthening the scientific and technical capabilities of the developing countries  the creation of a high-level horizontal structureâthat is  the Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Developmentâand the establishment of machinery for financing which could increase and guarantee the volume of funds necessary for the attainment of defined objectives.249.	It is true that it may be somewhat comforting and encouraging to note that at the second half of the eighth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which was concluded here a month ago  quite appreciable progress was made on certain points which were purported to be delicate  such as scientific research  pollution of the seas and the delimitation of the continental shelf.250.	Naturally  within the same context  I cannot re-main silent about the results of the renegotiation of the Convention of Lomeâwhere my country had the privilege of being Co-Chairman at a crucial moment of its historyâa convention which clearly should be taken as a model in the field of co-operation  which we hope will be ever more fruitful  more diversified and more dynamic  between the industrialized and the developing countries. My country is gratified by the fact that the signing of this convention will take place once again in Lome'.251.	These are so many grounds for satisfaction  and we are entitled to take pride in them in spite of serious short-comings.252.	My delegation feels that the political will to pursue dialogue exists in all quarters. We can therefore only support Mr. Waldheim's appealâissued at the 28th meeting of the work of the ad hoc committee on the North-South dialogue âfor the resumption of this dialogue because ""present stagnation is unacceptable at a time when dangers of all kinds threaten the world economy"".253.	Indeed  the constant imbalances which perturb the world economyâinflation and monetary disorders  just to mention twoâunderlie the particularly difficult and alarming situation affecting the economies of the third world in general and of the African continent in particular  aggravated by the problems of indebtedness and insufficient price supports for primary commodities and the deterioration of the terms of trade  a situation for which appropriate solutions should be found.254.	Among those solutions must be an increase by the rich countries in their official assistance to the developing countries  particularly since the figure of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product recommended in 1970 by the United Nations has been attained so far only by Sweden  Norway and the Netherlands.255.	Among those solutions also is the alleviation  management and total or partial remission of the debts contracted by the developing countries in accordance with an agreement of March 1968 by UNCTAD but subscribed to by only about 10 industrialized countries. My delegation wishes to pay warm tribute here to all of these countries in the hope that their example will be followed.256.	With regard to Africa  ever since the seminar in Monrovia which met at the felicitous initiative of the Administrative Secretary-General of the OAU  Mr. Edem Kodjo  after having realized that  at the international level  trade and other exchanges were much more current among the industrialized countries than between them and the developing countriesâin other words  there is a greater current of North-North trade than North-SouthâAfrica decided  by the solemn Declaration of its Heads of State and Government meeting in July last again in Monrovia  to promote in Africa a new course to be based on self-sufficiency.257.	I take pleasure in stressing that my country did not wait until the alarm bell had sounded in Monrovia before awakening to that fact; because  after what became an historic statement on 11 March 1976  the Head of State of Gabon  after having said No to unbridled capitalism and No to bureaucratic socialism  advocated ""the new Gabonese policy of development  that of democratic and concerted progressivism""  which consists of the awareness and the will of the Gabonese people to achieve better control of the economic machinery and better control and direction of their expansion  in the higher interest of the nation and for the benefit of all its citizens.258.	So we have poverty and hunger  but we also have that greatest of all scourges  war  not forgetting conflict situations in a world which is in full transformation. War still remains one of the constant concerns of man  because his very survival depends on peace and security.259.	On the basis of this analysis  it occurs to us to ask a fundamental question  When will all those who call for human rights and have arrogated to themselves the right to proclaim peace or war take the decision to devote even a tiny part of the billions they spend each year on the manufacture of ever-more sophisticated and deadly weapons to elimination of the scourges of hunger and poverty that afflict the world? It is deplorable indeed to note that the genius of man has never been better developed or more highly sophisticated than in that field of the invention  perfection and refinement of lethal devices.260.	This is a cry of alarm  but also a cry of hope; the hope which we place in the future of mankind  a hope for which we take pleasure in noting that an echo  however feeble  has been found among the two superpowers  which are primarily responsible for the grave concerns which afflict the world and which lead small and medium-sized countries like ours to believe that power is found in the muzzle of a gun and thus to seek it as an end in itself even more important than the well- being of starving peoples. But with this gun  as the Head of the Gabonese State likes to put it  ""we can do everything except lie on it with peace of mind"". And  within this context  we can only greet with optimism the creation of the International Fund for Agricultural Developmentâfor which my country proposes to provide a site for its headquartersâthe Fund has as one of its objectives ""to improve the nutritional level of the poorest populations""-  of all the developing countries.261.	There is hardly any need to remind representatives that the essence of a man's life depends  above all  on satisfying his vital needs rather than an unbridled race for a balance of terror in which the two superpowers have not ceased to recognize their responsibilities. An illustration has just been given to us by the conclusion of the agreements reached as a result of the second round of SALT  after six years of intensive bilateral negotiations. We must encourage them in that course of direct negotiation  as they were in a letter addressed to their then leaders by the Heads of State and Government of the non-aligned countries who met in Belgrade in 1961 for the First Conference of the Movement  with as their final objective the destruction of all nuclear arsenals.262.	Those are  in the view of my delegation  the major guidelines which should underlie our debate  because they flow from this profound conviction of the political philosophy of the Republic of Gabon  whose official seal shows a mother nursing her child.263.	The Gabonese State has enhanced the role of women by creating a department concerned with every-thing that affects their advancement  promoting action for mass education in the rural areas and preserving our traditional values. Action is jointly undertaken by the departments of women's advancement  social affairs and popular education  as well as the Women's Union of the Gabonese Democratic Party  under the leadership of Mrs. Josephine Bongo  the wife of the Head of State.264.	We have many mothers and sisters  all of whom are pleased to recognize the importance of their role in the development of our young nation  because in Gabon there is no discrimination between men and women in appointments to posts of responsibility. The only criterion is competence.265.	With reference to the child  the child is the most precious possession  the builder of tomorrow's world  the artisan of the future  the link between yesterday and tomorrow  the soul ready to blossomâbut which is stifled by man's selfishness  asphyxiated by the gunpowder of cannons. In so far as concerns the Gabonese Republic  for a long time now the importance of this ""promise of man""  as Gusdorf puts it  has been perceived and apprehended. Indeed  the Head of State of Gabon likes to repeat  as he did at the opening of the International Year of the Child:""For me  youth is sacred. And this youth is  above all  young children. And those children must be born into a society of peace and progress. Their balanced development depends on it.""266.	In this field  the Government of Renovation  for which public health and social security constitute priority sectors  is devoting the larger part of its efforts to maternal and children's health  to social security with its birth bonuses and family allowances. These measures and provisions are in Africa in the vanguard of the steps advocated by the WHO relating to primary health care with a view to preserving the health of all by the year 2000.267.	The efforts made on behalf of the child are also marked by a school attendance rate of 100 per cent at the primary level and somewhere near 70 to 80 per cent at the secondary and higher levels  as well as free education for all without any discrimination.268.	If I have mentioned the place occupied by the child in Gabonese society  it is not only because our session is taking place in the International Year of the Child; it is  above all  because one of the evils that afflicts mankind that we have just denounced  namely war  affects the child most since it spoils and destroys his innocence and for ever dulls his sensibilities.269.	Indeed  as President Bongo said quite recently:""In this turbulent world rent by troubles  too many children are born and grow up in fear and anguish of unbridled warfare between nations and fratricidal revolutions  without any protection other than the wretched shelter of refugee camps and orphanages.""270.	And the Head of the State of Gabon declared himself ready to welcome children  primarily from distant regions where we hope and trust that peace will finally triumph  so that those lands will finally be able to experience the harmonious development to which they are entitled after so many years of sacrifices that would be in vain if they were not to lead to the social peace which we whole-heartedly aspire to  above and beyond grudges and rancours.271.	If we consider the international political situation sector by sector  I am sure that members will agree with our appreciation of the present state of the world.272.	In Africa we thought that a peaceful and internationally acceptable solution to the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia was imminent.273.	We cannot deny that the African countries and the liberation movements primarily concerned have demonstrated a great deal of moderation in their just claims of full and entire sovereignty over the land of their ancestors.274.	We accepted the mediation of those very people who are the allies of the minority and racist regimes in Rhodesia and in South Africa  allies who are all the more clearly identifiable because they maintain relations of many kinds with the country that is primarily responsible for the terrible evil which is rampant in the regionâthat is  South Africa. But what have we obtained in exchange?275.	In Zimbabwe  since the rebellion by Mr. Ian Smith  the African countries in particular  and the countries of the third world in general  have constantly called on the United Kingdom  the administering Power for the Territory  to live up fully to its responsibilities as such and to lead the country to independence.276.	The idea that the reality of power should be concentrated in the hands of 3 per cent of the population of the Territory cannot be entertained. The members of this minority who for different reasons have found refuge in that country  and who have freely chosen to make a home there  should constantly bear in mind this truth  if they themselves after independence wish to be granted the right to make a positive contribution to the building of a new Zimbabwe  which will need their wisdom and experience.277.	That is why the Government of Gabon welcomed the position taken by the United Kingdom on the future of Zimbabwe in the course of the recent Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held in Lusaka  Zambia  because it was in keeping with its position of prevailing upon all the sons of Zimbabwe to sit down at the same table to find a peaceful solution to their problem that would be internationally acceptable.278.	This is why the Government of Gabon wishes to express the hope that the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference now being held at Lancaster House will see a resolution of this problem.279.	The Namibian problem resembles the Rhodesian problem inasmuch as its origin lies in the system of apartheid  because of which the word ""equality"" has become meaningless. It also resembles the Rhodesian problem inasmuch as progress is being made towards an internal solution which takes no account of SWAPO  which nevertheless is recognized by the OAU and the United Nations as the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people. Neither does the solution take any account of international opinion  or of the plan of the Secretary-General of the United Nations - while the South Africans have led the world to believe that it has accepted that plan based on the proposals of the five Western Powers. In acting in this way  South Africa thinks that it can benefit from the tacit agreement of the Western Powers because of their considerable investments in that region.280.	Consequently  it is up to these Powers to remove any possible misunderstanding about their true desire to bring about a solution in keeping with the inalienable right of the Namibian people to freedom  independence  the territorial integrity of their country  including the port of Walvis Bay  and also national sovereignty  by prevailing upon their ally to reverse its decision before it is too late.281.	From this very rostrum on 14 October 1977  at the thirty-second session of the General Assembly  His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo  President of the Republic of Gabon  said:"" . . .the masses deprived of the fundamental rights of man are living like pariahs in the land of their ancestors....""On our fellow human beings  treated as sub-humans  an iniquitous power is imposed by the so- called separate development of the famous 'national homelands' or bantustans  which are a parody of a homeland and government.""That remains a tragic reality  especially since a new Bantustan  the Venda  has just been created. Just as it condemned the Transkei in 1976 and Bophuthatswana in 1977  the Government of Gabon energetically condemns this most recent parody  which is designed to perpetuate the outrageous policy of white supremacy in this part of the continent.282.	We should also recall this other saying of President Bongo:""Sooner or later excess destroys itself.""The excessive humiliation to which so-called separate development exposes our brothers is driving them to revolt  just as it is making it our duty to help them. There should be no doubt on this score  particularly among the Western Powers.""283.	We were particularly anxious to cite these quotations because we find that the countries most frequently accused of violating human rights are the countries of the third world  particularly African countries. We are waiting impatiently for the champions of human rights also to apply the necessary sanctions against the racist power of South Africa  and for colossal sums of money to be devoted to catching and punishing those who exercise this iniquitous power. So far  as far as I know  it has not been possible to get the Security Council to adopt any kind of resolution calling for binding economic sanctions against this other scourge of humanity which has been elevated to a veritable system  namely apartheid.284.	I also wish to point out that certain major countries have not hesitated to suspend economic assistance to third-world countries accused of violating human rights. Justice  as we can see  is often selective  even in the West.285.	On the subject of the Middle East  one cannot refrain from drawing a parallel between southern Africa and that part of the world because of the persistent refusal of Israel to grant the Palestinian people their fundamental rights: the right to liberty and to sovereignty over internationally recognized territory  under the leadership of its vanguard organization. I refer to the PLO  whose existence cannot be ignored by Israel  all the less since the PLO leader  Yasser Arafat  has spoken from this very rostrum. 286.	We reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland just like all the other peoples of the region.287.	We also reaffirm that  while there exists a momentum towards peace in the region  Israel must return the occupied Arab territories and refrain from creating settlements there.288.	In this context  Jerusalem  the Holy Place of three revealed religions  must become an international city.289.	This is why Gabon  which looks to dialogue as the pre-eminent instrument for the peaceful settlement of conflicts  has always supported the tireless efforts of President El-Sadat  in this framework  as well as the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty  because it is liable to bring about a certain momentum for a global settlement of the problem of the Middle East  a settlement which would take account of the recognition of legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  in keeping with the relevant United Nations resolutions.290.	Our agenda  the consideration of which is to take some three months  accordingly embraces other items which are just as important and which it would have been worth while to deal with here.291.	But for lack of time  I shall confine myself  before concluding my statement  to mentioning the tragedy of a nation rent in twoâCyprusânot without  however  reaffirming the profound conviction of the Gabonese Government that we shall see the thorny problem of the Korean peninsula resolved by means of a peaceful and independent reunification.292.	With regard to Cyprus  then  here is a country which for six years now has suffered from division because of the presence on its territory of foreign troops. We reaffirm that the solution to this tragedy must inevitably  here as elsewhere  be brought about by means of dialogue  of direct intercommunal talks which must safeguard independence of the territory  its integrity and its non-aligned character.293.	I have deliberately made hope the keynote of my statementâhope for a better future for mankind  in spite of the vicissitudes to which it is subject  such as the discord we have just mentionedâin the light of the efforts of our Organization to bring about concord  a symbol which my country has chosen for its national anthem. We place this hope in the United Nations  for it remains the appropriate framework for the solution of the numerous problems confronting the world today which will certainly determine the kind of world we shall have tomorrow.294.	Because this hope alone is capable of permitting us to transcend our ideological differences  it spurs us on to reflexion  to the wisdom which mankind so sorely needs and which should accordingly preside throughout our debates  so that when they come to an end our delegations will leave New York with the legitimate satisfaction of having taken a step forward in the search for progress and peace in the world.295.	In conclusion  I should like to welcome Saint Lucia to the United Nations. The admission of Saint Lucia is for my delegation a matter of satisfaction because it enables our Organization to take one more step on its long march towards universality. 	"
"49",2521,"GBR",34,1979,"ï»¿This is the first time that I have had the honour of addressing the United Nations. But no one who has lived through the last 34 years can fail to have been conscious of the United Nations or to be aware of what it has achieved and of what it has yet to achieve.219.	There were 51 founder Members of the United Nations. Now there are 152 Member States. Last week  we welcomed Saint Lucia  formerly a British Territory  as the one hundred and fifty-second Member. I congratulate the Government and people of Saint Lucia on their achievement of full independence. This near- tripling of the membership is largely due to the dissolution of the great colonial empires. The United Kingdom worked with  and not against  that trend. This month  we in my country have mourned the death of Lord Mountbatten  who was a pioneer of decolonization. Since last year's General Assembly  besides Saint Lucia  the Republic of Kiribati has achieved full nationhood. We look forward to Saint Vincent joining them on 27 October. It remains our policy to respect the wishes of the peoples of our few remaining dependent Territories. It is for them to determine their own future in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. We shall therefore continue to give every support and encouragement to any of them who seek independence. When there are difficulties  we will do our best to overcome them. In particular  we want to bring Belize to secure independence as soon as possible.220.	The dismantling of the British Empire has led us either to join or create two new institutions  the European Community  whose President spoke earlier on this afternoonâand whose remarks I warmly endorseâand the Commonwealth  an institution sometimes referred to as a talking shop. If you are looking for an example of how valuable a talking shop can be  you need go no further than the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka two months ago. Talk there led first to greater understanding between the countries concerned  and then to action to try to solve the problems of Rhodesia.221.	During the last two weeks  the British Government has engaged in intensive negotiations on Rhodesia  and these negotiations are continuing. But I thought it right to come to New York to inform the General Assembly of the stage that we have now reached.222.	I do not intend to go back over the history of the Rhodesian dispute  now some 14 years old  apportioning blame to this party or absolving that. I would like to emphasize at the outset one point: throughout the vicissitudes of the Rhodesian problem  Britain has never succumbed to the temptation to abandon its responsibilities towards that unhappy country  leaving majority and minority alike to endless war. The whole approach of the present British Government is indeed based on a determination to fulfil our responsibilities towards the people of Rhodesia.223.	When my government came to power in May this year  we were confronted with a new situation  though there were also some depressingly familiar features. The reality of change for the better had been symbolized in the elections which had taken place in April of this year on the basis of the principle of ""one man  one vote. âThose elections have had many critics  but the plain fact is that they have led to the emergence of a parliament and an administration  most of whose members belong to the majority community and which is led by a member of that community. This represented a substantial step forward towards the abandonment by the white community of its privileged position  and my Government was determined to build on that  so as to make a further effort to bring Rhodesia to legal independence in a context of wide international recognition and acceptance.224.	But the Patriotic Front did not participate in the April elections  and the war continued. The constitution under which those elections took place was marred by certain deficiencies. But to decry and dismiss the elections would have been to discourage further change. There was a need for urgent and imaginative action to exploit the opportunity which had been created to achieve a settlement that would gain wide international acceptance and  we hoped  bring an end to the war. Past efforts to solve the Rhodesian dispute showed  however  that it was essential to proceed step by step to build a solid foundation for negotiations.225.	We therefore immediately engaged in an extensive series of consultations with all the parties concerned in the conflict in order to identify the elements for a solution. We spoke to the leaders of the Commonwealth  of the front-line States  of the Patriotic Front  and of the Salisbury parties. We also remained in close touch with our other friends and allies and took account of their views. These consultations were invaluable  and formed a sound basis for our present approach to a settlement.226.	From these consultations two main conclusions flowed. The first was a general recognition of the extent of the changes which had taken place in Rhodesia  despite the short-comings of the Salisbury constitution. The second was the unanimous conviction that there should now be a further attempt to involve all the parties to the conflict in an attempt to find a solution  and that any solution should emanate from Britain as the responsible Power.227.	The next stage was the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries as Lusaka in August  and it was here that the foundation of our present approach to a solution was laid. In Lusaka our proposals for a settlement were discussed and endorsed by a very important cross-section of the world community  including three of the front-line States. I wish to pay a tribute to the Heads of Government present at Lusaka for the helpful and constructive attitude which they all displayed during our discussions on Rhodesia  and especially to the wise chairmanship of President Kaunda of Zambia  which made a huge contribution to the successful outcome. The essence of the Lusaka agreement on Rhodesia was the acceptance by the Commonwealth of the British Government's constitutional responsibility to grant legal independence to Rhodesia on the basis of genuine majority rule.228.	In our negotiations with the Salisbury parties and the Patriotic Front  we have continued to be guided by the principles defined at Lusaka. Our first task has been to seek agreement on an independence constitution comparable with the constitutions on which we granted independence to other former British dependent territories. It would be idle to pretend that in the special historical circumstances of Rhodesia  such a task is proving easy. Compromise on both sides is essential. We have already secured from the Salisbury parties agreement in principle to British proposals on the constitution. This was a bold decision by Bishop Muzorewa's delegation.229.	Significant progress on certain points has also been made in discussions with the leaders of the Patriotic Front. All parties must sustain their efforts to continue the momentum of the Conference if the gains so far made are not to be eroded. A heavy responsibility will lie on any who fail to respond to this opportunity to achieve for the people of Rhodesia a fair settlement which will bring international acceptance and an end to the war. Much difficult negotiation undoubtedly lies ahead before the foundations of an independent and democratic society "" in which all the people of Rhodesia will be able to live in security and at peace with each other and with their neighbours  are laid. I do not underestimate the difficulties which remain to be overcome  but I dare to hope that the moment may not be too far away when the British Government and Parliament will be able to grant legal independence to Rhodesia on the basis of genuine majority rule. Many attempts to solve the Rhodesia problem have failed in the past. I hope that it may be our privilege before too long to welcome an independent Zimbabwe to this Assembly as a full member of the United Nations.230.	Namibia is another Territory where we must try to find an internationally acceptable solution through free and fair elections and not through bloodshed. The five Western countries  in close consultation with the Secretary-General  are pressing on with the search for a solution which would open the way to the arrival of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia. Discussions are now concentrated on the detailed arrangements  which will need to be carefully worked out with the parties concerned  for a demilitarized zone. The idea of such a zone was proposed by the late President Neto of Angola  whose death we all deeply mourn. Our aim is to achieve early and complete agreement so that a date can be fixed for a ceasefire and the beginning of the transition to independence. Given goodwill and flexibility on the part of all concerned  this goal should not be beyond our reach.231.	Namibia and Zimbabwe-Rhodesia are the immediate issues in southern Africa. But in the longer term it is on South Africa that the stability of this troubled region will depend. We share the international community's distaste of apartheid. It is neither just nor workable. But will threats and isolation bring about the changes we all wish to see? We in the British Government doubt it. We believe that the better course is to accept that the Republic's plural society gives rise to unprecedented problems and to offer our help to the leaders of all races to work together to find just solutions. In this way we can all contribute towards peaceful change in South Africa. Otherwise the future promises only violence and misery for all the people of South Africa  whatever their race.232.	In the Middle East  the British Government greatly welcomes what has so far been achieved through the process begun at Camp David. It is in the interests of all parties to explore fully the opening which was created there. We hope that these continuing negotiations will lead to transitional arrangements which will lighten the burden of occupation in the West Bank and Gaza and help to create a climate of confidence and co-operation in practical matters. But the ultimate goal must remain a comprehensive settlement  based on the effective application of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in all its parts. This involves the acceptance by all parties of Israel's right to live in peace with its neigh- ours within secure and recognized boundaries. And  equally  it requires the withdrawal of Israel from territories occupied in 1967.233.	There is one area in which a broad international consensus has recognized that resolution 242 (1967) is incompleteâthat is  in the handling of Palestinian rights. The resolution takes no account of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinians  which go well beyond their status as refugees. Nor does it take any account of the Palestinians ' belief that they are a separate people with a right to their homeland. This  I believe  is an area in which resolution 242 (1967) may be supplementedânot  I emphasize  replaced  amended or distorted  but supplementedâto meet this point.234.	My Government believes that a settlement which does not command the broad assent of the Palestinian people cannot last. But if the Palestinians are to exercise the right to determine their own future as a people  this must be in the context of a negotiated peace settlement which guarantees Israel's right to a peaceful and permanent existence within secure borders. Only if both parties recognize the legitimate rights of each other will it be possible to achieve the durable peace which all the peoples of the Middle East so desperately need.235.	In the meantime  it is our earnest hope that all parties will avoid doing or saying anything to make it harder to establish the minimum trust without which successful negotiations would be impossible. We call on the Israel Government to cease its policy of settlement in occupied territories. That Government's present policy prejudices the chance of progress in the autonomy talks and makes the achievement of a comprehensive settlement much more difficult. We deplore' its recent decision to allow Israeli citizens to buy land in the occupied territories. And moreover  while we understand the Israel Government's preoccupation with security  we urge it to refrain from its present policies in south Lebanon. These undermine the authority of the Lebanese Government and frustrate the efforts of UNIFIL to fulfil its mandate. In that context  I pay a tribute to the dedication and courage with which the officers and men of UNIFIL are carrying out their dangerous and difficult task.236.	Another area of dangerous tensions is IndoChina  where suffering due to natural causes has been made worse by the regimes which took power in 1975. I refer first to the Vietnamese Government  which  as I said on 20 July at the Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia  in Geneva  has driven so many people to flee its shores that the problem has become one of international concern. I was in Hong Kong in May. I saw there the misery of the people who had risked perilous journeys in unseaworthy craft to escape the tyranny in their own country. It is not an experience that I shall ever forget. Nor can I forget the tens of thousands of those unhappy people who were simply lost at sea. The Secretary-General chaired  with his customary skill  the Geneva Meeting  which my Prime Minister had suggested should be held. As a result  a start has been made to resettle the refugees who did not perish. Most of them came either to Hong Kong or to the ASEAN countries. My Government fully understands the problems which the refugee influx posed for those countries. But the problem is likely to remain until the Vietnamese Government stops bearing down harshly on elements of its population. Meanwhile  I hope that that Government will abide by the undertakings it gave in Geneva about future action.237.	Yet the most serious problems in Indo-China are perhaps to be found in Cambodia. The years of suffering to which that unhappy country was subjected by the Pol Pot Government are well known. That regime s human rights record is among the worst of any country in the world. The then British Government was among the first to draw attention to it. Then the country was brutally invaded by the armed forces of one of its neighbours. Now it is prey to starvation while fighting continues with the occupying forces. Unless those on the spot allow large-scale relief operations to start soon  the people of Cambodia will face yet another catastrophe. Food must get to these people soon  and those who want to help should not be asked to pay a political price for being allowed to do so. I shall only say now that in the British Government's view the Cambodian people has the same right as any other to live in peace under a Government freely chosen by itself. Without a settlement in Cambodia  stability and peace in South-East Asia will not be possible.238.	In Europe itself possible sources of tension remain. The maintenance of stable East-West relations remains a foremost priority for us and for our allies  most notably the United States. We welcome the signature by the United States and the Soviet Union earlier this year of a second Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and hope that it will soon be ratified. That agreement is an example of the kind of detailed and verifiable arms control arrangement that is needed; mere talk of a desire for peace and co-operation is not enough.239.	Meanwhile  the scale of the military build-up of the countries signatories of the Warsaw Treaty is a matter of serious and legitimate concern to all other European countries. So far the Warsaw Pact has shown little willingness to allay these concerns in any practical way  so we on the Western side have no alternative but to respond. Otherwise  the balance on which detente depends will be lost. Nor can we accept that detente should be a principle applied in Europe but ignored in the rest of the world. Detente  if it is to work anywhere  must work everywhere. The British Government is ready to work for greater confidence  stability and real co-operation. But this must be a two-way process  with give and take coming from both sides. It is certainly in that spirit that we shall approach the review session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be held in Madrid next year.240.	But work to reduce the threat of war must go wider than East-West relations. Above all we must avoid the spread of nuclear weapons  while at the same time permitting access to the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy. The 1968 Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons now has 111 parties. I much regret that it has not won universal adherence. I hope that further progress can be made before the Review Conference next August. If universal membership of the Treaty could be achieved  it would halt the spread of nuclear weapons.241.	As members know  a comprehensive test-ban treaty is being negotiated between the United States  the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. We still have difficult problems to overcome. But when the treaty is completed  it will  I hope  meet the objections of those who argue that the non-proliferation Treaty discriminates in favour of the nuclear-weapon States. The latter have also  of course  given the non-nuclear- weapon States various assurances that nuclear weapons will not be used against them.242.	Progress is important  too  in the field of conventional arms control. For this reason my Government supports the work of the Committee on Disarmament. We shall continue to take the position that measures to curb the nuclear arms race must go hand in hand with measures to reduce conventional weapons.243.	This year this Assembly's deliberations take place against the sombre background of tension in several different parts of the world. The economic background is grim too. The large and sudden increases in the price of oil this year have serious and damaging implications for the world economy. They will lead certainly to higher inflation and to balance-of-payments difficulties for very many countries. The oil-importing developing countries will be the hardest hit. But we are all affected.244.	The world's reserves of oil are not limitless. We all need to do what we can to use them properly and to reduce our consumption of oil. The British Government stands by the recent decisions of the International Energy Agency  the European Community and the Tokyo Economic Summit. These should have an important impact on the oil market by reducing demand for oil and by encouraging the development of other sources of energy  new and renewable.245.	But we cannot solve our problems by acting in isolation. In energy  almost more than anywhere else  the world is one world. There needs to be joint consideration of world energy problems and closer contacts between those who produce oil and those who import it  whether developed or developing countries. A number of proposals to this end have recently been made. We are certainly ready to consider all these proposals sympathetically in the hope that we can agree on the way ahead.246.	Finally  I should like to say something very shortly about the North-South dialogue. At a time when both developed and developing countries are struggling to stave off the effects of recession  it is hardly surprising that progress should be slow. I have spoken of the dangers of rhetoric. In this field of international economic relations  the dangers of rhetoric are perhaps at their greatest. We must all guard against the creation of new bodies whose primary function is the exchange of rhetoric. The first step has to be a substantial improvement in the shape and state of the world economy. It is increased production  not increased words  which creates resources. And without increased production how can there be a transfer of resources from rich to poor  whether at home or overseas  through increased aid  trade and investment? So our first priority must be to bring about the right framework in which more resources can be produced.247.	That is why my Government has taken steps to cut public expenditure right across the board. That is inevitable  if we are to put our economy in order and if we are to be able to help the less developed countries to achieve prosperity. We are no less concerned than others about the large proportion of the world's population that is unacceptably poor. Nor are we turning our backs on the North-South dialogue  despite its frustrations. On the contrary  we recognize that in an interdependent world Britain has a vital interestâboth economic and moralâin bringing prosperity to the poorer nations. That is why we have made it abundantly plain that we are in favour of maintaining the open trading system and of increasing overseas investment. Indeed  to encourage the latter  my Government has introduced considerable relaxations in exchange control. Provided the climate is right  these relaxations should be of direct benefit to the developing countries. Increased trade and increased investment are contributions we can make now. In due course increased growth should make it possible to provide more aid. But there are no easy short-cuts. The road back to greater prosperityâfor North and Southâis unlikely to be either easy or short. It will be even harder if each country or grouping tries to make it separately.248.	We are one world  bound to support each other if we are not to undergo greater hardships on our own. This is true of our search for prosperity and it is true of our search for peace and security. In both fields the United Nations provides an essential forum for discussion which can lead to useful action. The tasks of the 1980s are formidable and they face us all. We can overcome them  but only if we allow our common interests to bring us together and work out our solutions as one community."
"50",2592,"GHA",34,1979,"ï»¿First of all  Sir  let me congratulate you most warmly on your elevation to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are particularly delighted that the very first appearance in the United Nations of a Ghanaian delegation representing the new civilian administration of the Third Republicâthe Government of the People's National Party under the presidency of Mr. Hilla Limanâshould take place during a session presided over by a brother from the sister country  the United Republic of Tanzania. Your election is a fitting tribute to your fine qualities of leadership  impartiality and tact  qualities which you have abundantly displayed as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. Your election reflects honour not only on your native country  which  along with the other front-line States  continues to play such a laudable role in the liberation struggle  but on all of Africa  whose increasingly important role in world affairs today is thus fittingly recognized. We are convinced that both in the open debate and in the corridors of this Assembly your diplomatic skill and sober judgement will be fully brought to bear in guiding the discussions to a successful conclusion. In your challenging task as President  my delegation would like to assure you of its ready-support and co-operation at all times.2.	To your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia  we convey our deepest appreciation of his excellent achievement during his tenure of office in steering the thirty-third session to such a successful conclusion.3.	It is common knowledge that the work of this Assembly cannot be carried out effectively without the valuable support provided by our distinguished Secretary-General and his self-effacing but able and dedicated staff both at United Nations Headquarters and its various offices around the world. The Ghana delegation would like to place on record its profound appreciation of their excellent work.4.	May I here express our own sense of bereavement at the passing of Mr. Agostinho Neto  the late President of Angola  by his untimely death Africa has lost one of its greatest sons in the present phase of decolonization. He was a great African leader who  along with others like him  finally turned the tide against the colonialism of Salazar and Caetano and thus cleared the way for the final assault on the last bastions of imperialism and racial domination in southern Africa. Our profoundest condolences go to the delegation and to the Government and people of Angola for this irreparable loss.5.	The late President Boumediene of Algeria will also be remembered throughout the third world  and beyond it  not only as a great champion of the people in his own country  and a great fighter for rights of the Palestinian and Saharan peoples  but also as a great pioneer of the New International Economic Order. By his death  Africa  the Arab nations  and all the third world have sustained a heavy loss. To the Algerian delegation  and to the Algerian Government and people  we convey our deepest sympathies.6.	For us in Ghana  the birth of every new State is an occasion for rejoicing as it marks another milestone in the systematic eradication of colonialism. It is for this reason that we heartily welcome into our growing family the Government and people of Saint Lucia. We share their justified feeling of fulfilment and wish them every success in tackling the difficult problems of nation-building.7.	Ghana is a member of the non-aligned movement. Our first President  Mr. Kwame Nkrumah  was among the founding fathers of the movement. Guided by his precept and example  the People's National Party Government of the Third Republic  has resolved that the foreign policy of Ghana shall be securely anchored in the cardinal principles of non-alignment  namely  independence from great-Power influence  scrupulous respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations  and total commitment to the crusade for self-determination.8.	It is perhaps appropriate for us to recall the historic pronouncement of Mr. Nkrumah  on the eve of Ghana's independence some 22 years ago  that Ghana's independence would be meaningless unless it was linked with the total liberation of Africa. The Government of the People's National Party is determined that  in collaboration with all countries which believe in true freedom and justice for all men  Ghana shall bear its part of the burden  make the sacrifice and pay the price in order to achieve total and genuine freedom for all Africa and indeed for all territories still under colonial and alien domination.9.	In keeping with its commitment to genuine freedom and independence  Ghana did not hesitate to reject the internal settlement arranged between the racist Smith and the Muzorewa clique because that settlement did not bring majority rule to the people of Zimbabwe  but merely provided a black front for what was  in reality  the continuation of racist minority rule and the perpetuation of injustice. Any system of government which places in the hands of 3 per cent of the population the power to block all constitutional advance for a period of 10 years  and the control of the security forces as well as all senior positions in the civil service  the judiciary  and the police  is grossly unjust  and indeed outmoded at birth.10.	The consensus on Zimbabwe  reached at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held at Lusaka in August  clearly rejected the internal settlement and called for fresh elections based on a new constitution which would truly reflect the inalienable rights and legitimate aspirations of the black majority. Ghana supported this consensus  which we believe provides the basis for a just and internationally acceptable solution. In this regard  our prime objective was to ensure that the sole authentic liberation movement  the Patriotic Front  whose sacrifices and armed struggle created the right political conditions  assumes its rightful role in a truly independent Zimbabwe.11.	We expect the United Kingdom Government to honour its pledge and fulfil all its responsibilities and obligations as the administering Power  by ensuring  inter alia  that the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference  now being held at Lancaster House  produces a settlement acceptable to the black majority and to the international community. In the event that the Lancaster House negotiations on the constitution for independence should founder  there would be no alternative to an intensification of the armed struggle  and Ghana would for its part continue to extend all moral and material support to the heroic Patriotic Front until genuine majority rule was achieved.12.	It does  however  need to be emphasized that it would not be enough to secure agreement on a constitution without agreement on the transitional arrangements leading to independence. The character of an interim administration  arrangements for properly supervised elections and acceptable conditions for the cease-fireâall these have to be agreed on before any question of lifting sanctions can properly arise. Neither a cease-fire nor an end to international sanctions was envisaged at the Lusaka Meeting except in the context of putting into operation a settlement which could truly be regarded as lasting and internationally acceptable. Let no one imagine  expect or believe that a conclusion of the proceedings at Lancaster House that falls short of these conditions is likely to produce either an end to the war or an end to international sanctions. And any such conclusion should not be regarded as sufficient justification for a unilateral lifting of sanctions in defiance of the Security Council's decision under Chapter VII of the Charter and in violation of Charter obligations.13.	The issue of independence for Namibia continues to engage the attention of the United Nations and has perhaps become one of the most intractable problems facing this Organization. The five Western Powers and the front-line States worked out in 1978 a formula that formed the basis of the Secretary-General's plan for Namibia's transition to independence.  This plan was  however  sabotaged by the South African authorities  who  true to form  raised tenuous objections to its provisions and announced their intention of proceeding with their own bogus elections without the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  under what was in fact an internal settlement of the Rhodesian type. In spite of the Secretary-General's untiring efforts to achieve a cease-fire and break the deadlock  South Africa's provocative response took the form of a vicious attack on what it called a build-up of SWAPO guerrilla bases inside Angolaâa sovereign and independent State. The next phase was the arrest of 31 leading members of SWAPO's internal wing in Namibia  the transformation of the Constituent Assembly into a National Assembly with limited legislative powers and the appointment of a hard-liner as the new Administrator-General of this United Nations Trust Territory.14.	If the sinister design of the South African authorities is meant to bring about another unilateral declaration of independence in Namibia in utter defiance of international opinion  then South Africa will have to be warned now  in no uncertain terms  that this world body is ready and willing to frustrate its intentions by effective measures. In this regard  my delegation calls on the Security Council to implement  without any further delay  the resolution adopted by a vast majority of countries at the resumed thirty-third session of the General Assembly which proposed that the Security Council should urgently take enforcement measures against South Africa as provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter  in order to ensure South Africa's compliance with the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations on Namibia. My delegation is confident that the Security Council will enhance its credibility by taking such measures.15.	The related question of Walvis Bay should not be forgotten. My delegation will wish to reiterate its well- known position that Walvis Bay is an integral part of Namibia and should be so considered in any negotiations leading to the Territory's independence. Walvis Bay is Namibia's only deep-water port and is also the nerve centre of the Territory's thriving fishing industry and export and import trade. South Africa's questionable claim based on a nineteenth century fiction has been rightly rejected by this body  by the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  by SWAPO  by the front-line States and  indeed  by the five Western Powers.16.	Ghana's consistent and uncompromising condemnation of the criminal policy of apartheid  a policy rooted in the myth of racial superiority  stems from our abhorrence of any system which subjects man to humiliating indignities. While we are aware of the existence of pockets of racial prejudice and aberrations regarding human rights in other countries  it is only in South Africa that the policy of racial discrimination  of suppression and of persistent human rights violations against a majority of another racial stock has been institutionalized as an official  as well as a religious  dogma and given the full backing of the law.17.	The racial policies of South Africa create tensions and constitute a serious threat to world peace in our increasingly interdependent world; and yet strenuous efforts made since 1946 by the General Assembly and by the Security Council to change those backward policies have been treated with contempt by South Africa. Worse still  this shameful apartheid policy has been extended to Namibia  a Territory legally under United Nations administration. In view of South Africa's incorrigible obstinacy over a long period of 34 years  during which the international community's well-meaning exhortations have proved totally futile  my delegation calls for positive action in terms of comprehensive sanctions  including oil sanctions  aimed at ringing the racist regime to heel. In this regard  my delegation would like to record its deep gratitude to the new Iranian Government for joining the Arab oil- producing countries in their unqualified commitment to the embargo on oil supplies to South Africa.18.	The situation arising from the stoppage of Iranian and Arab oil supplies to South Africa offers a unique opportunity to the international community  particularly the other oil-exporting countries  to exert additional pressure on South Africa. Already the extra bill of approximately $5 million which South Africa has to meet every day for oil supplies from the spot market is doing serious harm to its economy  In order to prevent further oil from secretly entering South Africa  we urge the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] to extend their boycott to the five international oil companies known to be marketing to South Africa about 85 per cent of its oil supplies. Additionally  we endorse the suggestion that  in order to prevent embargoed oil from reaching South Africa  OPEC countries might include a standard clause in their sales contracts stipulating that the oil sold to any country should not be resold to South Africa or to any intermediary for future sale to South Africa. These measures  if faithfully applied  would make a great contribution towards the eradication of apartheid. We also welcome and applaud the courageous decision of the Nordic countries to support the intensification of international pressures against the apartheid regime.19.	In further defiance of international opinion  South Africa has since September 1979 created another of its so-called ""independent black States"". Venda  a small inhospitable area with a population of less than half a million  and without any resources  will have to be dependent on grants and paltry crumbs from its benefactor. The international community has in the past refused to recognize two such States and my delegation strongly urges all States Members of the United Nations as well as non-member States to withhold recognition from this spurious State of Venda.20.	As regards the Middle East problem  it is the view of my delegation that any settlement which ignores the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self- determination in Palestine and which does not accord full recognition to the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the authentic representative of the Palestinian people is unrealistic and bound to fail. In the light of the whole history of the Middle East problem  the refusal to have any talks  or indeed any contact  with the PLO is a totally untenable position. We are convinced that the PLO should participate on equal terms in all negotiations on the question of the Middle East and Palestine and that the PLO can play a constructive role in the search for a just and lasting settlement.21.	My delegation would also like to state categorically that it remains unalterably opposed to any Israeli presence on African and Arab land acquired as a prize of war. We also totally reject unilateral modifications of international boundaries by the use of force contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter. It is our belief that all States in the area have the right to peaceful existence in secure and recognized boundaries.22.	Indeed  our concern for a stable order in the Middle East has inspired our participation in various efforts  including conferences relating to this complex problem; it has also led to our contribution of two contingents of troops to serve in the area under the flag of UNEF and now under that of UNIFIL in southern Lebanon  so as to assist in securing a lasting peace for an area that has endured so much suffering for so long.23.	We are greatly encouraged by the positive results of the first review session of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  held at Belgrade in 1977. The renewed efforts to normalize relations and the cultivation of friendly co-operation should enhance the concept of detente and contribute to the relaxation of international tensions. The consolidation of detente and security in Europe  in view of our growing"" interdependence will have meaning only if it ensures the security and well-being of all States. We must move beyond the present gains and seek lasting solutions to the underlying causes of tension in international relations  including colonialism and under-development. It is regrettable that the super-Powers are still preoccupied  because of their shared feeling of insecurity  with the acquisition of more sophisticated nuclear weapons in order to achieve an illusory nuclear parity and mutual deterrence. We believe that the progressive reduction in the level of such expenditures will release much-needed resources not only for domestic development in their countries but also for promoting economic growth in the developing world. 24.	The current world economic situation poses grave problems for the developing countries. Its persistence will threaten the very livelihood of large numbers of people in those parts of the world  unless extraordinary efforts are made by the entire international community to bring the poor nations firmly within the developmental process. According to informed forecasts  if present trends continueâand they probably willâthe already intolerable conditions of these poor nations will  by the turn of the century  have deteriorated to unprecedented levels.25.	The developing countries  which represent three quarters of the world's population  account for a mere 20 per cent of total world trade. This unacceptably small share has failed to expand  as it normally should have  largely because of protectionist barriers raised by the developed nations against those products from the developing countries which could  in conditions of fair competition  significantly increase the latter's participation in world trade. The developing countries' access to financial resources for development purposes remains severely limited; at the same time their debt- servicing liabilities have grown completely unmanageable because of the harsh lending conditions under which they are forced to borrow.26.	In short  the gap between the developed and the developing countries is widening rapidly  causing serious social and political havoc in an increasing number of developing countries. Thus there now exists a very severe crisis of development.27.	Yet the great advances which science and technology have achieved in our lifetime have undeniably endowed man with a unique capacity to wipe out poverty from the face of the earth. Ironically however  this advantage is employed far more to increase the risks of self-annihilation than to improve the quality of life everywhere. The advances in science and technology are properly regarded as an asset belonging to the human family as a whole  and should be fully utilized as such and equitably shared among all.28.	Taking the example of agriculture and food production  it is disturbing to observe that the developing countries  which are generally regarded as agricultural and producers of primary products  are the very ones which can least satisfy the food needs and general agricultural requirements of their people. Agriculture has become so heavily industrialized that it is now virtually the preserve of the already industrialized countries  and this has serious implications for the trade and well- being of their disadvantaged counterparts. The international community must be concerned about the dangers implicit in policies which perpetuate such an unhappy state of affairs. With particular reference to the application of science and technology to agriculture and food production  all members of the international community should commit themselves irrevocably to ensuring that all decisions already taken within the United Nations system regarding food production  food aid and food security are implemented fully as a matter of the utmost urgency.29.	Since the last session of the General Assembly  the international economic situation has taken a turn for the worse. Serious distortions have developed because of fundamental defects in the system resulting in balance-of-payments difficulties  widespread recession  inflation and yet another energy crisis. Growth in world trade has suffered a serious setback  and many countries  particularly those with developed economies  have turned to greater protectionism  thus damaging the prospects of improvement in global living standards. Such acts of protectionism are short-sighted  because expanding world trade facilitates the exchange of goods and services and opens up avenues for investment  which in turn generate mutual employment opportunities.30.	These unhappy developments have forcefully underlined our growing interdependence. No nation  however powerful  can really solve its problems in isolation. The recent negotiations between the European Economic Community and the African  Caribbean and Pacific States  characterized as they were by confrontation and polemics  achieved only limited success. The results of the fifth session of UNCTAD  on which so much hope was pinned  fell far short of our expectations  as the session failed to promote liberal trade  or advance the development process in any significant way. The recent renegotiation of the International Cocoa Agreement in Geneva provides another instance of a clear lack of political will on the part of the developed countries  and demonstrates their insufficient sensitivity to the grave problems which continually afflict the developing countries but which  if solved  could contribute immensely to the achievement of an equitable system of international economic relations.31.	I need hardly point out that for the majority of the developing countries; raw materials constitute the mainstay of their economies. In the particular case of Ghana  cocoa is the very life-blood of the economy and accounts for over 65 per cent of the country's foreign- exchange earnings. While cocoa has proved vulnerable to variables such as the weather and unstable prices  essential inputs such as machinery and fertilizers  which must be imported from the industrialized countries  continue to escalate steadily in price  adding to the distress of the impoverished producer.32.	Only a price structure which is equitable to the producer as well as to the consumer can guarantee stability in the industry. Thus an unrealistic minimum price level which is obviously inadequate to cover fixed overhead not only is morally wrong but also perpetuates the perennial injustices which we are with such painful effort striving to redress. It would be tedious to spell out the full implications of the current unrealistic price system in terms of its destabilizing impact on our fragile economies.33.	The necessity of our time has imposed on all of us an obligation to anchor our relations on mutually beneficial international co-operation. In view of our interdependence  my delegation would like from this rostrum to appeal to the consumer developed countries for greater flexibility to permit agreement on more equitable cocoa price levels at the next renegotiating conference.34.	We are among the first to admit that development within our own domestic milieu is our primary responsibility. We have therefore paid attention to utilizing our limited resources for the attainment of social and economic objectives so as to brighten the lives of our peoples. We accept this responsibility  but development also provides a basis for international cooperation for mutual gain  under which we welcome foreign investment and a variety of experts with special skills to build  to heal and to help in forging an alliance for reciprocal progress.35.	Our economic policy is indeed based primarily on self-reliance  by which we seek essentially through our own resources to mobilize and develop Ghana's natural wealth  achieve modernization and overcome the vicious circle of poverty  thereby satisfying the growing expectations of our people. This strategy does not  however  preclude international co-operation with all friendly countries regardless of their ideological orientation or economic systems  provided that they respect our hopes and aspirations and our exclusive and sovereign right to determine our own domestic and foreign policy.36.	A major thrust of our foreign policy is the promotion of good-neighbourliness  by which we seek to stimulate and foster the closest possible co-operation and collaboration with our neighbours  so as to harness in an orderly fashion the material and human resources of the region. This explains the various bilateral trade and economic agreements and permanent joint com-missions signed with our neighbours. Such endeavours will be supportive of the wider co-operation that our membership in the Economic Community of West African States seeks to promote in order to remove constraints imposed by limited domestic-market skills  technology and investment funds. We are also dedicated to the strengthening of our continental and global links in order to promote mutual progress  advance the objectives of the New International Economic Order and achieve social justice.37.	I should now like to touch briefly on the energy question  which is of such crucial importance to all of us. It is with a sense of great expectation that my Government welcomes the decision to hold a United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy in 1981. My Government has also taken due note of current proposals to explore new forms of energy in the search for a more permanent solution to the energy crisis.38.	All of us have a stake in achieving stability and prosperity  in creating the right climate for the attainment of the ideal of a world which is one  a world without war  want  ignorance or under-development. For the continued existence of two worlds on this planet  with the minority living on an island of precarious affluence while the majority is condemned to grinding poverty and despair as the wretched of the earth only heightens international tensions and calls into question our sense of social justice and fair play. It also undermines the great act of faith of the founding fathers who designed the United Nations machinery not merely for the pursuit of international peace and security but also for the attainment of social and economic advancement for all.40 We have now reached the cross-roads. The options are clear. We must either come together in a grand design of collective co-operation or bitterly drift apart and disintegrate. As one great American statesman aptly observed and cautioned: ""You cannot have peace you cannot even have your legitimate business of the world  unless you are partners with the rest.""41.	Most of the problems that plague the majority of mankind are environmental and man-made  and they should therefore constitute a challenge to our joint and concerted wisdom. Given our natural instinct for survival  we are unavoidably left with the choice of charting a path which will enable us to exploit together the opportunities before us and mould an enduring future based on the New International Economic Order. In this regard may I assure the representatives that the new democratically elected Government of Ghana pledges its commitment to peace and international cooperation and stands prepared to contribute fully to their realization."

May we also be permitted to express our gratitude to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary- General  for the great competence with which he is fulfilling his delicate mission at the head of our Organization. We assure him of the firm support and total confidence of the people of Guinea and its President  Comrade Ahmed Se'kou Toure'.145.	Lastly  it is with great satisfaction that we welcome to our midst the new State of Saint Lucia  with which our country would like to establish relations of confidence  friendship and co-operation.146.	Africa has just suffered an immense loss in the passing of President Antonio Agostinho Neto of Angola  a tireless and intransigent fighter for the democratic African revolution. We address to our sister delegation of Angola a sincere expression of our condolences  and we wish to assure it of our active solidarity.147.	An analysis of the international political situation brings out the inevitable contradiction which pits the forces of emancipation of peoples against the systems of oppression and exploitation. The axis of the situation lies between two poles: the persistence of foreign domination  and the liberation struggle waged on various fronts by the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America.148.	Thus  we are bound to continue to observe with bitterness  but also alas in guilty impotence  that in southern Africa millions of Africans are groaning permanently under the weight of racist oppression and exploitation. Arbitrary imprisonments and massacres of African populations are common practices designed to check any attempt on the part of the majority to lay claim to the exercise of its inalienable rights to self- determination and independence.149.	The white racist minority regimes implanted in South Africa  in Zimbabwe and in Namibia are the best possible bases of aggression against Mozambique  Zambia  Botswana  Angola and Lesotho. At the same time  they are the choice subjugated zone of imperialist exploitation  a fact which adequately explains the material aid and the political and diplomatic support that is given to those regimes by the Western Powers. The incredible and intolerable indifference of the Western allies of Pretoria and Salisbury to the bombings and aggressions of all kinds against the front-line countries form part of this support.150.	The delegation of the Party-State of Guinea calls vigorously and insistently for the application against the apartheid regime of Pretoria of sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter. It also feels that it is the duty of the international community to afford Mozambique  Angola  Zambia  Botswana and Lesotho increasing aid of various kinds to enable them to resist victoriously the onslaughts of South Africa and Rhodesia and to cope with their consequencesâin particular  material destruction and the constant and increasing flow of refugees.151.	Without anticipating the outcome of the London negotiations  our delegation is convinced of the inescapable nature of the victory of the peoples of Zimbabwe  whose armed struggle is directed by the Patriotic Front. The armed struggle waged by the gallant freedom fighters in Namibia under the leadership of their vanguard  SWAPO  for total independence  including Walvis Bay  an integral part of the Territory  will be crowned with success.152.	The daily battle waged by the patriots of South Africa  in spite of all neo-colonialist manoeuvres now in progress  will also achieve victory. We know from experience that independence and freedom are not negotiated: they are fought for and won.153.	An examination of the situation in Africa  in South-East Asia and in the Middle East exposes other hotbeds of tension  and brings into focus the immensity of the task which our Organization has to face in trying to establish a just and lasting peace in all these parts of the world.154.	With regard to Western Sahara  our delegation would recall that the OAU has already assumed its responsibilities through the adoption  at the sixteenth ordinary session of its Assembly of Heads of State or Government at Monrovia  of the report of the committee of wise men  or the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara  on this important question.155.	Being in agreement with the conclusions and recommendations of that Committee  of which it is a member  the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea believes they should be put into effect. Also  the Party-State of Guinea is following  with confidence  the peace initiatives adopted at various levels outside the OAU as well as within it  to achieve a permanent solution which  we hope  will be constructive and beneficial  and also will redound to the advantage of all parties involved. The Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea will spare no effort to reach that goal.156.	With regard to the representation of Kampuchea  the leader responsible for our revolution  President Ahmed Sekou Toure  at the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Havana from 3 to 9 September 1979  made a thorough analysis of this crisis. He concluded that  both in the non-aligned movement and in the United Nations  it is States that are represented and not regimes  and that consequently it is the Government in being  that of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  which should occupy the seat which belongs to it by right  not only at the Havana Conference  but also in our world Organization.â157.	It is because we do not wish to repeat past mistakes that we must  as President Ahmed Sekou Toure has shown  give to the Government established at Phnom Penh the seat among us which belongs to it by right. We fully understand the concern of those who invoke the violation of international law to oppose the restitution to the present government at Phnom Penh of its seat in the United Nations. They fear that the example of Kampuchea might be contagious  and might spread to other countries of South-East Asia. But in the opinion of our delegation  what is more dangerous than a foreign intervention is the fact that a Government  by its reactionary  antinational  anti-popular policy could raise the masses against itself  and irretrievably lose any credibility in their eyes. What our Organization must not lose sight of  and what must serve it as a lodestone each time it is to decide upon similar cases  which may unfortunately arise in future  is the awareness of the interests of the people concerned. Above all  may realism prevail here at the United Nations in New York with the recognition that there is in Phnom Penh a government which is governing in fact. The United Nations has pursued this unrealistic policy on another occasion by denying the great Chinese people its legitimate rights and representation. We came to realize that that policy does not pay. History is stubborn and does not repeat itself.158.	Our country also ardently hopes that the differences between the People's Republic of China and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam can be resolved through peaceful and sincere negotiations. We also hope that the talks begun by the Soviet Union and China will likewise result in satisfactory solutions that can safeguard the interests of those two friendly countries  peoples joined by history and geography whose destiny is linked in solidarity with all the peoples of the world  including the people of Guinea.159.	The situation in the Middle East shows that the southern part of Africa is not the only place where blood is being shed. In that other area of the world  the Palestinian people are being deprived of their right to exist. Indeed  since the Balfour Declaration of 1917 that led to the creation of Israel  this region has known nothing but war. In our opinion  there is no need to dwell on the origins of this conflict  the persistent nature of which is a subject of great concern and anxiety for our Organization.160.	Although we have never denied any people the right to existence  neither have we ever condoned this right's being exercised by denying the right to existence of another people.161.	Israel must realize that the Palestinian people  whose sole legitimate representative is the PLO  will never renounce their inalienable national rights. In any negotiation for the over-all settlement of the Middle East crisis  the PLO must have the exclusive right to speak and act on behalf of Palestine 162.	The security of Israel lies less in territorial conquests than in peaceful coexistence with all the States of the region on the basis of respect for the recognized right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent national State. The status of the Holy City of Jerusalem as the hallowed site of the three great monotheistic religions must also be scrupulously respected. Israel must proceed  finally  to the unconditional withdrawal of all its troops from all occupied Arab territories.163.	In this connexion  our delegation considers that the Egyptian-Israeli agreements do not represent a real solution. For this reason  we support the holding of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the question of Palestine as proposed at the Tenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held at Fez last May  and we subscribe to the idea of convening  under the aegis of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  an international conference devoted to Palestine and the Middle East for the purpose of arriving at an over-all solution that would take into account the interests of all parties concerned.164.	In the meanwhile  the international community must deal more resolutely with the record of Israel's repeated aggressions against Lebanon. We emphasize this because this situation contains the genuine seeds of a conflict with unforeseeable dimensions.165.	Cyprus also continues to be a subject for concern in this Assembly. The delegation of Guinea considers that the territorial integrity  national unity and non- aligned character of that country must be protected. The discussions between the two communities that have yielded certain tangible results must be pursued under the aegis of the Secretary-General of our Organization.166.	The question of Korea  furthermore  is of equal concern. Our position is well known: we consider that the withdrawal of all foreign troops is an essential prior condition for the Korean people to achieve reunification in peace  without any outside interference  The tragedy of a divided people such as the Korean and Comorian peoples affects the balance of the entire international community  which must promote only those things that can contribute to the realization of this aspiration to national unity.167.	Our Organization must examine the fate of all peoples still being subjected to colonial domination and thus deprived of their inalienable right to self- determination in Africa  in Latin America  in the Caribbean and in Asia.168.	We wish to take this opportunity to hail the resounding victory of the gallant peoples of Nicaragua and Iran  whose example cannot fail to be followed by other peoples under neo-colonialist dictatorships.169.	The elimination of apartheid and an end to foreign intervention in the domestic affairs of the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America are preconditions to the establishment of true peace. In order to be genuine  detente must cover every region of our planet.170.	Indeed  developing countries know that any threat to peace imperils their efforts to strengthen their national independence and ensure their economic development. They are thus the first to feel concern about the establishment of an international order based on relations of trust and free from the threat of war. Such an international order must abolish the parcelling of the world into zones of influence or conquest in which the right to exercise domination would be preserved. The tendency of certain Powers to extend their lines of security beyond their geographical borders and into regions of the world that come under their purported protection and influence is extremely dangerous. The Party-State of Guinea will never agree to be a part of this ploy or to submit to it. Our people have sufficient strength  determination and conviction to win respect for its will to independence and to resist any infringement of its sovereignty.171.	On the question of disarmament  preceding speakers have laid sufficient emphasis on the evils of the arms race. My delegation fervently hopes that it will be brought to an end.172.	We are pleased to quote in this connexion President Ahmed Se'kou Toure  who stated:""The Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea gives its unqualified support to all decisions which might operate in favour of a reduction in international tensions and the arms race. It is also determined to oppose any attempts to establish a status quo which would maintain the unacceptable differentiations  the existing inequalities and discriminations in the living conditions of peoples and in the relations established between nations.""173.	It is specifically in the economic field that these relations are particularly unjust. The present economic situation is characterized by: first  a steady deterioration in the relationship of forces which has been detrimental to the developing countries; secondly  the export of increasing monetary inflation from the North to the South  as the consequence of monetary disorders in the industrialized countries; thirdly  constant increases in the external debt of the developing countries  because they have to channel their economies into exports. Many other factors contribute to a widening gap between the industrialized countries and the developing countries.174.	In the opinion of my delegation  the bitter truth is that  regardless of our approach to the issues  regardless of which bloc we give our sympathy to  there are always a few multinationals ready to turn their attention to us with our tacit or explicit connivance. The fact remains that  while we cannot be blamed for the existence of multinationals  we can be blamed for their persistence.175.	The standstill in the North-South dialogue and in the discussions in UNCTAD  the meagre results of the renewed Lome Convention  should all serve to convince the developing countries that they must stand together and promote a new development policy. That new strategy must be pursued nationally  regionally and internationally. Nationally this requires  first  that the people of different countries should take control of the principal economic levers in the areas of industry  transport  energy and trade; secondly  an independent national currency should be created; thirdly  there must be agrarian reform aimed at the promotion of modern agriculture; fourthly  a dynamic industrial system in harmony with a policy of land management should be created; and fifthly  those segments of society  young people and women  who have heretofore been deprived of their legitimate economic and social roles  should be brought into the fight for development.176.	We also believe that the advent of a new international economic order must lead to the creation of sub- regional and regional organizations. These institutions must serve to harmonize and integrate broader communities and bring them into the economic structures of our States  which have suffered from an arbitrary fragmentation giving rise to ""micro-markets"" barely  if at Si  viable. This form of co-operation must cover the following areas: transport  telecommunications  banking institutions  trade  the training of cadres and technical assistance.177.	We welcome the existence of the Latin American Economic System and of the Economic Community of West African States. These institutions must be supported by associations of producers of raw materials  such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Bauxite Association  just to mention those two. When those conditions are met  then and only then will the developing countries be in a good position to negotiate in international forums.178.	Notwithstanding the alarming situation which many representatives quite rightly have spoken about from this rostrum  my delegation believes that the international community must continue to be optimistic regarding positive results to be expected from the special session of the General Assembly in 1980 to be devoted to development problems.179.	Concerning the new strategy  we can affirm  as a representative of the African continent among the officers of the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy  that  regarding the requirements of development  Africa will maintain the position which it has so often expressed at previous meetings of the Preparatory Committee. That position is that the future strategy must take into account not only the growing gap between the North and South but above all must advocate special and specific political measures to help the poorer countries of the South.180.	On the initiative of President Ahmed Sekou Toure'  the OAU decided in resolution AHG/Res. 96 (XVI) to convene in Lagos in 1980 a special summit session devoted exclusively to a thorough consideration of the economic situation in Africa  which is inseparable from the general economic situation in the entire world  with a view to defining the ways and means of promoting the economic integration of our continent.181.	For all these reasons  my delegation is quite convinced that it is possible to create a new international economic order of benefit to the entire international community on the basis of justice  equality and mutual interest.  182.	The gravity of the world economic situation cannot turn our attention from the problem of the environment. Considering the harm done to nature by the development of the wealth of the subsoil  we welcome the draft convention on the preservation of nature which Zaire is planning to submit to our States for consideration.183.	As regards the measures being considered by the United Nations to help the Sudano-Sahelian region  my country will give special attention to any plan of action aimed at ensuring  first  the rational management and exploitation of water  soil and vegetation resources; secondly  the rational management and development of pasture-land; and  thirdly  reafforestation.184.	The Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea is the primary water source of West Africa  and it is now accepted that the success of any campaign to combat the drought in the Sahelian sub region requires the development in Guinea of the Futa catchment basin  the source of the largest waterways in our part of the world. The sixteenth ordinary session of the OAU Assembly adopted a decision on the development of that basin. We are convinced that international support and the co-operation of the States of the Sahel will not be withheld from us  that the Economic Community of West African States will also enjoy assistance in their fight against the drought and that that assistance will be forthcoming from the entire international community.185.	The United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were proclaimed long ago  but it is less than seven years since the question of the protection of human rights was included in our agenda and the debate on this subject took on a special nature and world-wide scope. We find that development heartening and encouraging. Our countries have a duty firmly to support any action to bring about the triumph of causes that concern mankind all over the world. We  for our part  will support any action to strengthen the cause of human rights anywhere in the world.186.	However    my delegation believes that our Organization can usher in a world where human rights are respected only if countries reach agreement on a global approach to the cause of human rights throughout the world. How can we reconcile the concept of a selective discriminatory approach to the rights of the individual  in which human rights are defended only when there is political profit to be gained from it  with a global concept which views human rights as fundamental and indivisible and part of the larger problem of the rights of peoples?187.	We firmly believe that the cause of human rights necessarily has certain limits owing to the fact that man's much proclaimed universality is not yet matched  in our contemporary society  by a universal respect for man's rights. There is a deep-rooted discrepancy between the rights recognized to every manâ whether white  black  yellow  rich or poorâand the rights that he actually enjoys in daily life. It must be courageously recognized that a single standard is not applied in today's world  although man's nature may be said to be universal and the same everywhere. We do not wish thereby to deny the spiritual and material dimensions of man as an individual; but those dimensions cannot be correctly evaluated without taking into account the political and social dimensions of man and the political and social conditions in which he lives.188.	In the light of those considerations it will be more easily understood why our country chose to organize in the first half of November 1978 an international ideological symposium in the course of which the questions of human rights and the rights of peoples were debated. The official records of that symposium give preference to the rights of peoples over human rightsâor  more accurately  they defined what is the correct approach to human rights by viewing human rights as part of the larger problem of the rights of peoples. To make clear the basic theses of that symposium  we wish to say that we cannot ferociously defend human rights without first doing whatever is necessary to eradicate apartheid in South Africa; to do away with the power of the white racist minority in Rhodesia; to restore the rights of the Namibian people; to put an end to the crime of killing civilian populations in Mozambique  Angola  Zambia and Botswana  resulting from bombings by white racists in South Africa and Rhodesia. How can we seriously claim to defend human rights elsewhere and at the same time allow the Palestinian people to have their rights erased from the records of mankind  including their right to existence? Is there any right more sacred than that? How can we effectively ensure the defence of human rights elsewhere if  closer to us in the Middle East  entire peoples are humiliated because their territories are occupied and Lebanon is being bombarded by Israel? Does not the defence of human rights involve also the defence of the right to a decent life for entire peoples? When we see the industrialized countries at the fifth session of UNCTAD at Manila and the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries meeting at Brussels flatly refusing to recognize the elementary economic rights of the peoples of the third world  we cannot help but wonder whether the selfishness of the industrialized Powers is not also a denial of human rights.189.	It would be a fine thing if those self-same crusaders for human rights were to declare war on all the injustices of our century  which might very well appear in the eyes of posterity to be the most cruel century in human history. Now that we are on the threshold of the third millennium  the future of mankind depends not only on the ability of our generation to solve the problems of development but also on our ability to remove from our world anything that mutilates the human person and peoples. Man cannot achieve great things on earth if he does not first face up to his many woes in all their dimensionsâpolitical  social  economic and spiritual.190.	The Party-State of Guinea has given close attention to the problem of integrating segments of society  young people and women  who have hitherto not been permitted to play their due role in the economic and social spheres  in the struggle I have described.191.	Thus  within the framework of the International Year of the Child proclaimed in resolution 31/169 of 21 December 1976  the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea set up in 1978 a national commission to prepare for the year under the presidency of Comrade Andree Toure  the wife of our Chief of State.192.	A few of the accomplishments of that commission  which has now become a permanent institution  are the adoption of a code protecting children  the issuance of a postage stamp  the creation of weekly educational radio and television programmes for children  the printing of story-books  the creation of playgrounds  the holding of a fair  exhibitions of children's works  and a national seminar on the sexual problems of youth  juvenile delinquency  the responsibility of parents for the education of their children  and the role of the organs of the Party-State.193.	We also welcome the fact that the international community seems now to be clearly in favour of restoring the right of women to participate in the political  economic and social life of nations.â194.	In Guinea  women played a paramount role in our struggle for national liberation  and they have exercised their full rights on an equal footing with men in all activities of the national life.195.	Our delegation fully supports the Draft Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women that our Organization is now preparing  and we are convinced that it will lead to the elimination of all barriers to the full development of women's potential.196.	In conclusion  we believe that the experience we have acquired during the 35 years of the existence of our Organization should make it possible for us to live up to the hopes that were placed in it when it was created.197.	Although the record in the area of decolonization is positive inasmuch as two thirds of the countries represented here were languishing under colonial domination when our Organization was created  the same cannot be said of the record in other areas.198.	Hotbeds of tension in southern Africa  in the Middle East  in South-East Asia and in other areas of the world and the stagnation in economic negotiations are challenges to our Organization requiring urgent and effective action by it.199.	If these problems are to be solved  there must be a complete overhauling of the structures of the United Nations Charter.200.	We understand why  under the Charter  the major Powers have been given a special responsibility and obligation in the maintenance of peace and security in the world. It is a fact that they have in their hands the means of mass destruction  which threaten peace  but the defence and preservation of peace cannot be considered to fall exclusively within the province of any Power.201.	That is why the United Nations Charter needs to be revised and needs all the structures and strength necessary for it to be more effective. We wonder whether the right to raise objections that is given to some in world affairs  an exorbitant right compared to the rights of the overwhelming majority  should continue to be exercised in our Organization  which preaches democracy and equality among all Members.202.	However that may be  we wish to reaffirm the fierce determination of the Revolutionary People's Republic of Guinea to join other nations in trying to ensure that reason will prevail over force and that justice will prevail over power."
"52",2718,"GNB",34,1979,"ï»¿Almost a month ago  Africa and the world learned the sad news of the premature death of President Agostinho Neto  which caused immense pain to the hearts of millions of Angolans. The political stature of Agostinho Neto is matched only by the greatness of the Angolan revolution. Mr. Neto's contribution to the liberation of the peoples of the world far exceeds the geographical limits of Angola and of Africa  and has attained a universal dimension. May I be allowed to pay a last heartfelt tribute to the memory of the unforgettable leader and founder of the Angolan nation  the long-time companion-in-arms of Amilcar Cabral and Eduardo Mondlane  the poet whose example and whose devotion to the noble cause of his people  to freedom  peace and the building of a free and prosperous Angola will remain forever engraved in the memories of all peoples that love peace and freedom.29.	It is a particular pleasure for me  Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of my country  Guinea-Bissau  which it is my singular honour to represent  to address to you sincere congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute by the international community to your outstanding qualities as a diplomat and experienced politician  qualities which you have so devotedly placed at the service of oppressed peoples. At the same time  the General Assembly also wanted to pay a well-deserved tribute to the fraternal people of the United Republic of Tanzania  who draw inspiration from the colonialist past from which they suffered in their constant struggle against exploitation and domination and for peace and the progress of the peoples.30.	I should also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General of our Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  to express to him our long-standing sympathy and to reiterate our appreciation of his devotion and his untiring efforts on behalf of peace  justice and international detente  whereby he has ennobled the mission and prestige of the United Nations.31.	I am particularly pleased to note the presence among us of the delegation of Saint Lucia  whose admission to full membership in our great family of nations enhances the universality of our Organization.32.	The second half of the twentieth centuryâthe century of freedomâhas been marked by popular struggles for national liberation. In Africa  in Asia and in Latin America  empires that were veritable bastions of colonialism have crumbled after several centuries of construction. In the aftermath of this phenomenon  we are witnessing the entry on to the international political scene of dozens of young States from the ruins of the colonial past  and this is a decisive factor in the transformation of today's world. We have witnessed the advancement of a part of mankind and its decisive and qualitative leap forward in the inevitable process of liberation within the over-all framework of the liberating dynamics of our era.33.	Here and there  however  the tidal wave of oppression persistently threatens the peoples of the world. Hotbeds of tension are still being fuelled and conflicts are being fomented and controlled from afar. Blame for this must be laid on the enemies of freedom and of the emancipation of peoples. Often  political  economic and cultural oppression reaches such proportions that it actually becomes colonization. And in many cases  and particularly where colonial domination is exercised by minority and racist regimes over a large majority  the violence of oppression becomes an open scandal and forces popular resistance to take the form of armed struggle  the sole means for asserting legitimate aspirations to freedom  peace and social justice.34.	Such is the phenomenon we are witnessing in southern Africa  in Western Sahara  in the Middle East and East Timor  where revolutionary violence  faced with the violence of oppression  makes armed resistance legitimate.35.	Everyone agrees that there has been a change on the political chess-board of southern Africa. Minority and racist regimes in that part of the African continent  faced with the stubborn struggle of the freedom fighters of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa  are attempting to work out new formulas of neo-colonialist compromise designed to perpetuate their domination.36.	The disturbing development of the situation in Namibia  and the creation of a so-called black majority government following the so-called internal settlement and sham elections in Zimbabwe  are evidence of this fact.37.	The elements of this change are essentially the result of the action taken by vanguard organizationsâ the Patriotic Front  SWAPO and the African National Congress of South Africaâwithin the framework of the new balance of forces established by the accession to independence of the former Portuguese colonies as a whole  in particular Angola and Mozambique.38.	In another respect  the conflicting internal convulsions within the minority racist regimes  which find it impossible to continue the exploitation of the black majority under their own system  as well as the increased international awareness of the inhuman nature of the situation constitute additional elements of the situation now prevailing in southern Africa.39.	South Africa is experiencing an economic crisis as a result of the recession in the capitalist world  the fall in investments and the restrictive practices of apartheid that hinder the full use of that country's human and material resources. That crisis explains the motives of the advocates of apartheid  in league with the imperialist Powers  in concocting alternative solutions to the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia.40.	In fact  we have witnessed of late a vast number of manoeuvres aimed at eliminating from the political scene liberation movements representing the legitimate interests and profound aspirations to independence of the peoples of that region. Efforts are being made to set up puppet regimes  including governments on the model of the South African Bantustan regimes. In Namibia  the creation of a so-called ""constituent assembly"" cannot be interpreted otherwise than as the prelude to a proclamation of unilateral independence by the racist settlers and their black agents.41.	We cannot accept such a de facto situation. Similarly  in Zimbabwe  we are already confronted with a racist puppet regime that was set up following a so- called internal settlement concocted by the racists; Rhodesia is a colony of the United Kingdom under the rules of international law. Its constitution is an illegal one because it is the product of an illegal regime  has no legal status and no political authority or moral force to win acceptance of the results of the sham election that was held in that Territory. This is a fundamental fact that deserves consideration by all those who speak out on behalf of human rights. It is thus becoming clear that the changes that have occurred in the political situation in southern Africa aimed at finding new alternatives to the earlier forms of domination employed by the minority and racist regimes are  more than anything else  the result of the armed struggle waged by the Patriotic Front and SWAPO. Because they are engaged in a national liberation struggle which is difficult and painful and because we have had a similar experience  the freedom fighters of Zimbabwe and Namibia appear to us to be the most genuine defenders of the ideals of the Charter of our Organization. Amilcar Cabral would have said that they are the anonymous fighters of the United Nations. Thus we are deeply disturbed.42.	We wish to stress in this Assembly the danger to the United Nations of the adoption of any position not reflecting the popular will of the black majority on the situation in southern Africa in general and  in particular  on the efforts being made to gain recognition for the puppet regime in Zimbabwe.43.	In our opinion  there is only one possible solution  and that is one which  in view of the sacrifices of the national liberation movements and those of the frontline countries  would pave the way to the exercise of power by the true representatives of the black majorities in those countries.44.	Any other action would be a denial of the basic principles of the United Nations and would jeopardize its foundation and objectives. We believe that our aim must be to sensitize the entire international community and encourage it to adopt the joint position of the OAU and the United Nations  which have spoken out in favour of the creation of conditions in southern Africa conducive to the free exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence and for the emergence of a political system that would be the choice of the African peoples of the continent.45.	It must be stressed also that it is the innocent peoples of Zambia  Angola and Mozambique in particular which bear the heavy burden of the war of aggression being conducted by the minority racist regimes  and it is necessary that international solidarity should be increasingly demonstrated in order to help those countries to comply with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.46.	The final bastions of colonialism and racism are defying world public opinion and the principles of the Charter of our Organization. It is therefore imperative that the Security Council and the entire international community should act in accordance with the responsibility incumbent upon them as a consequence of their undertaking to work for democratic solutions in southern Africa.47.	The Pretoria apartheid regime must take the necessary measures to reverse the process which has been started so that a truly democratic solution may be attained.48.	As far as Western Sahara is concerned  a new situation has been created thanks to the tremendous continuing successes of the courageous struggle of the Saharan people  under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO. 49.	The important military victories of the Frente POLISARIO have aroused the admiration of the peoples of the world which cherish freedom  and have increasingly attracted the attention and support of the international community. That in turn has led to the diplomatic successes of which we are all aware.50.	Recognition of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic by many Member States of our Organization is merely the result of respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and has no other aim than the complete elimination of colonialism in all its forms.51.	All independent countries  and particularly those which only recently were groaning under the boot of colonialism  have an overriding duty to make a contribution to the acceleration of the process of decolonization in order to restore the inalienable rights of the Saharan people to freedom and independence.52.	My Government welcomes the decision of the Government and people of the fraternal country of Mauritania to withdraw from the conflict and recognize the right to self-determination and sovereignty of the Saharan people over the territory that was seized from it. We believe that this noble and courageous act of the brotherly people of Mauritania deserves the support of the entire international community.53.	We hope that the Moroccan Government will not delay in heeding the voice of reason and  above all  will respect the decisions of the recent Assembly of Heads of State or Government of the OAU  held in Monrovia in July  and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations  and will follow Mauritania's example. In our opinion  that is the only possible way to put an end to this fratricidal war. This pressing appeal which we make to the Moroccan Government is especially fraternal in the sense that it is based on the historical bonds formed between our two peoples ever since the early days of our national liberation struggle  when the people and Government of Morocco helped us and made an inestimable contribution for a certain period.54.	The struggle of the Saharan people is irreversible and its victory inevitable. No force in the world can stop the victorious march of this martyred people which desires the freedom  sovereignty and national independence to which it is entitled  like any other people in the world.55.	As regards East Timor  we cannot fail to express our militant support for the just struggle of the Maubere people under the leadership of FRETILIN  to regain their international legal status so cruelly and inhumanly usurped by Indonesia.56.	We exhort the international community and the nations of the world to take whatever action is required by the present situation to bring about the full withdrawal of Indonesian troops from East Timor and help the people of that country to exercise their right to self-determination and independence.57.	The situation in Cyprus is also disturbing  and we hope that a just and lasting solution will be found that respects the territorial integrity and the national sovereignty of Cyprus  as well as the right of both communities  Greek and Turkish  to live together in a climate of peace and unity.58.	The problem in the Middle East is another source of deep concern. The complexity of the grave situation in the Middle East has had a negative impact on international relations and cannot be ignored by anyone. No one can disregard the duty of each one of us to contribute to restoring certain precepts which must above all be respected in the relations between the peoples of the area: freedom  a just peace  a global and lasting settlement and peaceful coexistence among men.59.	It would be Utopian to hope to solve the problem of the Middle East satisfactorily by ignoring at the outset its fundamental cause  namely  the flouting of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people trampled upon by Israel. It would also be Utopian to ignore the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and to exclude the PLO  which is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.60.	We reiterate our view that any negotiated settlement which does not include the return of the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the creation of a Palestinian State  will be doomed to failure.61.	The repeated acts of aggression perpetrated by Israel against the people of southern Lebanon are inhumane and deserve the strongest condemnation of the peoples of the world who cherish peace  freedom and justice.62.	The struggle of the people of Latin America to win back their national rights and exercise their sovereignty has also taken a qualitative step forward. The recovery of the Panama Canal is a victory for the Panamanian people that we welcome since it will help them to consolidate their political and economic independence.63.	In Nicaragua  an impressive popular uprising under the leadership of the Sandinist Front  which represents the legitimate aspirations for freedom and social justice of the poorest people  has done away with one of the oldest and most retrograde dictatorships in Latin America. The historic transcendence of the events in Nicaragua is a severe warning to unpopular dictatorial regimes.64.	Guinea-Bissau firmly supports the Provisional Government  which has emerged from that struggle as the sole representative of the Nicaraguan people.65.	A few weeks ago in Havana there came to a close the work of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries. The results achieved there emphasize that the fight against underdevelopment  neo-colonialism and imperialism must be based on a genuine policy of non-alignment  which is a decisive factor in the unification of popular liberation struggles. At the same time  non-alignment presupposes a concerted struggle against the enemies of the economic  political and cultural independence of the peoples of the world  against racism and Zionism  against treacherous attempts to turn the weaker countries into areas of rivalry or to confine them within zones of influence against the interests of their peoples.66.	At the present time we are experiencing a moment of uncertainty with regard to the future of economic relations between the industrialized countries and the developing countries. It is with particular concern that we approach this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  the importance of which can be compared to the crisis constantly and seriously affecting international economic relations.67.	Indeed  to take action to restructure the international economic system is required more urgently than ever  although the developed countries do not seem willing to move in that direction at the present time.68.	The policy of controlling the cycle of economic activities is at the source of the present situation  is a flagrant demonstration of the egocentricity of the developed countries and renders their policies ineffective.69.	The importance and persistence of the economic crisis show that any effective and lasting solution to the problem depends essentially on the creation of new forms of relations between the industrially advanced countries and the developing countries on a basis of equality and mutual advantage.70.	Regrettably  it seems to us that certain developed countriesânotwithstanding their awareness of those requirementsâdo not act in accordance with their historic responsibilities in the course of international negotiations. That is why we are not at all surprised that no negotiations thus far have led to any concrete and tangible results and that the problems are becoming increasingly serious for the international community.71.	In the area of trade  the protectionist measures adopted by the developed countries and the disregard of the fundamental interests of the developing countries in multilateral trade negotiations have led to a situation in which the results have recently been even more unsatisfactory than before.72.	This is in flagrant contradiction with the commitments and decisions contained in the Tokyo Declaration and the repeated declarations of the developed countries regarding the need to have an open trade system favourable in particular to the developing countries.73.	We are particularly concerned at the tendency to apply the rules of GATT  to which third-world countries must adjust.74.	The fifth session of UNCTAD did not produce the results expected and there was no significant progress in implementation of the commitments and decisions concerning the Integrated Programme for Commodities entered into at Nairobi. 75.	With reference to the Common Fund  it seems that there have been certain developments  in particular the developed countries' decision to accept in principle certain financing facilities as a means of promoting stabilization. That is one of the more encouraging aspects of these developments.76.	We believe that it is time for the industrially developed countries to reach agreement on the meaning of the alternatives proposed and really to commit themselves with the other members of the international community to move towards these new forms of relations that can guarantee the peoples of the world a better future.77.	There is a need for permanent  active and effective solidarity among the developing countries in order to avoid situations of under-development  domination and exploitation and to ensure recognition of their common interests if there is to be a new international economic order making possible economic independence in the service of genuine development.78.	In this context  we should recall that today there are still millions of children in the world who are suffering from social injustice  hunger  exploitation  illiteracy and malnutrition. That is why we believe that  within the framework of the International Year of the Child  we must establish a new and more just international economic order and effect fundamental social changes capable of bringing about a better and more humane future for succeeding generations.79.	My country  Guinea-Bissau  welcomes the recent signing of the Soviet-American agreement resulting from the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] which is not only a decisive step in the search for general and complete disarmament but may also herald a new era in international detente.80.	Incalculable sums of money and great quantities of human energy are being wasted instead of being invested to help the less favoured nations of the world to narrow the gap between the industrialized countries and the developing countries and consequently to establish stability and international security. These sums are needlessly poured into the war industry to satisfy the crass interests of those who would wage war.81.	We therefore welcome this new step towards peace  but we do not forget the voices of the theoreticians of war  whose philosophy has caused so much human misery  nor do we believe that this single act is a goal in itself.82.	Because we have a long way to go and a difficult  rough road ahead  we call for the redoubling of efforts to put an end to the arms race  for that has become an imperative  a demand of our day to which all those who think that peace and security represent the loftier interests of mankind must tirelessly devote their efforts."
"53",2757,"GNQ",34,1979,"ï»¿It is a great honour and a particular privilege for me to address the General Assembly of the United Nations  meeting in its thirty-fourth session at a time when my country  the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  has just undergone profound political  social and economic changes. First and foremost  we should like to express our deep and sincere congratulations to an eminent and worthy son of the United Republic of Tanzania  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  the pride of the African continent  who is directing with honour and responsibility the work of this thirty-fourth session of our world Organization. The United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  two African countries with a common colonial past and strongly limited in the goal of the emancipation of their peoples  maintain excellent relations of fraternal cooperation  friendship and solidarity. Hence it is a source of pride and particular satisfaction to us that you  Sir  are presiding over the debates of this session of the Assembly. Your outstanding qualities as a great diplomat  your talent and the vast experience you have gained in international affairs  as well as the importance of the country that you represent  guarantee that this session of the Assembly will be marked by successes unprecedented in United Nations history.282.	We wish  through you  Mr. President  to convey our congratulations to the members of the General Committee  who  we trust  will bring their experience  skill and dynamism to bear in the solution of the problems currently besetting this Organization.283.	In view of the outstanding accomplishments of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly  it is only proper for us on this solemn occasion to express our sincere recognition and appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Indalecio Lievano that distinguished Colombian diplomat  who skilfully and wisely guided our debates last year. We extend to him our heartfelt congratulations.284.	Saint Lucia  the newest Member of our Organization  has once again reaffirmed the universal nature of the United Nations by its admission to membership in this community of nations. We welcome Saint Lucia and extend our warmest congratulations to its people certain that  with their participation and co-operation  the United Nations will be further strengthened in its efforts to achieve its worthy aims.285.	This thirty-fourth session of the Assembly is being held at a time when the African continent is mourning the passing of one of its most outstanding sons  the leader and forger of the independence and dignity not only of the sister-people of Angola but also of all territories under colonial and racist occupation throughout the African continent. From this rostrum  on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  we express our heartfelt grief and extend our condolences to the people  Government and family of the late President  Comrade Agostinho Neto. Words are superfluous when referring to him  as all of us here are fully aware of the contribution of that worthy  unforgettable son of Africa to our common efforts to achieve a world of peace  justice  freedom and peaceful coexistence among nations.286.	May I now take this opportunity to recount to the Assembly the recent events in Equatorial Guinea  beginning on 3 August this year  and to indicate the political options and directions that will be taken by the new Government which is now guiding the historic destiny of my country.287.	The overthrow of the dictatorial and bloody regime of former President Maci'as Nguema Biyogo by the people's armed forces came about thanks to a new awareness of the historical responsibility borne by the national army of Equatorial Guinea towards our people  and because of the appalling impoverishment into which the Maci'as regime had plunged the country during the 11 years it was in powerâ11 years of veritable torture  slavery  horrors and suffering for the people of Equatorial Guinea  a total betrayal of the traditional spiritual values of our citizens. Equatorial Guinea lost the structure and form of a State: its political  social and administrative organization  and its links with other countries of the world disappeared.288.	The term of office of ex-President Maci'as was characterized by an ambitious personal centralization of power in the administration and the other bodies of the State of Equatorial Guinea: he seized all power for himself. The oppression was of all kinds: moral  social  cultural  economic  administrative  religious  and so onâa sorry situation which culminated in his abandoning the nation's capital for five years and moving his official residence to his distant birth-place  with a resultant paralysis of the machinery of State which left the noble people of Equatorial Guinea in utter poverty and hunger. Agriculture was devastated. For example  40 000 metric tons of cacao were produced in 1968  the year of independence  but this plummeted to an average of 5 000 metric tons. Coffee production  8 064 metric tons annually  became completely non-existent. From an enviable position in the health field on the African continent  we were plunged into a catastrophic situation with the reappearance  owing to inexcusable negligence and cruel indifference  of all sorts of long-forgotten epidemics and diseases  such as typhus  measles  cholera  tuberculosis  whooping cough  polio and so on. In the wake of these terrible diseases  which decimated the infant population  the overall population gradually decreased.289.	From a high level of education  with a literacy rate which placed us among the first in Africa  we fell to a lamentable state of cultural impoverishment  marking a slump from which it will take us years to recover. Education was limited by tyrannical dictate to the mechanical and degrading repetition of slogans hammered out by a rigid personality cult.290.	The State finds  fruit of the labours of the noble workers  citizens of Equatorial Guinea  were seized and taken to the ex-President's birth-place of Nzangayong (Mongomo). Equatorial Guinea's international image was tarnished and debased during these long and painful 11 years of wandering  as is clear to the majority of this Assembly. International co-operation was almost totally blocked during the term of ex-President Macias  a regime characterized by the systematic and flagrant violation of the fundamental human rights of the citizens of Equatorial Guinea  and also of foreignersâby assassinations  disappearances  arbitrary imprisonments  torture  exile  house arrests  all manner of mistreatments  heartless despoliation of goods  destruction of property  and deprivation of information and freedom of movement. These practices were the daily lot of the citizens of Equatorial Guinea during the 11 years of the dictatorial and bloody regime of ex-President Macias. This human misery and degradation caused the progressive flight from the country of thousands of our compatriots  who were forced into a forced  vile and shameful exile.291.	In the light of all that I have said of the sad  gradual degradation of the society of Equatorial Guinea  and faced by a future of uncertainty for generations to come  the armed forces  encouraged by the people of Equatorial Guinea itself  decided to change the unfortunate turn affairs had taken in our country. In fact  affairs were following no direction: matters of State were treated by former President Maci'as as if they were domestic  personal questions.292.	We are convinced that most of the members here were able  either directly or indirectly  to keep abreast of the sad reality of the suffering of which the people of Equatorial Guinea was a victim  which became even more acute during the past five years.293.	When it took the helm of State in Equatorial Guinea on 3 August 1979  the Supreme Military Council peacefully invited Mr. Macias Nguema Biyogo to come forward and submit to the will of the people and the fate history had dealt him. His freedom and that of his family were guaranteed. Elders of the population were sent to him as emissaries to persuade him to offer no resistance and to show him that the people itself were calling for him to step down. Despite all these efforts  Mr. Maci'as shamefully urged a small groupâhis personal bodyguard  which consisted mainly of family membersâto resist on his behalf  risking thereby the loss of innocent human life. And even worse  the ex-President  acting in a fanatical  desperate and irresponsible manner burned all the bank-notes of the National Treasury  which he had removed to his birthplace. These amounted to more than 5 000 million ekuleâthe local currencyâas well as foreign currency to the approximate value of $10 million. Mr. Maci'as bombed several towns and massacred the peaceful and noble townspeople; children  women and old people were ruthlessly massacred in retaliation against the military uprising.294.	It is in this state of economic and social chaos that the delegation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea comes before this Assembly to urge it to consider the disastrous situation now prevailing in my country; we would be grateful to Member States for providing urgent aid to the people of Equatorial Guinea.295.	For all these crimes  former President Maci'as Nguema was arrested and a fair trial began on Monday  24 September. The Supreme Military Council invited observers from international judicial bodies and from the press.296.	A great outburst of happiness and of support of the people of Equatorial Guinea for the Supreme Military Council occurred spontaneously throughout the national territory of the Republic during these events. This is the best possible proof of the popular support enjoyed by the Supreme Military Council as it takes on this historic responsibility. These popular demonstrations clearly show that the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has regained the harmony and freedom lost in the 1! years of the dictatorial and bloody regime of former President Macias Nguema Biyogo.297.	For all of these reasons  and for the information of this Assembly  the military action taken on 3 August by the Supreme Military Council to depose President Macfas Nguema is in consonance with the desires and will of the people of Equatorial Guinea and constitutes a practical expression of compliance with the oath of loyalty in which the armed forces undertook to safeguard the legitimate interests of the nation. Thus  the coup dâÃ©tat in Equatorial Guinea must not be considered to be the result of a thirst for power by the armed forces  but rather to be a blow for freedom made by the people of Equatorial Guinea. The people's armed forces in Equatorial Guinea will act for the people and for the good of the people.298.	The plan of the Supreme Military Council  which now leads our country  is for a direct democracy in which the individualâalpha and omega of all creationâwill enjoy all necessary rights and privileges  with all material and spiritual benefits  and all the knowledge and wisdom of our people available to him.299.	The Supreme Military Council of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea faithfully reflects the philosophy and ethics advocated in the United Nations Charter  the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and the non-aligned movement  so as to ensure the well-being and security of the individual.300.	It is within this context that the Supreme Military Council brought democracy to Equatorial Guinea. All of the prisoners which the former regime considered to be political prisoners have been released. Property is protected and guaranteed by the Council and all the freedoms and rights of the citizens are being respected and guaranteed. The main aim of the Supreme Military Council in this connexion is to achieve national reconstruction and the social  economic and cultural development of the people in order to ensure their happiness. To accomplish this goal  the Supreme Military Council believes that it is necessary to obtain the participation of all the people of Equatorial Guinea. It has therefore asked all the people of Equatorial Guinea to join ranks to rebuild the national structure of the country. The country requires the toil of all its sons  and we must not betray it.301.	The Supreme Military Council  faithful to the principles of the United Nations Charter  will maintain relations with all countries throughout the world that are devoted to peace and freedom  on the basis of the principles of international law  the sovereign equality of States  non-interference in domestic affairs  strict respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity  the peaceful settlement of disputes and the maintenance of friendly relations and co-operation with all States for mutual and reciprocal benefit.302.	At this precise moment when our country has been totally paralysed for five years and ruined and abandoned by the overthrown President  our needs  both humanitarian and the assistance we require to rebuild the State institutions of the country are many and great. Equatorial Guinea would be most grateful to receive any moral  material or humanitarian aid from any of the countries of the world. The fact that at this difficult time  when we are reorganizing the State of Equatorial Guinea  a delegation of the Supreme Military Council has come to New York explains the great importance which our country attaches to the role played by this world Organization.303.	A retrospective view of the achievements of the United Nations since it was established in 1945 clearly demonstrates that this Organization has been a catalyst in solving the serious problems that have afflicted our world since the Second World War. The United Nations continues to be the only forum of peace in which nations throughout the world  large and small  have an opportunity to share their concerns  irrespective of their ideological  social or cultural differences. Although there are many problems to be solved  the United Nations has none the less made a great contribution to solving the problems resulting from the Second World War  the cold war  decolonization  the lessening of the use of force in the settlement of disputes and so forth.304.	However  despite the incalculable achievements of the United Nations  a great deal remains to be done in order to achieve the aims and objectives sought by those who signed the Charter at San Francisco. Our Organization cannot justify its existence so long as there are vestiges of colonialism throughout the world  and particularly in southern Africa. The United Nations will not have achieved its sacred mission as long as the threat posed by the iniquitous arms race remains. The United Nations will be a meaningless organization if it cannot replace the present economic system  based on injustice and inequality  with a just and equitable order which will ensure proper development throughout the world. Finally  the United Nations will not have done its duty as long as any individual is considered as a simple object at the mercy of the whims of his leaders.305.	The colonial system which oppresses peoples under foreign domination constitutes one form of injustice in today's civilization. It scorns and tramples underfoot the values of the individual. Great progress has been made in this field by the United Nations  but more must be done and priority must be given to the total elimination of the colonial system wherever it exists in the world. Equatorial Guinea will never feel completely free as long as there are countries which are still under the yoke of colonial oppression anywhere in the world. All the peoples of the world  whether in large or small countries  have the sacred and natural right to self-determination and independence. It is a crime against humanity to deprive any individual of these inalienable rights.306.	Although colonialism is definitely reaching an end  there are still large areas in Africa  Asia and Latin America which are afflicted by the horrors of colonial and racist domination.307.	The situation in southern Africa continues to be a matter of concern because of the system of apartheid and the exploitation of man by man. The uprisings and massacres that took place in Soweto  Johannesburg and Pretoria demonstrate the determination of the people of Azania to take charge of their own political destiny. These messages are truly revolutionary and lead us to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Azania as they fight to regain their inalienable rights.308.	Trade and military co-operation between South Africa and some countries  including nuclear cooperation in violation of the decisions of this Organization  is a clear demonstration of the diabolical intentions of the Pretoria regime in relation to the African continent.309.	The African Territory of Namibia continues to be the victim of the manoeuvres of imperialism  which prevent that people from exercising their legitimate right to freedom  independence and self-determination. Despite the great victories won by SWAPO  the racist reactionaries are stepping up their manoeuvres to perpetuate the illegal occupation of the Territory  to violate is integrity and to break the national unity of Namibia.310.	The attempts of South Africa to ignore SWAPO  which is the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  reveal the fact that the South African regime in the Territory is a puppet and is illegal. This diabolical plan is designed purely and simply to make a mockery of and trample underfoot the decisions of the international community and to perpetuate indefinitely its presence in the Territory. It is time for the international community to become aware of this situation and to give material  political and diplomatic support to the Namibian people  both inside and outside the Territory  so as to make it possible for that suppressed people to regain their rights  which colonialism and imperialism wrested from them.311.	Zimbabwe continues to be a source of tension caused by the ambitions of colonialism and imperialism  which endanger the peace and serenity of the inhabitants of Zimbabwe. The sham elections that were held on the basis of the internal settlement which have been condemned by the international community merely ensured that a clique would stay in power  a clique which had illegally seized power in Zimbabwe in 1966. Zimbabwe thus remains a colony  illegally governed by the aforementioned clique of racists and traitors. The people of Zimbabwe will never fully exercise their rights unless their authentic representatives effectively participate. In this connexion  the Republic of Equatorial Guinea gives its unswerving support to the struggle waged by the Patriotic Front to liberate Zimbabwe  as it is the only movement defending the interests of its people. The United Nations must take urgent and positive action to facilitate the liberation of the Territory and to eliminate the racist minority system in Zimbabwe.312.	It would not be just for this Assembly to disregard all the excellent things that have been done by the Front-line States in support of the liberation causes of the peoples of Azania  Namibia and Zimbabwe. They have made tremendous sacrifices and lost a great deal. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea would like to express its full support for and its solidarity with the Governments of Angola  Botswana  Mozambique  the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia in their struggle to resist the racist enemy.313.	Equatorial Guinea is deeply concerned over the situation currently prevailing in Western Sahara. Countries of this world Organization are involved in this conflict  which my Government regards as part of decolonization. Here I should like to recall that this question has been dealt with by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  at its sixteenth ordinary session  held at Monrovia from 17 to 20 July 1979. My delegation feels that any action which could be taken to settle this conflict should be within the context of the recommendations contained in the report of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara  which was approved at the recent summit meeting I mentioned earlier.314.	We hope that all the parties involved in this conflict will make all the necessary efforts to ensure a peaceful  just and negotiated solution to this dispute  in which thousands of our brothers die every day.315.	The Middle East is still an area of tension in which countries of this Organization find themselves involved  and we face all kinds of obstacles to a just  equitable and lasting solution. This tragic situation is a matter of deep concern to the international community. It is a threat to the peace and security not only of that region but also of the international community as a whole. Arab territories are still occupied and the rights of the Palestinian people  who have been deprived of their homeland  are still being disregarded and trampled on.316.	Although any initiative aimed at peaceful negotiations to arrive at a solution of the problem of the Middle East is just and acceptable  these efforts would nevertheless not be as effective as they should be were they not to take account of all the problems involved in that question. This is something which has been stated quite clearly in General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX). A solution of the Middle East problem cannot be achieved unless there is an unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all the occupied Arab territories  unless the Palestinians regain their homeland and the exercise of their national rights and unless there is full and effective participation by the PLO  the sole representative of the Palestinian people. In this context my Government hopes that this question will be resolved through effective negotiations with the participation of all the parties concerned.317.	World peace and security can never be achieved only within the context of relations based upon international law. That is why the United Nations cannot disregard any dispute involving two or more States of the world community if it wishes to attain these noble objectives.318.	The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is deeply concerned over the dispute between Spain and the United Kingdom on the question of sovereignty over Gibraltar. We feel that a solution to this dispute should be found through peaceful negotiations whose objective would be to ensure the decolonization of Gibraltar  which is an integral part of Spanish territory. We have always maintained that colonialism is a crime against humanity and that all peoplesâlarge and smallâdo have the sacred natural right to freedom and independence. In keeping with this policy  my Government would like to urge the United Kingdom to carry on sincere negotiations with Spain so that they can find the best way of returning Gibraltar to Spanish sovereignty.319.	Another matter of concern which should be drawn to the attention of the United Nations is international peace and security. Although considerable progress has been made in this area with the creation of a strong international awareness increasingly favourable to detente and also the formation of impartial international groupings  such as the group of non-aligned States  against the military and ideological blocs. There is also awareness of the growing need for interdependence among nations  which has to a large extent lessened the hostility between East and West.320.	However  despite all this  the current world situation still contains elements  problems and practices which clearly pose a threat of the disruption of international peace and security. For example  there is the maintenance of an unjust social and economic order in the world  an accelerated increase in the bitter arms race  a desperate urge on the part of some to perpetuate their domination and hegemony in the world  a lack of respect for the fundamental rights of individuals  exploitation  the maintenance of military blocs  expansionism and the exportation of ideologiesâall of which makes difficult an international world order guaranteeing peace and the well-being of the peoples.321.	The major economic and militarily powerful countries have a special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is quite clear that the power to attain these objectives lies in the hands of the great Powers. Although the developing countries have a certain responsibility and can play a certain role in helping to achieve these goals  it is nevertheless true that their participation will  unlike the active participation of the major Powers  remain passive.322.	Therefore  primary responsibility for limiting the arms race and concluding a treaty on the prohibition of the use of strategic and sophisticated weapons and on their destruction lies directly with the major Powers. Considerable efforts are being made to attain this objective  as can be seen from the conclusion of the second SALT Treaty. While welcoming and praising this agreement  Equatorial Guinea trusts that the major Powers will in future enter into new and more substantial commitments which would in fact lead to the complete cessation of this bitter arms race and prohibit the use of strategic and sophisticated weapons.323.	The tremendous amounts of money now being channelled into military budgets are more than sufficient to cover the development programmes of the under-developed countries and meet the most fundamental and elementary human needs of today's world  for example  hunger and poverty  which affect everybody  including the developed countries themselves. There can be no lasting peace and security at the national or international levels unless we establish a just and equitable society within a new world economic order. In this context it is up to the developed countries and the developing countries to co-ordinate their efforts dispassionately  without egoism or other complexes  with a view to overcoming and eliminating the obstacles that our society faces today.324.	While it is trueâand this is something that we have mentioned beforeâthat the number of items on our agenda dealing with questions of decolonization is visibly diminishing  which proves that colonialism is drawing to an end  it is nevertheless also true that this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly is meeting at a time when we are entering upon another decisive and perhaps even harder struggle. I refer to the struggle which we must wage for the economic emancipation of our countries and the establishment of a new international economic order.325.	Despite the many actions taken and the various decisions and resolutions adopted by the General Assembly  the relations between the rich and the poor countries are still unequal and unjust. Although there have been serious economic negotiations in this decade  an imbalance in the economic situation persists. The economies of the developing countries are still seriously affected by uncurbed inflation  unemployment  poverty  hunger  serious difficulties in our balances of payments and also the economic imbalance between rich countries and developing countries  All of this is due to the lack of political will on the part of the rich countries and also to their constant practice of applying double standards in trade relations with developing countries.326.	It is sad and distressing to see what is happening in the North-South dialogue and in the various international conferences that have been held this year on economic questionsâsuch as the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held in Arusha  United Republic of Tanzania  the fifth session of UNCTAD  held in Manila  the Tokyo Economic Summit meeting of the northern countries held in June  this year's second regular session of the Economic and Social Council  the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development  held in Rome  the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  in Vienna  and the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries recently held in Havanaânot one of whose resolutions have been applied.327.	Faced with this situation  we must wage a stronger and more determined struggle. We must adopt new strategies that will meet the just requirements of our peoples for their social well-being and for a better world.328.	I should now like to turn to another issue of concern to the international community. This is something my country suffered under its previous regime  I refer to the question of the refugees from Equatorial Guinea who are now to be found in neighbouring and other countries. Those citizens of Equatorial Guinea were forced to save their lives by fleeing from the horrors of the barbarous policy of flagrant and systematic violation of their rights as citizens of Equatorial Guinea under the previous regime. I take this opportunity to address an appeal to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to provide all necessary assistance to facilitate the voluntary return of those citizens of Equatorial Guinea who are now outside the country as refugees  for the circumstances that obliged them to choose exile have now been totally done away with by the overthrow of the dictator Maci'as Nguema. The new Guinean Government has established conditions that ensure an atmosphere of national rejoicing and reconciliation that will enable it to proceed with the major task of reconstruction of our nation. In that undertaking  the contribution of all citizens of Equatorial Guinea is clearly very needed. We have taken steps vis-3-vis the Governments of the sister republics of Gabon  Cameroon and Nigeria  and also the friendly Government of Spain to ensure the repatriation of our citizens. Here  I should like to express our appreciation to those Governments for their goodwill and for their constant concern to work for this kind of repatriation  and also for the efforts they have made to care for the refugees from Equatorial Guinea in their respective countries.329.	The refugees from Equatorial Guinea are most enthusiastic about returning to our country  but unfortunately my Government finds itself faced with a chaotic economic situation. This is a result of the current economic crisis in the world  and also of the disastrous situation the new Government inherited from the destructive regime of ex-President Maci'as  a situation that has placed us among the poorest and most disadvantaged countries of the world. Because of this  my Government cannot incur all the costs involved in such repatriation  or in the reintegration of the citizens of Equatorial Guinea who return home. Here I would like to reiterate our fervent appeal to the international community and the competent agencies in this Organization to give consideration to this situation.330.	Equatorial Guinea is part of the Hispanic family. For that reason we feel ourselves linked very closely by historical and cultural ties with the Latin American nations. Although in the past we were unable to do anything of a practical nature about this affinity or to make rational use of it for the benefit of our respective peoples  nevertheless Equatorial Guinea  while remaining faithful to its calling as an African country  has always regarded itself as part of what we could call here the ""great Afro-Ibero-American family"".331.	It is in this spirit that Equatorial Guinea follows with great interest all that happens in this community of nations. Hence  we express our solidarity with the brother people of Nicaragua and we welcome their recent victory that has led them to create a new society of dignity and prosperity. We also welcome the achievements of the brother people of Panama who have regained their inalienable rights over the Canal.332.	Accordingly  Equatorial Guinea hopes to see relations of co-operation develop in all areas among the countries that make up this great Afro-Ibero-American family  with due respect paid to the interests of all our peoples.333.	In conclusion  my Government is fully confident that our work here in the United Nations will inevitably help us to build a new world of peace  security and social well-being."
"54",2802,"GRC",34,1979,"ï»¿It is with great pleasure that I extend to you  Sir  the warmest congratulations of the Hellenic delegation on your unanimous election to the high post of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.187.	During the many years you held the post of Permanent Representative of your country to this Organization you nave  on numerous occasions  given proof of your outstanding qualities as a diplomat and a statesman. Africa  a continent which plays a preponderant role in the activities of the United Nations  and the United Republic of Tanzania  a country with which mine maintains the most friendly and cordial relations  could not have chosen a better representative to preside over the work of this body  which more than any other reflects the universal character to which the United Nations has aspired since it came into being.188.	At the same time I should like to express to the outgoing President  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  our appreciation of the authority and competence with which he guided the work of the General Assembly during a difficult period that was full of problems.189.	It is also a pleasure for me once again to extend our most sincere congratulations and profound gratitude to our Secretary-General for his tireless efforts and his devotion to his difficult and sometimes thankless  but very important  task. The considerable successes of which Mr. Waldheim can be justly proud make him an irreplaceable champion of international peace.190.	Finally I should like most warmly to welcome Saint Lucia  which has just been added to the number of young and dynamic countries that have become Members of our Organization in the last few years.191.	The 12 months that have elapsed since the opening of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly have witnessed a wealth of events an assessment of which is unfortunately not very encouraging. Side by side with some positive developments  we observe stagnation in the resolution of most of the problems that concern the world  most of which date back for many years. What is more  new hotbeds of tension have been added to existing crises  so that peace has seemed threatened more than once  and this at a time when mankind must face problems that concern people everywhere  on the solution of which mankind's very survival might depend.192.	In the Middle East  a region of very particular interest to my country because of its geographical proximity  but above all because of our fraternal links with our Arab brothers  the deadlock continues. The position of my country in respect of this problem is well known. We have always been in favour of the complete application of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and of the other relevant resolutions of that body and the General Assembly that call for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967  as well as the right of all the countries of the region to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries. At the same time  we believe that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including their right to self-determination and to a country must be recognized within the framework of a global settlement.193.	It is in the light of those principles and their effective application that we view the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel. We believe that every effort towards a negotiated settlement of the Middle East problem must be encouraged in so far as there is an attempt in those efforts to apply these principles within the framework of a global solution. But at the same time it is necessary to avoid any action that might aggravate the situation and make the atmosphere in the region even more difficult.194.	In this context we cannot but deplore the policy of settlements pursued by the Israeli Government on the West Bank of the River Jordan  in Gaza and in the Golan Heights.195.	In the same spirit we deplore also the armed incursions into Lebanese territory  and we launch an appeal for the ending of all acts of violence in Lebanon! Without wishing to enter into the details of this complex problem  we must here reiterate our conviction that its solution resides in absolute respect for the territorial integrity of Lebanon and in the restoration of the authority of the Lebanese Government over the entire territory of the country. At the same time we should like to express our appreciation for the work accomplished by UNIFIL in southern Lebanon.196.	Alas  the Middle East is not the only part of the world where confrontation continues to prevail and where efforts designed to arrive at the peaceful settlement of conflicts have so far remained without notable results. Southern Africa is another striking example. The plan that the five Western members of the Security Council  last year submitted to the parties concernedâto enable the Namibian people to accede to real independence has not yet brought about a rapprochement of opposing viewsâand this despite its acceptance by South Africa  the South West Africa People's Organization and the African front-line States.â197.	On this point  too  the position of Greece is clear. Any jurisdiction of South Africa over Namibia ceased at the moment the General Assembly terminated its Mandate over the Territory. The only obligation of the Government of South Africaâand this is a clear and imperative obligationâis to co-operate with the competent organ of the United Nations  the United Nations Council for Namibia  in the transfer of power to the representatives of the Namibian people. Those representatives must be designated by means of free elections held under international control and with the participation of all Namibian political forces  including the South West Africa People's Organization.198.	At the same time  my Government most energetically condemns the aerial attacks and armed incursions against neighbouring countries  which constitute a misuse by South Africa of its military superiority and a flagrant violation of the most sacred principles of the Charter.199.	Unlike what is going on in Namibia  the latest developments in Zimbabwe are promising. The decisions adopted by the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries at Lusaka could and should serve as a basis for the establishment of a regime that would confer power upon the majority  while guaranteeing the rights of the white minority. We hope that the Constitutional Conference convened as a result of the praiseworthy efforts of the United Kingdom Government  with the participation of the parties concerned  will be crowned with success.200.	Finally  to conclude this review of the situation in southern Africa  I am bound once again to refer to the stigma of apartheid. Our condemnation of the apartheid regime  which flies in the face of the most elementary requirements of human dignity  cannot be too categorical.201.	Disarmament continues to be an imperative necessity for mankind. It suffices to consider the magnitude of the resources that could be placed at the service of far nobler causes  such as the development of the less fortunate countries  to realize the need to establish without further delay the principles and the machinery for a disarmament that would be as far- reaching as possible.202.	We are happy to note that the SALT Treaty signed in May last in Vienna by the chief executives of the two greatest nuclear Powers in the world represents a step in the right direction.203.	For our part  our position is well known: a balanced and progressive reduction of nuclear weapons  with a view to their complete elimination  should go hand in hand with a similar reduction in conventional weapons. But such a reduction presupposes strengthening of the sense of security of countries  and particularly of the small countries  because a people which feels threatened has no choice but to arm itself  whatever sacrifices that might entail. What is needed  therefore  is to strengthen the means for the pacific settlement of disputes among States. The necessary machinery and organs exist. They are provided for under the Charter or flow from it. If need be  they can be strengthened or improved. But it is essential that all States  large or small  should accept and  if necessary  be persuaded to agree to renounce the threat and the use of force in order to have their points of view and their claims prevail.204.	In this context  it is fitting to recall the various initiatives aimed at the maintenance of peace and stability in the world. One of them concerns the non-use of force in international relations. The Special Committee on Enhancing the Effectiveness of the Principle of Non- Use of Force in International Relations  which has been entrusted with the drafting of a convention to that end  held a fruitful session and prepared a report which is on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly. Greece  which is a member of that Committee  is prepared favourably to consider any follow-up which might be given to that report  as well as any other initiative which might lead to the desired results. Faithful to the principles of the Charter  we firmly believe that force cannot be used other than for the purpose of self-defence and that only when other means of prevention of aggression have failed.205.	Respect for human rights should be one of the paramount concerns of the United Nations. Greece  where the concept of the protection of human beings against abuses of power came into being 25 centuries ago  aspires to be in the forefront of the struggle to safeguard those rights as defined by a number of international legal instruments  in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.206.	That is why we are against any violation of human rights  whether within a country or imposed from outside by the force of arms.207.	If there is one people whose most elementary rights have been trampled underfoot in the course of the last years  it is the people of Cyprus. The existence of 200 000 refugees five years after the invasion of the island by foreign forces bears witness to this in a most distressing way. The same is true of some 2 000 missing persons  whose fate is still not known. The agreement reached on the latter point in the month of May last between the President of the Republic of Cyprus and the head of the Turkish Cypriot community to set up the investigatory body provided for in General Assembly resolution 33/172 had allowed us to hope that it would finally be possible to learn the fate of these persons among whom there are some scores of Greek citizens. Unfortunately  the agreement in question has remained a dead letter to date since the Turkish Cypriot leaders have not communicated to the Secretary-General their formal acceptance of the establishment of that investigatory body.208.	I intend to go into detail on the problem of Cyprus later in my statement. But these humanitarian considerations  which I have just recalled  deserve  I believe  a quick solution independently of any political settlementâthe more so since this is required under a series of United Nations resolutions.209.	I shall now deal briefly with certain economic questions. First of all  we are bound to note the ever-growing participation of our Organization in the establishment of a new international economic order  the final objective of which would be to eliminate the enormous disparities between rich and poor countries  to arrive at a better distribution of wealth on our planet and to secure for all its inhabitants a standard of living which  besides providing for their material needs  would enable them also to develop their intellectual potential and guarantee their fundamental freedoms which cannot survive in a world of deprivation.210.	One of the major events this year in the economic field was the fifth session of UNCTAD. While the results were not as spectacular as one might have wished  they did  nevertheless  enable us to renew efforts toward a greater liberalization of international trade while in a number of cases there was a lessening of differences between the various groups of countries which participated in the session. Furthermore  we should not lose sight of the adverse economic conditions in the world  which make it more difficult to find solutions to problems such as inflation  the reform of the international monetary system  and so on. As for the main objectives of the Conference  my country views with much sympathy any initiative which would tend to alleviate the fate of the least-favoured nations such as  for example  setting up a fund for the stabilization of commodity prices. For its part  Greece  which in the course of the last 30 years has taken major steps toward development  is prepared to continue to play its part in the pursuit of these objectives.211.	In the context of our particular interest in development problems  we have actively participated in the last two major international gatherings: the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development at Vienna  and the third session of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174.212.	Finally  there is a subject the long-term economic implications of which are no less than its political or legal aspects. I am referring to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea which  as is known  held two sessions this year. The ground covered by the Conference since its inception is  on the whole  satisfactory. Without wishing to minimize the complexity of the problems remaining to be solved  I would say that their solution would seem no more difficult than the obstacles which have been surmounted so farâprovided that all countries evince a spirit of compromise. The interests at issue are no doubt important. But the benefits which mankind would stand to gain from the conclusion of an agreement of universal application are well worth the efforts and concessions necessary to reach that goal.213.	Before concluding  I should like to refer to the situation on Cyprus  which continues to be a major cause of concern. Five years after the invasion of the island  euphemistically called a ""peace operation""  foreign occupation forces are still there. Numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions remain dead letters. The Republic of Cyprus  a country which is an independent and sovereign Member of our Organization  continues to be deprived of the exercise of its sovereignty over almost 40 per cent of its territory. Some 200 000 refugees continue to live far from their homes  while the establishment of settlers arriving from Turkey has never ceased and recently seems even to have increased.214.	In these circumstances  the hope for a just and lasting solution to the problem is growing dim and depends on the sole procedure of intercommunal talks under the aegis of the United Nations. The renewed initiative of our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  met with success on 19 May of this year  when the meeting between President Kyprianou and the head of the Turkish Cypriot community  Mr. Denktas  led to a 10-point agreement that was to serve as a basis for the resumption of intercommunal negotiations.215.	Unfortunately  it appears that we rejoiced too soon. The Turkish Cypriot side apparently felt that the agreement of 19 May  which gave priority to the question of Varosha  did not suit it  and it chose to sabotage it. Thus it set forth prior conditions and introduced new questions that were conceived in such a manner that the initiation of a dialogue became improbable  if not impossible  because these conditions and questions were aimed at nothing less than obtaining concessions on substance  even before negotiations were begun. They were designed to impose on the injured party  on the victim of aggression  a concept that would make it possible to set up the infrastructure for a division of the island at the opportune moment. It is hardly surprising  therefore  that the Government of Cyprus refused to agree to compromise the survival of Cyprus as a unitary  sovereign and independent State before the negotiations had even begun.216.	In these circumstances  how can we fail to express our concern when numerous resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly continue to be unilaterally ignored? How can we fail to express our profound concern at the pretexts and subterfuges that are placed as obstacles to the resumption of dialogue? It is our firm hope that  given this situation  the General Assembly will demand that its voice finally be heeded.217.	I can assure the Assembly that my Government will continue to support the Government of Cyprus and to support the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General for a just and lasting solution of the problem within the framework of the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council."
"55",2845,"GRD",34,1979,"ï»¿cToday it is a great honour and privilege for me to deliver my country's address to the United Nations on behalf of the People's Revolutionary Government and the people of Grenada. It is particularly pleasing to be able to deliver this address in 1979  a year that will undoubtedly be recorded as the year of the fall of the dictators  including from my region Somoza of Nicaragua and Gairy of Grenada.3.	At this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  I should like to welcome you  Mr. Salim  and to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly. The People's Revolutionary Government and the people of Grenada have the closest ties with the Government and people of the United Republic of Tanzania and we thus hold you and your President  Mr. Julius Nyerere  in the highest regard and we are fully confident that your presidential term will be successful.4.	We also place on record our warmest appreciation for the excellent manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  presided over the work of the last session. I wish also to join with those preceding me to this rostrum in conveying through you  Mr  President  our gratitude for the dedicated and untiring efforts of our distinguished Secretary-General and his staff. History will certainly record the tremendous contribution of Mr. Kurt Waldheim in particular to the cause of world peace.5.	At the same time  I wish on behalf of the People's Revolutionary Government and the people of Grenada to congratulate and warmly welcome the newly independent State of Saint Lucia to membership of the United Nations. This is a particular pleasure for us because Saint Lucia is not only our neighbour in the Caribbean  but is also a fraternal friend.6.	As I speak before this body today  I do so as the representative of a small country which intends to speak with a resolute and principled voice on the issues of substantive concern to the world today.7.	The advent of our revolution has signalled the be-ginning of the end of the most dangerous and vicious stage of the colonial experience  that which we recognize as neo-colonialism. This stage had seen us exposed to various constitutional manipulations  all of which had failed to hide the reality of economic bondage under imperialism. Moreover  this neo-colonial stage has also exposed our nation to the vicious  ruthless neo-Fascist dictatorship of Eric Gairy. To you here at this renowned body this petty dictator was known as ""Mr. UFO""  but to us in Grenada this amusingly descriptive title did not hide the reality of a dictator whose closest links were with imperialism and international criminal elements and openly Fascist and dictatorial regimes.8.	Apart from his criminal record  Gairy left Grenada in an economic wilderness. Indeed  due to his neo- fascist regime we have a legacy of total dependence on imperialism  a reality which has meant extreme poverty characterized by wholesale repression of the working people and their organizations  massive unemployment  with more than half of the work force out of work; high levels of illiteracy  malnutrition  superstition  ""Mongoose Gang'' brutality and the murder of our people  poor housing and health conditions; all combined with overall economic stagnation and massive migration.9.	Such a legacy was the motive force behind our revolution on 13 March of this year. Our revolution had its roots with the formation of our party in March 1973. From that date till March of this year  our party was subjected to various forms of the grossest and most openly hostile brutality at the hands of Gairy and his Fascist allies. I am proud to announce to this body today that such abuses of human rights ceased as of 13 March this year and that since that time the democratic rights and freedoms of the people have been restored and expanded.10.	Indeed  our revolution in Grenada is a peopled revolution and thus one of the fundamental principles of our revolution is the establishment of the people's rights. Among these rights we include the right to equal pay for men and women  the right to social and economic justice  the right to work and the right to democratic participation in the affairs of our nation  At the same time we also have a firm commitment to the establishment of people's rights in the international community and we thus firmly oppose imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  apartheid  racism (including zionism) and fascism. More than this  we strongly condemn any attempt by any country to maintain any of these hostile and repugnant systems and for this reason we particularly join in the chorus of support for the application demanding mandatory sanctions against the racist State of South Africa  as is provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.11.	I wish at this time clearly to assert our nation's commitment to this body's Universal Declaration of Human Rights  with a clear understanding that one of the fundamental rights of all peoples is the achievement of economic well-being  a reality that is hindered by imperialism. I emphasize also our nation's unyielding support for the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  and in particular I wish to record our firm commitment to General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of December 1960 and 2621 (XXV) of October 1970  both asserting the need for an end to colonialism.12.	Grenada has recently joined the non-aligned movement and attended the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  to which the fraternal revolutionary Government of Cuba played host in Havana from 3 to 9 September 1979. That historic gathering was attended by 91 out of 94 full member States and national liberation movements  several observer countries and guests drawn from all parts of the world. We were greatly honoured at our first non-aligned Conference by being elected to the Coordinating Bureau of the movement.13.	We like to feel that this honour is indicative of our firm adherence to the fundamental principles of non- alignment. We joined this great movement not out of considerations of convenience or selfish gain but because  following the assumption of power of our Government in Grenada  we undertook  as a matter of the highest priority  to elevate our country's foreign policy to the plane of principle and purposefulness.14.	Non-alignment does not imply for us that we must be neutral in the sterile and negative sense  nor does it imply that our country must regard itself as a political eunuch in the conduct of our international affairs. Our non-aligned policy will certainly not lead us to surrender our independence of judgement in world affairs  or to retreat from our right and duty to participate fully in international forums and discussions concerned with issues vital to our interests  concerns and principles. To the contrary  non-alignment for us is a positive concept characterizing a vigorous and principled approach to international issues. It is an affirmation of that fundamental aspiration of all peoples and States to sovereignty  independence and the right freely to determine their own domestic and foreign policies.15.	It is perhaps true to say that during the early years of the history of the movement the major concern of non-alignment was the achievement of independence for colonial countries  and the second was the struggle to maintain and enhance their sovereignty  with all that implies  including  first and foremost  the fight against imperialism.16.	It is undoubtedly true to say that today the anti- colonial aspect of the struggle of the non-aligned movement has become much less important than it was 18 years ago. And this is so for the obvious reason that the vast majority of countries which were colonies in 1961 are now independent. Not unnaturally  in this new situation more and more countries in the non-aligned movement  in common with more and more countries in the third world as a whole  have been focusing their attention on the struggle against imperialism. Our concern increasingly has been concentrated on the fight to regain control over our natural and national resources from the grip of the rapacious multinational corporations backed by their powerful Governments.17.	This has led more and more third-world countries to recognize that imperialism is the greatest enemy of mankind and that the perpetrators of this rape of our resources are to be found in the imperialist world. Nor does the matter end here. We have witnessed  for example  the cold-blooded support of the imperialist countries for the murderous apartheid regimes of southern Africa  as opposed to the moral and material support given the freedom fighters by the socialist com-munity. This  more than anything else  exposes the true character of imperialism today. Obviously  not only the socialist community supports this struggle against racism and apartheid: the front-line States  which are third world and non-aligned  have also provided crucial and meaningful support. So too has the non-aligned movement.18.	A further important indicator of the character of imperialism is that the high cost of manufactured products and machinery  the refusal to enter into reasonable and just commodity agreements  the stonewalling of attempts to agree on a new international economic order  the refusal to accept that an international regime should be created to exploit the resources of the deep sea for the benefit of all of mankind and not just for a few multinational corporations can all be placed at the doorstep of the imperialist world. It is clear  therefore  that there is an affinity of principle and policy among the non-aligned and the socialist world.19.	Consistent with our opposition to colonialism  imperialism  and racism  we affirm today before this great Assembly our firm support for the struggles being waged by the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa under the leadership of the Patriotic Front  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and the African National Congress of South Africa for their liberation and against apartheid and racism. We recognize and applaud the principled and consistent support being given to those struggles by the front-line States.20.	We express our firmest support for and solidarity with the struggles of the people of Palestine  led by their sole and legitimate representatives  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]. On this basis  we reject the Camp David agreements ' which do not have the support of the Palestinian people  the PLO  the Arab world or the entire democratic  progressive and socialist world.21.	We reaffirm our support for the people of Western Sahara  under the leadership of the FrenteâPOLISARIO   in their struggle for independence and self-determination. We call upon the people of Korea to continue the just struggle for the reunification of their homeland. We express our firm support for the Heng Samrin Government and the heroic people of Kampucheaâa government which we recognized on 20 August last. We support the struggle of the Government and people of Belize for independence with full territorial integrity. We also wish to express our strongest solidarity with the people of Puerto Rico in their struggle for independence. We fully support the ongoing and determined struggle of the Government and people of Cuba in their fight to gain control over Guantanamo Bay. Our profound solidarity also goes to the Government and people of Panama in their just struggle to recover the Panama Canal. We support fully the struggles of all the people of the Caribbean who are today still fighting for an end to colonialism.22.	The peace of the world is a matter that concerns not only the rich and powerful nations  some of which produce  purchase and deploy sophisticated weapons of mass destruction but  more profoundly  the poor  weak and small nations  which are the victims of the squander and waste that are characteristic of militarism. The expenditure on arms and weapons of war is truly colossal and stupendous. As has been expressed elsewhere  more than $300 billion a year is spent on arms and other military equipment and installations throughout the world. This astronomical sum could  if spent on health  build and equip 30 000 hospitals with 18 million beds. It could construct 20 000 factories with jobs for more than 20 million workers. In fact  $300 billion represents the budget of my country for 14 000 years at current rates of exchange and taking into consideration a very generous rate of inflation  17 percent a year. This says a lot for the small size of my country's budget  which is less than a fraction of the budget of most multinational corporations. But it also says a great deal about the enormous waste of financial resources expended on armaments by nations some of which already have the capacity to wipe out the whole of mankind several times over.23.	Members can well understand the deep concern we harbour for peace. It is for this reason that we strongly support the efforts of the World Peace Council and any and all moves towards detente  peaceful coexistence and disarmament. The people of Grenada are gratified  therefore  that the Helsinki Final Act  and now the Treaty reached at the conclusion of the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] have been signed by both the United States and the USSR. We are  however  disturbed to note that reactionary elements that definitely have a vested interest in the prolongation of the arms race have been making feverish efforts to prevent the ratification of the SALT Treaty in the United States Senate.24.	These same reactionary elements have been pushing the United States Government to re-introduce ""cold war"" principles and create new  or strengthen old  military pacts  alliances  arrangements or manoeuvres aimed at serving the interests of expansionism and imperialism and/or trampling upon the struggles of the people against Fascist methods and the suppression of democratic rights. These reactionaries have succeeded in their aim in the Caribbean and Latin American region with the recent statement by President Carter.25.	We view with very grave concern the ""cold war"" and militaristic steps proclaimed by the President in his national address to the people of America on Monday  1 October   in which he announced the establishment of a permanent full-time Caribbean military task force with headquarters in Key West  Florida. Such a force will be made up of men from all the military services and will conduct military manoeuvres in the region. These manoeuvres have in fact already begun with the deployment of some 16 naval vessels in the Caribbean Sea  along with other manoeuvres in Guantanamo Bay  on Cuban soil. And mention of Guantanamo must surely remind us of the absurdity of a country that has bases in Cuba and Panama  against the will of the peoples of those countries  denouncing another country maintaining troops in Cuba with the consent of the Cuban people. We note that  of the seven proposals announced by the President  six are of a military character.26.	We believe that this is a reaction to the recent progressive changes and developments within the Latin American and Caribbean region. A wind of change is blowing through the Caribbean bringing with it a new regional balance of forces as a result of the changes towards progress effected by the peoples of Nicaragua  Grenada  Saint Lucia and Dominicaâa situation that has led the United States Secretary of State to define the eastern Caribbean as one of the world's four ""trouble spots"".27.	It is our view that the new regional balance of forces has serious implications for the profits being made by the multinational corporations and also for geo-political considerations in the region  and this is what is making reactionary elements in the United States desperate.28.	The international community must take this new threat to the region seriously  because the United States Government has an established pattern of using gunboat diplomacy  blockades  destabilization tactics and other ""cold war"" measures against the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean. It is an attempt to revive the Monroe Doctrine  under which the United States claims the unilateral right to intervene militarily in the domestic affairs of any country in the region. And it is a matter of historical record that such interventions have taken place in  among other places  the Dominican Republic  Haiti  Guatemala  Colombia  Mexico  Nicaragua and the very Cuba towards which they are today expressing so much hostility.29.	For our part  we uphold the democratic right of the people of the Caribbean to choose their own Government or political system. The Caribbean belongs to the peoples of the Caribbean. We reject the United States plan to set up a Caribbean task force  and we call upon the international community to join with us in demanding an immediate withdrawal of this proposal. We join also with our sister Caribbean nations in re- emphasizing our deep determination to preserve the Caribbean as a zone of peace  free from military intimidation. We demand the right to build our own processes in our own way  Free from outside interference  free from bullying and free from the use or threat of force.30.	We desire normal and friendly relations with the Government of the United States. Many of our citizens reside and work in this country and many United States citizens are frequent visitors to our country. But it must be manifestly clear that our relations must be based on the fundamental principles of mutual respect for sovereignty  equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairsâa position which in fact applies to all other States.31.	I wish to raise briefly the issue of small States in the international community. Notwithstanding our basic position that all States are equal  sovereign  independent entities  we cannot lose sight of the fact that there are significant physical  demographic and economic differences among us. The issues of small size and small scale are not incidental to the levels of development of small countries or to their significance in the conduct of international relations. Small size must be explicitly recognized as a dimension of international relations. Poverty and dependence can of course apply to both small and large States but there are some special disabilities experienced by small countries that weigh heavily in explaining their economic and social problems.32.	The Caribbean is characterized by several small island-States. Many have populations of about 100 000 people and an area of between 100 and 100 square miles. Most lack significant material resources  being dependent throughout all their history on agricultural production and more recently on tourism and light manufacturing. Additionally  such economies lack adequate capital and skilled manpower resources  while infra- structural and technological under-development abound. and there is great dependence on the export of one or two basic raw materials for foreign-exchange earnings.33.	We also face political disabilities  in many ways. As island communities  separated by stretches of water and linguistic barriers  we have experienced the consequences of imperialist domination and cultural fragmentation. Consistent with our struggle to overcome these problems  the new Governments of Dominica  Saint Lucia and Grenada jointly issued the St. George's Declaration which pledged as follows:""The Governments affirm that the Caribbean area is one entity  regardless of language differences  economic differences  separation by sea or other such considerations. His Governments therefore emphasize the need for developing the closest possible relations between the islands and countries in the Caribbean  regardless of whether they are English  Dutch  Spanish or French speaking.""34.	Notwithstanding the fact that as long ago as 1970. the General Assembly unanimously adopted the landmark Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor  and the Subsoil Thereof  beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction which stated that the sea-bed  ocean floor and the subsoil thereof  beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. as well as their resources  constituted ""the common heritage of mankind""  we are still today without a global oceans regime. And while the people of Grenada welcome the progress that has been made on the law of the sea  we remain anxious about the absence of a definite treaty because a satisfactory treaty has fundamental implications for our economic well-being and the establishment of a new international economic order.35.	Winning the economic war against imperialism and its concomitantsâpoverty  high unemployment  poor health  and the alienation of the people from the fruits of their labourârequires us to conduct struggles on both the domestic and international planes. As sovereign Governments we are separately responsible for our own programmes of economic transformation  but our international solidarity and co-operation are critical for meeting our goals.36.	The present distribution of world economic power  wealth and living standards is manifestly unjust. It derives from the long history of imperialist expansion and control of the third world. We seek to change this order and to substitute for it a new international economic order  but we must be clear about our conception of it.37.	By the new international economic order  we mean the assertion of national sovereignly over the ownership and control of our economic resources. We mean the establishment of the freedom to determine the disposition and use of our resources in whatever ways our peoples wish  in furtherance of their own aspirations for economic development. We mean the creation of an equitable system of international trade based on just prices for our exports. We mean the opening up of markets internationally  particularly in the wealthy countries  to facilitate growth in the exports of the third world. We also mean the establishment of an international agreement on the exploitation of the resources of the sea which would -secure a just share of those resources and the wealth generated therefrom for the under-developed countries. The importance of this aspect of our concept of the new international economic order cannot be overestimated as the sea is the last frontier  and the oil. fish  manganese  nickel and minerals in the deep sea must be exploited by an international regime for the benefit of all mankind  and not just for the benefit of a handful of multinational corporations and their Governments.38.	We desire a new system of international interdependence  based on mutual respect for sovereignty and a collective will to put an end to imperialist machinations designed to disrupt our unity and purpose.39.	Broadly  the whole thrust of any new international economic order could only lead towards the elimination of the severe economic problems besetting our peoplesâinadequate diet  poor medical care  insufficient clothing and other basic amenities. All or any of our grand schemes of economic reorganization and transformation must be designed to fulfil these basic goals.40.	Before closing I would like  on behalf of the Government and the people of Grenada  to express our deepest sympathy to and solidarity with the Government and people of Angola in particular  and the peoples of Africa in general  on the loss of President Agostinho Neto  a truly great revolutionary and patriotic son of Africa.41.	I wish also formally to support earlier calls for urgent assistance to the hurricane-stricken and devastated countries of Dominica and the Dominican Republic. We certainly hope that the response of countries in the United Nations and of international organs and agencies will match the great extent of their needs 42.	The People's Revolutionary Government and people of Grenada salute the outstanding work and achievements of the United Nations over the past three decades. For our part  we confirm our commitment to the noble aims  ideals and objectives of this great body and pledge our contribution to building a new world in which the poor of the world will at last obtain social  economic and political justice."
"56",2890,"GTM",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of the people and Government of Guatemala  headed by General Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia  I wish to convey our friendly greetings to all the peoples of the countries of the world who are worthily represented here.383.	My delegation wishes to congratulate Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania on his election to the presidency of this General Assembly  and to convey to him our best wishes for a successful term of office.384.	I also wish to express the gratitude of the Guatemalan delegation to Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre  for the skill and wisdom he demonstrated in his presidency of the last Assembly.385.	The positive  realistic and objective manner in which the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has carried out his duties prompts my delegation to express to him its support and solidarity.386.	The Government of Guatemala is pleased to see the admission to the United Nations of Saint Lucia  and it congratulates that new country on having joined the international community. 387.	As its contribution to the work of this Assembly  my delegation wishes to describe the achievements of the people and Government of Guatemala; the postulates  principles and foundations of its national and international policy; its position with regard to the international economy and international trade; its views on how the United Nations should approach the new international development strategy; its philosophy on children and youth  and its position with regard to the controversy concerning the territory of Belize.388.	The Government of Guatemala feels it appropriate that the international community should learn  through this world forum  of the efforts being made by the people and the Government of Guatemala to stimulate the country's integrated development process  and to provide all Guatemalans with adequate scope for the realization of their aspirations and the development of their abilities  within a framework of freedom  dignity and the full implementation and observance of constitutional guarantees  and of the values and human rights which are well provided for in our Constitution.389.	The Government of Guatemala  elected and supported by the people  is carrying out the tasks laid down in the national development plan for 1979-1982  which is a technically drafted document containing an inventory of our needs  an evaluation of our priorities and an indication of how the resources will be obtained for the performance of those tasks which are indispensable to the nation.390.	Thus  the Government is constructing hydroelectric stations  highways  ports  schools  hospitals  health centres  and housing  and is developing a lateral strip in the northern part of the country which covers an area of 9 140 square kilometres and which will provide more land for the Guatemalan people  ensure access to the sea for their products  and permit them to settle in this area  which is being equipped with everything necessary to provide a decent standard of living.391.	Our Government is striving for the full development of all Guatemalans  combating malnutrition  improving sanitation in areas of endemic diseases  facilitating access to education for all children  youth and old people  and fostering the organization and strengthening of industry in order to generate new sources of employment and thus  through our own labour and efforts  to ensure that our country continues to progress in the development process which is known to all the world.392.	The people of Guatemala are democratic and  consequently  their Government maintains absolute respect for civil rights. In our country  nationals and foreigners enjoy all the freedoms. With regard to one of the fundamental freedoms  that of expression  newspapers  radio and television news services flourish in Guatemala and exercise daily their freedom of opinion  which naturally includes the right of criticism and dissent.393.	Political parties also flourish in Guatemala. Ideas are channelled through these public bodies  and citizens have access to legally institutionalized organizations through which to express their opinions and make suggestions  ultimately to participate in government itself  so that our people may benefit from the enthusiasm and political wisdom of their sons.394.	In the field of labour relations  a process of unionization thrives  and 80 new trade-union leaders have been duly registered in the past year.395.	Democracy in Guatemala  as in any civilized place in the world  demands a just order  constructive peace  internal discipline and productive labour.396.	In the conclusion to its report on human rights in Guatemala  the International Commission of Jurists stated the following:""The 1965 Constitution of the Republic of Guatemala is a genuinely liberal document providing a solid basis for a democratic and just society."" In another of its conclusions the report states:""Many factors exist in Guatemala that could serve as the basis of a constructive development toward a peaceful and prosperous future. These include the facts that the majority of the country's population consists of inherently peaceful Indian tribes; that the country has a substantial middle class and a large number of highly trained professionals; that the constitutional and legal structure of the country provide a solid foundation for a democratic society; that the positive orientation of its legal structure is confirmed by the entry into force in Guatemala on July 18  1978 of the American Convention on Human Rights  ex-pressing the intention to establish within a framework of democratic institutions a system of personal liberty and social justice based on respect for the essential rights of man; and that the National Council of Economic Planning has published a report on the objectives and strategy of long-term development which sets forth in reasonable detail a strategy for reaching the objective of raising the level of material  cultural and spiritual well-being of the majority of the Guatemalan population in order to achieve a just and stable social peace."" 397.	The people and Government of Guatemala are grateful for this recognition of the country's development process and wish to reiterate in this Assembly the resolve which inspires them to pursue their development in all areas. They also wish to express their keen desire that other societies in under-developed countries  such as our own  will attain such levels of well-being as Guatemala is attaining.398.	Guatemala is politically structured by the sovereign will of its people on the basis of the democratic model of society which prevails in the Western world.399.	Its international policy is fully in line with its domestic policy and  consequently  is serious  honourable  loyal  responsible  honest and in accordance with the principles and postulates on which its philosophy of government is based.400.	As a developing nation  its policy identifies completely with the hopes of the under-developed world  as shown by all the positions taken by the country internationally  in which it has endorsed by its presence and its reasoning  the decisions taken within the Group of 77.401.	In the context of the Central American sub region  Guatemala has developed and maintained a policy of sincere brotherhood with the people of its brother nations in the isthmus  and of respect  co-operation and deep faith and conviction in the Central American identity.402.	In connexion with the events in Nicaragua  10 000 of our Nicaraguan brothers arrived in Guatemala both before and after the victory of the Sandinist Liberation Front  and our people  in accordance with our long-standing tradition of hospitality  received them with the affection which Guatemala feels for all its Central American brothers  regardless of their political convictions  and without labelling them in any discriminatory fashion. It receives them with sincerity and affection  offering them the opportunity to live in freedom.403.	My people and my Government thus reiterate their most sincere wishes towards the people of Nicaragua that they will recover from their wounds  and offer them all the solidarity and co-operation they can possibly provide to promote the development of our sister nation.404.	The Government of Guatemala reaffirms its faith in the process of Central American integration  on the understanding that integration is not confined solely to the economic field  but extends also to all fields and means anything to the social  economic and political benefit of all Central Americans.405.	In the context of the Latin American region  Guatemala has always promoted solidarity  has advocated the solution of differences between the nations of our continent by means of procedures for peaceful settlement  and has always been in the vanguard of the demands made in the various international forums that Latin America should be accorded the importance it deserves and be allowed to participate in the taking of decisions affecting it.406.	We Guatemalans are and feel ourselves to be Latin Americans; we believe in Latin America as a community  in its historical destiny  and in the role it must play in the world.407.	In the field of world politics  Guatemala is creating relations of all kinds with Western nations and its conduct conforms to standards of serious and scrupulous international ethics.408.	Fully aware of the reality of an international community composed of increasingly interdependent States  it has entered into trading relations with other countriesârelations which  by a natural and logical process  will be deepened and extended in the future.409.	The world economic situation continues to be clouded by the persistent inflation which has given rise to serious consequences for the developing countries  which cause their exports to fallâboth the quantity of products and the prices which they commandâand the cost of their imports to rise. These unfavourable terms of trade imply reductions in the potential gross national product  while economic growth does not correspond to the people's efforts and sacrifices. Under those conditions  the development process is undergoing unjust and undeserved setbacks  which dangerously aggravate all problems.410.	This economic situation must not become chronic because its consequences are felt in very sensitive areas of the human community  such as standards of living  levels of education  trade flow and social peace.411.	The first session of UNCTAD set the target of making development viable through the establishment of equitable trading standards and practices  which would permit countries to obtain terms of trade that would reward both human efforts and the product of their natural resources. Neither the labour nor the raw materials of the developing countries have succeeded in obtaining remunerative prices for their products on the international markets  prices which would have enabled them to finance the large investments which their economic and social progress demand.412.	Moreover  the industrialized countries have applied a policy of protectionism which sets up a barrier to the developing nations' exports of basic products. It is also clear that the developed countries' tariff rates act in practice as a tax on imported goods.413.	Guatemala believes that economic co-operation among the developing countries will be beneficial to the international economy in that it will provide other outlets for the exports of nations which are at an early stage of industrialization and will strengthen the negotiating capacity of the developing countries.414.	At the level of the region  economic co-operation among the five States members of the Central American Common Market has been conducted  despite the inevitable problems  in accordance with principles which are favourable to the promotion of trade among developing nations.415.	It is evident that some rational readjustments and reorganization are necessary throughout the economic sector and that these cannot come about without an agreement  given the complication of the existence of different economic systems at one and the same time.416.	Economic recovery and stability must be the aim of concerted action by States  which must constantly take decisions to deal with the problem.417.	We developing countries have demonstrated a spirit of conciliation in all matters relating to the international economy and to international trade. That is why we who are fighting for fundamental values such as the protection of our peoples from the scourge of under-development must not engage in divisive and fruitless struggles which  instead of bringing constructive agreement  provoke futile confrontations.418.	Guatemala also wishes to express  in this international  forum  its concern at the constant and excessive increases in the price of oil  which have a negative impact on the economies of the under-developed countries.419- It is imperative that machinery be established which will permit the financing or the offsetting  by means of concessions  of any new increase in the price of oil which would negatively affect the economies of the developing nations.420.	The preparation of the new international development strategy constitutes the third stage in the great effort undertaken at the world level to meet the challenge of under-development.421.	My delegation wishes  first  to emphasize the context in which development problems are posed. We live in a world characterized by growing interdependence but also by profound disparities and imbalances. While in certain societies an abundance  even an extravagance  of material goods prevails  others live in want and even in the depths of poverty.422.	Guatemala considers that each country must  on the one hand  face up to the problems which it must solve itself  mobilizing its own creative possibilities; and  on the other hand  collaborate in the solution of problems which require co-operation at the regional or world level and which demand large-scale  dynamic international action in order to find solutions which correspond to the present needs of mankind and to the aspirations of peoples.423.	Among the challenges posed at the world level  I might mention those of peace  the protection of human rights  and the establishment of more equitable trade relations between industrialized and developing countries.424.	But these challenges are linked to the more general problem of the elimination of all sources of tension  beginning with those related to the growing poverty of a large portion of mankind. Hunger  disease and ignorance are plagues whose eradication is necessary and possible: necessary  because world stability depends on it; and possible  because the means of attaining it exist.425.	Perhaps there is not yet a world vision that transcends present self-interest  as political will is lacking among the most advantaged. For their part  the latter must face up to the increasingly serious problems for the solution of which innovative ideas must be found.426.	The new course is that of solidarity  but a genuine solidarity undertaken fully and consciously  in a world that lives in real peace.427.	Guatemala believes that the international community must understand that the path of development need not always be the same  and that the idea of reducing it to the mere increase of the means of material production should be discarded.428.	It is certainly true that  to improve the living conditions of many of the peoples of the world which lack even the basic minimum requirements  it is essential that social prosperity be increased  but the challenges posed by hunger  malnutrition  ill-health and illiteracy are not of a technical nature since they stem from poverty  which in turn stems from a society's inability for various reasons to use the knowledge and the techniques that are essential to enable it to dominate nature sufficiently and to organize rationally all aspects of its life.429.	In other words  one of the factors essential to development that has not always been taken into account is the capacity of a people to mobilize all its energies with a view to attaining ends related to what it believes should be its present and its future.430.	Taking this and all the other related factors into account amounts to viewing development as a process that brings together  indivisibly  all expressions of social creativity and implies the active participation of all sectors of the population to attain the full development of the human being  with all his material  intellectual  moral and spiritual aspirations.431.	In these conditions  the various sectors of the economy should complement each other harmoniously and in solidarity  because their growth is linked to the simultaneous promotion of culture  education  science and technology  through which peoples affirm their identity and their cohesion  explore their future plans in solidarity and impose on economic growth its essential purposes.432.	Development of this nature requires a global social plan that is rooted in a country's historic heritage and can consequently command a general consensus with regard to its objectives. In this context culture takes on a vital function in that it concentrates the values that perpetuate a country's genius. Only culture permits a country to form a vision of its identity and of its destiny  thanks to which the cohesion of its activities is attained in respect of development. Only culture dictates the ethical goals with which each of its inhabitants can identify and through which each can fully commit himself to collective objectives.433.	In short  by combining all the spiritual and material dimensions of social activity the people will be able to affirm their identity  to resolve their subsistence problems  to live in dignity and to make their choices for the future.434.	These considerations constitute the position of the Guatemalan Government on the manner in which the international community must approach the Third United Nations Development Decade. My country believes it necessary for this new Decade to make a special contribution to the endeavour to establish a new just and fraternal international order. The effective realization of this aspiration depends on each of our countries.435.	The General Assembly has proclaimed this year the International Year of the Child. Guatemala has whole-heartedly supported this because it is aware that children are the collective responsibility of the community and that measures to benefit children should be adopted as part of the collective effort.436.	The Government of Guatemala is implementing programmes to benefit children  especially the most vulnerable among them  with the aim of surrounding them with care  guiding them and improving their living conditions. To that end  its Secretariat of Social Welfare  under the direction of the Presidency of the Republic  has approached the problem with the philosophy that children are the future of the country and that the efforts and sacrifices of this generation are being made so that the country can develop in all sectors and so that in their adult life children can benefit from a country that is fully developed in all spheres 437.	The Government of the Republic has also established a National Commission for the International Year of the Child to implement all the measures that the international community prescribes  for the benefit of children.438.	My delegation is prepared to support those resolutions that are designed to protect the children of the world at the international level.439.	Our Government also attaches fundamental importance to youth as a vital creative force that can give impetus to the progress of the nation. The participation of young people in all areas of national life is welcomed  and particular attention is given to their demands and problems as well as to their full development and training  so as to produce free citizens profoundly aware of their obligations and duties to society and to their country  and fully responsible in the exercise of their fundamental freedoms.440.	Guatemala whole-heartedly supports in this Assembly the proclamation of an international youth year  convinced that it would provide an ideal opportunity for the community of nations to examine the problems of youth and to try to find more adequate solutions that would channel the vigour  the enthusiasm and the sincere and pure drive of youth into the task of building a better  more humane and more balanced world on firm foundations of social justice.441.	I now wish to refer to the most serious international problem confronting my country. This concerns the Guatemalan territory of Belize  which has been usurped and occupied by Great Britain.442.	In previous sessions of the General Assembly  the historical background to our claim has been stated  as have the indisputable geographical  legal  political and moral arguments justifying Guatemala's rights over this part of its territory.443.	It is clear that the occupation by Great Britain of the territory of Belize constitutes a serious obstacle to the economic and social development of the peoples of Guatemala and Belize and to the progress of the Central American region.444.	For these reasons  Guatemala  which has always shown its solidarity with all the nations of Latin America  has appealed for the continent's solidarity and support in its just claim  which it has maintained constantly for more than 150 years  that Britain should return the territory of Belize  which is part of Guatemalan territory.445.	It would be paradoxical  and would totally undermine Latin American solidarity  if some nations of our America were to support the removal from a country of a substantial part of its territory by an imperialist and colonialist Power which wishes to appear to champion the principle of the right of peoples to self-determinationâa noble principle which England has never respected and  in fact  has invariably violated 446.	My delegation wishes to reiterate solemnly and categorically the willingness of the Government of Guatemala to negotiate with the Government of Great Britain a just solution to the century-old controversy concerning the territory of Belize  a solution that would reconcile the legitimate rights of Guatemala with the vital interests of the people of Belize 447.	Guatemala  which believes in and respects the lofty values of mankind  considers that the United Nations can and must endeavour to ensure universal respect for the ideals which inspired its creation  such as ensuring peace in the world and accelerating the development of all peoples.448.	The people and Government of Guatemala are willing to make the necessary efforts for the attainment of these noble goals."
"57",2935,"GUY",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  to extend to you congratulations upon your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly is for me no mere fulfilment of a tradition. The bonds of great fraternal solidarity between our two countries and the shared aspirations of our two peoples are the sources of the pride and pleasure Guyana feels at your assumption of this high office. Further  Mr. President  your election is in recognition of your unswerving commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of this Organization  of your rich experience and your considerable talents and consummate skills  but above all  of your broad vision as a humanist striving for a world in which exploitation is no more and in which alt can grow to their full stature. If I may be allowed to strike a somewhat more personal note  it will be to recall with the greatest satisfaction the years which you and I shared  working in tandem in this Organization. These recollections  Mr. President  serve to reinforce Guyana's conviction that  under your guidance and with your counsel  the business of this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly will be efficiently discharged.70.	It is appropriate at this stage  Mr. President  that I should place on record Guyana's appreciation of the serenity with which your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  conducted the work of the last session  and of the success which attended his efforts.71.	As we look back over the past year  we must recall with particular sadness the loss of two distinguished leaders of the developing world  Mr. Houari Bourne- diene  the President of the People's Republic of Algeria  and Mr. Agostinho Neto  the President of the People's Republic of Angola. Their memory will be cherished wherever men speak of peace  justice and political and economic emancipation.72.	Looking forward to the year ahead of us  it is with especial pleasure that Guyana welcomes the admission to our Organization of the sister Commonwealth Caribbean territory of Saint Lucia  with which we share a common history of colonialism and exploitation and with which we work closely together in the councils of the Caribbean community.73.	As in the past  this general debate is providing the occasion for a searching analysis of the condition of man at a particular moment in time. Clearly  old problems remain  and new situations requiring international attention have arisen.â74.	The persistence of old problems and the thrust of new ones seem to call into question the collective capacity of the international community to articulate solutions and to implement them. Indeed  many of the declarations  resolutions and programmes of action reflective of our joint experience and wisdom have languished unimplemented.75.	Within this chamber there has been struck on occasion a note expressive of uncertainty and of the lack of a sense of direction. Some have even conveyed the feeling that the moorings of the international ship of state have been cut and that it is adrift in uncharted seas.76.	It may be that reflections of such moods are responses characteristic of the end of a time-rhythmâthe decade  the millennium. But it may be as well that the roots of such feelings lie in the nature of the international system and the manner in which its actors  both national and non-national  comport themselves in pursuit of often contradictory objectives.77.	Yet not all the voices which have been heard from this podium have conveyed a mood of groping  of un-certainty. We need to ponder carefully the reasons for these differentiated responses.78.	In Guyana's view  out of this general debate must emerge the identification of the constraints on international co-operation and of the obstacles to the development of greater international understanding. If this were done  and if there were a measure of broad consensus  this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly could represent a true turning-point in human affairs.79.	No one can contest that the two most profound revolutions of this century have been that of October 1917  in the Soviet Union and the post-colonial revolution  the vibrancy of which reverberates throughout the international milieu.80.	The first not only offered an alternative strategy for the internal development of societies  but also promulgated an entirely new system of values with which the then dominant form of international organization had to contend. The most striking result of this challenge was the cold war. But its reality  albeit in a different form  continues today.81.	The second revolution involves the majority of the Members of this Organization. It continues to enrich the international community through the insights and experiences of diverse peoples. It has advanced universality based on sovereign equality. It has made possible the concept of a planetary community. And  above all  the articulation of the legitimate aspirations and objectives of that second revolution brought into focus the selectivity of affluence reflected in the divide between the rich North and the South where the poor live in the shadow of reality.82.	These revolutions registered advances towards the democratization of the world order and exerted influence on the international system  a system in which this universal actor  the United Nations  properly utilized  could play a leadership and catalytic role.83.	In large measure  the desire of the post-colonial States for the maintenance and consolidation of their independence  for the elimination of imperialism and colonialism  for the establishment of equitable international economic relations and for the creation of conditions for a secure peace found expression in the policy of non-alignment.84.	But while these two great revolutions have been global in their range and in the transformations which they have effected  the present legacy of the international system is one of profound cleavages and discontinuities. These complexities which the international community presently confronts include the persistence of imperialism with its structures of dependency and supportive networks  among which numbered the mass media  the spiralling of nuclear arms technology  which buttresses the immediate post-war bipolar division  and the new patterns of ideological behaviour.85.	Yet somehow there seems to be  beneath the turbulence  positive elements for change which provide the basis for new forms of co-operation which can take into account the desirability of peaceful coexistence.86.	In more recent times  there has been growing acknowledgement of the diffusion of power within the global society. Two years ago this was recognized at the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London. More recently it was reflected in the report of the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has so consistently served the cause of peace. In his report to us this year  the Secretary- General said  inter alia: ""The international scene has never been more complex nor the old concepts of power so diffused"" 87.	If we were to disaggregate the elements of power today  we will find that the power to destroy humanity is not necessarily coincidental with the power to ensure justice and equality. The elements of power are no longer located in any one national entity or a small group of national entities. Indeed  there are new centres of powerâfinancial  economic and moral.88.	The real question before us is how to build on these growth points and to maximize the potential  nay the inevitability  of a global approach which  in taking account of our separate national interests  serves the wider purpose of the international community.89.	The field of disarmament reflects the dichotomies which we face as we seek to grapple with the more complex model of international organization which the present realities portend. If we integrate into the concept of security the profound changes in attitudes to resource utilization  political pluralism  and technology itself  are some of us not still imprisoned by a perception of security which does not go beyond the building of isolated fortresses within national societies? Any commitment to disarmament in today's world is meaningless if it rests at the threshold of arms limitation. For the ramparts that are built on such assumptions are not founded on the satisfaction of human wants at the elemental level. Such a situation results in an armed peace which  in the pursuit of national survival  could encompass the destruction of the entire human race.90.	Similarly  the global application of detente is a prerequisite for its universal acceptance. It is necessary to ensure that detente in its operational parameters should not be limited to the European theatre. Thus we must insist that  if and when it is invoked outside Europe  it is not interpreted to mean either the observance of so-called spheres of influence  or privately negotiated codes of behaviours. For such action is  in essence  an attempt to preserve a status quo  which is inconsistent with the aspirations of the majority of the world's peoples.91.	Dramatic examples of the dilemma we face as a result of our failure to transcend the constraints to which I have alluded are the continued division of the Korean people  despite their quest for reunification without outside interference  and the apparent stalemate which besets the people of the small non-aligned State of Cyprus in their desire to be united and to rid their country of foreign occupation.92.	The situation in southern Africa is no less reflective of the conflicts which have so far inhibited collective international efforts for just and equitable change.93.	The Fascist regime in Pretoria has  since its ignominious defeat in Angola  effected tactical shifts in its over-all objective of economic and strategic supremacy in southern Africa. The pace of bantustanization has been accelerated  starting with the Transkei in 1976. The so-called internal settlements in Namibia and Zimbabwe have been promoted as part of a grand South African design for an edifice of puppet States behind which a white redoubt can be kept intact.94.	The cardinal objective of apartheid is the protection of settler interests in South Africaâinterests which are buttressed internationally by class links.95.	The liquidation of apartheid would substantially assist the forces of liberation throughout southern Africa. But its elimination is not a necessary condition for the reconquest of freedom and independence by the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia. In relation to the former  the conjuncture of the declining economic base of a shrinking white minority and the pressures of the freedom fighters  led by the Patriotic Front  has made the present Conference in London possible. Let us hope that this particular opportunity for a negotiated settlement will be effectively utilized for ensuring the full transfer of genuine power to the majority of the people of that country. In this way  further bloodshed  in a war where the victory of the Patriotic Front is inevitable  can be avoided.96.	Similarly  the efforts of the five Western countries  the major trading partners of South Africa  to effect a negotiated settlement must not compromise the genuine aspirations of the people of Namibia  led by their authentic representatives  the South West Africa People's Organization. The white tribes of South Africa must be given no succour for perpetual illegal dominion.97.	Apartheid has been roundly and universally condemned. While moral suasion is a legitimate tool of pressure for desirable change  it is apposite to assert that the cardinal underpinning of apartheid is economic. Racism is a derivative of that essential condition. Like slavery before it  apartheid will be effectively terminated when it becomes unsustainable as a form of economic organization.98.	The oppressed people of South Africa are waging a bitter struggle to achieve precisely that objective. For its part  the United Nations must maintain a multifaceted attack on apartheid  and it is in this context that Guyana contends  and has done so consistently  that mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter will hasten the collapse of the structure of apartheid.99.	In the Middle East a lasting peace is still elusive  and this despite the fact that the foundations for such a peace have long been identified. Pivotal to any search for a just settlement must be the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people  their full involvement in that search through their sole legitimate representatives  the PLO  and the universal acknowledgement of their right to a home and State of their own in Palestine. It is Guyana's hope that  ere this Assembly ends  there would be no more equivocation on the just rights of the Palestinian people. Meanwhile  we must condemn Israeli aggression against Lebanon and lend our full support to the people of that country in their present travail.100.	While the constraints that I have mentioned have been operated to hinder international co-operation  there has been contemporaneously an unheralded emergence of issues and values of a global character. These include the maintenance of the environment as a life-support system  the need to devise a new regime for the seas  an effective system of world food security  the supervision of multinational corporations and the elimination of both over-development and underdevelopment. These challenges have led to a number of global consultations under the auspices of this Organization. Global programmes have been formulated and  in some instances  new norms identified.101.	It is the contradiction between new global norms and the maintenance of attitudes and practices which are inconsistent with present-day imperatives that has served to retard effective action in the establishment of the New International Economic Order.102.	If we were to reflect on the mood of the international community earlier in this decade  when there appeared global consensus on the way forward in inter-national economic relations  it would be to perceive that this development was effected by the energy catalyst and the circumstances which inspired it. For a while thereafter it appearedâto some of us  at leastâ that the degree of international economic co-operation which was necessary for the implementation of the programmes of action agreed upon was both possible and realizable. But the hopes that the sixth and seventh special sessions aroused for the early implementation of the New International Economic Order were not sustained. The course of subsequent events and the resurgence of intransigent attitudes dramatically demonstrated this reality. Some minimal gains were made. I refer  for example  to the Common Fund and the agreement on debt in relation to the least developed countries. But in so many areas there was no progress.103.	As we come to the end of the decade of the 1970s  it seems that both in magnitude and range the economic problems which afflict the world's communitiesâEast and West  North and Southâare of such dimensions as perhaps to be insoluble in terms of the present collective measures and approaches.â104.	The upcoming negotiations in the early 1980s present the international community with a clear opportunity for co-operative action. Let us profit from our experience of the failure and disappointment of the 1970s. The forthcoming negotiations must not be approached as previous ones on the New International Economic Order when stratagems were utilized to maintain an old order while using the rhetoric of the new. On the contrary  the approach must take fully into account the new global imperatives  otherwise the decade of the 1980s may well be worse than that of the 1970s.105.	As we begin the preparations for the important negotiations which 1980 will herald  it is to the goal of wider co-operation that I suggest our energies be directed. The year 1980 will mark the third time the international community will initiate a development decade with a hopefully appropriate international development strategy.106.	Of special importance  as part of a proposed global round of negotiations  will be the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy to be held in 1981. The approach to this Conference must be based on recognition of the rights of the producers  the finiteness of the oil resource  its over- consumption by some industrialized States  the special vulnerability of some oil-importing States and the urgent need to alleviate their situation of crisis and  finally  the need to develop globally new and/or renewable resources of energy.107.	One of the consequences of the present situation of persistent dysfunction in the international economic system has been the universalization of the awareness of the true dimension and nature of interdependence. It may be that with this development a new opportunity presents itself for a collective definition of the mutuality of interests which will banish for ever arrangements based on domination and exploitation.108.	If I am right about the potential of these new circumstances  then it is essential that before we embark on a global round of negotiations we should seek to establish the pre-conditions for success. One such is the inevitability of the further diffusion of power within the international system. This is but one of the consequences that will flow from growing South-South cooperation. Similarly  the relations which are increasingly being built between countries of different social  political and economic systems will impact on the distribution of power itself within the international system.109.	And there are other essential verities which we should acknowledge together and which should inform our attitudes to these forthcoming negotiations. I do not propose an exhaustive list  but I believe that recognition of the following is indispensable: (i) that usable power is no longer the monopoly of a few; (ii) that in terms of demographic trends  the presently rich nations of the world are a shrinking minority; (iii) that technology  including nuclear technology  cannot for ever be monopolized by a few; (iv) and that the maintenance and growth of high levels of economic activity in the affluent North must be premised on the development of the developing countries themselves.110.	The policy of non-alignment and the movement of countries which practice that policy are universally recognized as an independent factor with a positive influence in the international system. Those of us who subscribe to that policyâwhich has provided a strategic alternative to multilateral alliances rooted in military powerâhave been consistently advocating the need for a system of international relations which is survival-oriented  democratic  equitable and just.111.	Even though our efforts in international organization have resulted in sometimes uneven success  it is yet undeniable that in the several forums in which we pursue our objectives new norms have emerged which have as their fundamental constituency the global polity. It may be that the time has come when we should attempt to devise an international contract bringing together into a single document the norms of genuine interdependence of requirements in a planetary community and the essentials for the new global round of negotiations.112.	Guyana  a small  non-aligned  socialist State  stands ready to participate constructively in advancing the cause of international co-operation."
"58",2979,"HND",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I am very pleased to convey to you  on behalf of the Government and the people of Honduras  our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We are all fully aware of your dedication to promoting the lofty aims of our Organization  particularly with reference to decolonization and the ongoing and necessary struggle against the odious policy of apartheid. World opinion is also very much aware of the great efforts that the United Republic of Tanzania  under the leadership of President Julius Nyerere  has exerted in various forums in favour of the African continent and world peace  so that  in electing you President of this great Assembly  we have also paid a tribute to the nation which you so worthily represent.297.	We also express warm greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the tact and excellence with which he is carrying out his important functions. The United Nations is the best machinery available to the international community for maintaining peace and promoting co-operation among nations  and our country would like to see  instead of the bitter censure directed against it  a renewal of confidence in its bodies and an attempt to improve its effectiveness by means of a serious commitment by Member States to carry out its recommendations and programmes.298.	We also hail with great joy and optimism for the future the accession of Saint Lucia to freedom as well as its admission to the United Nations.299.	With regard to disarmament  the results of the tenth special session have as yet not materialized  but it must be recognized that the States members of the Committee on Disarmament have with renewed purpose undertaken the consideration of various important problems relating to the comprehensive programme and the action that is needed so that as of 1980 we may have achieved an effective disarmament decade.300.	Today more than ever the arms race is obviously absurd and morally unjustifiable. Weapons do not only cause destruction  suffering and death; the very fact of manufacturing or acquiring them by way of enormous investments of money  together with the idea of the production of weapons as a necessary component of the economies of the highly industrialized countries  pre-supposes erroneous concepts which cannot be accepted. At this time  it is not possible to imagine that  while millions of human beings are dying from hunger  cold  poverty  disease and so many other gifts of the horsemen of the apocalypse  the highly developed Powers are devoting astronomical sums to the production of cannon  missiles and nuclear devices capable of causing the rapid and complete extermination 01 mankind. In this connexion the most authoritative statistics indicate that the largest centres of military power in the world have arsenals sufficient to destroy each other 15 times over. What do you think of that? And the gravest aspect of this tragedy is that  even though these weapons are instruments of death  their effect is not final; they will leave in their wake  after the ruins and smouldering embers  lingering hatreds and vengeance  so that for centuries thereafter the Biblical story of Cain and Abel will be relived.301.	The supreme value in international life must therefore be justice  and more specifically social justice  the essential basis for peace  since the serious disturbances in the contemporary world are without doubt caused by the unjust distribution of benefits and opportunities. On the other hand  if we set aside the use or threat of use of force as a means to do battle in today's world  the only means left is dialogue  in other words  communication between people setting aside questions of race  beliefs or frontiers  in order to overcome the enormous gaps separating men. Hence  our conviction that all disputes can be resolved by means of peaceful procedures established by international law  so long as the sun shines equally on all.302.	We hope that the second SALT Treaty will be ratified by the United States and the Soviet Union be-cause  although it represents a partial measure  it is a step in the right direction  which we must support for the sake of detente so that the peoples desirous of living in peace and free from pressure and fear will have their security enhanced.303.	In the past year peace agreements between Israel and Egypt have been concluded in a way which our country applauds  convinced as we are that such complicated and difficult problems can be resolved when goodwill and the desire for co-operation are brought to ear. It is to be hoped that these first steps will cement future good relations between the Arab and Israeli peoples  thus bringing permanent harmony to the Middle East.304.	We are also following with hope the development of the programme for autonomy of the Palestinian people  confident that  with the future in mind and with justice  effective participation will be given to its representatives in the preparation and implementation of that programme.305.	While Lebanon is still a prey to violence and overt foreign interference  which only worsens the crisis  Honduras wishes to appeal yet again for an end to this fratricidal struggle among the Lebanese people and to the artificial and harmful internationalization of the conflict.306.	Honduras continues to support the efforts  both of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative for Namibia  to obtain the necessary co-operation of South Africa to implement Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978).307.	The international community  through the United Nations  is directly responsible for the fate of this valiant people and it must leave no stone unturned in its efforts to ensure its prompt independence without any territorial subordination. The five Western Powers must carry out the commitment they entered into to hold free elections in Namibia under effective United Nations supervision and with the active participation of SWAPO.308.	With regard to Zimbabwe-Rhodesia  the latest plans and events are encouraging regarding a solution to a highly explosive situation and the attempt to put an end to the iniquitous racial discrimination suffered by its people through the establishment of an effective system of democracy; a system which would achieve a balance among the rights of the majorities and the minorities; a path that would enable a country torn by ethnic  social and religious divisions to overcome its difficulties and harmoniously join the community of nations.309.	The talks in Lusaka between the front-line States and the United Kingdom  the recommendations of the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries and the results of the Constitutional Conference now being held in London should therefore be firmly supported.310.	With regard to South Africa  international pressure in the form of economic sanctions against other regimes should convince that country of the futility and danger of its policy of supporting positions of the most extreme domination; equally this pressure should make it understand that the apartheid policy can only give rise to insurrection in South Africa and spark off a conflict of incalculable proportions throughout southern Africa.311.	Ten years ago my country became involved in a military conflict with the neighbouring Republic of El Salvador. This created an abnormal situation  which unfortunately remains unresolved. Honduras is a peace-loving country and its foreign policy is based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and of the Charter of the Organization of American States [OAS]  which categorically prohibit the use of force  stating that force can only be employed as a means of self- defence  as was our case in 1969.312.	Thus after various attempts at negotiation  in December 1977 we began a process of mediation  led by the eminent statesman  Mr. Jose Luis Bustamente y Rivero  under whose wise leadership the parties have completed the written stage of the procedure. There now remains the oral stage  in which  once the general treaty has been signed  all existing differences between both nations will be globally resolved.313.	Honduras  by tradition and by conviction  has always placed its trust in the procedures established by international law as the only civilized means of resolving disputes between States. Therefore it has taken part and will continue to take part most sincerely and constructively in mediation  and that is why it welcomes the recent statement by the highest authorities in ElâSalvador to the effect that that country is more than willing to discuss the matter of frontiers and thus reach a final solution of the dispute. If it should prove impossible to resolve some of the points or aspects in dispute within the mediation process  then these will be put before the International Court of Justice for a ruling  as we have unshakable trust and faith in the effectiveness  wisdom and soundness of that Court.314.	For almost a year the Central American isthmus has been rent by civil war in the sister Republic of Nicaragua. From the outset  the Government of Honduras declared its absolute neutrality in the conflict and scrupulously applied  in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the Charter of the OAS  the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and respect for the free self-determination of peoples.315.	However  I should make it clear here that my country's attitude dates from much earlier  since in 1907  when there were no international organizations or bodies  Honduras  in an inter-Central American document known in the annals of international law as the Washington Pacts  declared its perpetual neutrality in any conflict which might arise between two or more countries in the Central American isthmus.316.	I regard it as unnecessary to say that neutrality is not the same thing as indifference. No one could be indifferent to the death of more than 40 000 men  women and children  or to the fate of three times as many disabled  impoverished victims of war. Neither could one be indifferent to the systematic and indiscriminate devastation of towns and villages with the consequent destruction of factories  shops and all sources of production.317.	Honduras furthermore in its own territory shared the tragedy of the helpless  when it received more than 50 000 Nicaraguans who were fleeing from war. In refugee camps administered by the Honduran Red Cross  by improvising shelter and even receiving people into our own homes  we have given constant and unfaltering aid  because our Government and people are convinced of the imperative need to help a brother people unjustly subjected to the most terrible tests. While seriously limited in its activities by obstacles of an economic order  our Government called for and obtained international aid  and here I wish to state our thanks for the altruistic and effective action taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  the International Red Cross  the OAS and by various friendly Governments  without whose valuable co-operation it would not have been possible for us to have assumed such a burden.318.	I can add that  with the setting up of a new regime in Nicaragua  the great majority of refugees have returned home  although afterwards  because of this same war  several thousand more came and these have been treated in exactly the same way as those who preceded them. At present we have about 13 000 refugees and our Government will continue to help those who are genuine refugees in giving them the protection they deserve as human beings.319.	However  I must state with some concern that  according to our information  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has decided to put an end to the aid operation  despite the fact that there is an agreement between that organization and our Government concerning activities to render refugees self-reliant which will be in force until 31 December this year. In view of this situation  we request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to continue its valuable and resolute support in order to relieve the most pressing needs of these poor Nicaraguans.320.	Nicaragua  for its part  as a nation  is confronting an historic challenge of institutional consolidation and economic reconstruction which our country also wishes to support as far as it can. Our Government has never claimed or had pretensions to set itself up as a judge of political events in or the affairs of other countries  and it wishes to maintain friendly relations with the Government of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua within the framework of sincere cooperation and mutual respect of Central American States  whose people constitute one family or  to put it better  one nation in the full sense of the word.321.	Consequently  we firmly support the recommendations of the member countries of ECLA  those of the Action Committee of the Latin American Economic System  those of the Inter-American Development Bank and those of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration concerning international assistance for Nicaragua.322.	Of course  the United Nations system will also have to co-ordinate and increase its contribution to the task of reconstruction which has to be carried out  and Honduras appeals to Member States from this podium to take part generously in the programmes being studied or carried out by UNDP  the World Bank and other agencies to assist Nicaragua.323.	The Government of Honduras is continuing to give impetus to the internal efforts necessary for balanced economic and social development in the country  and for the material and cultural well-being of its inhabitants. To this end  further stages in the programme of basic infrastructure have been completed with the opening of a highway to the rich regions of the Valle de Olancho and the opening of a new port on the Pacific in the Gulf of Fonseca.324.	Efforts have also gone on constantly to increase agricultural production  in terms both of basic food cereals and of agricultural products for export  in an attempt to achieve stable earnings which in turn could fund expansion of the national economy.325.	Co-operation with international bodies  particularly those of the United Nations system  and with friendly Governments has been intensified since the Government of Honduras attempted effectively to integrate financial aid and foreign technical assistance in the 1979 to 1983 national development plan.326.	However  a few years short of that date  the world is in full debate on the economic chaos created by the energy crisis. The high price of oil has disrupted the economy of countries  and those which do not produce it are obliged to divert enormous sums of money to obtain it  creating for developing countries lacking in hydrocarbons a really critical situation  since the imperative of development does not allow of delays  vacillations or retrogressions. We therefore hope that the arguments which Mexico put forward yesterday through the person of its illustrious President will help to dissipate as far as possible the heavy clouds at present darkening the horizon of those countries which do not possess these vital elements.327.	At the same time  the developing peoples must continue to confront the situation of tariff and non-tariff barriers put up by the highly industrialized countries which place additional limitations on our efforts  and if we look at this sincerely I am sure that-the difficulties can be overcome by frank  open  thorough dialogue which would lead to genuine international economic co-operation.328.	In this context  Honduras firmly supports the declaration of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 on various important aspects of the economic negotiations going on at the international level at this time.329.	The major tragedy of refugees in South-East Asia calls for a wide-ranging  generous programme based on understanding  which would permit the resettlement of thousands of deserving families  who need not only a temporary refuge but also some certainty of a proper future  and the best efforts should be made to see that the causes of such a deeply distressing and enormous exodus are removed.330.	As for the problems of children throughout the world  through a national committee presided over by the First Lady of the nation  Carlota de Paz Garcia  with the active participation of governmental agencies  private bodies and welfare bodies  Honduras has for its part carried out the aims of the International Year of the Child.331.	In this attempt to afford every advantage to our men of the future  in 1979 wide dissemination has been given in Honduras to the rights of the child and the need to provide adequately in our society for its basic requirements in terms of nutrition  literacy  a healthy family environment and a gradual and effective in-corporation in the life of the nation.332.	Honduras  which is a party to the Inter- American Convention on Human Rights adopted in San JosÃ© in 1969 at an historic Conference in which I had the honour to take part as head of my country's delegation  welcomed this month the setting up of its main body  the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.333.	My Government continues  moreover  to observe the free exercise of civil  political and economic rights of the inhabitants and  within the institutional framework  the Government of the Armed Forces fully guarantees at present an electoral process which has deeply democratic roots  and this will culminate in a general election in April 1980 for the members of a national constituent assembly.334.	The pre-election stage is going ahead with the most rigorous observance of the law and in full freedom. Any Honduran can publicly say or state in writing  without fear of reprisals  whatever he so desires. In Honduras  although my country is very small  very modest  very humble  there is not a single political prisoner or political exile. I invite anybody here in the Assembly to visit us and see the proof of what I am saying. There are no guerrilla groups  no terrorist groups. There are no acts of violence and no kidnappings of the kind that are the fashion in other part s of the world. All our inhabitants have full freedom of movement without any restrictions whatever in an atmosphere of complete tranquillity. The rights of association and of peaceable assembly are fully guaranteed. The judiciary is absolutely independent in making its decisions.335.	Of course  because we are a small and poor developing country  it is natural that we are somewhat overwhelmed by the major challenges of development. We have to be more energetic in combating our problems of housing  malnutrition  disease and illiteracy in rural areas  the excessively rapid growth of our towns and cities  and many other imbalances caused by inflation and economic disorders  evils which are endemic throughout the world.336.	And we can say with satisfaction that we are holding our own in dealing with these scourges. The most important areas in our national budget come under the headings of communications  education and public health. There is a land reform in progress and proceeding according to plan which is based on a law that is the most progressive in Central America. Trade union and co-operative movements are in the forefront in the region  both in organization and in achievement. We are devoting our best material and human resources to this struggle  and we are sure that we will meet the challenges of domestic peace  and peaceful coexistence at the regional level  and that we will achieve a proper democracy based on bread  a roof over one's head and dignity.337.	In the context of the United Nations  my Government hopes to put the finishing touches to the process of ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  in the hope that we can deposit our instruments of ratification before the end of this year.338.	In conclusion  I should like to state that Honduras has continued to give close attention to the tasks of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We hope that not only will institutions be consolidatedâwhich  like the 12-mile limit of the territorial sea and the 200-mile exclusive economic zone are part of international customary lawâbut also that machinery will be set up which  in a truly international regime  will ensure the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed as the common heritage of mankind.339.	Honduras  most conscious of the high honour and responsibility involved  has this year chaired the Group of 77 developing countries. And  in again thanking the member countries of the Group for their cooperation and assistance  Honduras repeats that it is willing to continue to serve most devotedly the interests of those same countries.340.	Honduras needs resources from the sea in order to supplement the nutritional requirements of its population  and to ensure the proper growth of a healthy and diversified economy. It further needs  like the other developing countries and the international community as a whole  the full observance of the rights embodied in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV). It requires also that the negotiations of the ninth and last session of the Conference in 1980 conclude with the setting up of the international machinery essential to the exploitation of the sea-bed and ocean floor.341.	Undoubtedly  the sea is the fourth dimension of the world economy  particularly at a time such as this  when the tidal wave of human reproduction before the year 2000 threatens to wipe off the map millions of people from lack of food and vitamins.342.	Honduras therefore considers that any national legislation or treaty of limited participation designed to allow large consortia to exploit the sea-bed would run counter to international law already in force  and would disrupt the process of negotiations already undertaken. Any action or operation carried out under instruments of that kind would in our view be completely lacking in validity and the international community would have to take action against them by calling for a proper sense of responsibility  and thus defending bravely and strongly the common heritage of mankind."
"59",3048,"HTI",34,1979,"ï»¿The delegation of the Republic of Haiti is happy and proud  Sir  to welcome your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your brilliant intelligence  your political sense and your long experience within the United Nations have brought you well-deserved election to this high office in which no doubt you will continue to do honour not only to the Republic of Tanzania but to Africa and the African Diaspora.382.	I should like to pay a tribute to Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre  who  in conducting the work of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly  showed himself to be a diplomat full of tact and devoted to the cause of humanity.â383.	The Republic of Haiti welcomes Saint Lucia to the United Nations family. The people and Government of Haiti welcome the addition of that new State and hope that it will make its contribution to the ideals of solidarity and fraternity which are the substance of the Charter of this Organization.384.	The delegation of the Republic of Haiti would like to transmit to the valiant people of Panama and to their leaders the congratulations of my Government and people on the establishment of the sovereignty of the State of Panama over the Canal Zone. The date 1 October 1979 marks a turning-point towards realism in relations between the United States and the other countries of the Latin American continent.385.	The Government of the Republic of Haiti would like  first  to reaffirm its attachment to the ideals and principles of the United Nations Charter and to renew its determination to collaborate to find a solution to problems which require intelligence  understanding and the devotion of men who are responsible for the future of humanity.386.	My delegation is delighted to participate in the work of this thirty-fourth session since  whatever the outcome of our debates  it is comforting to see that the qualified and legitimate representatives of the peoples of the whole world  notwithstanding the differences in their situations and their opinions  have recourse to this forum to air their opinions and  in a spirit of conciliation  to submit blueprints for solutions to problems which threaten international peace and security.387.	I should like to take this opportunity heartily to congratulate our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and his eminent colleagues  as well as all those who  in various capacities  have contributed to maintaining the vitality of the Organization and of the specialized agencies and to preparing the work of this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly.388.	Before the International Year of the Child draws to a close  the delegation of the Republic of Haiti wishes to draw the attention of the Assembly to the lot of children in the third world  60 per cent of whom suffer from hunger  two out of three of whom die from it  while a fair number of the survivors remain stunted throughout their lives.389.	Moreover  statistics show that more than 25 000 children in developing countries become blind because of deficiencies in vitamin A; that 5 million die of diphtheria  tetanus  poliomyelitis  tuberculosis and other diseases  because of the dearth of vaccines; that 350 million do not receive any schooling.390.	If we add to this already gloomy picture  the number of children who fall victims of apartheid and of the adoption business  it can be seen that the situation of needy children in the third-world countries is quite simply tragic.391.	Of course UNICEF has made laudable efforts for disseminating information on family planning techniques  nutrition  pre-natal care  vaccination and disease prevention  hygiene and the improvement of the environment. But the task of governmental leaders with regard to children remains to be accomplished. Preparing for the future means caring for and educating the children of today  who will become the men and women of tomorrow.392.	There is no need to stress the importance of child care; it suffices to recall that adult behaviour is the direct consequence of the biological  psychological and social phenomena which mark the first stages in one's life. Will the General Assembly at this thirty-fourth session have the wisdom to recommend the strengthening of the work of UNICEF and of the private organizations which devote themselves to needy children out of a noble concern to preserve the future for them?393.	The Republic of Haiti is concerned about the grave crisis which seriously affects the world economy. Inflation and unemployment rates throughout the world threaten the stability of institutions which  from 1955 to 1970  ensured an unhoped-for expansion of the Western  economy.'394.	But have we really taken the trouble to research the deep-seated causes of this crisis  for which total responsibility is attributed to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries? Have we thought about the way of life and production in the Western countries  based on an unimpeded exploitation of the riches of the third world  without taking into account that the third world would one day claim sovereignty and effective c6ntroI over its natural resources? Have we forgotten the obstinate retention of the international financial system  established by the Bretton Woods agreements   when timely changes should have been introduced to adapt them to the development of the world economy?395.	One of the most important tasks of our time is to overcome this economic crisis by making people more aware of human solidarity and the interdependence of nations in a framework of international social justice which would be established by the new international economic order.396.	The Republic of Haiti was founded on human dignity and freedom and  since the black slave revolution  has always been in the vanguard of those that defend the basic rights of the human person. Its very existence is the expression of those rights the various component aspects of which have been stressed in turn  according to the stages of our national development.397.	Today the Republic of Haiti gives priority to economic and social rights  as defined by His Excellency Jean-Claude Duvalier  the President-for-Life of the Republic:What constitute rights  basic and legitimate privileges for the Haitian are the rights to food and clothing  to housing  educationâin a word  the right to live decently"".398.	Because of the present constraints in international economic relations  President Jean-Claude Duvalier has undertaken a vast programme of reforms dealing with taxation  administration  the organization of rural communities  education and health  with a view to improving the standard of living of the rural and urban masses.â399.	Immediately following the Second World War  international relations were reduced to a duel between West and East. Humanity's awareness was restricted to simplistic and unsubtle Manicheanism. The spark struck in April 1955 at the African-Asian Conference in Bandung was not powerful enough to illuminate the way of newly independent people who were quickly taken over by one or the other camp.400.	Torn apart and weak  dependent technologically and economically  the States of the third world allowed themselves to become the pawns of history in a conflict which reflected the hegemonistic will of Powers which believed that they represented the universal conscience. Gradually  the spirit of Bandung was reborn and was finally reaffirmed with the establishment of the Group of 77  the forerunner of the North-South dialogue  which replaced ideological confrontation.401.	The new axis on which international relations were based  enshrined by the political constellation of the industrialized countries and the economically backward countries  represents an historic victory of the peoples of the third world who discovered an identity of interests and of problems. However  in certain recent international meetings the old scenario reappeared. It is important that peoples who lived through colonial domination should recall the ""divide-and-rule"" tactics and the localized wars in which people acted as intermediaries.402.	Certainly the diversity of situations can cause breaches in third-world solidarity  as was observed in the discussions on energy problems. The reference to this common good  which is an abiding theme in history  should enable us to distinguish the essential from the inessential and to transcend such past incidents. Even if the deficit of the poor countries caused by rises in oil prices reaches $40 billion at the end of 1979 and even if petrodollars are not invested in the developing countries  the nations of the third world should see to it that their financial interests should not take precedence over their solidarity. Furthermore  the oil-exporting countries  by adopting a selective pricing policy according to the consignees of the oil  would close the breach which the champions of neo-colonialism want to use to sow confusion and cause disunity in the ranks of the third world.403.	Accordingly  the Government of the Republic of Haiti makes an urgent appeal to all Governments of the third world to strengthen their solidarity in favour of a common ideology  which should be the original expression of the aspirations of our peoples  striving for effective control over their natural resources and for the right to choose in freedom and sovereignty their political  economic and social institutions. If it were otherwise  the third world would never stop being an arena for confrontationâwithout a value of its own  without its creative forceâdestined to suffer passively the contradictory influences which have Balkanized it culturally  politically and economically.404.	If the diversity of people is an undeniable fact flowing from historical development and from the civilization peculiar to each nation community  the unity of men is none the less a certainty because of their aspirations to freedom  peace  justice and well-being.405.	For liberated minds there are values on which all civilizations can agree. If we wish to cut off history from its tragic elements  we must find points on which to pin new hope; we must draw the distinction between what we are entitled to hope for and what we have reason to believe is attainable.406.	Accordingly  the Republic of Haiti is prepared to make its contribution to the establishment of a better world  as was stated by His Excellency Mr. Jean- Claude Duvalier  President-for-Life of our Republic  in a message to the nation on 2 January 1979. The message was as follows:' 'The basic goal of my Government is to seek original ways to reconcile the fundamental demands of the third world and the legitimate interests of the industrialized nations to confer a cultural and human touch on international co-operation.""407.	These are the comments of the delegation of the Republic of Haiti which we wish to submit for the consideration of the Assembly at this thirty-fourth session. We hope that the work of this session will be crowned with success."
"60",3094,"HUN",34,1979,"ï»¿ Mr. President I should like  on behalf of my Government  to welcome you warmly and to express my hope that the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly under your leadership will be successful in its work.35.	On behalf of my Government  I should like to are some people who  to put it mildly  are behaving rather strangely. They acknowledged that the Pol Pot regime pursued a policy of genocide and for years had raided the border areas of Viet Nam  but in practice they closed their eyes to it and in this way they justify the ""right to existence"" of a regime that committed unpardonable crimes against the Kampuchean people. They also serve to justify the acts of the aggressor which invaded Viet Nam from the north.58.	In recent years significant changes have occurred in the Near East.59.	A popular revolution has triumphed in Afghanistan  but it has still to fight counter-revolutionaries and the foreign forces which assist them. My Government expresses its solidarity with the revolution in Afghanistan and stands at its side in its hard struggle.60.	Present-day developments point to an increasingly active participation of Latin American countries in the struggle for a democratic and independent pattern of political and economic development. We welcome the democratic changes in Nicaragua and reject any manoeuvres designed to impose on that country arrangements alien to the interests of the people. It is for the long-suffering Nicaraguan people to choose the path they wish to follow.61.	The Hungarian Government continues to pledge its solidarity with the Arab peoples fighting for the elimination of the consequences of the Israeli aggression  and is in favour of a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East. The separate peace treaty between Egypt and Israel disregards the concerns of the Arab peoples  tends to increase tension in the region and is a source of new conflicts. That is why we refuse to accept the separate peace treaty and oppose the effort to have it recognized by the United Nations. A just and lasting settlement can be brought about only with the equal participation of all the interested parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  and that settlement should ensure the right of the Palestinian Arab people to establish a State of their own.62.	The recent Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Havana was a true reflection of the increasing role being played by the non-aligned movement in shaping international political life. Following the movement's traditions  the meeting of Heads of State and Government once again raised its voice against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and racism  and in favour of disarmament. The Hungarian Government supports the just aspirations of the non-aligned movement and agrees with the substance of the Havana Declaration.63.	My Government is increasingly concerned over some of the alarming phenomena occurring in the world economy which are manifest in no small measure in the protectionist and discriminatory tendencies of the developed capitalist countries and the international monopolies. We find it unacceptable that the capitalist countries should be shifting the burden of solutions to their internal economic problems to other countries  particularly those which are economically less developed.64.	My Government believes that the activity of the United Nations in the field of formulating economic policy should concentrate on the restructuring of international economic relations on a democratic and just basis  on the reorganization of the prevailing pattern of the international division of labour and of the structure of the world economy. The world conferences held in 1979 and scheduled for 1980  particularly the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1980  have a significant role to play in economic development over the next decade. Our delegation will do its best to promote efforts seeking to ensure that the relevant provisions to be worked out take due account of the positive principles laid down in important United Nations resolutions on economic matters  particularly the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  and reflect faithfully the real causes of the state of backwardness in developing countries as well as the material and moral responsibility of the developed capitalist countries. These provisions should also make clear the close relations between international economic and political processes on the one hand  and the internal and external conditions of economic growth on the other.65.	As I have had several occasions to state from this rostrum  my Government considers it necessary that the effectiveness of the United Nations should be enhanced. We appreciate the significant personal efforts made towards that goal by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whom we had the pleasure of welcoming to Hungary last July. The Charter of the United Nations contains numerous possibilities that have not yet been sufficiently used to that end. We still hold that the provisions of the Charter on the purposes and principles of the United Nations  as well as on its organs and their functions  provide an appropriate basis for performing the tasks incumbent upon us.66.	The constant and considerable increase in the United Nations budget is a matter of concern. We think that effective measures should be taken to reduce the rate of increase in expenditure.67.	It is with these reflections in mind that I have sought to outline my Government's position on some of the major international issues before the General Assembly. We hope that the work of the present session of the United Nations General Assembly will live up to our expectations and that the world Organization will contribute substantially to the realization of the ardent wish of all of us to establish firmly lasting international peace and security."
"61",3141,"IDN",34,1979,"ï»¿It is particularly gratifying to Indonesia that the President of this session is not only a distinguished diplomat with a long association with the United Nations but also an outstanding representative of the United Republic of Tanzania  with which my country enjoys excellent relations. I wish to take this opportunity to express to theâPresident the warmest congratulations of my Government  as well as my own  upon his unanimous election. We pledge to him our full co-operation in making this session of the Assembly a success.153.	At the same time  I should like to pay my country's tribute to his predecessor  Ambassador Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  for the efficient manner in which he conducted the deliberations of the last session.154.	To our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whom my Government recently had the pleasure to welcome to Indonesia  I wish to state our sincere appreciation for his unremitting efforts to promote peace and international understanding within the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.155.	I also take pleasure in welcoming the State of Saint Lucia into the United Nations. The admission of Saint Lucia underscores the widening universality of membership of the United Nations and the need for mutual co-operation. My delegation looks forward to close and useful co-operation with the delegation of Saint Lucia in our common effort in solving the myriad problems that confront the world community today.156.	Once again we are assembled in this hall to ex-amine the concerns of our times  to seek new avenues to strengthen global peace and security  to solidify international co-operation  and to chart a better future for the nations of the world. These concerns evolve at a time of structural transformation of the present political and economic orderâa process which is advancing irresistibly. The challenge facing the international com-munity is to influence the direction of this process towards the formation of a new pattern of international relations  a more equitable international co-operation for development and a new international order developing in a world which requires  for the successful consummation of these processes  a stable and enduring peace.157.	While we are confronted with these new challenges  new forms of threat to global peace are constantly emerging as a result of power politics and the intensification of the arms race  bringing in their wake a serious deterioration in the climate of international security. We are witnessing  among others  a changing international power structure and a new generation of local conflicts. These conflicts in certain parts of the world emphasize the need for the revitalization of detente. Relaxation of tension between the major Powers and between Power blocs constitutes an important pre-requisite. Detente  as a prerequisite for the maintenance of real peace as distinguished from a mere absence of armed conflict  should be made to evolve into a global system of peaceful coexistence comprising all regions of the world and all aspects of inter-State relations. It must be based on respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of all States  non-interference in internal affairs and the non-use of force. To lead to a durable peace  detente should also be consciously pursued as part of a universal effort towards general and complete disarmament.158.	It is in this context that consensus has grown among the members of the international community to find ways and means to enhance the effectiveness of ourOrganization to deal with the challenges and problems created by the radical changes which are taking place in the international community of nations which have far- reaching consequences. Particularly  there exists an urgent need to strengthen the Organization in order to enable it to discharge effectively its primary responsibility of maintaining peace based on justice and to contribute to the strengthening of international security. In our efforts to strengthen the efficacy and role of the United Nations as an instrument for peace and cooperation  it is essential that the Organization should conform to the changed circumstances of our times. Furthermore  efforts must be made to encourage Members to exhibit the political will to make greater use of the possibilities of peaceful settlement of disputes afforded by our Organization. The Secretary-General underscored the need for this approach when he stated in his report on the work of the Organization that the United Nations  if effectively utilized as the working structure of the world community of the future  could be of unique assistance in solving problems.159.	The United Nations has a long and enviable record of providing assistance to refugees. More recently  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  among others  has been burdened by the deluge of Indo-China refugees and displaced persons flooding the countries of South-East Asia  putting a heavy strain on them. Indonesia and the other members of ASEAN have none the less extended their co-operation within their limited means to alleviate the suffering of the refugees.160.	The influx of refugees has left in its trail local problems and unsettled local conditions. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the refugees are not only a humanitarian concern but also pose questions or national security containing at the same time potential threats to the political and economic stability of the region.161.	The recent Geneva Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia has produced some encouraging results  although it fell short of providing an over-all and lasting solution. In this connexion  my Government has noted with appreciation the response of the Government of Viet Nam with regard to extending its co-operation to the High Commissioner for Refugees in tackling the problem at the source  and hopes that it will continue to honour its commitments undertaken in this regard. However  it is of the utmost importance that the international communityâin particular  the receiving Statesâtake more concerted action to expedite the resettlement of the refugees.162.	The importance of the success of the Geneva Meeting on refugees lies in the fact that  given the opportunity  the United Nations system can and does work. The Meeting was able to pluck the nations of South-East Asia from the brink of chaos because we  the participants  were able  for a change  to set aside our differences and address ourselves to the problem at hand  irrespective of our social  economic and political inclinations.163.	The South-East Asian region is now again faced with a problem of great magnitude. It is pertinent to note that the conflict is still continuing and a threat of widespread famine now appears imminent. Such an eventuality will result in hardship and deprivation on a massive scale for the people of Kampuchea  who have already suffered immensely. It will also worsen and aggravate the refugee problem already faced by the neighbouring countries. My delegation  therefore  calls upon all the parties involved to extend their full and unconditional co-operation to relief operations that may be undertaken by the international community.164.	In the final analysis  in this deteriorating situation not of their own making  the people of Kampuchea must be allowed to determine their future by themselves. This must be made free of outside interference and influence. Coming from the region  we must express our concern at the threat that this conflict poses to the peace and security of the ASEAN States and to the whole region. It is in view of these considerations that the ASEAN States have urged the General Assembly to consider at this session the situation in Kampuchea.165.	The principles which I have just noted concerning the situation in Kampuchea are  indeed  of relevance to the whole region of South-East Asia. In particular  it is essential to accord recognition to the principles of respect for the independence of all the States in the region and the sovereign right of those States to define their national policies free from foreign interference and intervention. It is also necessary to reject any action by individual outside Powers which is aimed at the creation of spheres of influence. The countries of the region should be left to solve their own problems in accordance with their perception of national interests and regional harmony. The countries of the region should be given a chance to seek a solution towards meaningful and real peaceful coexistence  regardless of their respective economic  social and political systems  At the same time  the countries of the region should refrain from policies or actions which would give a pretext for or justify interference or intervention by outside Powers. Through such an approach it should be possible to build a strong and vibrant region whose Governments can devote their efforts to the economic development of their peoples.166.	On the question of the Middle East  the United Nations has adopted a number of resolutions  particularly since 1967  to serve as a basis for a just and durable peace. However  Israel has consistently defied and railed to heed the demands of the overwhelming majority of the international community. Israel's policy of aggression and colonial expansion and occupation perpetuates a situation of protracted conflict and inherent injustice. Israel's defiant acts of provocation and persistent disregard of United Nations resolutions have been exposed  time and again  as being the major obstacle to a just and lasting peace in the region. Israel continues its universally condemned practice of establishing new settlements in the occupied territories. Only a few days ago it took still another defiant step by sanctioning the acquisition of land in the occupied areas by its citizens. Such actions are added proof that Israel intends to maintain control of those areas with a view to annexing them. Its repeated and senseless attacks against Lebanon have caused the loss of innumerable innocent lives and of property.167.	We are all united in the conviction that a settlement of the Middle East question cannot be achieved through partial solutions. A solution to be just and lasting should be one that is comprehensiveâ comprehensive in the sense that it should lead to the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab lands. It should lead to the return of Jerusalem to Arab custody  and it should also lead to the fulfilment of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self- determination.168.	Indonesia has consistently supported the universally accepted position that the Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East problem and that the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people should be realized  including their right to establish an independent State of their own  and the recognition of the PLO as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. No one can ignore the fact that the PLO  as the sole representative of the people of Palestine and their aspirations  is now more universally recognized. We look forward to that inevitable day when the PLO participates in the negotiations for a just and comprehensive settlement leading to the establishment by the Palestinian people of their own national State.169.	Despite the strenuous efforts of the international community to bring about just and peaceful solutions  the situation in southern Africa has deteriorated over the past year. Colonialist repression and racial discrimination continue to flaunt world opinion and pose a threat to international peace and security.170.	International efforts over many years totally to eliminate the apartheid policy in South Africa have so far shown no substantive results. In view of this  my delegation feels that it is time now that new ways and means for forcing an end to this policy were considered seriously and implemented with firmer determination. In this regard  Member States should support the complete isolation of the Pretoria regime by any means  including the continuation of United Nations sanctions 171.	The illegal presence of South Africa in Namibia continues in contravention of the responsibility of the United Nations for bringing Namibia to national independence. This is an open defiance of United Nations authority. We must deal with it effectively in order to bring South Africa to a settlement which would give the people of Namibia genuine independence. Specifically  the States that enjoy a close relationship with the Pretoria regime must exert further pressure in order to make the Pretoria regime adhere strictly and immediately to the relevant United Nations resolutions. In the event these efforts prove fruitless  our recourse should be to implement resolution 33/206 of 31 May 1979  which calls upon the Security Council to consider enforcement measures against South Africa  as provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter.172.	My delegation is satisfied that the decision on Zimbabwe by the recent Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries held in Lusaka has led to the present London Conference aimed at ending the impasse on the decolonization of Zimbabwe. The fact that all concerned parties are participating has given the Conference an auspicious start which may lead to a positive solution. My delegation  however  believes that that solution should be one acceptable to all parties  and must lead to genuine independence. Until such a solution is reached  my Government will continue to support relevant United Nations resolutions pertaining to the question  including sanctions.â173.	A year has elapsed since the adoption of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament  and progress in this sphere has fallen short of our expectations. The arms race has continued unabated  despite the concerted efforts of the international community. Moreover  satisfactory progress on a number of pressing problems  such as a comprehensive test ban and the prohibition of chemical weapons  has not yet been achieved. The Committee on Disarmament has so far been unable to make significant headway on these problems.174.	Another important question concerns the security guarantee for the non-nuclear-weapon States. Efforts in this regard did not succeed due to disagreement among the nuclear-weapon States to provide such a guarantee. We believe that an effective and credible guarantee consists in the prohibition of the use or the threat to use nuclear weapons. Such a prohibition is in the interests not only of the non-nuclear-weapon States but of the entire world as well. This issue should be dealt with expeditiously  as the non-nuclear-weapon States  which have accepted unequal and onerous obligations  are justified in urging the nuclear-weapon States to provide such a guarantee.175.	Indonesia welcomes the signing of the second SALT Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union and looks forward to its entering into force soon. It is our hope that the agreement will contribute to the improvement of relations between them  and thus help to reduce the risk of an outbreak of war. Despite the successful outcome of the second round of SALT the world is still far away from real disarmament. We hope  therefore  that the parties concerned will continue  as they have agreed  to pursue negotiations on measures for further limitation and reduction in the number of strategic arms as well as for further qualitative limitations.176.	As regards the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  my delegation has welcomed the progress achieved during the meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean  held in July. It has set in motion the process of convening an international conference with a view to reaching an international agreement which will facilitate the implementation of the Declaration. The Meeting also epitomized the desire of the States concerned to evolve a common position and to work together to ensure peace in the region. My delegation attaches great importance to the non-use of the Indian Ocean as an arena for great Power rivalry and conflict in any of its manifestations and ramifications. In this light my delegation views with concern the increasing military presence of the great Powers in the area. This constitutes a serious setback to the efforts by the States of the region to keep great Power rivalry out of the Indian Ocean. We hope that the forthcoming conference on the Indian Ocean  the venue and date of which will be decided by this Assembly  will succeed in facilitating the attainment of the objectives of the Declaration to the benefit not only of the riparian States  but of all the peace-loving nations of the world.177.	The experience of ASEAN  in its efforts to establish a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  offers a useful analogy in this regard. Its most important objective is the attainment and preservation of peace as a prerequisite for that sustained development of the region by pursuing the goals of preventing external interference and containing intra-regional differences. ASEAN hopes  thereby  to make a positive contribution to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.178.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea approved during last summer's session a programme of work providing for the adoption of a new and comprehensive convention on the law of the sea next year. My delegation wishes to express its appreciation for this useful and timely decision  which will enable us not only to initiate the exploitation of deep sea-bed resources but also to avoid protracted negotiations which  in the final analysis  will exhaust our limited resources  especially those of the developing countries.179.	Although the eighth session of the Conference did not finalize a formal text  it did achieve significant progress on certain hard-core issues. My delegation continues to support the statement made by the Chairman of the Group of 77 during the last session concerning unilateral legislation on the exploitation of deep sea-bed resources  since such action would prejudice the results of the Conference.180.	Indonesia  as an archipelagic State  lying at the cross-roads  between two continents and two oceans  attaches great importance to the successful outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and will always lend its support to the acceleration of meaningful negotiations. It is our earnest hope that all interested parties will negotiate fully in a spirit of compromise in order to reach agreement as soon as possible.181.	The world has come to realize that there is an inseparable link between international security and economic justice and equality. There can be no genuine and lasting peace as long as gross inequalities and imbalances prevail. As we enter the new decade of the 1980s  we are very much aware that there has been no substantial progress towards the elimination of these inequities which aggravate the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries. Moreover  the world is still afflicted by a pervasive economic crisis and is experiencing a general sense of drift and uncertainty on major issues relating to international cooperation for development. There has been in recent years a growing awareness that the problems now besetting the world economy are of a structural nature  and that the measures taken to date by the international community have not been commensurate with the imperatives for structural change nor with the accelerated development of the developing countries. As a consequence  the world economy continues to show symptoms of inherent structural malfunction  which adversely affects the economies of the developing countries. The resurgence of protectionism has further compounded these difficulties  with negative implications for the pattern of international trade and development.â182.	With the exception of some aspects in certain fields  the North-South negotiations pursued in the various forums of the United Nations system to bring about structural change are either bogged down or moving at a frustratingly slow pace. It is now evident that no real progress has been made because of the absence of genuine political will on the part of a large majority of developed countries to engage in meaningful negotiations. This was clearly apparent during the ministerial meeting of the fifth session of UNCTAD held last May in Manila  the meetings of The Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy and the recently concluded session of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  where the developed countries displayed increasingly inflexible positions towards the legitimate demands of the developing countries.183.	In the face of these adverse trends and critical developments in the world economic situation  we should seek new initiatives and approaches in order to achieve concrete results on the fundamental issues relating to the establishment of the New International Economic Order. In this connexion the Secretary- General has rightly appealed for a new impetus in the North-South negotiations to dispel the present climate of uncertainty and disenchantment.184.	The proposal of the Group of 77 to launch a round of global and sustained negotiations on international co-operation for development at the special session of the General Assembly in 1980 constitutes an innovative and bold initiative to bring about a breakthrough in the present stalemate. My delegation wishes to reaffirm its conviction that this new approach should be action-oriented  and that the main issues involved should be dealt with in an integrated manner.185.	We also subscribe to the view that the global negotiations should not involve any interruption of the ongoing negotiations in other United Nations forums. Furthermore  there should be a close relationship between the preparations of the global negotiations and the completion of the work for the new international development strategy  as the proposed negotiations are designed to make a significant contribution towards the implementation of that strategy.186.	We see the new international development strategy as the principal instrument for achieving the objectives of the New International Economic Order  constituting a conceptual framework for the whole range of North-South dialogues. We must reaffirm our confidence in the concept of an international development strategy as a concrete commitment of the international community to establish a just and more equitable world economic order 187.	Having presented the views of my Government on major world problems  may I now touch briefly upon the efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the work of this Assembly. The growing number of problems discussed in the General Assembly bears testimony to the increasing importance of the United Nations and reflects the determination of the international community to settle its problems by means of constructive dialogue.188.	Conversely  these positive developments pose serious problems for the effective and efficient discharge of the work of the General Assembly  with adverse repercussions for the functioning of the Organization as a whole. In this regard  we welcome various efforts to rationalize the procedures and organization of the General Assembly. I am confident that these attempts at institutional changes and improvements will go a long way towards making the United Nations more effective as a global system for international cooperation.189.	From my account of our common efforts to deal with world problems and the role of the United Nations  it may have been noted that we have an undiminished and enduring faith in our Organization. All things considered  there is no viable alternative to the United Nations system in our efforts to build a new and better world  however far from perfect the United Nations may seem to its critics.190.	It is for this reason that Indonesia  which has benefited since its birth from the United Nations  has in its turn and within its limited means constantly supported United Nations programmes and efforts in our search for a more peaceful  just and better world. We have done this because  for better or for worse  we Member nations are the United Nations.191.	As we stand now at the threshold of a new decade  it is appropriate for us in this Organization to learn from the failures of the past and to take strength from its positive achievements in order to go forward in our quest for a more peaceful  prosperous and just world. The United Nationsâthat is  weâcannot afford to fail."
"62",3188,"IND",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is indeed an honour and a privilege to greet you on your unanimous election  because you bring to this high office not only your outstanding skills and rich experience  but also something of the idealism and high sense of morality that characterizes your country's role in international affairs.25.	It is also no mere formality when I express our great appreciation for the leadership provided by Mr. Lievano of Colombia as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. The zeal and ability he displayed in discharging his responsibilities has enhanced his reputation  as well as his country's prestige.26.	In the exemplary dedication to duty and the practical wisdom of our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  we have an assurance that the challenging tasks ahead will be met with faith and fortitude  vision and constructive statesmanship.27.	Our family of nations has grown as Saint Lucia  our youngest and newest Member  has joined us. We wish the people of Saint Lucia prosperity and assure them of our goodwill and co-operation in the responsibilities awaiting them.28.	India comes to this Assembly with the strength of a tradition which is more than 4 000 years old  dating from when our Vedic ancestors had the insight to declare; ""the soil is my mother; I am the son of the earth"". This was the germ of the concept of ""one world""  the unity of which was to be ensured by peace. This is why ""peace  peace and peace"" has been my country's constant invocation.29.	I stand here today conscious of this rich heritage and of its reflection in the continuing national consensus which prevails in the pursuit of international objectives. Independent India's policies and attitudes to international problems show a continuity and consistency of which we are proud.30.	Since the time  31 years ago  when India's first Foreign Minister and Prime Minister  Jawaharlal Nehru  declared in this Assembly that ""India adhered completely to the principles and purposes of the Charter'â  there has been in our expressions of support of the United Nations and its Charter every year a repetitive rhythm which should not be mistaken for ritual or formality. The United Nations unmistakably symbolizes the best balance between the right to independence and the compulsion to work together. It rep-resents a warning that we can survive only in good- neighbourliness. If international  problems have been aggravated at times during the 34-year career of this Organization  this is due to the fact that in our national perspectives we have overlooked the fact that we form one world and not 152 worlds of various sizes. Despite all the lessons of history  we are still bogged down in short-term problems and are still overlooking the fact that our long-term destinies are intertwined and must be safeguarded.31.	If we look back over the decade of the 1970s  which are now drawing to a close  we find repeated confirmation of the Tact that the world's political problems arise from the short-term perspectives of many of the powerful-nation States which virtually distort the long-term imperatives. If we still see recalcitrant imperialism  malevolent or defiant racism  persistent habits of intervention  manipulation  domination and even aggression  this is because there are forces trying to stem the tide of history. So many world-wide and regional problems are the result of the obdurate refusal to accept the logic of coexistence and co-operation.32.	This Assembly is meeting again after one more year and it can be seen that the world has been changing fast. The past year has not been more tranquil or less dangerous. The world continues to hang precariously between war and peace  development and stagnation  domination and justice. Many of the old myths have died -but not the belief in them. The time when the world order could be maintained through the strength of military establishments is over. While many still see military power as supreme  its political consequences often mean that it cannot be used. No doubt there is a fleeting intellectual realization that things have changed  but this has not kept pace with the formulation of foreign policy by important countries.33.	The days of an imperial role are gone; neither is there any scope for imperial management. Even the management of crises can no longer be left to a few great Powers  although they have an important responsibility. Countries may differ in power  wealth and beliefs  but the world community cannot be managed now without the voluntary participation and equitable involvement of the largest possible number of countries.34.	It is also clear that the leverage of the weaker countries is a factor to be reckoned with in the emerging international order. Military power may have remained concentrated in a few hands  but popular power  if one may use that term  has become more widely dispersed. Recent events have again shown that  given will power and determination  even a small Power can hold a big Power at bay. The strength of the non-aligned movement is really the collective leverage exerted by the weaker countries on the global scene. This collective leverage  reflected in the demand for a new international economic order  is in essence a call for the democratization of world power.35.	We are indeed in an era of increasing plurality. Just as the managerial revolution has replaced family management  the transformation of the world situation has brought about a diffusion of the power to shape and influence events. This requires a new awareness  a new approach and a new adjustment which would facilitate the evolution of a more just and equitable world order.36.	May I underline in this context the growing revolutionary significance of a factor that has been emerging over the last two decades in the United Nations. The fact that well over 90 Members of the United Nations have joined the non-aligned movement has affected a quiet revolution in the functioning of the international organization. This constitutes a guarantee against the misuse of the United Nations or for that matter  of any intergovernmental organization.37.	The fundamental problems of May arise from not accepting the natural and the inevitable. We have seen resistance and delay in the process of decolonization and the fulfilment of the will of all peoples for freedom and national emancipation. Even today  this important historical process is not complete. The war in VietNam arose from attempts to frustrate the national aspirations of the Vietnamese. We failed to recognize  and perhaps we still often deny in action if not in affirmation  the fact that each nation has the right to choose its own pattern or political system for social and economic fulfilment. Today  we see the vindication of the notion implicit in the first principles of the United Nations Charter: that differing ideological and socio-economic systems have to coexist. As an Indian  I cannot but recall that the principles of coexistence were first enunciated in the middle of the 1950s and enshrined ill the Declaration adopted by the African-Asian Conference  held at Bandung in 1955.38.	Detente was enthusiastically acclaimed by some  much wished for by many. But in its realization we find that the effects of the cold-war years have been effaced neither in the functioning of this Organization nor in the various regions of the world. There is even a danger of detenteâs becoming a facade behind which the role of the Organization stands reduced in the priorities of the great Powers and  paradoxically  regional wars and conflicts also flourish.39.	Surely  if detente means the mere normalization of bilateral relations among the great Powers  then the vast majority of members of the international community will have little interest in it. Though normalization among great Powers is essential  an honest detente has to be global and universal and this indeed is our goal.40.	It would also be wrong to assume that the process of even this limited detente is irreversible. The stalemate in the ratification of the treaty resulting from the second round of SALT negotiations  the deepening crisis in West Asia  the hardening of attitudes in relation to southern Africa  the polarized postures in Southeast Asia and the disturbing trend towards the formation of destabilizing political combinations are ominous portents.41.	Consequently  reinforcing the fabric of peace must remain the primary concern in our discussions. Progress on disarmament in all its various aspects has to be seen as the touchstone of our commitment to peace. Lasting world peace can stand only on the foundation of effective disarmament.42.	We must remind ourselves that the United Nations was established to save ""succeeding generations from the scourge of war."" For as long as nuclear stockpiles exist in the world  there is a definite threat of a nuclear holocaust. Nuclear war is possible through accident  miscalculation  misperception and impulsive or irrational behaviour under tension. The most urgent task facing humanity today is to delegitimize nuclear weapons  to dismantle the hierarchical international order that supports the present military system and to replace it by an alternative security system based on peaceful coexistence and the acceptance in practice of the equal sovereignty of all nations and of die right of each nation to choose its national and international policies.43.	The tenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  laid down a programme of action for nuclear disarmament. That programme consisted of steps for freezing the present nuclear arms race and for initiating reductions leading to the eventual elimination of all existing stockpiles of such weapons. It is a matter of deep regret that  despite the consensus behind that programme  there has been no progress towards its implementation. We are particularly concerned to note that the draft of the comprehensive test-ban treaty is not yet ready and the negotiations continue at a glacial pace. We strongly urge that the draft of the treaty be finalized without further delay.44.	We welcome second SALT treaty. But it is only a beginningâthough an important beginning  which must be formalized and implemented so that the world may move further towards real nuclear disarmament. At the same time we cannot but note with regret that that treaty does not incorporate any measure for the reduction of nuclear arsenals and that the growing and deadly sophistication of nuclear weaponry presents an ever greater danger to mankind.45.	Much is being said  and rightly  about the problem of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 1 think it would be pertinent to remember that it was India that brought this issue to the attention of the United Nations when  in 1964  it specifically asked for the inclusion in the agenda of an item entitled ""Non-proliferation of nuclear weapons"".  Our approach was based on the premise  born of bitter historical experience  that both horizontal and vertical proliferation was integral parts of the problem which needed to be dealt with as a whole. The General Assembly accepted this concept and resolution 2028 (XX) stated that:' 'The treaty should embody an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations of the nuclear and non-nuclear Powers"".46.	Unfortunately the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons concluded in 1968 deliberately sought to alter this concept. It addressed itself only to the aspect of horizontal proliferation  and if the Treaty has become an unworkable document  it is only because of this narrow and illogical approach. The protagonists have been trying to buttress their position by cartel- type arrangements and further discriminatory measures  such as the establishment of the so-called ""London Club"" of nuclear suppliers and the attempted imposition of full-scope safeguards  on the peaceful nuclear activities of non-nuclear-weapon States  something that the nuclear-weapon States are themselves not prepared to accept.47.	In a world where we now grapple with the task of evolving the methodology of a new international economic and political order based on justice and equity  it would be nothing short of anachronism for some Powers to play the role of barons and overlords in a system of nuclear feudalism. Such an attitude tends to make nonsense of national independence  equality of nations and the very concept of peaceful coexistence that is at the heart of the United Nations.â48.	It may be recalled that during the special session on disarmament held last year  India took two significant initiativesâone seeking the non-use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances   and the other calling for a suspension of nuclear-weapons testing pending a complete ban.8 We are gratified at the endorsement that the Assembly at its thirty-third session gave to those initiatives. We would urge the nuclear-weapon States on whom the primary responsibility lies to take meaningful steps in this direction.49.	One further initiative I have in mind is the dissemination of public knowledge and through it the creation of enhanced awareness and popular will against the use of nuclear weapons. Efforts to build world public opinion would assist the Governments concerned to turn away from the path of nuclear competition in the direction of practical measures for avoiding nuclear war. The United Nations has achieved significant success in the past in helping to rouse the conscience of mankind on a number of humanitarian issues  through a variety of special observances. Would it not be appropriate that this vital question  on which depends the future and fate of man himself  should receive similar attention? It is only fitting that the second Disarmament Decade should begin next year with measures aimed at mobilizing world opinion for international co-operative action to consolidate world peace. The year 1980 could be the commencement year for laying the foundations for eliminating for ever the danger of nuclear war.50.	If I have spoken at length on nuclear disarmament  it is because of the overwhelming fact that nuclear weapons  with their mind-boggling destructive capacity and their increasing degree of ""overkill""  constitute the greatest danger to mankind.51.	The relationship between disarmament and development has been stressed by many earlier speakers  and I need not dwell upon it at any great length. The point has often been made that the total annual world military expenditure  now exceeding $400 billion  is equivalent to half the combined gross domestic product of all the third-world countries. It exceeds the global government expenditure on education and is more than twice the expenditure on public health services. In a world seriously afflicted by an energy crisis  by inflation  unemployment  mass poverty and so forth  it is surely criminal that our dwindling resources should be expended in this extravagant fashion for military purposes. In this  the International Year of the Child  is it not revolting that one Trident submarine costs as much as would be needed for the schooling of 16 million children in developing countries? What is the legacy we shall be leaving for our children if we continue in the present insane manner in the name of safeguarding security?52.	Another problem that threatens civilized existence is the criminal combination of racist policies and colonial ambition that adds up to apartheid. A minority regime continues to violate openly and flagrantly the resolutions  decisions and sanctions of the United Nations and to subject the majority of the South African people to extreme forms of degradation  repression and torture. This situation is a reflection of the barrenness of our ritualistic reiteration of opposition to apartheid without our being able to ensure effective and comprehensive action against it. We have to mobilize the entire world community  without exception  if the opposition to this outrage is to be credible and effective. We should like to reaffirm our continued support for the measures to implement mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa. We also reiterate strongly our opposition to the economic and military collaborationâincluding nuclear collaborationâbetween certain Western countries and other States with South Africa.53.	In Namibia  the action of the General Assembly and the Security Council over the last decade and beyond constitutes a history of lost opportunities. This continuing inefficacy casts serious doubts on the prospects for success of the United Nations plan for Namibia.  SWAPO  for its part  has displayed a consistent willingness to accept United Nations-supervised elections for the transition to majority rule and independence in Namibia. As long as South Africa continues its illegal presence inside Namibia  a just and peaceful change-over would be well-nigh impossible. My delegation fully supports the adoption by the Security Council of concrete measures to compel South Africa to end its illegal occupation of Namibia.54.	In Zimbabwe  the liberation struggle continues at great cost in human suffering and ominous portents of escalation. The Rhodesia Constitutional Conference currently considering the problem of the transfer of power to the majority oscillates between hope and des-pair. We had welcomed the Lusaka agreement and had cautioned that its implementation should be a matter of time- bound urgency. We hope that a constitution acceptable to the Patriotic Front will be evolved in the Conference.55.	In West Asia  developments in relations between certain States should not obscure consideration of the deteriorating situation in the occupied Arab territories in southern Lebanon.56.	India believes that nothing but a comprehensive solution of the problem will bring about peace in the area. Central to this settlement is the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights  including the right to establish an independent State in their own homeland; the total and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem; and  finally  the right of all States in the region  including Arab Palestine  to live within secure borders. Full and equal participation of the PLO in any peace negotiations is a sine qua non for a final settlement. The growing threat to international peace and security resulting from Israeli policies and partial solutions can no longer be ignored  The continued Israeli acts of aggression in Lebanon also bear testimony to the Israelis' belligerent intentions.57.	It is also painful to note that Cyprus continues to suffer foreign occupation of a sizeable part of its territory. We welcome the 10-point agreement reached in May 1979 and we urge the parties concerned to recognize each other's legitimate rights and interests and to display a spirit of mutual accommodation. Let us hope that the talks will lead to a just and peaceful resolution of the problems between the two communities  within the framework of the unity  sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence and non-alignment of Cyprus.58.	The South Asian region  earlier plagued by war and dissension  is now freer from tensions. We have been able to respond to each other's interests and concerns in a spirit of accommodation. My country feels a sense of satisfaction at the resolution of some intractable problems. The improved environment provides scope for greater contacts and co-operation which will benefit the countries of the region. We rejoice that at last the entire subcontinent is now committed to the principles and policies of non-alignment and of peaceful coexistence. All this should augur well for peace and stability in the region. If  however  I advert to Jammu and Kashmir  which is an integral part of India  it is because there was reference to it by the foreign affairs adviser to the President of Pakistan in his statement to this Assembly on 1 October. We have repeatedly made it clear that United Nations resolutions have ceased to be relevant and the Simla Agreement holds the field. So the issue has to be bilaterally settled in accordance with the Simla Agreement.59.	We are happy that in the region of South-East Asia  economic co-operation and efforts to establish a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality on the initiative of the Association of South-East Asian Nations have been making progress in spite of the many pressures operating in the area.60.	We had thought that the retreat of foreign troops from Viet Nam over four years ago would usher in a new era of peace and co-operation in Indo-China and in the whole region of South-East Asia. That expectation was  unfortunately  short-lived. Foreign intervention and foreign involvement in Indo-China continued in new forms distorting the entire situation in that strategic area. Distrust and suspicion are rife in the region  as is the apprehension that great Powers may become involved. In consequence  the countries of Indo-China have not been allowed to settle down in peace to the reconstruction and development of their economies.61.	The Sino-Viet Nam border remains tense  and there is no peace in Kampuchea as yet. We ardently hope that the tension between China and Viet Nam will not be allowed to escalate  and we believe that boundary questions and other problems between two great neighbouring Asian countries can and ought to be resolved through peaceful and friendly negotiations.62. 	The brave people of Kampuchea  with whom we in India have age-old cultural ties  have been subjected to untold misery and deprivation. The present situation demands statesmanship from all parties  so that peace  stability  mutual confidence and co-operation may be restored  and so that respect for the personality and independence of every State can be strictly observed.63.	There have been some indications that at least the humanitarian problems could be mitigated through goodwill and a constructive approach. We should like to congratulate the Secretary-General for the success of the United Nations-sponsored Geneva conference on the Indo-China refugees.  It is gratifying to note that since that conference the exodus of refugees has dropped to a trickle.64.	The spectre of famine  however  looms large over Kampuchea. We welcome the recent understanding for extending international emergency relief and assistance. India would be ready to make its modest contribution in this regard.65.	India is firmly committed to the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean  as envisaged in the Declaration of the General Assembly. The increase  over the years  in great-Power military presence in the Indian Ocean and the further strengthening of military bases  such as Diego Garcia  are a matter of serious concern. On the most important issues pertaining to the implementation of the Declaration  the majority of the littoral and hinterland States were able to adopt a common position at the meeting held in New York in July this year.66.	We invite the participation of all permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users of the Indian Ocean in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean with a view to convening a conference on the Indian Ocean.67.	It was a disappointment for us when the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States for the reduction of their military presence in the Indian Ocean were abruptly suspended in March 1978. We welcome the agreement reached at the Vienna summit to resume the dialogue and urge early and meaningful negotiations.68.	In the field of human rights  it is immensely important to realize that  in the ultimate analysis  individual human rights must rest on the foundation of collective human rights. National liberation creates the framework for the latter  and only after achieving it can one think of ensuring human rights for individuals. The stability of newly gained freedom is essential for ensuring socio-economic change and for the widening and deepening of the ambit of human rights. These need to be properly institutionalized  for only thus will there be a safeguard against their possible abuse  suppression or total eclipse.69.	The present world economic order continues to follow the rule that to him who hath even more shall be given. The two United Nations Development Decades  one of the 1960s and the other of the 1970s  and a series of protracted negotiations  have proved sterile exercises  belying the hopes that had been raised that inequity between nations need not be an inexorable law and that  for reasons as much economic as ethical  the rich should assist the poor.70.	We are now on the threshold of the third United Nations Development Decade  covering the 1980s  and of the special session of the United Nations which will be held next year. Despite the bleakness of past experience  we must not miss this opportunity to impart a momentum to the negotiations for establishing a new economic order. Among the vital requirements of such an order  is an international trading system that would be more responsive to the needs of developing countries. Multilateral trade negotiations portend nothing more than disappointment for the developing countries. Protectionism by advanced countries grows unabated and has assumed new forms. The fifth session of UNCTAD concluded in Manila without coming to grips with the issues that relate to the structure of the present economic order. The special session must therefore address itself squarely to the task of dealing with basic structural issues if it is to have any meaning. The current imbalance; the dependence and external vulnerability of the developing countries; the urgent need to make a perceptible dent in the worst aspects of mass povertyâthese are a few of the issues that the developed countries need to look at from a fresh perspective. Without giving up existing commitments  they will have to conceive new forms of resource transfers  which can ensure that responsibility is shared and which are capable of leading us to greater common prosperity. Even though the main thrust towards development should come from the developing countries themselves  the developed world in its own enlightened self-interest must realize that its prosperity is best ensured if the world at large can meet its basic minimum requirements  thus forming a large and growing market for developed countries.71.	The disparity in the dissemination of scientific knowledge and technological know-how in the world is one of the basic causes for the widening gap between the developed and developing nations. The United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  recently concluded at Vienna  was successful in focusing attention on this question and in evolving an agreed plan of action at the international level.  We hope that the new Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development will be able to promote agreement on adequate and sustained measures for the transfer of technology to the developing countries.72.	The developing countries expect to  and indeed must  participate fully in the world decision-making processes. Having abandoned  with the earlier decades  the framework that was formulated for appraising performance and ensuring joint responsibility of both the North and the South  we have yet to agree on a draft of the preamble of a new international development strategy. We run the risk of going to the special session marking the commencement of the third development decade without an agreed strategy  jeopardizing the outcome of the Decade itself.73.	Similar mechanisms to promote international accountability are required in specific areas of multilateral economic functioning particularly within UNCTAD and UNIDO. One of the principal tasks at the forthcoming Third General Conference of UNIDO to be held in New Delhi in 1980 will be to equip the agency with an effective mechanism to examine and monitor the implications of the Lima target of 25 per cent of the world's manufacturing output as the share of developing countries.74.	Finally   the developing countries must not forget the imperatives of collective self-reliance as a major component of the new international development strategy. In fact  it could well provide the special session in 1980 its principal theme. When meshed together  the unutilized complementarities and the surplus resources of developing countries give the developing countries enhanced bargaining power with the developed world 75.	India has  at the recent Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which met in Havana  taken a number of initiatives in fostering collective self-reliance. We have  with Bangladesh  proposed the establishment of a food security system for developing countries. Though a developing country which has had to feed an immense population  we in India today are in a position to make a modest contribution to any agreed international system of food security that may be evolved. It is time that the world  and especially the advanced nations  realized that food security is even more important than military security in maintaining peace and stability in the world.76.	Similarly  the Havana Conference approved the proposal to study the possibility of establishing a project development facility. We hope that the facility would become operational by the end of 1980. India  with extensive experience in technology relevant to developing countries  is willing to collaborate with others in setting up facilities for research and training in priority areas  geared specially to their needs. We would be glad to share our experience and welcome their participation.77.	The policy guidelines on reinforcing mutual solidarity recently adopted in Havana are a welcome expression of the political will of the non-aligned and other developing countries to co-operate among themselves to meet their minimum needs and emergency requirements. The guidelines  which are not confined to oil  have wide implications of a long-term nature  since they cover all primary commodities and raw materials. It is our sincere hope that these policy guidelines will be expeditiously translated into concrete commitments.78.	Another problem which has bedevilled the evolution of a just and equitable world economic order has been the energy problem. Half of India's total import bill  for instance  is now accounted for by oil imports and the latest round of price increases has further raised the burden by a crushing $1.4 billion per year. Even more critical has been the problem of securing minimum requirements of petroleum from the world market  where we have to compete with the affluent nations.79.	I need hardly emphasize the enormous significance of energy in the context of developing economies  characterized as they are by limited substitution possibilities for priority uses such as transport  by the high capital intensity of alternative energy resources and by the problems inherent in reducing a level of consumption which is already at the bare and essential minimum. Clearly these countries are particularly vulnerable to the world oil situation. Is it not unconscionable that out of the total world consumption of 60 million barrels a day the United States  Europe  Japan and Canada should together consume 45 million? Or that in the year 2000 the per capita daily consumption of oil will be 62 barrels in North America  32 for each European  10 for those living in the oil-producing countries and only some 4 barrels for the rest.80.	All the developing countries should have a right  indeed a special right  to secure a fair share in the world consumption of energy and other raw materials.81.	In the ultimate analysis  the question involves the principle of equity. The core of the present resource crisis is the attempt by developed countries to pre-empt the bulk of the world's natural resources in order to maintain their current pattern of consumption and continue their existing life-styles. The disaster that profligate consumption is leading to calls for a change in fife-styles in developed countries. Such a change is also necessitated by the imbalance between material and spiritual growth that has prompted many in the West to turn to the philosophy of the Orient in their quest for inner peace and harmony. Echoing the present predicament of the mature industrial or post-industrial societies  T. S. Eliot spoke of "" . . .the torment of desire unsatisfied and the greater torment of desire satisfied"".82.	The political  economic and social order in our world has to be refashioned not only with reference to ourselves but for the sake of the future of our children. Appropriately  the observance of the International Women's Year and the International Year of the Child has coincided with the efforts at promoting a new inter-national economic order. With the mother and the child at the core of our thoughts we obviously cannot concentrate on a political order based on power and exploitation and a development process which is myopic and inequitable. In fact  if the process is to begin with the child in the mother's womb  as it ought to  we have to work for the creation of a total environment which would ensure equality at birth to every child and provide for his development throughout the formative period. The symbolic significance of observing a particular year as dedicated to a particular cause can only find real meaning if the problem is considered in a larger perspective. Standing on the threshold of the 1980s  we shall have to begin the desired development process now.83.	Is it not a pity that we assemble here year after year to do little more than patch up our petty quarrels and pay lip service to some lofty ideas and principles? It is time we ceased to concern ourselves merely with the past and the present and began to look to the future with the spirit of collective creativity which must be the hallmark of the United Nations system. The United Nations has to be not merely the engineer of truce but rather the architect of a new eraâan era that could see the rise of the new man of the twenty-first century. To do this  we need to help the United Nations to extend the frontiers of its perception. The time to do so is now."
"63",3234,"IRL",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I wish to congratulate you on your election as President of this session of the Assembly. This marks the Assembly's recognition of your unique contribution to its work over the years and the regard of the international community for the constructive role played by the United Republic of Tanzania in world affairs.2.	I am honoured to have the opportunity today of addressing this Assembly as President-in-Office of the European Community and of European Political Co-operation.3.	A world-wide political system of independent nations has come into being since this Organization was founded  and each year the Member States come together in this universal forum to debate the problems of our global society; for mankind now sees itself increasingly as one.4.	Our task now is to order our affairs globally in a manner that measures up to the economic and political objectives of a global society. This requires that we come to grips both with the problems of inequity within the world economy and with the need to resolve conflict and tension without resort to war.5.	Injustices of which we may have previously been only partly aware must  in a global society  be redressed  if dangerous division and dissension are to be avoided. Conflicts which in the past could be seen as local and limited now have an impact on all of us.6.	The need for wisdom and understanding in the management of human affairs is clear  as we face these clangers and come to see the limits of our resources and our environment. We have the framework in which to apply this wisdom. The United Nations and its family oforganizations provide a forum in which interests can be accommodated and reconciled if we accept the implications of our interdependence.7.	What is needed is a determination to make a full use of the opportunities thus provided to act together in the interests of the human family. This means seeking to resolve actual or potential conflict  to organize the world economy more equitably  to relieve human suffering and to promote respect for human rights. On behalf of the nine countries for which I speak  I repeat that we are actively committed to the United Nations as the ""centre for harmonizing the actions of nations"" envisaged by the Charter.8.	We nine countries  as member States of the European Community  feel that we exemplify in a particular way the aim of ""harmonizing the actions of nations"" because our Community grew out of the determination to make a new beginning in a continent so often torn by war. In building that Community we do not seek to impose a static and rigid order on our diversity  but rather  be a slow and patient process of growth  to move towards a closer union between our peoples.9.	Two developments in the past year illustrate this process. First  our peoples have voted together in the first direct elections to send representatives to a common parliament. This was  I believe  the first such international election in history. It is important to us because it is evidence of our commitment to democracy and because it involves the citizens of the Community in a new and more direct way in shaping its future. Secondly  a decision was taken to enlarge our Community further. Greece signed the treaty by which it will become the tenth member in 1981; negotiations are continuing for the accession of Portugal and Spain; and we are  of course  continuing to develop our relations as a community with other associated States in our region.10.	It is on behalf of this growing Community and its member Statesâa Community where old enemies have become friends and partners in a movement towards closer integrationâthat I speak to you today in this wider world forum. We accept fully the responsibilities that go with our economic weight and we seek to develop with the rest of the world a relationship of friendship and co-operation that will take full account of the interdependent nature of our global society.11.	The world economic situation is extremely difficult. For 1979  the Community is likely to register a reduced economic growth rate of 3 per cent and in 1980 this may fall to 2 per cent. We have been less successful than we hoped in dealing with inflation and unemployment. In facing up to this state of affairs  the Community looks not only to its own interests but also to international economic well-being.12.	Last December the European Council agreed to establish the European monetary system. This was a means of bringing about a greater measure of monetary stability within the Community. But it was also intended to have a stabilizing effect on international economic and monetary relations in the interests of industrial and developing countries alike. The adjustments  made during the past week-end  took place within the rules of the system and proved that the system works effectively.13.	The European Council's determination in Strasbourg to frame new energy guidelines for the Community to deal with present and future needs made a significant contribution to the outcome of the Tokyo Economic Summit in June and more particularly to the adoption of energy-saving measures and plans for developing new forms of energy. At the same time  the Community is looking forward with particular interest to the forthcoming United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy. The Community has also noted with great interest Mr. Waldheim's proposal for a world energy institute.14.	On trade questions we have opposed protectionist tendencies and we have confirmed our commitment to an open system of international trade. I would recall that  despite the recession  the Community has consistently increased its imports from developing countries especially imports of manufactured goods.15.	In the view of the Community  the recent successful conclusion of the multilateral trade negotiations held under the auspices of GATT  is a decisive step towards the greater liberalization of international trade. The substantial tariff and non-tariff concessions made by the Community and its partners  which were directed to the developing countries to a significant extent  should encourage those countries to participate more fully in the GATT system. The Community has always supported legal recognition of the right of developing countries  and especially of the least developed  to special and differential treatment Moreover  in the post-multilateral trade negotiations phase  the Community will participate actively in the matters developing countries on trade matters.16.	The Community's relations with the developing countries have intensified considerably in recent years  reflecting the growing interdependence of the world economy. Through its own development cooperation programmes and through its involvement in the global dialogue on international cooperation for development  the community has committed itself to the goal of establishing a more just and equitable international economic order  We are determined to continue the promotion of close and harmonious relations with the developing countries  taking fully into account their urgent need for economic and social development. We attach great importance to the work towards a new international development strategy for the 1980s. In the same spirit at the recent session of the committee of the whole established under general assembly resolution 32/174  the community undertook to be ready to consider constructively any proposals which may be made with a view to promoting a more effective and fruitful dialogue. 17- It is in this context that the Community and its member States are studying the proposal of the Group of 77 concerning global negotiations relating to international economic co-operation for development. Numerous questions on the precise implications of this initiative remain to be clarified. The answers to these questions would considerably assist us in our consideration of this important initiative.18.	It is understandable perhaps that developing countries should express dissatisfaction at what must seem to them to be the slow pace of developments in the North-South dialogue. The widespread conditions of hunger and deprivation which still prevail among large sections of the population in many developing countries are a particular source of concern and must continue to receive urgent and priority attention from the entire international community. Following the Ottawa Con-ference 1 the Community reaffirms its commitment to fight the dramatic problem posed by world hunger by facilitating and encouraging food production in developing countries and by taking the necessary measures to accelerate the implementation of the various food aid programmes adopted by the Community.19.	None of the issues of the dialogue  however  lends itself to easy solution  while many which are structural in nature can only be gradually pursued. Nevertheless  the Community does not feel that the achievements in the dialogue to date can be lightly dismissed. For example  we welcome the March 1979 compromise on the fundamental elements of the Common Fund. It is also our sincere belief that the results of the fifth session of UNCTAD and the multilateral trade negotiations contain worth-while advances for developing countries.20. The Community is also pursuing its own development co-operation in favour of all developing countries  particularly the least developed. Recently  the Community concluded negotiations with the African  Caribbean and Pacific States on a successor agreement to the first Lome Convention  the provisions of whichâ particularly on trade  STABEX and financial and technical co-operationâcontain appreciable improvements on the old one. We in the Community believe that this is a worthy successor. It retains and consolidates the progressive features of the first Convention and introduces a number of new elements based on the experience we have gained and designed to respond to the specific needs of our partners the African  Caribbean and Pacific States.21. The future holds great promise. In the immediate term  however  the entire international community races an immense challenge and each of us must shoulder a fair share of the burden. The Community is ready for facilitating agreement in the field of disarmament and arms control. The first substantive meetings of the reformed and reactivated disarmament bodies  agreed upon in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  took place this year. The nine countries participated actively in the first substantive meeting of the Disarmament Commission. This meeting agreed by consensus on the elements of a comprehensive programme of disarmament and this will now be referred to the Committee on Disarmament. A number of the nine countries are members of the new Committee on Disarmament and they took an active part in its work. We welcome the intensive work which has taken place in the Committee  for example on questions relating to chemical weapons and to so-called negative security assurances.23.	We also welcome the signature at Vienna on 18 June by President Carter and President Brezhnev of the recent Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. We strongly hope that this will give a new impetus to the detente process and make a positive contribution to the atmosphere in which international disarmament negotiations are pursued. We look forward to the early entry into force of the agreement and the prospects for further reductions of nuclear weapons afforded by the continuation of the process involved in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] between these countries.24.	The nine members of the Community are deeply committed to the continuation and expansion of inter-national detente and we have played our full part in the process of relaxation of tension and the development of co-operation in Europe initiated by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Final Act of the Conference  signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975  is a unique document in that it covers not only relations between States but also those between individuals and between Governments and individuals. As its provisions are put into effect an improvement in these relations becomes apparent  which in turn reduces tensions in Europe. The first review session of the Conference  held at Belgrade in 1977 and 1978  afforded the signatory States an opportunity to review progress made in this respect. The nine countries are preparing for the second review session to be held in Madrid next year in a constructive spirit and in the hope that the meeting will be able to record an improved level of implementation of the provisions of the Final Act in all the signatory States.25.	The nine countries continue to hope that it will be possible to achieve in the Middle East the just  lasting and comprehensive settlement to which this Assembly is overwhelmingly committed. They believe that such a settlement must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  applied in all their parts and on all fronts. It must also be based on the principles set out by them in their statement on 29 June 1977 and on several occasions subsequently.26.	These principles are: first  the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force; secondly  the need for Israel to end the territorial occupation which it has maintained since the conflict of 1967; thirdly  respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of all States in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; and fourthly  recognition that  in the establishment of a just and lasting peace  account must be taken of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.27.	The nine countries emphasize that it is essential that all parties to the negotiation accept the right of all States in the area to live within secure and recognized boundaries with adequate guarantees. Equally  of course  it is essential that there be respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. These include the right to a homeland and the right  through its representatives  to play its full part in the negotiation of a comprehensive settlement.28.	Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  together with the principles I have mentioned  taken as a whole  set the essential framework for a peace settlement. In the view of the nine countries it is necessary that they be accepted by all those involved- including the Palestine Liberation Organizationâas the basis for negotiation of a comprehensive settlement in which all the parties will play their full part.29.	Such a settlement would win the endorsement and support of the international community and would meet the legitimate rights and interests of all parties. This includes Israel  which is entitled to exist at peace within secure boundaries that are accepted and adequately guaranteed  and the Palestinian people  who are entitled  within the framework set by a peace settlement  to exercise their right to determine their own future as a people.30.	The nine members of the Community recognize of course that such a settlement is not easy to achieve. But they believe it must be the continuing aim of the international community to promote it. They are convinced that such a comprehensive settlement would bring peace at last to the region; and they recall that they have already expressed their readiness to consider participating in guarantees in the framework of the United Nations.31.	The past year has seen some major developments to which our countries  in view of their close connexions with the region; are particularly sensitive. One of these was the signature on 26 March of the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel. In their declaration of 26 March last   they stated their position on these agreements.32.	Since the signature of these agreements  which the nine countries see as a correct application of the principles of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) as far as Egyptian-Israeli relations are concerned  there has been progress towards improved relations between Egypt and Israel and there have been withdrawals of Israeli forces in Sinai. The nine countries note these recent developments and recall that one of the basic requirements of a comprehensive settlement is an end to the territorial occupation which Israel has maintained since the conflict of 1967. The nine countries will continue to follow the situation closely and will seek in every way they can to advance the aim of a comprehensive and lasting peace settlement involving all parties and dealing with all of the fundamental issues I have mentioned.33.	It follows that the nine countries must view with the greatest regret any action or statement which aggravates the present situation or places an obstacle in the way of a peace settlement. Accordingly  they strongly deplore continued acts of violence by any of those involved. They are opposed to the Israeli Government's policy of establishing settlements in occupied territories in contravention of international law; and they cannot accept claims by Israel to sovereignty over occupied territories  since this would be incompatible with resolution 242 (1967). The security of Israel  which they consider essential  can be guaranteed  and the legitimate rights of the Palestinians given effect  within the framework of a comprehensive settlement.34.	The nine states are fully aware  too  of the importance of the question of Jerusalem to all parties. They know that an acceptable solution to this problem will be vital to an over-all settlement on the basis I have indicated. They consider  in particular  that any agreement on the future status of Jerusalem should guarantee free access by all to the Holy Places; and they do not accept any unilateral moves which claim to change the status of the city.35.	The problem of Lebanon is clearly related to the larger problem of the Middle East as a whole. The nine members of the Community have frequently reaffirmed their support for Lebanon's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. They did so most recently in a statement issued by the nine Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Dublin on 11 September. This statement also recognized the courageous efforts made by the Lebanese Government to promote the security of its people and the restoration of its authority over the whole of its territory.36.	Violence has none the less continued in several parts of Lebanon  as is clear from current news reports. The members of the Community recognize that there has been some improvement in the situation  particularly in the south of the country  since the recent meeting of the Security Council requested by the Government of Lebanon. They are concerned however about the constant harassment of UNIFIL  of which certain members of the Community form part  and about the difficulties which have been placed in its way as it attempts to fulfil its mandate. They are particularly disturbed about the military and financial aid from outside Lebanon given to those who have made it difficult for the UNIFIL to carry out its mandate. They call on all parties to give full support to UNIFIL and to respect the decisions of the Security Council.37.	The Community remains convinced that United Nations peace-keeping operations can play a particularly useful role in helping to prevent violence between parties to a conflict  thus facilitating a peaceful settlement. Its members are ready to contribute to such operations in the future  as they have done in the past.38.	A problem which is particularly close to us in the Community is that of the intercommunal conflict on the island of Cyprus. When the 10-point communique agreed to between President Kyprianou and Mr. Denktas  was published   following their meeting with the United Nations Secretary-General on 18 and 19 May last  the members of the Community were hopeful that this heralded a break-through in the stalemate in the intercommunal talks which has existed for so long. In particular  we welcomed the commitment by the two parties to carry out intercommunal talks in a continuous and sustained manner  while avoiding any delay  and to abstain from any action which might jeopardize the outcome of the talks. It was with considerable regret that we noted the suspension of the talks within such a short time of the resumption on 15 June. We continue to believe that the best means for achieving a solution to the question is to be found within the framework of the intercommunal talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General  whose efforts to further the progress between the parties concerned we have consistently supported.39.	Africa has witnessed in the past year a number of developments which have been the focus of world concern. We should not underestimate the dangers arising from political tensions and from the economic difficulties that confront many African States.40.	The Charter recognizes the possibilities for action at the regional level. The countries of Africa have come together in a number of forums to co-operate and to seek a common approach to African problems. In this context  the Organization of African Unity has a preeminent role. Our nine countries  for their part  share the view that African problems can best be resolved through African solutions. They reject the concept of the establishment of spheres of influence in Africa by outside Powers. The nine do not themselves seek to impose their political and social system on Africa; rather than reaffirm their desire to co-operate to the fullest extent possible with Africa in promoting its economic development in a spirit of partnership.41.	The situation in southern Africa remains a source of deep concern.42.	The oppressive system of apartheid in South Africa is of particular concern. The nine members of the Community condemn and reject this system of institutionalized racism  which is an insult to human dignity and which denies to the majority of the people the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. They reaffirm that the purported independence of so-called ""homelands"" such as Transkei  Bophuthatswana and Venda is a false solution to the problems of apartheid. The nine have repeatedly stated their belief that a peaceful future for South Africa necessitates the creation of a society which permits the full participation of all the inhabitants of South Africa in the political  social and economic life of their country. They believe that change in South Africa is as inevitable as it is essential. They note and welcome the internal debate on this subject within South Africa  and they hope that this debate may lead to concrete and positive results. The nine countries have sought to encourage this process of change in a number of ways  including the adoption of a code of conduct for all their firms with subsidiaries  branches  or representation in South Africa.  They will continue their efforts to promote the process of peaceful change in order to bring about the ending of the system of apartheid and the establishment of a society with freedom and justice for all. They reaffirm their commitment to use the collective weight of the European Community to influence South Africa to this end.43.	On Namibia  one cannot help but feel disappointed at the very slow progress in resolving the remaining difficulties in the way of a peaceful settlement. The nine members have supported the efforts made by the Secretary-General  the five Western States and the front-line States to implement the plan adopted by the United Nations  and they have rejected unreservedly ail efforts to impose an ""internal settlement"" in Namibia. Such a settlement would not gain international recognition and would merely delay the day when the people of Namibia achieve genuine self- determination. In May this year  in this Assembly   the nine States again expressed their grave concern at the lack of progress and drew the attention of the South African Government to the consequences that could result. They urgently requested the South African Government to accept without delay the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and to permit the deployment of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. This remains their view.44.	Since the Assembly's meetings in May  efforts to reach agreement have been renewed. The outcome will depend on the political will of the parties involvedâ particularly South Africa which has a responsibility in this regardâto overcome the points of difficulty which do not justify the failure to implement the United Nations plan. Accordingly  the nine countries express the earnest hope that all concerned will now agree to the very early implementation of the plan in the light of the arrangements now being discussed. This will avoid the very grave consequences of failure and secure great benefits for the people of Namibia and for all the people of Southern Africa.45.	The nine members of the Community  in their statement on Rhodesia of 11 September  welcomed the understanding reached by the Commonwealth Heads of Government in Lusaka and the action of the United Kingdom Government in inviting the parties to attend the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London. They trust that this will make possible a solution to the conflict on the basis of genuine majority rule. Continued bloodshed will only serve to prolong the suffering of all the people of Zimbabwe. They therefore reaffirm their support for a peaceful settlement acceptable to all the parties involved. Once such a settlement has been achieved the Community is ready to play its part in assisting the development of independent Zimbabwe.46.	The attention of the world has been focused during the past year on the suffering and death caused by large-scale movements of refugees in South-East Asia. This problem does not exist in isolationâit is a consequence of the instability and widespread unrest in the region. I have already outlined on 20 July at the Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia  in Geneva  the views of the Community on the refugee problem. We believe that everyone should enjoy the right to leave his country freely and re-enter freely  but should not be obliged to leave because of fear or because conditions have been made intolerable. We note with satisfaction the measures agreed at the Geneva meeting and the proposed expansion of the programme previously established by the Government of Viet Nam and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We hope that all concerned will honour the understandings given there. Our Governments await with interest the report of the Secretary-General on the situation and on the implementation of the action plan agreed at Geneva. We are well aware  however  that the measures already agreed are only partial remedies. The problem of refugees can best be resolved if there is a settlement of the wider problems of the region.47.	The nine members of the European Community are also gravely concerned about the situation in Cambodia. It is a matter of utmost urgency that effective humanitarian relief be given to the people of that country. We are ready to support in appropriate ways relief efforts which are already under way  or which may be launched in the future. If such relief efforts are to be effective and to benefit the Cambodian population  they should be properly supervised  independently administered  and directed to help ail those in need.48.	A solution of the political problem of Cambodia is essential to the peace and stability of South-East Asia as a whole. Any such solution must  in our view  be based on an independent Cambodia with a genuinely representative Government  free from any foreign military presence  maintaining friendly relations with all the countries of the region  and having the benefit of international assistance for reconstruction.49.	Our Charter reaffirms faith in ""the dignity and worth of the human person"". To fulfil this we must continue our efforts to promote respect for and observance of human rights. Since the adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the effort to promote these rights has had mixed results.50.	On the one hand  human rights have been defined in an extensive  if not yet complete  series of international instruments. An ever-increasing awareness of these concepts has developed. No State can now hope to avoid criticism where gross and consistent violations occur.51.	On the other hand  the gap between ideal and reality is  too often  distressingly large. Millions suffer from hunger and oppression. Torture  though few admit responsibility  is still practised. Individuals are still imprisoned or exiled because of their political views. Others disappear without trace. Executions take place  apparently without full respect for judicial process.52.	We  in the Community  see all human rights and fundamental freedoms as interdependent. Political and economic rights are not in contradiction. They reinforce and complement each other. Freedom from want without freedom from torture and ill-treatment is not enough. Likewise  the right to participate as a citizen in the political process cannot be easily exercised by the starving. The realization of each category of rights needs to be vigorously pursued.53.	While human rights have been defined  it has not so far proved easy to devise means by which they may be safeguarded. Our nine countries believe that agreed procedures accepted by States under existing instruments should be fully and effectively used. A continued international dialogue is needed on ways and means of securing greater respect for human rights. Further progress can be made in regional organizations. We will continue to contribute actively to the debate and to seek support for proposals to promote respect for human rights and for their implementation.54.	I should now like  as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland  to touch on a number of issues of particular concern to us in Ireland.55.	We in Ireland have fully supported the development by the United Nations of peace-keeping forces as a practical means of defusing tension. Peace-keeping operations are by their nature of a temporary character. If they are to be successful in reducing tension  they require  as the Secretary-General has pointed out in his report on the work of the Organization  the co-operation of the parties concerned. Peacekeeping operations are no substitute for a political solution; the need remains to seek political solutions actively.56.	As a small nation  Ireland has never had any ambition to involve itself directly in local or regional conflicts elsewhere in the world. We have recognized the value of international involvement in peace-keeping and have contributed actively to it for over 20 years. We have participated in the effort to improve the peacekeeping capacity of the United Nations and to ensure the equitable sharing of the cost.57.	Ireland at present has a contingent with UNIFIL  and some men with UNFICYP and UNTSO. I have already indicated the concern of the nine countries about developments in the Lebanon and the difficulties faced there by UNIFIL. These difficulties have been the subject of frequent consideration by the Security Council over the past year  and on two occasions Ireland felt obliged to express its concern in statements to the Council.58.	A particular concern to my Government has been the harassment of UNIFIL by the de facto forces  which have been assisted by Israel  which prevented the full deployment of the Force in the first instance  and which continue to encroach on the territory held by UNIFIL. The situation thus created has been compounded by the efforts of armed elements to infiltrate and to establish themselves in the UNIFIL area. This has led to serious incidents and casualties. Even as I speak these difficulties continue. I hope that all concerned will respect the cease-fire and assist the Force in achieving its objectives. They should reflect carefully on the possible consequences of any failure to do so.59.	I would wish to express my appreciation for the courage and restraint shown by the men who participate  under the expert direction of the Force Commander and the Secretary-General  in a Force which  as the Secretary-General has pointed out ""is performing an absolutely essential task of conflict control in one of the most sensitive and explosive parts of the world"" [ibid.].60.	I would endorse the appeal of the Secretary- General to Member States that have not paid their contributions to reconsider their position  and I hope that ways may be found to improve the financial position in the coming months. My country is naturally concerned that those contributing to this difficult operation are not fully reimbursed for the extra costs they incur.61.	But a commitment to peace is not enough. It must be paralleled by co-operation which helps the developing countries to provide for their peoples the basic conditions for the enjoyment of peace. The Irish Government is committed to co-operation with some of the least developed countries and to sharing the knowledge we have acquired in our own process of development.62.	Although we are still short of the target set by the United Nations  we have doubled our allocation to development co-operation in the last two years and hope to maintain this momentum. In our co-operation programmes we hope we can help to meet some of the fundamental needs of our partner countries  particularly in areas where we may have specific skills and experience to offer.63.	The United Nations is an act of faith in mankind's ability to resolve even the most intractable conflicts through dialogue and negotiation  respect for the rule of law and a common dedication to peace. It is in this spirit also  with an overriding commitment to peaceful processes  that my Government approaches the Northern Ireland conflict  a problem of the deepest and most urgent concern to us.64.	The Northern Ireland conflict continues to exact an intolerable and mounting toll of innocent lives and to cause massive physical destruction. The indirect effects of the conflict are also severe  They are evident in the deterioration in the quality of life and in lost opportunities for economic development. Habits of lawlessness are becoming ingrained  and the outlook for young people in Northern Ireland is blighted because they cannot look forward to a future free from recurring violence. There is an urgent need to create the conditions for peace in Northern Ireland  and the Irish Government is ready to give the utmost co-operation in this task.65.	We recognize  as have all Irish Governments since the foundation of the State  that the only way in which this can be achieved is through peaceful means and by consent. Violence anywhere in Ireland is an act of aggression against the Irish people as a whole and must be dealt with as such. Throughout Ireland there is deep anger and outrage at the repeated atrocities of a callous few. Among their victims have been eminent statesmen and young children  and they have shown that they will shrink from no crime in their deliberate campaign of provoking polarization and confrontation. The Irish Government is committing its full resources to protect the basic human right of every person to life and security against terrorism and to defend the political process against the usurpation of a ruthless minority. We have passed and implemented stringent legislation to meet this threat and to provide that those who perpetrate violence in any part of Ireland may be made answerable before the courts for their crimes 66.	Our expenditure on security has been increased to the point where the direct cost of countering violence emanating from Northern Ireland now represents a heavier economic burden per head of all population than is the case in the United Kingdom. There is the closest co-operation between the Irish and British security forces in dealing with violence  and our two Governments consult constantly to enhance the effectiveness of the effort against this common threat.67.	But a common effort is also needed to eradicate the root-cause of violence and the factors which prompt its growth and persistence in Northern Ireland. As in all such conflicts  the conquest of violence in Northern Ireland cannot be achieved by security means alone. Political failure  economic and social deprivation and the lack of respect and trust between the two communities are all factors which are exploited by the men of violence in a deliberate strategy of hatred and confrontation. The Irish Government believes that it is necessary to counter that strategy by a resourceful  consistent and imaginative strategy of reconciliation. The determination of the men of violence to impede progress and destroy each impulse for reconciliation must be met by an even stronger resolution on the part of Governments and constitutional parties to work out a political solution based on respect for the aspirations and concerns of both communities in Northern Ireland. If this can be accomplished the strategists of violence will face something they fear more than the most Draconian security measuresâthe elimination of those political  economic and social factors which they so successfully exploit for their purposes.68.	My Government does not underestimate the difficulties in the way of reaching such a political solution. But if there are difficulties in the way  so too there are resources that can be drawn upon. There is a close relationship and a fund of goodwill between the Irish and British peoples. This must be developed in both countries by informed policies of government. Stories of violence emanating from Northern Ireland have perhaps obscured the many activities on the non- political or personal level which down the years have made a great contribution to the growth of trust and good-neighbourliness between the two communities and between North and South. It is fitting that I should pay a tribute in this forum to the work of the churches  of sporting and cultural organizations  of business and financial organizations and of the trade-union movement. All these transcend political divisions  and they foster a wealth of personal links which have consistently contributed to mutual understanding. The challenge which must be taken up is to mobilize and use these resources of goodwill and solidarity. The deep yearning for peace and stable progress is overwhelmingly more representative of the feelings of the great majority of Irish people than are the actions of a violent few. It is a tragedy that these positive forces have not yet been focused through acceptable political structures in Northern Ireland.69.	The newly elected Government of the United Kingdom has given repeated indications that it is aware of the need for a fresh political initiative in relation to Northern Ireland. Such an initiative is essential and urgent if constructive politics are to prevail there.70.	The absence of such politics in recent years has left a void which has all too clearly served the strategy of the men of violence. It goes without saying that a political initiative  to be fruitful  must take adequate account of the rights and aspirations of both communities and lead to partnership in political institutions acceptable to both communities. In face of the tragic history and cost of the Northern Ireland conflict  every move along the road that contributes  even to a small degree  to the growth of trust and reconciliation is an important gain and cannot be neglected.71.	The Irish Government welcomes the recognition by the United Kingdom Government of the need for political progress in Northern Ireland. We are at present engaged in extensive studies of ways in which such progress can be encouraged and enhanced and we are confident that the insights and conclusions emerging from our studies will make an important contribution to this objective. The interrelationship between the traditions in Ireland is a fact. What is at stake is the form it will take. There is a duty on all those concerned for peace in Northern Ireland to ensure that this interrelationship moves along the path of partnership and reconciliation.72.	There is an urgent need for an initiative on the part of the United Kingdom Government to mobilize the constructive political energies of both communities in Northern Ireland. My Government  for its part  will be ready to respond to such a development. Our policy is clear and I would like to restate it here. We want to see partnership in Northern Ireland and reconciliation between the people of Ireland  and we will do everything open to us to help to bring this about. I believe that an effort now to promote this would have the support of all our friends  the friends of Britain and Ireland  in Europe and in North Americaâand indeed of all the nations represented in this Assembly."
"64",3281,"IRN",34,1979,"ï»¿O believers  we created you male and female and have made of you nations and tribes that you should know one another. Lo  the noblest of you in the sight of God is the most righteous.""196.	Mr. President  I should like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The unanimous vote of this body in your support is a tribute to Africa  to your country and to you personally.197.	I should also like to express my respect for Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim  whose continuous search for world peace ought to be an example for all peace-loving nations.198.	Permit me to convey to this Assembly the greetings of the Iranian people  of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan  and of the great leader of our revolution  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.199.	I should also like to note that this is not the first time I have addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations  although this is the first time the Assembly is actually hearing me. As an Iranian who has come here from out of the ranks of a 30-year-old revolutionary movement  I have enjoyed the satisfaction of screaming the outrage of my people at you on several occasions from the sidewalks in front of this building. While from the outside  the wails of this complex seemed difficult to penetrate  I never questioned the necessity of appealing to the conscience of the world in our struggle against tyranny.200.	Now that we have penetrated the walls and this Assembly can hear me loud and clear  I should like to state categorically that this is the first time since the coup engineered in Iran by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1953 that the Iranian delegation to the United Nations has represented the true preference of the Iranian people. It is an undeniable fact that during the past 25 years the Shah of Iran was a puppet of imperialism and Zionism. While our people identified with the liberation movements of the third world  the Iranian delegation to the General Assembly sided with the racist or imperialist oppressors. While the Iranians felt a deep sense of solidarity with the people of Palestine and their sole and legitimate representative  the PLO  the Iranian delegation voted with the Zionists  whose repression of the Palestinians and the Lebanese has become comparable to Nazi criminal acts.201.	It is a source of immense pleasure for me to announce to this session of the General Assembly that from now on the Iranian delegation to the United Nations will act and vote on the basis of the true preferences and aspirations of the Iranian people. It is intrinsic to the Islamic Republic of Iran that our representatives in the world Organization should always side with the victims of colonialism  imperialism  exploitation  racism and Zionism.202.	The Iranian revolution is committed to a fundamental transformation of Iranian society  on the basis of the Koranic principles of justice  equality and participation. Revolution is a quest for freedom and  from the perspective of Islam; freedom involves the unchaining of human beings from economic oppression  exploitation  political and cultural manipulation  mental slavery  egocentrism and all other causes of alienation. In the Islamic world view  one is capable of recognizing God only after one has unchained oneself from the conditions of one's alienation. The final goal of all revolutions is the destruction of the sources of human alienation  whether they he found in capitalism  totalitarianism or exploitation.203.	The goal of the Islamic revolution is to create a society in which all people may fulfil their potential  regardless of race  religion or sex. The end of the Shah's regime was the first step towards this goal by the Iranian revolution. Needless to say  the destruction of the Pahlavi rule was the less difficult part of our task; the more complex revolutionary work is ahead of us. For example  we have to restructure the society at a time where our agriculture  by reason of the neglect and irresponsibility of the old regime  can feed no more than 30 per cent of Iran's population.204.	The moral explosion of the Iranian masses in 1978 was greatly inspired by the doctrines of the Koran and the efforts of Prophet Mohammed to transform the wealthy and class-dominated societies of his time into egalitarian and democratic communities of the Islamic faithful. The doctrines of the Koran and the Prophet's tradition will continue to guide and inspire our revolution. One of the most popular slogans of the demonstrators during the last phase of the revolutionary struggle was ""Neither East nor West: only Islamic Republic"".205.	It is indeed true that both the Western and the Eastern worlds have difficulty understanding the nature of the Iranian revolution. The difficulties of the West are rooted in a number of misperceptions.206.	In the first place  in the West religion is defined as a relationship between man and the supernatural. There is no room in that definition for political  economic and social considerations. Islam  however  consists of a set of doctrines based on a world view. The Islamic doctrines define and conceptualize both man and the social universe with the purpose of transforming them in accordance with the Islamic world view. Seen in this light  the religion of Islam has its own political  economic  social and cultural perspectives. It is the imposition of the Western definition of religion on Islam which prevents most Western observers from comprehending our revolution.207.	Secondly  the development of secular scientific culture in Europe was opposed by the organized Church. This was not the case in the Islamic societies simply because Islam has no organized and centrally controlled Church. The Western intellectuals  as a class  developed their distinction in opposition to the Church  particularly the Catholic Church. They were perceived to be rational rather than emotional  and committed to the doctrine that knowledge is the product of pure reason. During the dark ages  which  in the specific sense  were exclusively a Western phenomenon  the Church rejected the existence of non-religious or non-theological knowledge. The Christian clergy's attitude of resentment and contempt towards the early scientific discoveries is well known.208.	In pre-Renaissance Europe  the papal system had transformed religion into a stagnant institution closely connected with the ruling classes of the time. A principal function of theology and religious literature was to comfort the oppressed masses with the promise of heaven. With the Renaissance  science and philosophy broke away from the bondage of papal totalitarianism and began their free and independent inquiry. With the passage of time  this sense of liberation  along with the scientific reasoning brought about by the Renaissance  became the weapon of the intellectuals against organized religion  which fought back with all its resources.209.	In such a situation  it was logical for the scientists and secular thinkers to distinguish their activities as separate from  or opposed to  religious doctrines. When the clock  which was invented by the Moslems  was introduced into the French Court  the priests deemed it to be the work of the devil and ordered their servants to destroy it. Thus when the Western intellectuals began to advocate the separation of Church and State they were actually choosing freedom over the arbitrary power of organized religion. They were against superstition and denial of natural joy  not against ethics or morality. Consequently  the antagonism of the intellectuals to the Church in the West made a significant contribution to social and scientific advancement. However  when Western secularism was transmitted to the colonized societies  particularly Islamic societies  and popularized among the educated elements of the people  the results were not social and scientific advancement but the alienation of the intellectuals from themselves as well as from the masses.210.	The West moved toward secularism as a way of solving this problem. The separation of Church and State was the outcome of this movement  which served the progressive interests of science and society. The Islamic world has never had such an experience. Those Western observers who assume their experience with religion has universal application are often confused when they see a religious leader has become the leader of a great political revolution.211.	Thirdly  the Western experience with religion also contributed to the development of philosophical materialism. When Karl Marx described religion as the ""opium of the people""  he had the history of Western Europe in mind. He knew very little about Islam or the African or Asian societies. In the Islamic societies  when the intellectuals opposed religion and religious values  echoing either Marxism or Western liberalism  the result was the destruction or weakening of the moral force capable of confronting colonial aggression and imperialism  particularly in its cultural form.212.	The prejudice of the colonial scholars was  and continues to be  heavily influenced by the imperialist interests  while the misperception of the Marxist writers has been a logical extension of the assumption that ""religion is the opium of the people""  a contention that could have been true in one society or region but not necessarily in other societies and regions of the world. Instead of using Marxism as a tool of analysis  many Western and Eastern thinkers have substituted the Marxist doctrines for an independent study of third- world societies within their own native socio-historical context. It is unfortunate that too many of the contemporary liberal and socialist observers of the third world are still pursuing the framework developed by their nineteenth-century predecessors.213.	The fourth factor in understanding the Iranian revolution is that the works of the so-called Western orientalists on Islam are  for the most part  so prejudiced that even those who wish to learn about the reality of Islam as a revolutionary ideology have difficulty finding adequate literature. Most students of Middle Eastern affairs in Western universities study with teachers who have a built-in antipathy towards Islamic cultures.214.	Finally  the fifth factor; for a quarter of a century the deposed Shah spent millions of dollars in order to present a progressive image of himself to the Western world. A component of this undertaking was to present his opponents as either Marxists or religious extremists opposed to his modernization programs.215.	Given such pre-conceived notions and prejudices  it is no wonder that many observers of socialist and liberal persuasion have as much trouble appreciating the radical and progressive nature of the Iranian revolution as do the apologists for imperialism 216.	All societies have their own organic development  regardless of what the ethnocentric social theoreticians would like to believe. It was the consequence of this reality that  in February 1979 after 100 years of struggle  enabled the Iranian people to force their illegitimate monarch into permanent exile and to welcome home their most popular leader  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Those events were a culmination of more than a year of nation-wide demonstrations  protests and strikes against the Pahlavi regime and United States imperialism. The dominant slogans of the protest demonstrations and mass marches were: ""Death to the Shah""  ""Independence  Freedom and Islamic Republic"" and 'Neither East  Nor West  only Islamic Republic"".217.	The swiftness with which the Islamic Republic of Iran acted against Zionist Israel and South Africa exemplifies the ideals embodied in the international stand taken by our revolution. It demonstrated our unequivocal commitment to the right of all peoples to a sovereign and independent life free of oppression  domination and exploitation in all their manifestations.218.	We are committed to the view that the maintenance and propagation of bloc alliances based on a military network serves only the cause of imperialism and tyranny. The policy of dismantling military bases and dissociating Iran from military alliances  which cater to the imperialistic game-plan  was one of the initial foreign policy decisions of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It was also a logical step for revolutionary Iran to join the ranks of the non-aligned States. The ideals represented by the non-aligned movement reflect many of our own. Our recent participation in the Havana Conference of the Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries signalled the beginning of what we hope will be a very active membership in the non- aligned movement. Our beloved national hero  and Prime Minister from 1951 to 1953  the late Mohammad Mossadegh  was one of the original advocates of non- alignment. He championed the cause of non-alignment from the tribune of the United Nations in 1952  at a time when Stalinism and United States imperialism did not even respect the legitimacy of non-alignment  The coup engineered by the Central Intelligence Agency against Mossadegh was  in part  due to his advocacy of non-alignment  exemplified by his refusal to join the military alliance sponsored by the United States which came to be known as the Baghdad Pact.219.	We are all too familiar with the facts of the Middle East conflict. For us  the most important fact is the displacement and suffering of the Palestinian people. Three million human beings either have been expelled from their ancestral homes or live under the Nazi-fied terror of the Israeli military occupation simply because they are not Jews. I know such a formulation of the problem may sound over-simplified  but it is nevertheless the naked truth. This is why Zionism has to be regarded as one of the most vicious forms of racism in recorded history; it displaces and terrorizes human beings simply because they do not belong to a particular race and religion.220.	Poor people have always used less sophisticated means of killing their enemies than have the rich. This inequality of means in warfare  which is tremendously intensified by the industrial and technological advances of the past century  has enabled the rich to distort the reality of their actions and intentions. When the Israeli bombers rain death on the impoverished Palestinians and Lebanese  their media apologists in the Western countries  particularly in the United States  describe their genocidal aggression as defensive aerial attacks on Palestinian military bases. No correspondent goes to the Palestinian refugee camps or to the Lebanese villages to report on the plight of the victims. But when the Palestinians blow up a bus in occupied Jerusalem or assassinate an Israeli secret agent  they are described as terrorists. This hypocrisy is characteristic of systems of oppression that deny the rights and human dignity of their victims.221.	My Government is proud to have taken concrete steps in contributing to international efforts aimed at unmasking such deceptions and at undoing the violations and criminal acts committed by Israel.222.	Nowhere are the vestiges and remnants of colonialism and imperialism more apparent and stark than in southern Africa. In keeping with our conviction that we must seek for others the same dignities and freedoms that we have sought for ourselves  the Iranian Government took prompt action regarding the abhorrent policies of apartheid and racial discrimination on the African continent. This action resulted  among other things  in the total cut-off of Iranian oil shipped to South Africa. That measure was adopted with the intention of applying economic pressure on the Pretoria regime and  indirectly  upon the equally racist and illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia.223.	Five months ago the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples held a series of plenary meetings in Belgrade  Yugoslavia. Iran participated in those de-liberations and enunciated its views on apartheid and decolonization in greater specificity and detail. We mentioned then  and we repeat the view now  that the Iranian Government finds the situations existing in South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe-Rhodesia disgraceful and deplorable. We add our voice to those that have already made themselves heard through the channels of the United Nations as well as elsewhere  denouncing any solution not entailing the right of the majority to self-determination and freedom without qualification. It is our hope that the Security Council in particular will further contribute to this end by strengthening all existing sanctions against Southern Rhodesia  and that all Member States will cease and desist from violating the letter and spirit of these prohibitions.224.	In the case of South Africa  our policy is predicated on the same tenets of anti-imperialism and anti- colonialism that combined to form the moral underpinnings of our position on Southern Rhodesia. As mentioned earlier  the existing racist nature of the apartheid regime of South Africa remains in direct opposition to Iran's policy of supporting efforts aimed at creating an international society free from the evils of colonialism  neo-colonialism and racial discrimination in all their forms. As such  South Africa has done little to ameliorate its present posture in either style or substance  as witnessed by its continuing discriminatory  exploitative and provocative policies in Namibia  all pursued in defiance of the unanimous call by the international community for a peaceful and just settlement in that Territory. We believe  then  that it is high time that the United Nations adopted more effective economic and other measures  including the application of the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations against the Government of South Africa.225.	Although the revolutionary government is only eight months old  the Provisional Government of Bazargan  under the moral guidance of Ayatollah Khomeini  has made it abundantly clear that Iran has proudly joined the anti-colonial  anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist forces. However  what is distinct about our revolutionary posture  in both the domestic and international realms  lies in our conviction that the struggle for justice  independence and freedom should in part be directed against our own habits and perceptions. It is certain that the racists and exploiters of this world will not treat the nations and peoples of the third world any better than the way we treat our own people and relate to one another across national boundaries.226.	Until recent decades the rulers in the official or unofficial colonies of Africa  Asia and Latin America did not need the assistance of colonial or imperialist Powers in order to maintain their privileged position. In fact  in many cases the traditional rulers attempted to resist the Western penetration of their societies not only for political but also for cultural and ideological reasons. Until the outbreak of the Second World War  the cultural and ideological orientation of the typical traditional ruling class in the under-developed world was not too different from that of its own general population.227.	Today the situation is completely changed. The peasants are still living under the same conditions or have moved to urban ghettos  but the owners or controllers of the means of production have adopted a cultural and ideological orientation that mystifies the general population. The privileged few  whether they belong to the commercial  bureaucratic or military sector of the governing class  have little socio-cultural contact with the exploited many. In terms of their concrete aspirations and ambitions  they identify with the West to the point of being alienated from their own roots.228.	Thus as the economic gap between the privileged few and the wretched many increases  so does the cultural gap. The enclaves of wealth and power in many under-developed countries are also enclaves of imported cultures and life-styles. The rapid growth of international finance  the movement of goods and services  travel and communication have led to a global standardization of values  goals and aspirations among those who benefit from these activities. Since the technology and the ideology of this dramatic phenomenon are the product of organic socio-economic growth in the West  the standardization of values  goals and aspirations among the ruling classes of the world has added a new dimension of cultural domination to the evolving character of imperialism in the contemporary world. Today  even the liberal education  the manners  the dress fashion  the fads and the consumptive norms of the ruling classes in the subordinated societies are similar to those of their counterparts in the advanced industrial world.229.	In our time imperialism has produced an unprecedented amount of resentment among the populace in the subordinated societies. This resentment  which is a response to exploitation  coercion and consumption- oriented manipulation  has resulted in an intensified and expanded revolutionary challenge from below. Thus installation of repressive technology in the dominated society and militarization of its state have become necessary in order to maintain the status quo. And yet it is a mistake to think of the export of manipulation  repression and militarism to the developing countries as a reaction to the resentment of the wretched. Since the resentment itself is a product of imperialism  the response to it is also a product of imperialism. Seen in this light  manipulation  repression and militarism are the organic commodities of imperialism in search of global markets.230.	Sad to say  too many of us are eager customers for the latest commodities of imperialism. Too many of us spend the precious resources of our people in a parasitic and paranoia-producing arms race. Too many of us are more responsive to the greed of the few for luxury goods than to the essential needs of the many. The arms race and the insatiable hunger for luxury goods are integral parts of the imperialist design for the contemporary world. Too many of us are the unconscious victims of imperialism. The perceptions which were imposed on our fathers by colonialism and imperialism have gradually become so internalized by us that we think they are the product of our own thinking. Cultural imperialism has penetrated the deepest levels of our psyches. Too many of us use the imported instruments of repression and oppression against our own peoples more effectively than their producers intended for us. Too many of us spend more of our resources on the institutions of coercion than on education or public health. The deposed Shah of Iran was perhaps the most irrational ruler in this category  but we all know that there are too many smaller shahs in this world.231.	Why did China have to teach Viet Nam a lesson? What justification was there for the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia to pursue a course of action that resulted in the death of more than 2 million of its own citizens? Why did Viet Nam find it necessary to invade Cambodia? If the new regime in Cambodia is popular and legitimate  why are foreign troops compelled to continue their presence in the country?232.	The rebellion in Afghanistan has produced thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of refugees  who are pouring into the Iranian and Pakistani territories. Irrational and alienated elements justify such actions in the name of an imported 'ism'. It does not matter if the natives reject the imported formula or do not wish to be represented by those who arrogate to themselves a scientific mission.233.	We will betray our own commitment to peace  justice  independence and freedom if our answers to these questions are superficial  evasive  self-serving and one-dimensional. It was not class struggle or economic considerations which caused the latest tragedies in Indo-China. And it is not enough to claim that subjective factors are at work without pursuing the question of what we mean by ""subjective factors' and what should be done to remove them. It is our responsibility to analyze these conflicts with as much vigour and commitment to truth as we apply to unmasking the nature and consequences of traditional imperialism.234.	The Marxist theory of conflict falls short of explaining all the problems of our time; and when it does explain a particular conflict situation  it is a mistake to perceive such an explanation as final. There is an abundance of historical evidence that materialist categories of explanations or prescriptions  whether rooted in Marxism or capitalism  neither fully comprehend the nature of human conflict  nor sufficiently satisfy human aspirations.235.	The revolutionary experiences of this century are once again demonstrating the ancient truth that the struggle for justice  freedom  peace and independence requires a moral dimension which is separate from and beyond the material structure. Nuclear weapons and the real possibility of a global holocaust have intensified the need for this recognition in an unprecedented manner. Nineteenth century conditions of growth and industrialization made morality subservient to materialism in social theories and political actions. Contemporary revolutionary movements can no longer continue this unnatural situation. They have to recognize that imperialism  war and oppression cannot be defeated by materialism alone.236.	The problem in the third-world countries is not just the political and economic domination by the alien forces of super-Powers  but also their cultural domination.237.	Many of the third-world countries are dominated by the ideological  philosophical and cultural tendencies which are alien to the native societies. As a result  many intellectuals in the third world are alienated not only from themselves  but also from their own people. This situation has produced an unprecedented crisis among intellectuals in the third world  to the extent that communication between them and the masses has be-come extremely difficult  and at times impossible.238.	Many of the educated elements in the third world speak the native language; they might even dress like the natives. But they think  feel  taste  see and hear in a Western or Eastern way. In other words  their sense perceptions are taken over by alien forces. This is the worst kind of slavery human beings can be subjected to. This mental slavery is the most distinct consequence of imperialism in the contemporary world  and it seems to be a cheap and effective tool for perpetuating imperialist domination.239.	The global problems diversely analysed from this podium during the past 10 days have a cultural dimension the comprehension of which is at least as crucial as their economic  political  commercial and military components. The multifaceted crisis confronting us all can be reversed if our attention is not limited to the objective conditions of oppression and exploitation. We must also confront the habits and perceptions which we have inherited and internalized without thought or reflection. The problems of development  poverty  inequality  insecurity and violence in the third world can be effectively dealt with only in native socio-cultural contexts; otherwise we will continue to be  however unwittingly  the tools of the super-Powers.240.	The producers and sellers of arms live in a few advanced industrial societies  but increasingly those who use the ever more sophisticated weapons are the impoverished peoples of the third world. This is a new but less visible form of domination and exploitation to which the wretched of the earth are subjected. The poor have become the fighters of the proxy wars of the rich  and this is why the militarization of politics in the third world has reached a sorry stage. In the name of security and with the dubious claim of knowing what is good for their people  many rulers of third-world countries have substituted forced submission for civil society and voluntary association. Nationalism  once a source of solidarity against imperialism  is now becoming an excuse for militarized societies to engage in civil and regional wars. Both the East and the West are exploiting the misperceptions and militarization of the third-world countries in accordance with their imperialistic game- plans  which include the expansion of their own self- serving arms race.241.	It is the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran that the United Nations should be as active in combating the new forms of imperialism as it was in the struggle against colonialism. The cultural domination and militarization of the third world can be as destructive of the rights and humanity of nations as violation of their sovereignty. The confrontation between the oppressed natives and the rulers whose alienated consciousness has placed them at the service of imperialism is as inevitable as was the confrontation between the natives and their colonial masters. Whenever the United Nations has had an opportunity to play a constructive role in the confrontation between colonial oppressors and the forces of national self-determination  it has been instrumental in reducing the violence of the confrontation.242.	In the past decade the United Nations has played a significant role in unmasking the deceptiveness of Zionist Israel or arousing the conscience of the world against the racist regimes of southern Africa  The Western mass media have a near monopoly of information and communications facilities and it is extremely difficult for the poor or the oppressed to appeal to world public opinion. The plight of the oppressed is not sensational enough for the monopolists of information and communications facilities. The United Nations can be more helpful in this regard than it has been in the past.243.	For a quarter of a century half a million Iranians served time in prison; more than 65 000 of them were killed by the Shah's armed men; over 2 000 of them  all young men and women  were publicly executed and an unknown number were tortured to death; yet not a word about these hideous crimes was uttered in this Assembly. There are other peoples in the world who are being killed  imprisoned and tortured by other shahs. The United Nations should heed their cries and reflect them in its public deliberations.244.	The crimes of the shahs cannot be ignored by the world Organization simply because they take place within national boundaries. If the oppressors have to get their arms  ammunition  spies  advisers  and repression technology from outside their national boundaries  then concern over their crimes cannot be confined within their national boundaries either.245.	The legitimacy of the United Nations can be deepened if this challenge is taken seriously. The oppressors  the monopolists of information and communications facilities  those who benefit from proxy wars and cultural domination  whether they live inside or outside certain national boundaries  will certainly advise the United Nations to tolerate the crimes of those who rule by coercion alone. But if we are to serve the cause of peace and justice in the world  we cannot ignore the plight of the oppressed without losing our legitimacy  The Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to the proposition that the most sacred mission of the United Nations is to support  within a realistic framework  the rights and human dignity of the oppressed at all times and under all circumstances."
"65",3328,"IRQ",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  it gives the delegation of the Republic of Iraq great pleasure to extend to you its heartfelt felicitations on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I wish you complete success in the discharge of the duties of this high office  and would like to stress that the delegation of my country will exert its best endeavours  as it has done at past sessions  to participate actively in the work of this session in order to attain the goals assigned to it. Your vast experience at the United Nations  particularly your chairmanship over many years of the Special Committee on decolonization  ensure that you will preside over the deliberations of the General Assembly efficiently and successfully.313.	I am also glad to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  for is valuable efforts as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.314.	The developments witnessed by the world this year are grave and constitute a threat to peace in many regions of the world. Perhaps the gravest of these developments are the schemes perpetrated in our Arab region  the implementation of which has begun to threaten our security and stability and constitute a setback to the cause of peace in the world as a whole.315.	In my statement last year 1 called attention to the risks involved in the plans for the so-called peaceful settlement in the Middle East  which the United States of America has exerted all its material and moral efforts to implement successfully in the Arab region. I made special reference to the results of the Camp David agreements and tried to give a true picture of the aims of the so-called peaceful settlement which are based on nullifying the Palestinian existence and liquidating the cause of the Palestinian people. We declared at the time  as did the entire Arab nation  particularly the Palestinian people  inside and outside its occupied homeland  our vehement and categorical rejection of the two agreements  and singled out a number of essential elements in discussing the Palestinian question and the Middle East. We stressed that the United Nations should assume its full responsibility to make the Zionist forces of occupation withdraw from the Palestinian and Arab territories without giving the Zionist entity any political advantages. We reiterate our position that the Palestinian question should be discussed within the framework of the United Nations and in the presence of the representatives of the Palestinian people in conformity with General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX). We reject all unilateral schemes for settlements which would not be conducive to a just and durable peace.316.	We have warned that the continuation of material and particularly military support for the racist regime in Tel Aviv will lead to the escalation of tension and the continuation of conflict in the Arab region which  in turn  will threaten peace and security in the world  particularly with the proliferation of nuclear weapons to the Middle East which has become a reality. In this context I wish to refer to agenda item 121  entitled ""Israeli nuclear armament""  proposed by our delegation this year in document A/34/142  which reflects the mounting Zionist expansionist attempts to impose capitulation on the Arab nation through the use of every method of terror and blackmail  including nuclear blackmail. I trust that this question will receive the attention it merits from the General Assembly at its current session.317.	The Zionist schemes for imposing occupation and capitulation on the Palestinian people and the Arab nation  with full support from United States imperialism  culminated in the signing of a separate peace treaty on 26 March 1979 between the Egyptian Government and the Zionist entity. Notwithstanding the fact that this treaty is a bilateral agreement  its effects on the Palestinian question  the Arab world and the international community are grave indeed. The treaty is in essence a tripartite alliance which basically contradicts the United Nations resolutions on the Palestinian question and runs counter to the interests of the Arab Palestinian people and the interests of all Arab States. Its aim is well-known to all since the Camp David agreements set up its framework with the goal of perpetuating Zionist occupation  liquidating the Palestinian question and imposing domination on the Arab States.318.	Article VI  paragraph 5  of the Egyptian-Israeli treaty provides that:"" . . . in the event of conflict between the obligations of the parties under the present treaty and any of their Other obligations  the obligations under this treaty will be binding and implemented."" This provision nullifies any obligations undertaken by the Egyptian Government in support of the Palestinian cause in conformity with the resolutions of the United Nations and of the non-aligned movement. The Egyptian Government did not stop at withdrawing its support from this issue of the destiny of the Palestinians under the agreement  but it also took it upon itself to speak and negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians regarding the autonomy formula proposed by Israel  which had been categorically rejected by the Palestinian people. On this matter  the Zionist leaders have always insisted on the fact that this constituted nothing more than a limited  local administrative government relating to the people  and not to the land.319.	The pressures on the Palestinian people to force them to accept the formula of autonomy  which were created by the treaty of capitulation and continue with the support of the United States  violate the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to their inalienable rights which have been recognized by the General Assembly in numerous resolutions.320.	The Camp David agreements and the separate treaty  as well as the exchange of letters that accompanied the treaty  contradict United Nations resolutions on Jerusalem  since those letters confirmed Israel's control over Arab Jerusalem  which the Zionist leaders stress will remain for ever the capital of Israel. Those separate agreements also violate the resolutions of the General Assembly on the right of those Palestinians who have left their lands since 1948 as a result of the Zionist aggression  which has continued through the 1967 aggression. These agreements give Israel the right of veto on the return of the Palestinians who left the occupied territories in 1967. The rights of the Palestinians who were the victims of Zionist aggression in 1948 were totally ignored.321.	If the Egyptian-Israeli treaty is really a treaty of peace  why is there a continuous flow of United States weapons  more highly sophisticated than ever before  to the Israeli military establishment in larger quantities than ever before? The requests of the Egyptian regime for United States military weapons expose the area to the dangers of a new war and leave the door wide open for United States military presence and an escalation of tension in the Middle East.322.	The United States press reported that Sadat had expressed his willingness to play a major military role in support of the West if he were provided by the United States with modern weapons worth billions of dollars. Responsible United States sources said that Sadat had made this offer to United States Secretary of Defence Harold Brown during a long meeting between the two. Those sources affirmed that the Egyptian President requested 300 F-16 fighter-bombers  hundreds of tanks and missiles  and thousands of military personnel carriers and trucks. In return  Sadat would undertake to ensure the stability of the area extending between Algeria and Afghanistan and from the Mediterranean to Somalia. Sadat stressed that he would not use those weapons in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Should the United States respond to Egypt's request  Sadat would contribute to the establishment of a military balance in the Middle East through Egypt's force and distribute the Soviet weapons in Egypt's possession among the small friendly States in the Middle East and Africa. The United States sources added that Sadat's thinking was for him to be the policeman of the area and for his role to extend beyond his near neighbours. In other words  Sadat made it clear that he wanted Egypt to be an alternative to Iran but on a more massive scale than Iran during the days of the Shah.323.	Cairo was visited by numerous United States military delegations for this purpose in order to work out the details of the large-scale shipment of military hardware to be received by Egypt from the United States as part of the Egyptian-Israeli peaceful settlement. How can one reconcile a peaceful settlement with the United States weapons transactions which have begun to threaten the security of the Arab and African countries? The United States leaders do not hesitate to issue open threats to the effect that they are prepared to use force in the Arab area  and especially in the Arabian Gulf  if their interests are exposed to ' danger. In fact  the size of the United States naval presence in the region has recently increased. The escalation of the United States military presence in the region has as its aim the strengthening of ties and cooperation with the racist regimes in southern Africa and the creation of an axis between those regimes and Egypt and Israel in order to suppress the national liberation movements and protect United States imperialist interests.324.	It has become clear  particularly since the signing of the separate Egyptian-Israeli treaty and the signing of the Camp David agreements  that the aim of all these agreements is to heighten tension in the region and impose capitulation on the Palestinian people and the Arab nation  and not the reverse. The tragedy in southern Lebanon and the daily open aggression  death and destruction against civilian targets and the Lebanese and Palestinian population constitute irrefutable evidence of the insistence of Israel on its expansionist aggression against the Arab nation with the full support of the United States. We are now witnessing the most modern United States F-15 planes making daily raids against our defenceless people in Lebanon and hurling death and destruction at them. Where is the peace which the Zionist circles and their allies are persistently proclaiming?â325.	We call upon the United Nations to reject and condemn those agreements  which totally flout the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly over the years on the Palestine question and the situation in the Middle East. We wish to recall that the Arab States  as represented by the League of Arab States  vehemently rejected those agreements in their entirety during the meeting of the League Council in Baghdad from 27 to 31 March 1979. The same position was taken by the Tenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers convened at Fez from 8 to 12 May 1979 and the Ministerial Meeting of the Co-ordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned States in Colombo from 4 to 9 June 1979.326.	Lastly  the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries decided by consensus to condemn the Camp David agreements and the Egyptian-Israeli treaty  The Conference also referred the question of suspension of Egypt's membership in the movement to the Co-ordinating Bureauâin its capacity as a special committeeâto examine the damages caused by the Egyptian Government to the Arab nation and the Palestinian people  and to present a report to the Foreign Ministers of the movement in 1981  when a decision will be taken regarding the status of Egypt in the movement.327.	Ever since the signing of the Camp David agreements and the Egyptian-Israeli treaty  attempts have been made to involve the United Nations  in one way or another  in their implementation. We warn against any attempts to give international legitimacy to that unjust treaty  which ignores all the United Nations resolutions relating to the Palestinian question and the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  such as their right to regain their homeland  their right to self-determination  the unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the Arab territories without any gains  and the recognition of the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. All the contacts and consultations between Egypt and the Zionist entity with the support of the United States have been held outside the framework of the United Nations and not within it. This constitutes a clear denial of the role of the Organization and an intentional disregard of its resolutions  although the Organization has been playing a central role in this question. Today  our Organization is asked to act as a witness and a party to schemes and conspiracies perpetrated by Zionism and United States imperialism against the Palestinian people and the Arab nation.328.	The Arab nation rejected from the outset the Camp David agreements. It also vehemently rejected the unilateral peace treaty and considered it to be an aggression causing great harm to the rights and interests of the Arab nation. The Arab Kings and Presidents at the Ninth Arab Summit Conference  as well as the meeting of the Council of the League of Arab States in Baghdad at the level of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Economy  declared their categorical rejection of these agreements. They condemned the Egyptian regime  the Zionist entity and the United States  and decided not to deal with those agreements and to reject all their political  economic  legal and other consequences. Today  this international Organization is called upon to stand firmly against all attempts to involve it in the implementation of unjust provisions which the United Nations had no role in formulating.329.	Iraq has always considered the Palestinian question to be the central and pivotal question in its foreign policy. It has provided and continues to provide all help it can to the Palestinian people in the struggle against the Zionist invasion. Despite all the Zionist and the imperialist attempts directed against our Arab nation  our struggle will continue and grow in strength until our just goals are attained and our usurped rights are restored. The Arab nation will not be deflected from this course by treaties and schemes concocted to the exclusion of the people directly concerned  with the aim of usurping their rights and liquidating their cause. In the event of the outbreak of war and the collapse of peace in our region  the Arab nation can never be held responsible  because we are defending our legitimate rights  our land  our very existence and our civilization. World Zionism and those supporting it  particularly the United States  will bear the responsibility for the dire consequences in all spheres of the collapse of peace and the outbreak of war. We will never accept capitulation  whatever the price. The peoples of the world and peace- loving States should discharge their responsibilities before it is too late.330.	Iraq fully supports the non-aligned movement and is working actively to increase its role and effectiveness and its march toward the establishment of a new system of political and economic relations in the world. The great success of the Sixth Conference of the movement in Havana is a source of deep gratification for us. The Conference deepened the progressive character of non-alignment and adopted firm and clear positions against colonialism  imperialism  racism  including Zionism  and all other forms of foreign domination. Iraq  which considers non-alignment the cornerstone of its foreign policy  is contributing actively and constructively to support the movement at all levels and is looking forward to 1982  when it will play host to the next summit conference of non-aligned countries.331.	Among the most important goals and principles of the non-aligned movement are total support for and assistance to the liberation movements in southern Africa in their final efforts to put an end to colonialism and racism in the continent. Iraq fully supports the liberation movements of South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe and the front-line African States in their just struggle to attain this goal which the United Nations has advocated for so long.332.	Western imperialist circles continue to conduct a well-planned and vicious campaign in a vain attempt to blame certain petroleum-exporting developing countries for the economic problems besetting the capitalist countries. These same circles do not hesitate to blame the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for the imported inflation of the developing countries  notwithstanding all the available evidence and statistics to the contrary. With a sense of responsibility  Iraq took the initiative of proposing the establishment of an international fund to assist the developing countries in facing the effects of inflation  a fund to which the industrialized countries  regardless of their systems  would contribute annually the equivalent of the inflation which they export to the developing countries. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would also contribute to the fund on the same basis.333.	Proposals from various quarters are made from time to time calling for the consideration of the energy problems in isolation from other important issues. We wish to reiterate our firm position that  whether inside the United Nations or elsewhere  the problems of energy should be approached within a comprehensive framework designed to tackle all the principal problems of international economy as decided at the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly in the context of the new international economic order.334.	All attempts to use the energy problem in order to divide the ranks of the developing countries have thus far met with failure  because the developing countries have maintained their unity and their determination to adopt a comprehensive approach in all discussion of the international economy. We have no doubt that the new wave of proposals will meet the same fate.335.	The position of Iraq on all the subjects included in the agenda of this session is well known and I shall refrain from repeating it at this time in order to save the time of the Assembly. Our delegation will  as usual  present our views and positions during the deliberations of the Main Committees and in the Assembly's plenary meetings when we discuss various items on the agenda."
"66",3375,"ISL",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues in congratulating you on your election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am certain that your wisdom and experience will enable you to give the Assembly the leadership that it needs.250.	I should also like to express my deep gratitude to the Secretary-General and the entire staff of the United Nations for their tireless efforts in the slow and often frustrating fight for peace and better conditions for humanity.251.	The Secretary-General opens his annual report by stating: ""The past year has been full of uncertainty  tension and conflict""  No doubt the same could have been saidâor was saidâabout every year in the third of a century during which the United Nations has existed. It is true that there have been rapid changes and that the international scene is becoming ever more complex.252.	But there are bright spots in the landscape. For 30 years there has been peace in Europeâthe Old World which has been the battleground of empires for so long. This has  however  been an armed and an expensive peace. Regional alliances  as provided for in the Charter  have formed around the two super-Powers and have established the most sophisticated systems of armaments at immense cost to their two peoples. But  however costly they are  we can be certain that conflict involving atomic weapons would have cost these nations infinitely more in lives and property.253.	Precarious as the military balance may be  in the opinion of the experts  the most important thing is that in Europe and North America the leading items on the political agenda are detente and disarmament. At the same time other continents are ravaged by civil strife and warfare  which cause great misery and damage to large populations. This difference is most striking  and it is to be hoped that Europe will continue to stabilize its peace and that other continents can follow in its footsteps; but  alas  problems are different and they call for different solutions.254.	The Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe represents one of the milestones of post-war history  as it strives to formalize detente. The Helsinki agreement has had its ups and downs while the participating nations and others have digested its contents. The results seem to be that they want to continue and maintain the spirit of the agreement.255.	The next milepost in the development of detente will be the second Review session of the Conference  to be held in Madrid late next year. Active preparations have been going on for many months already within conferences of groups of States and bilateral discussions. It seems that everyone is anxious to make the Madrid meeting a success to enhance the future development of detente. Let us hope that this great effort will mean a real step forward  and that the optimists will be proved right and the sceptics wrong.256.	The second SALT Treaty is  of course  the latest and most important step in that process. It has still to be ratified and is being critically examined these days. I hope that the results of these deliberations will be positive  not only because of the contents of the second SALT Treaty itself but even more because of the continued process of detente that it promises  as exemplified by a comprehensive test-ban treaty  conventional disarmament in Europe and many other possible agreements.257.	As President John F. Kennedy of the United States once said  we must change the arms race into a peace race. Even the disarmed and the smallest nations are involved in this matter  especially if they are geographically situated in strategic areas. My people in Iceland live on an island in the middle of the North Atlantic  and we cannot but take notice of the immense armament race that goes on throughout the oceans of the worldâtwo thirds of the surface of the globe.258.	There has been little talk of naval disarmament of late  only some speculation about possible confidence- building measures on the oceans. I shall not express impatience in this matter  but I should like to call the attention of my colleagues from lands around the world to the fact that naval power can easily traverse the globe and reach every coastline  however distant from the hubs of power. Naval might used to be the backbone of empiresâand it still can be.259.	Speaking of the sea  allow me to turn to a more pleasant aspect. I refer to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which this summer finished its eighth session. This has become the longest and most comprehensive diplomatic Conference ever held under the auspices of the United Nations and  counting the previous two Conferences on the subject  is perhaps the greatest effort ever made to bring the rule of law to human affairs  where anarchy has too long been dominant.260.	About six years of long  biannual meetings have  no doubt  tried the patience and endurance of many representatives attending the Conference. But the end is in sight and we must not give up on the final stretch or bring up new problems and complications that might ruin the positive results of years of work.261.	During its last session this summer  the Conference approved a programme of work providing for the adoption of a convention on the law of the sea next year. Although some issues have yet to be resolved  the representatives attending the conference unanimously agreed that it is possible to adopt a convention before the end of August 1980.262.	Many questions that seemed insoluble in the early stages of the long conference have found solutions through the patient and often brilliant work of the participants in the spirit of compromise.263.	Vital issues have been and are at stake. Perhaps the greatest is the very relationship of man to the sea: whether the immense oceans are to be saved and their resources harvested with prudence or whether they are to be polluted and destroyed  as most certainly would happen in the absence of a comprehensive law of the sea. The draft convention provides for the ideal of giving the profits of the deep ocean to the developing countries of the world  which is a most novel and admirable approach. It also provides for equitable principles of settlement where interests clash and  in return for generous economic zones  coastal States will be charged with the responsibility of protecting the resources of their waters and saving them from pollution.264.	I fully agree with the comment made by the Secretary-General in his report  that""the outcome of this Conference could greatly influence the willingness of Governments to make full use of the machinery of the United Nations to achieve international understanding on global issues."" 265.	The long work of the Conference on the law of the sea has already made a great impact upon international law. With other major ideas  the 200-mile concept has been put into practice by so many nations that it must be regarded as internationally valid by custom as well as by widespread recognition. This one rule leads to many other problems that call for solutions  and all this makes it imperative that no effort be spared to follow the schedule for completion of the convention by next year. Let us hope that by the time the next session of the General Assembly meets in this hall the United Nations willâto its eternal creditâhave created the new law of the sea.266.	I should like to turn now to a major question that occupied us especially during last year's Assembly session  namely human rights. While we celebrated in this very hall the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  one of the milestones of international co-operation  we witnessed at the same time continued violence in many countries  the continued use of force  and continued torture and cruelty.267.	The Nordic countries have recently repeated their pledge to continue their active international involvement in promoting and safeguarding human rights. In this context they have re-emphasized the relationship between civil and political rights on the one hand and economic  social and cultural rights on the other.268.	The Nordic countries underscored  in the common statement made by their Foreign Ministers recently in Reykjavik  the importance of making progress at this session of the General Assembly in the work of improving the international machinery for the implementation of human rights. They stressed in particular the development of regional co-operative machinery to protect and promote human rights  and asked for renewed consideration of the proposal for the establishment of a post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights under the Secretary-General. The Nordic countries pledge to continue their efforts aimed at the elimination of torture  capital punishment  racism and racial discrimination  as well as religious intolerance  throughout the world.269.	Once again we join all those who have condemned in this forum South Africa's policy of apartheid  and all that goes with that ominous system of suppression and injustice. Eventually  international pressure must bring down this system and see it replaced by a just and equal system for all races in that country.270.	South Africa continues to thwart the implementation of the United Nations plan for free and fair elections in Namibia. Further delay is unacceptable in the negotiations for Namibia's peaceful transition to independence.271.	Recent events in the Zimbabwe conflict have brought new hopeâif the results of the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka and the talks now going on in London  as so brilliantly described by Lord Carrington  prove to be a basis for genuine majority government in the country. All political groupings must be afforded equal opportunities in elections for a new parliament if such a solution is to be acceptable.272.	The situation in the Middle East continues to be highly explosive and no effort must be spared to keep the peace with a view to securing the right for all States in the area to live in peace and security within recognized boundaries. The Palestinians must be granted their legitimate national rights.273.	I shall not continue to enumerate the trouble- spots of the world. Suffice it to say that the use of force is everywhere to be condemned and is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations.274.	The economic state of the world is certainly one of disorder. In almost every area economic problems have multiplied. Inequality of wealth continues; poverty and undernourishment are rampant. Producers of certain necessities form cartels to raise their prices and reap immense profits. Some countries suffer from intolerable unemployment or inflation. Trade is stagnant and protectionism seems to be growing.275.	These are all indicators of an economic situation that seems difficult to overcome and likely to cause major difficulties for some time to come. There is  of course  no panacea  but several things come to mind: first  we must break the stalemate over the new international economic order; secondly  we must deal vigorously with the problems of energy; and thirdly  we must especially deal with the problems of oil-importing developing nations.276.	Today we have technical knowledge and communications unsurpassed in human history and beyond the wildest dreams of a generation ago. Yet we seem to make little or no progress in the field of social science  which should provide adequate guidance for the equitable distribution of the world's goods. This disparity is not new  yet it becomes more terrifying with every passing year.277.	We have within our grasp the scientific knowledge that we need to solve most problems of managing and dividing the resources of the earth and the sea. But we seem to lack the knowledgeâor is it the love and the compassion?âthat is needed to outlaw wars  hunger and terror.278.	May the work of the United Nations continue to move us in the right direction  and save us from self- imposed catastrophes."
"67",3422,"ISR",34,1979,"ï»¿161.	Mr  President  please accept my congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that you will guide the work of the Assembly efficiently and fairly.162.	I would also like to express our appreciation to the President of the last session of the General Assembly  Ambassador Lievano of Colombia.163.	It is my pleasure to congratulate Saint Lucia on its independence and admission to the United Nations.164.	As we reflect on the development of the United Nations throughout the past year  we find the spectacle far from encouraging. The fundamental obstacle to the Organization's work is the selectivity which has been forced upon it by an automatic majority of the membership  which is far from impartial and prefers expediency to principles. The United Nations specialized agencies have suffered badly from this. Organs like UNESCO  WHO  the ILO and others have been severely affected by heavy politicization which has influenced their functioning. Instead of dedicating themselves solely to their specific fields in the service of mankind  they have been reduced to forums of political one-sidedness.165.	There must be a return to the United Nations Charter. Consultation and agreement should be restored to their primary place. In particular  the specialized agencies must abandon the dangerous path of politicization along which they have been dragged  so that they may devote themselves to the economic  social  humanitarian  scientific and technological tasks which they were set up to perform and which they perform so well when permitted to do so.166.	There has been little improvement in the situation of the Jews in the Soviet Union during the past year. Even though the number of exit visas for Soviet Jews has increased recently  the gap between the number of Jews applying for exit visas and those granted them is growing  while an even larger number of Soviet Jews have been denied the fundamental right to emigrateâa right guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Helsinki Declaration. Those Jews who do insist on their rights are subjected to continued harassment by the authorities  to dismissal from their places of employment and  in some cases  to arrest and imprisonment. We have taken note of the fact that seven Jewish prisoners were released a few months ago. However  we are particularly concerned by the harsh prison sentences imposed on other Jews whose only crime is their desire to re-join their families in IsraelâIosif Begun  Boris Kalendarov  Iosif Mendelevich  Ida Nudel  Anatoly Shcharansky  Simon Shnirman  Vladimir Slepak  Aleksandr Vilic and Amner Zavurov. The Soviet Union should release these and other prisoners of conscience and permit everyone who seeks to emigrate to Israel and join his people and his family to do so.167.	We cannot be silent in the face of the rising incitement against the State of Israel and the Jewish people  its religion  culture and national movement  as manifested day by day in the official Soviet media. In this regard  it must be noted that the Soviet authorities still do not permit Jews to practise their religion and culture. We appeal to the Soviet Union to allow Jewish religion and culture to be practised and expressed freely  and to put an end to anti-Jewish propaganda.168.	We also deeply regret that the Government of Syria continues to violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international conventions by refusing to permit its Jewish citizens to leave and to be reunited with their relatives living in other lands. We appeal to the Syrian Government to change this policy.169.	The past year witnessed a historic break-through in the Middle East. In March  Israel and Egypt signed the first ever Israel-Arab peace treaty. President El-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Begin of Israel concluded that Treaty after intense negotiations  which lasted a year and a half and which demanded great leadership and courage. Israel wishes to express its appreciation and gratitude to the United States of America and to its President  Mr. Jimmy Carter  personally for the vital role which they played in bringing about this historic achievement  which has created a new reality in our region.170.	Let me recall here that Israel has throughout the first 30 years of its independence constantly extended its hand to its neighbours in the search for peace. This found expression on the very first day of the establishment of our State  in the Israel Declaration of Independence of 14 May 1948. Let me add specifically that as early as in the summer of 1967  very shortly after the six-day war  Israel had taken the initiative and offered to sign a treaty of peace with Egypt  declaring its readiness to withdraw from the Sinai and return it to Egyptian sovereignty in the context of a peace treaty. This Israeli proposal was rejected  and the answer given by Egypt at the time was: ""No negotiation  no recognition and no peace with Israel: what was taken by force will be taken back by force."" This year  however  has seen the beginning of a new era in the Middle East. After a generation of continued warfare  the realization of a dream begins.171.	The Treaty of Peace  which  as stated in its preamble  is ""an important step in the search for comprehensive peace in the area "" has provided for a role in its implementation to be fulfilled by the United Nations. United Nations forces and observers were called upon to carry out functions in order to see that the peace treaty was fully implemented. Ironically and paradoxically  that initiative taken by some States Members of the United Nations in the cause of peace was rejected by the United Nations. The Security Council was exposed to the threat of a Soviet veto  and the mandate of UNEF was not renewed  so that the Security Council in effect disassociated itself from the first positive and major step in the great effort to relieve the Middle East from the dangers of war.172.	Although our assumption and hope that the United Nations would assist in the implementation of the Treaty of Peace have been disappointed  we will proceed along the path of peace. The attitude of the United Nations will not damage the peace process; but it will  no doubt  lower the prestige and even the moral stature of the United Nations  one of whose basic principles and purposes is  as stated by the Charter  to ""maintain international peace and security . . . and to bring about by peaceful means . . . settlement of international disputes. . . ''.173.	As a result of the Treaty of Peace  the process of normalization in the relations between Egypt and Israel has already begun. We are confident that in the months ahead we shall make further progress in cementing new bonds of co-operation.174.	The frequent visits and meetings of the leaders of both countries are also an expression of the common desire to promote understanding and closer personal relationships. The most recentâand most impressiveâvisit of President El-Sadat to Israel three weeks ago and the reception given him in the city of Haifa  where Jews and Arabs coexist in harmony and cooperation  indicated the deep feelings of all the population of Israel towards the era of peace and  we hope  left warm memories in the minds and hearts of our Egyptian guests.175.	Over the past year the situation in Lebanon has become grave. The intervention of Syria has  in fact  plunged the northern part of that formerly prosperous country into a state of anarchy  and the Lebanese Government has become incapable of ruling and exercising its authority over all of its territory. The southern part of Lebanon has been  to a great extent  in the hands of the terrorist groups of the PLO  whose murderous activities have been a source of danger and harassment not only to Israel  but also to the Christian and Moslem Lebanese in that area.176.	UNIFIL was established by Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978.177.	Israel  having been compelled to act militarily against the PLO in southern Lebanon in a clear act of self-defence  agreed to withdraw its forces  provided that the new United Nations force would undertake to restore peace and security in the area and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the country.178.	Unfortunately  the aim of restoring Lebanon's integrity has not been achieved  and the Lebanese Government is still incapable of exercising its sovereignty. PLO terrorist groups are still functioning all over Lebanon and  in quite a large number of cases  inside the area of United Nations units. In this region  which was free from any terrorist presence at the time of the Israeli withdrawal  there are now about 700 PLO terrorists  who are acting murderously through the lines of the United Nations Force against the people of Israel. The Force was supposed to act against this. The Secretary-General  in his initial report of 19 March 1978 spoke of the right of self-defence of the Force  including resistance by forceful means to attempts to prevent it from discharging its duties.179.	In his report of 13 September 1978  the Secretary-General stated  among the guidelines and terms of reference of UNIFIL  that ""uniformed or armed personnel and military equipment are not allowed to enter the UNIFIL area of operation""."" However  there are too many cases in which the Force has in fact reconciled itself to the presence and activities of the terrorists in its own area. UNIFIL has not carried out its mandate and duties in this respect  despite the fact that its units have themselves suffered from terrorist activities and at least eight UNIFIL soldiers have been killed in these incidents. The presence and activities of the PLO terrorist groups in the region are in violation of the UNIFIL mandate  and it should be understood that Israel cannot be expected to sit back while terror is being unleashed against its population  no matter where in Lebanon these actions originate.180- Once again it must be emphasized that terrorism could be virtually eliminated if certain countries ceased to provide arms  training and refuge to its practitioners. No cause can justify terrorism. The issue is  therefore  a fundamental one for the international community  and the struggle against terrorism should continue until terrorism has been brought to an end.181.	The PLO  by its very nature and actions  is a terrorist organization. Its true character is reflected in its so-called' 'Covenant""  which calls for the purging of the Zionist presence from Palestine. The same document denies the existence of the Jewish people and its unbroken historical ties with the land of Israel. It alleges that the establishment of the State of Israel is null and void and rejects outright any plans to settle the Middle East conflict by peaceful means.182.	The PLO has not hesitated to try to translate its vicious doctrine into criminal deeds. It has conducted an unceasing campaign of terror aimed at the mass murder of innocent civilians in Israel. From June 1967 to date  over 640 people have been murdered and 3 300 others have been wounded in Israel by the PLO. It has also terrorized and intimidated Arabs prepared to negotiate peace with Israel  killing more than 350 Arabs and injuring almost 2 000 others.183.	Given the PLO's character and aims  it was  in fact  recognized by the parties at Camp David that the PLO could not be a partner to the peace process. No country can or should be expected to negotiate with a party which denies its very existence  aims at its destruction  and uses terror against its civilian population. On the other hand  careful provision was made in the Camp David agreements to include Palestinian Arab residents of Judea  Samaria and the Gaza District in the peace process.184.	The Framework for Peace in the Middle East  Agreed at Camp David by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel  and witnessed by the President of the United States of America  refers positively and constructively to Palestinian Arab rights  as well as to the rights and security interests of the other parties. It is based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which are the only agreed basis for peace negotiations in the Middle East. Any tampering with them can only gravely jeopardize the current peace process.185.	This Framework agreement sees the solution of the question of the Palestinian Arab residents of Judaea  Samaria and the Gaza District in terms of granting them full autonomy  for a transitional period of five years  before reaching an agreement on the final status of the area. For that reason  it was agreed to negotiate on a principle of self-governmentâexercised through an administrative councilâfor the Arab inhabitants of the areas in question.186.	Moreover  in the preamble to this Framework  the signatories invited other parties to the Arab-Israel conflict to adhere to it as well. In the letter sent by the President of Egypt and the Prime Minister of Israel to President Carter on 26 March 1979âthe date of the signing of the peace treatyâthey invited the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to Join the negotiations.187.	This Framework provides for negotiations on the transitional period of five years  and also for the subsequent negotiations on a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan  in which the location of the boundaries dividing the two countries will be agreed. The option of creating a third State between Israel and Jordan is  therefore  not considered in the Camp David agreements.188.	Thus  the objective of the negotiations being held now  based on the Camp David Framework  is the provision of full autonomy for the inhabitants of Judaea  Samaria and Gaza. The Israeli military government and its civilian administration will be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has been freely elected by the inhabitants. This Framework also specifies measures that will be taken to assure the security of Israel and its neighbours.189.	The only way to keep the process of peace going on is for us to adhere strictly to the Camp David agreements in their letter and spirit  and I should like to assure this Assembly that this is the policy of Israel.190.	Before concluding  let me say a few words about Jerusalem  the eternal capital of Israel and of the Jewish people.191.	Jerusalem has known many foreign rulers during the course of its long history  but none of them regarded it as their capital. Only the Jewish people has always maintained it as the sole centre of its national and spiritual life. For thousands of years  Jews have prayed daily for their return to Jerusalem and  for the past century and a half  Jerusalem has had a continuous and uninterrupted Jewish majority.192.	Jerusalem cannot be divided again by barbed wire and there can be no return to the repeated shooting at our civilians and the barbaric desecration of the Jewish quarter of the City  the Holy Places and cemeteries  as happened before 1967  when the eastern part of Jerusalem was under the occupation of Jordan. It is relevant to recall that  in grave violation of the 1949 Israel-Jordan General Armistice Agreement; Jordan prevented Jews from having access to their Holy Places and cultural institutions and tried to eliminate systematically every trace of Jerusalem's Jewish past. By contrast  as a result of Israel's policy of free access to all Holy Places  millions of Moslem and Christian tourists and pilgrimsâin addition to Jewish visitorsâhave come to Jerusalem since 1967  and have prayed and worshipped freely at its mosques and churches.193.	Jerusalem is now a city of coexistence between Jews and Arabs. At the same time  the Government of Israel is and has always been conscious of the fact that Jerusalem is of deep concern also to other faiths  and that its religious and cultural sites are precious to Christians and Moslems  as well as to Jews. There should be completely free access to all the holy shrines by believers of all religions  without any exception  completely protected and guaranteed by the law of the country  and those holy shrines should be administered by the respective representatives of the religions concerned  without any interference.194.	The choice before the United Nations is clear. This Organization  whose Charter enjoins it to support the cause of international peace and security  must not submit to the designs of those who reject peace. Let the United Nations give peace its full support. Let the Governments of Jordan  Syria and Lebanon and the representatives of the Palestinian Arabs residing in Judaea  Samaria and Gaza join the negotiations in order to achieve the noble goal of a real and durable comprehensive peace in our area."
"68",3469,"ITA",34,1979,"ï»¿May I convey to the President my warmest congratulations on your election  which is proof of the esteem and appreciation with which the United Republic of Tanzania is justly regarded throughout the world for the efficiency and realism which distinguish its contribution to international affairs.104.	President Nyerere's visit to Rome last July con-firmed our view of a country and of a continent which are more and more actively involved in the solution of those problems to which so much of our future is linked.105.	While I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Lie'vano Aguirre  I am sure that under Mr. Salmi's presidency  the firmness and efficiency of which we have already begun to appreciate  this General Assembly will constitute again the most important occasion of the year for assessing the results of our efforts over the last 12 months  for courageously facing our failures  and for seeking new paths of cooperation between our peoples. Indeed  all of us will again be faced with a great responsibility during the debates of this session.106.	The United Nations can only be what we ourselves  the peoples of the earth  want it to be. It depends solely on us whether it will continue to be a forum for a free and frank discussion of ideas  or whether it will degenerate into an arena of conflicts where the logic of preconceived ideas prevails over a thoughtful review of our respective positions.107 Italy welcomes the admission of Saint Lucia to membership in the United Nations as a new step towards the ultimate goal of the universality of the Organization and looks forward to fruitful co-operation with this new Member.â108.	If we can assert that effective progress has been made along the difficult road of understanding between peoples  no small part of the credit is due to the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  and to the way in which he has dealt with the serious developments which  this year too  have caused grave concern to mankind.109.	The activities described in the Secretary- General's report to this session of the General Assembly on the work of the Organization are evidence of an effort which has never wavered in the face of difficulties. Apart from the measure of success of individual initiatives  these activities remain the best indication of the vitality and validity of the United Nations  especially at a time when mankind is becoming more and more aware of a common future and is now faced more than ever with political and economic problems of such a scale that they can only be solved at the world level. Italy is well aware of this global interdependence which confronts every country more and more often with problems which cannot be solved merely by a bilateral approach.110.	For these reasons  Italy's foreign policy has always been inspired by the ideals of an increasingly broad international co-operation which has found its expression in Italy's participation in the intensive and fruitful efforts of the United Nations on behalf of peace and the advancement of peoples. In the same spirit  Italy is committed to the construction of the European Community  which is in the process of being enlarged to include Greece  Spain and Portugal. This Communityâthe European Communityâmust continue to develop on a world scale its action of solidarity and peace  with the primary goal of helping to establish a fairer balance in the social and economic situation of the peoples of the world. In the construction of Europe the participation of the peoples in the institutional and representational machinery is of vital importance and for this reason I wish to draw attention to the recent election by direct  universal suffrage of the European Parliament. Similarly  our participation in the Atlantic Alliance as an essential regional factor for security and peace is another basic element in Italian foreign policy.111.	Since Italy's participation in international affairs is based on the principles of the United Nations Charter  the Italian Government has never failed to voice its concern at the persistence throughout the world of serious centres of tension and dangerous factors of destabilization.112.	An analysis of the world situation  this year again  reveals that in manyâtoo manyâcountries of the world the factors of destabilization have not been reduced or shown any tendency to decrease.113.	Italy firmly supports and considers as essential the efforts of the United Nations aimed at detente and disarmament. However  these efforts can be effectively pursued only within an over-all context where centres of tension are eliminated.114.	The maintenance of international peace and stability is  I repeat  a collective responsibility  even if this goal must be sought primarily through the effective participation in the processes of normalization by all the parties involved in the various crises.115.	With regard to specific problems and the crises we are now facing  I should like to recall the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland in his capacity as the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers of the European Community. Thus the General Assembly has heard in outline form the principles on which  in the view of the nine members of the Community  must be based all efforts to solve the serious problems of peace in the Middle East  that of the implementation of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians  as well as that of the security of Israel and the problem of Jerusalem and that of the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon.116.	Italy is convinced that the peaceful settlement we all desire can be achieved only if these basic principles are applied by all the parties to the negotiation for a comprehensive solution. This applies equally to the PLO  which for quite a long time Italy has recognized as an important political force of the Palestinian people.117.	Still with regard to the Middle East situation  Italy decided last July to participate directly in one of the most important peace-keeping operations of the United Nations. It accepted the Secretary-General's invitation to place a helicopter unit at the disposal of the United Nations Force in southern Lebanon. This practical contribution  an expression of Italy's determination to help in a gradual solution of the problems of a geographical area with which it has so many historical and cultural ties  is proof of our full confidence in the role of the United Nations in the Middle East and of the United Nations peace-keeping forces deployed in that area. Therefore we consider it necessary above all to work so as to prevent the tragic tensions in Lebanon from leading to increasingly uncontrollable developments.118.	In the vital area of the Mediterranean  Italy continues to follow with legitimate and natural interest the prospects for a normalization of the situation in the Republic of Cyprus and for a peaceful and mutually beneficial coexistence between the two communities on the island. We have every hope that positive results will be achieved through the tenacious efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim.119.	On the African continent  along with such positive developments as the return of some countries to democratic forms of government and the attainment of higher standards in the protection and promotion of human rights  we note with concern the persistence of tensions which are encouraged by the presence of foreign military forces and whose implications appear increasingly serious and unforeseeable.120.	Italy firmly condemns the institutionalized violation of the rights of the majority of the South African people which is embodied in the apartheid system  and it also condemns the political and economic regime based on this system. In this context  with regard to the problem of Zimbabwe  we support the negotiating efforts now taking place at the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London for the peaceful and rapid attainment of an internationally accepted independence for the territory. Should these efforts  like those for Namibia  fail  the stability of the region  detente in general and the guarantees of the rights of the peoples concerned would be seriously endangered.121.	Crises and tensions which have degenerated into armed confrontations have sown the seeds of destabilization in the whole region of South-East Asia. They involve fundamental principles of international coexistence and have at the same time brought further sufferings to those martyred peoples.122.	Faced with the tragic situation of the refugees from the Indo-Chinese peninsula  Italy has felt in duty bound to participate actively in the practical implementation of the internationally agreed operations designed to relieve the sufferings of those forced to abandon their native land and their homes. Thus  last July  three units of the Italian navy participated in those seas in the rescue operations of the Indo-Chinese refugees  whom we are helping to resettle in Italian society in a spirit of increasingly close humanitarian co-operation with the programmes of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.123.	The international Meeting convened last July in Geneva by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to discuss the humanitarian aspects of the problem of the Indo-Chinese refugees has yielded positive results. The fact that such a large number of countries participated in those discussions constituted an eloquent expression of the extent to which international solidarity may contribute to the relief of human suffering. However  even though efforts have been made to reduce the burden on the countries of first asylum  the final solution of the problem of the South-East Asian refugees still seems  unfortunately  to be far off. This will require persistent efforts by the international community and  above all  the will of all those directly and indirectly concerned to tackle on the political level the basic problems of that area.124.	We have followed with profound sympathy the long sufferings of the Nicaraguan people in liberating themselves from dictatorship  whose overthrow Italy has welcomed with satisfaction. It is the duty of the entire international community to endeavour to give concrete proof of its solidarity with that grievously stricken people. This effort must take the form of a programme of economic and social aid  to which Italy has already made its contribution. At the same time  we reiterate the hope already expressed by the Organization of American States and by the European Community in the Declaration on Nicaragua of 29 June that the situation in that country will develop along democratic and pluralistic lines.125.	With regard to Latin America  the same ideals of freedom and democracy  in which the Italian people firmly believe and which have always inspired the actions of their Government  prompt us to welcome with satisfaction the progress of other countries towards forms of representative democracy and lead us to hope for a new era of co-operation and progress  which will certainly be among the objectives of the next General Assembly of the Organization of American States at La Paz.126.	Italy's confidence in the process of detente is inspired by  and has as its ultimate objective  the recognition of the worth and dignity of the human being  which the Charter of the United Nations affirms in its very Preamble.127.	Indeed only a process of detente and disarmament  conducted with conviction and pursued with loyalty  can pave the way for a broader dialogue between peoples on the question of human rights  overcome the resistance to more advanced and general forms of international protection and gradually release vast resources so that all human rights  without distinctions or hierarchies as between civil and political rights or economic  social and cultural rights  are frilly achieved.128.	If  however  we ask ourselves whether and to what extent we have witnessed during the course of the year further prospects of effective progress in the recognition of human rights within each State and in the international protection of these same rights  the reply is not yet satisfactory  and in many instances it is definitely unsatisfactory  with serious political implications which vary in importance in the different cases.129.	With regard to the international protection of human rights  we cannot help observing that  this year again  many hopes have been dashed by the rigid application of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. Italy maintains that the application of this principle in the field of human rights admits  and indeed requires  a certain degree of flexibility.130.	In this respect may I recall that Italy has accepted all the optional provisions of the international conventions on human rights  including those concerning communications submitted by States in regard to violations of human rights.131.	In Europe the strengthening of security and co-operation has found at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and in the follow-up conferences appropriate forums to begin a dialogue which  we hope  will at the meeting in Madrid next year  further promote the creation of conditions of stability and trust in relations between States and between individuals.132.	After the solemn signing of the Final Act of that Conference at Helsinki on I August 1975  the process set in motion by the Conference has resulted in a growing number of meetings at various levels  among which the Madrid meeting may  through the efforts of all the signatory States  represent a new and important stage along the path of detente. In close collaboration with the other members of the European Community  Italy is preparing for this meeting in an open and constructive spirit.133.	Italy's commitment to peace and detente is also reflected in its active participation at the European level in the Vienna negotiations on the mutual and balanced reduction of forces and at the world level in the disarm-ament negotiations 134.	There is no doubt that the security of States cannot be guaranteed through the uncontrolled spiralling and piling up of weapons of destruction. On the contrary  the halting of this process and its reversal is the priority task of the international community  as was pointed out last year in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament. This is the more true as the arms race  in addition to causing a general feeling of insecurity  also involves at the world level an enormous waste of resources  which are diverted from their natural function of serving the economic and social development of all countries  and in particular of those of the third world.â135.	It is therefore the task of the General Assembly and of the specialized bodies in the field of disarmament  whose work this year has entered a new phase following the restructuring of the negotiating machinery by the General Assembly at the special session  to proceed without delay along the path of disarmament negotiations. It is also the basic responsibility of all of us to ensure that all the urgent points contained in the various phases of the programme are progressively tackled and resolved as soon as possible.136.	Within the context of our joint efforts to achieve general and complete disarmament under effective international control  nuclear disarmament is obviously of particular importance. We therefore welcome the second SALT Treaty reached by the United States and the Soviet Union on intercontinental nuclear weapons and we hope for the prompt conclusion of a treaty on the comprehensive banning of nuclear tests and new initiatives aimed at limiting nuclear weapons.137.	However  in parallel with the process of nuclear disarmament  negotiations for a balanced and controlled limitation of conventional weapons must proceed so as to strengthen stability and achieve decreasing levels of armaments.138.	A better and more stable world requires a growing commitment to overcoming a difficult economic situation whose negative characteristics are a decrease in employment  strong inflationary pressures and a slackening in economic growth 139.	We are all therefore faced with the priority task of ensuring a more dynamic and harmonious development of the world economy.140.	The strengthening of world peace also requires a greater measure of economic justice for all peoples. It is clear that the time in which we live is characterized by a growing interdependence between industrialized and developing countries and between problems we must tackle on a global scale.141.	The economic crisis cannot therefore be invoked as an excuse for diminishing the solidarity of the industrialized countries with the third world. The path to be followed in every case must lead to the strengthening of this solidarity. With this aim in mind  Italyâdespite the difficult economic situationâhas decided in recent weeks to double in 1980 the volume of its official aid for development and also proposes to increase its aid still further in the coming years. With this aim in mind  we have also decided to cancel the official debts of 10 of the least developed among the developing countries.142.	We hope that other countries will follow this lead and in particular that all the industrialized countries  whatever their political system  will participate in a renewed effort of solidarity and justice.143.	But  however important official aid for development may be  it cannot alone solve the problems of the third world.144.	In this context Italy has noted with particular interest the recent proposal  made by the Group of 77 at the last session of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 for a global discussion of the international economic situation  including the problem of energy. It is now clear that the problem of energy is of fundamental importance for all countries  whether developing or industrialized. The transition from the uncontrolled consumption of energy  especially oil  to a policy of energy saving and the diversification of energy sources requires  if it is to take place in an orderly manner  the co-operation and consultation of all States.145.	The large-scale co-ordination of these policies must be ensured in practice through a close complementarity between measures taken at the international level and measures and objectives to be pursued at national level by both the developing and the industrialized countries.146.	Only such a co-ordination between instruments and objectives can guarantee for all the satisfaction of essential needs and the achievement of a lasting and widespread economic balance. If we missed this opportunity we would all of us bear a serious responsibility  a responsibility to future generations and to the weak and the less fortunate. We cannot forget that economic imbalances and energy crises have a tragic impact on the day-to-day economic realities of so many developing countries  which are struggling for advancement and to bring to broader segments of their populations the benefits of development.147.	The dramatic figures published by the United Nations on the world food crisis make us reflect bitterly on the problems still encountered by mankind today and must awaken our consciences so that we can take up successfully the challenge of satisfying the fundamental needs of the world's population.148.	That is why Italy has decided to concentrate an important part of its additional official development aid on multilateral programmes which can contribute to an improvement of the food situation.149.	Italy is therefore ready to intensify its contribution to the efforts of the United Nations to work out and implement a new international development strategy for the next decade.150.	In this context  and for the achievement of the objectives of a greater measure of social justice throughout the world  of an international community based on the reaffirmation of the worth and dignity of the human person  and of an ever growing co-operation between States for the settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace  the Italian Government has worked and will continue to work on the basis of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.151.	If we remain faithful to these principles and seek to apply them constantly  it will mean that men and States will have chosen the right pathâthe path of life  peace and solidarity."
"69",3515,"JAM",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I wish to express the sincere pleasure of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. You are a son of Africa  a continent which is tied with the Caribbean countries by an umbilical cord. You represent a country which shares the common desire of our peoples for freedom. You have already made your own distinguished contribution to many facets of international affairs  including your service to the cause of decolonization. We hold you in the highest esteem as a friend  and believe that your outstanding abilities as a diplomat equip you admirably for the exacting office of President.108.	Permit me also to record the appreciation of my Government for the work of Mr. Indalecio Lie'vano Aguirre of Columbia  who so ably conducted the affairs or our thirty-third session.109.	My Government expresses its thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his dedicated and untiring service to the cause of peace. We recall with pleasure his visit to our country early this year  a visit which helped to strengthen further Jamaica's close association with  and unwavering support for  this institution and its work.110.	Jamaica takes particular pride in welcoming our sister Caribbean country  Saint Lucia  which has recently gained its independence and has now been admitted to membership in this body.111.	The peoples of the Caribbean have recently experienced a series of natural disasters which have been among the worst in our history. There have been volcanic eruptions in St. Vincent  floods have ravaged Jamaica  hurricanes have devastated our sister countries  Dominica and the Dominican Republic. Large areas of our countries have been destroyed  and we will need the understanding and material support of the international community in our urgent task of reconstruction. I should like at this stage to express Jamaica's appreciation for the assistance which we have already received from States Members of the United Nations and from several international organizations.112.	The Caribbean remains one area of the world where the process of decolonization is not yet complete. For centuries our region has been the scene of incessant conflict between colonial Powers in their struggle for supremacy. Our history has been a turbulent one  as we have been moved like pawns on a political chess-board.113.	In the light of all this it should not be surprising that the desire of all our peoples now is to make the Caribbean a region free from the scourge of great- Power rivalry  free from military conflict and free from any form of external domination. The Caribbean yearns to be an area of peace  not of confrontation  to be an arena of co-operation and tranquillity  not one of tension and conflict.114.	We are small States without the military capacity to initiate or resist aggression. We require a climate free from conflict and super-Power confrontation in order to enable us to wipe out the legacy of neglect and to undertake the mammoth task of social  political and economic transformation.115.	Jamaica recognizes that our size and location may tempt the powerful to take advantage of our vulnerability. It should never be forgotten that we are a resilient people zealous for the rewards of our struggles and impatient to continue on the path to genuine independence and complete freedom. We intend to continue playing our part freely in the affairs of the world.116.	We are not pawns and we refuse to be surrogates.117.	We end the decade of the 1970s with much less of the confidence and certainty with which we began. Despite the welcome signature of the second SALT agreement  the nuclear menace remains. The General Assembly proclaimed the 1970s the Disarmament Decade  but the cruel irony is that the 1970s have seen unprecedented growth in the sophistication  volume and sale of weaponsâall this when the social and economic needs of the vast majority of mankind have been growing increasingly urgent.118.	Detente has not spread world-wide. Regional conflicts continue to simmer and in some areas have broken out into open warfare as the major Powers stand at one remove  and the contending parties exhaust themselves.119.	In the Middle East a comprehensive settlement continues to elude us. The attainment by the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights is the key to lasting peace in the area. Yet the Palestinian people remain in effect outside the mainstream of the peace process.120.	In Africa the successful elimination of the remnants of Portugal's colonial empire brought new and dynamic countries into the family of nations; but there still remain white racist minority regimes on the continent.121.	Some of us had supported the display of viable international co-operation and positive action to achieve the liberation of Namibia from South African occupation in accordance with the decisions of the United Nations. The efforts of the five Western countries have apparently lost their momentum and the initiative has been ceded to Pretoria.122.	The efforts for the liberation of Zimbabwe from minority racist oppression spearheaded by the struggle of the Patriotic Front have been buttressed by a notable and encouraging degree of international co-operation. Out of the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held in Lusaka has come the recognition that the farcical situation which exists in Zimbabwe must come to an end and that a Government truly representative of the people of that country must be instituted. We hope that everything will be done at the Conference now taking place in London to ensure that the people of Zimbabwe enjoy the peace  freedom and independence through genuine majority rule that they have so long sought.123.	The long  hard years of struggle by the peoples of South-East Asia have not yet led to the peace hoped for; the region is again enmeshed in conflicts because of rivalry and competition among the major Powers; the people continue to suffer economic and social deprivation; and some have even been forced to become unwanted refugees  thus contributing a new and disquieting dimension to the problems of the area.124.	Elsewhere  small countries remain threatened and insecure. Lebanon is fragmented and still visited with death and destruction; Cyprus at the end of the 1970s is still divided and a victim of foreign occupation; Belize is prevented from attaining its independence because of the continuing threat from a neighbouring State; and the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic is still denied its rightful place in the international community and unable to exercise its sovereignty over the whole of its territory.125.	Nor is this all. The greater awareness of human rights has not been matched by greater observance; the benefits of the unprecedented technological advances have not yet filtered through to the broad masses of our peoples; the promise of a significant increase in food production in developing countries has not been fulfilled and  as a result  world food stocks are critically low.126.	The prospect is bleak.127.	The efforts of the developing countries during this decade have had as their most important objective economic liberation. The pressures of poverty  deprivation  hunger  unemployment and social turmoil have exposed the inescapable truth that the achievement of political independence without a corresponding attainment of economic independence is a hollow victory. Without economic independence we can never improve the quality of life of our peoples.128.	The decade of the 1970s has clearly shown that the world economic system must be restructured if we are to achieve economic liberation  equity and justice in relations among States; that this process entails  among other things  a transfer of resources from the developed to the developing world; and that these things require a global consensus.129.	Early in the present decade the developing countries enunciated a coherent set of principles and objectives for the establishment of the New International Economic Order. As we near the close of the 1970s  our objectives remain unfulfilled and our monumental efforts have resulted in only marginal advances.130.	The international economic agenda of the 1970s constitutes the most elaborate annotation of the roots of world  poverty and distorted development. The pathways towards the restructuring of a world economic order are clearly discernible. We have undertaken the most rigorous examination of the problems besetting money and finance  raw materials  energy and other major development issues. Yet  even after this  our last lingering memory as we close this decade is the frustrating experience of the fifth session of UNCTAD and the lack of any clear perception of the way forward. With the phenomenon of ""stagflation"" there has been a resurgence of protectionism and the developed countries are obdurate in ignoring our cries.131.	It cannot be claimed that the thought and effort expended in the preparation and delivery of our statements in general debates have contributed as much as we would have hoped to the easing of international tensions  or to resolution of the specific issues which confront us.132.	Perhaps the clearest indication of this is the fact that the agenda from one session of the General Assembly to the next preserves a disconcerting sameness. Identical issues  be they political  economic  or social  recur each year for consideration and debate. I fully recognize and acknowledge that these issues are extremely complex and that it is difficult to reconcile the diverse interests of countries and of peoples. But while each year our delegations strive mightily to reach agreement on resolutions  we the Member countries have not spent sufficient time or exerted sufficient effort to implement them.133.	We can ease the burden of these sessions and advance the work of the Assembly by reducing the number of items on our agenda. I am aware  Mr. President  of the efforts made by you  by the Secretary- General and by a number of delegations to introduce in the work of this session some much-needed changes.134.	A fundamental objective of the Charter in its Article 1  paragraph 3  is:""To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character ..."".It is clear that the failure of the international community to tackle successfully the problems of poverty  starvation and inequitable international economic relationships now contributes significantly to the increase in global tensions and to an erosion of international peace and security. Suffering  tension and instability now present the greatest threat to world peace and continue only because people themselves feel locked into a situation of despondency and despair.135.	Having missed or ignored opportunities in the present decade  the international community will in the next one have to deal with old and new issues in what appear to be less propitious conditions. But the quest for peace and development must go on  for both are mutually reinforcing.136.	The agenda for the 1980s will be formidable: we will begin another development decade; there will be a special session in its first year  a United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy in the next  and there are prospects for a global round of negotiations.137.	As we seek for the third time to chart the course of a development decade  we should be concerned that even at this late stage the international community is still without a consensus on the approaches towards the international development strategy: in other words  on such questions as who it is for  what are its aims and objectives and how the process of development should be implemented.138.	We believe that the international development strategy should be formulated within the framework of the New International Economic Order. It follows from this that the accord which eluded us in our negotiations on the basic principles for restructuring the international economic system will have to be achieved in the coming decade if the developing countries are to secure any advances.139.	Energy is basic to human existence. It is a pre-requisite for the survival of mankind. Failure to achieve a coherent world energy policy will make a mockery of all our efforts to reduce the levels of poverty  hunger and unemployment. It will make a mockery of all our plans  targets and strategies. Without adequate supplies of energy we do not have the capacity to produce goods and services consistent with the requirements for a rational and equitable pattern of global economic development. Energy is therefore a unique input into the developmental process. Its availability and its price affect profoundly the prospects for economic development in the developing countries which have no significant indigenous energy supplies  and which have limited foreign exchange from which to allocate funds for its purchase.140.	Two years ago  in 1977  Jamaica proposed to this General Assembly the creation of an international energy institution that would be charged with the task of addressing many facets of this complex subject.  Since then we have watched with satisfaction a growing international recognition of the urgency attending this problem. We have also noted with pleasure the initiatives of a number of oil-exporting developing countries.141.	The President of Mexico has presented a penetrating analysis of the global energy situation [11th meeting]. He has focused on the crux of the issue and laid before us a comprehensive set of proposals which could usefully guide this Assembly in the quest for a global energy policy.142.	Countries like my own are faced with very serious and immediate problems which cannot await probable long-term global solutions. Last year Jamaica spent 23 per cent of its foreign-exchange earnings on energy imports; in 1979 these expenditures are expected to exceed 35 per cent. Obviously  there is less for imports of critical raw materials to support economic activities  less for machinery and capital equipment and  above all  less for vital commodity imports to sustain the health and welfare of our people. My delegation hopes that the analysis of the energy issue in this General Assembly will motivate the international community to seek earnestly for solutions to immediate problems such as these.143.	The 1970s made a positive contribution to the analysis and understanding of the basic problems in money and finance  trade  industrialization  the transfer of technology and other development issues. From this analysis have emerged a number of cogent proposals. In the coming decade we must implement them to ensure improvements in the quality of life of our peoples.144.	On the solution of those problems which I have discussed hangs the very survival of mankind. Not only must we confront these issues with global solidarity  but we must also ensure that every segment of our national populations is brought fully into the developmental process. We must recognize the debilitating effect on our efforts to achieve the New International Economic Order of actions and policies which prevent the effective utilization of human resources.145.	In this regard we cannot continue to treat human rights violations  racism  racial discrimination and apartheid  discrimination against women and non- recognition of the rights of the child as issues which are to be isolated from our basic thrust for economic justice. The international community must realize once and for all that the challenges of development and of economic transformation at the global level cannot be metâwill not be metâunless we successfully resolve the critical political problems which have bedevilled the international community for so long.146.	We are all aware of and familiar with the various areas of crisis on our planet. They are symptomatic of a deeper malaise  of more fundamental problems with which we must come to grips if the decade of the 1980s is to be a decade of hope and optimism.147.	No human being and no society can flourish and achieve its full potential in that milieu of spiritual de-basement  human degradation and economic exploitation which characterizes the system of apartheid and all human societies organized upon or tolerant of the ideology of racial superiority. The international community must continue its assault upon this ultimate indecency with renewed vigour  and in particular upon its bastionsâthe racist regimes of South Africa and Namibia.148.	More than any other issue perhaps  disarmament is one on which the longer we take to make meaningful progress the more certain we can be that we will bear the painful consequences of our folly and delay. To put it simply  our luck cannot hold forever. The arms raceâthe fondness for new weapons of destruction- sustains and feeds among nations and peoples a bellicosity of nature  a predisposition to confrontation  to psychic fatalism and insecurity  and above all a tragic misplacement of priorities  which cannot augur well for the international community.149.	What  I must ask  is there in store for a world which is constantly threatened by the very existence of armaments which already are capable of destroying it several times over? Yet there are a growing number of countries which  in pursuit of absolute security  not only seek additional and more sophisticated nuclear weapons but also by that very desire stimulate others to do likewise. Surely we have a right to look forward to a time when man will become so aware of the futility of that search in the present structure of international society and in the  present system of inter-State relations that Governments will abandon this phantasm. If we are to avoid the holocaust  the 1980s must see a major change in the predisposition of peoples and Governments towards one another and their perception of one another.150.	One of the challenges of the 1980s must be a reassertion in practice of the basic principles of sovereign equality  territorial integrity  non-interference in internal affairs and peaceful coexistence  which must guide States if anarchy is not to prevail at the international level. We firmly believe that  if the challenges can be met in these areas  then the 1980s could be a decade of optimism and accomplishment Jamaica believes that the international community must pledge itself to making of the 1980s a watershed decade. It can do this only by recognizing the limitations of policies based upon narrow self-interest and the flexing of muscles. It can do this by beginning now to implement the pragmatic measures and by beginning now to inculcate the philosophical and psychological orientations which are essential to the spirit of cooperation and accommodation with which we need to confront the decade of the 1980s.151.	Spanning the 1970s and the 1980s is the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality  Development and [Peace. An important achievement of the Decade has been the establishment of the Voluntary Fund for the United Nations Decade for Women  from which many developing countries  including my own  have benefited. While congratulating the Secretary-General on the effective management and operation of the Fund  we must express our hope that its future operations will be maintained at least at the present level. Jamaica also looks forward to the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality  Development and Peace. In most of our societies women have for too long been relegated to secondary or marginal roles  their capabilities underestimated and their talents ignored. Clearly they need to be encouraged to participate fully in the process of development. We expect the forthcoming Conference to help to do that and thereby contribute to the establishment of the New International Economic Order.152.	The current stage of negotiations in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea points to the possibility of an early resolution of the outstanding issues. These negotiations are intimately related to the ongoing deliberations on the New International Economic Order and encompass some of the most enduring concerns in the political  economic and juridical relations among States. We confidently expect that the management of the resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor and the juridical regime that we agree to establish will represent for the 1980s a singular and extraordinary demonstration of international cooperation in what has been often described as the last frontier of man. The success of the Conference is therefore of special importance for the future of the world.153.	A review of the 1970s compels us to admit that the early promises of the decade have not been realized. We end in a mood of deep disappointment at our failures and real concern over the dangers for the coming years.154.	The frustration and disillusionment of the past must now give way to a new era of hope and fulfilment. The 1980s beckon us to new challenges of leadership  of vision and of creative action. We require a new summons to our will to establish a world free from fear  free from poverty and free from exploitation. We are challenged to create a lasting peace which goes beyond the mere absence of war and to usher in a new age where injustice and exploitation are no more. Our experience demonstrates that our future is inextricably intertwined. We are driven to the recognition that we may belong to several nations and several peoples but that  despite our differences in size  in wealth and in power  we all belong to one raceâthe human raceâand that the earth we must all inhabit is one and indivisible."
"70",3561,"JOR",34,1979,"ï»¿ I should like first of all to extend my warmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a tribute paid to you personally and to your friendly  struggling country. In all your efforts exerted at the United Nations you have always embodied the spirit of the United Republic of Tanzania  which is struggling  under the wise  experienced and determined leadership of its friendly President  Julius Nyerere  for the benefit of Africa and the whole world. The assumption of the leadership of this Assembly by Africa today has very deep meaning of which no one is ignorant. Africa has recently begun with determination  awareness and courage to put its efforts  experience and hopes at the service of mankind for its benefit.3.	I thank your predecessor  a true son of Latin America  who led the General Assembly last year with competence and dedication. Latin America has contributed with enthusiasm and wisdom to the work and successes of the United Nations from its inception; and it will continue to do so  increasing day by day the role of Latin America in our new contemporary world.4.	I could not fail to praise the efforts of the Secretary- General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who bears his great responsibilities with patience  courage and impartiality while working for international peace and co-operation and for the solution of humanitarian causes.5.	The last time I spoke from this rostrum the world situation and the situation in my own country were very different from what they are now. It was on 26 June 1967  when the Arab nation was tending its wounds and attempting to absorb the shock of the Israeli expansionist campaign which had thrust Israel's armed forces across the borders in every direction. The Israeli forces had just occupied the Syrian Golan Heights and the Egyptian Sinai  as well as Palestinian Gaza and the West Bankâthe heart of Palestine and the secure and stable habitat of the largest concentration of Palestinians. They had occupied Arab Jerusalem  so dear to the hearts and minds of hundreds of millions of Moslems and believers around the world. In one fell swoop  they had shattered the city's security  violated its sanctity and annexed its people  its land and  indeed  its history  to the body politic of Israel.6.	At that time I carried to this international bodyâ which  after all  is the world's conscienceâa message from a brave people that had borne the brunt of the pain and shock in the wake of the aggression and occupation carried out so blatantly against them. I told you then that this same people  which had stood in the face of aggression on behalf of the Arab nation and in defence of its rights and principles  was a valiant and steadfast breed which would cope with suffering but would not compromise its principles. I said then that we would stand fast until the entire world community came around to comprehending our just cause  at which time it would stand by us and enforce a just and honourable peace based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and rooted in the requirements of international justice.7.	The United Nations  then  was still groping for maturity  independence and comprehensive membership. There was then a sector of world opinion which still believed that Israel sought security  not hegemony or expansion. The then independent nations of the third world  the opponents of racism and colonialism in all their forms  had not yet achieved their present cohesion. Nor had the ideas  aspirations and new values of the third world emerged with the insistent voice within this world body that they have today.8.	The world had not yet experienced Israel's intransigence  its determination to block all avenues to a just peace  or its increasingly open declarations of its ambitions to annex occupied Arab lands. The world's conscience had not yet been aroused to the reality that Israel's Zionist racism was of the same coin as the racism of the minorities of southern Africa. Nor had it come to realize that it belonged to the same stuff which made the colonial wars in Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau and lies behind the present strife in Zimbabwe and Namibia.9.	We in Jordan  together with our Palestinian brethren and the rest of the Arab nation  have suffered for many years from a lack of understanding or appreciation by the world community of our just cause. But we now take solace in the fact that the world of today is not the world of 1967. There have been dramatic changes during the last decade. Angola  Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau are now liberated. The colonial institutionâa vestige of the nineteenth centuryâhas collapsed in Africa and elsewhere. United Nations membership has been extended to include almost every country around the globe  affording a proper representation of the interests and principles of the majority of the nations of the world.10.	The non-aligned countries  together with the rest of the third world  have succeeded in placing the United Nations in an adversary relationship to colonialism  racism and foreign domination of whatever kind. The values governing international relations have thus shifted in favour of the overwhelming majority of nations and have moved towards greater international equality.11.	There is a growing international conviction  even among the industrially and technologically advanced nations  that the world must rectify existing economic relationships and seek a new pattern of international economic interaction based on equity  co-operation and equal opportunity. Concepts of the new international economic order are gaining acceptance on the part of the majority of nations and are viewed with respect even by the minority which still approaches them with varying degrees of reservation.12.	This is indeed a different world from that of 1967  when Israel could perpetrate its tragic occupation of surrounding Arab lands and impose on the Palestinian people yet another round of pain and suffering.13.	Jordan  together with the entire Arab nation  welcomes these far-reaching developments in international life. We in Jordan have always supported the movements towards positive change which inevitably leads the world towards broader horizons of liberty  prosperity and self-realization.14.	Every day  the world moves closer towards the new values. My country's active participation in this movement is prompted by several factors. As part of the third world  as an Arab country and as one of the non-aligned countries  Jordan seeks renewal and progress  be it economic  social  cultural or political. As an Arab country it has an unquestioned obligation to Arab history  to Arab unity  to the ultimate triumph of the Arab struggle for liberty and progress and to the Arab future. Jordan has also been inextricably linked to the sufferings and aspirations of the Palestinian Arabs  whose recent history is a living symbol of the just struggle of all nations against colonialism  racism and oppressive foreign rule and whose aspirations are a true reflection of the desire of the entire Arab nation for stability  security  a just peace and continued progress.15.	Jordan is for world peace  without which the world cannot hope for stability  prosperity or a better standard of living for all nations. For this reason  we stand against international tension and the cold-war mentality  not to say the cold war. We are for complete and comprehensive disarmament based on reciprocal guarantees. We are for an honest and a fruitful dialogue between the South and the North  between the industrialized world and the less fortunate countries which are seeking to achieve comparable progress. We are for the new international economic order in all its manifestations: equitable interaction among all nations; anew basis for international trade; the transfer of resources from developed to developing countries; the implantation of technology in the developing countries where it is most needed; the effective supply of food to the poorer countries and the wherewithal to produce more of their own food; the dissemination of knowledge and education; the effective solution of the problem of housing and clothing; the provision of medical care; and the promotion of individual dignity. We are for viewing the entire world as an indivisible unit with regard to resources  aspirations  peace and the solution of problems. We are for placing the resources of humanity at the service of progress and enlightenment for all of mankind.16. The forces of positive change which have altered the world of today from what it was a decade ago have also had their effect on our Middle East region. The cause of justice in the Middle East  which is closely intertwined with the rights of the Palestinian people  has been making continued progress. Transcending old barriers  the new  free and vibrant Africa has declared its firm and clear support for the just Arab cause and for the Palestinian people. Western Europe is overcoming the effects of Zionist control both in the mass media and in national parliaments. The European mind has been opened to the realities of the situation in the Middle East and to the aspirations and sufferings of the Palestinian people. Western Europe has started a constructive dialogue with the Arab countries  with a view to building bridges of understanding  broadening the base of mutual interests and directing joint efforts towards the achievement of a just peace in the region.1.7. The whole climate in the world today is one that rejects occupation and racism wherever they are exercised . It is thus conducive to an emergent recognition of Palestinian rights.18.	Unfortunately  however  the Israeli occupation of Arab territories and the concomitant sufferings of the Palestinian people have prevented a break-through in our own region. The cause of justice and liberty for the Palestinian people continues to face increasing Israeli intransigence.19.	Everyone knows that Israel has since 1967 been occupying vast Arab territories and that the entire Palestinian homeland is under occupation. The Assembly will recall that at first the Israeli leadership made the claim that Israel was ready to withdraw within the framework of a comprehensive settlement that guaranteed peace and security. However  it is evident today that the Israeli leadership has no intention of withdrawing from the occupied territories or of returning to the Palestinian people its occupied homeland  where it can exercise its right to self-determination and the establishment of a free national entity.20.	Israel has literally planted  and is still planting  the occupied territories with settlements. It has tied the economy of these territories to its own. It has introduced deep radical changes into their physical  human and cultural characteristics. And it has done this before the eyes of the inhabitants of the occupied territories and the whole world. In successive announcements the Israeli leaders have emphasized that they consider any self-rule for the Palestiniansâhowever mutilatedâto apply to the inhabitants but not to the land. The same leaders have dug outâfrom myth and legendâclaims for perpetual ownership of the occupied land.21.	As for Jerusalem  which is the heart of Palestine and the occupied territories  and the sanctum of Arabs and Moslems everywhere  it was forcibly annexed by Israel in the early days of the 1967 occupation by a government that had claimed more concern for peace than the present oneâalthough every Arab knows from bitter experience that the thinking and actions of successive Israeli governments have remained alarmingly constant.22.	Jerusalem  so dear to us all  is suffering from the ravages of daily mutilation. Its long-suffering people are faced with sustained psychological and economic pressures as well as outright repression intended to Force them to leave or else surrender their national and historical identity. Arab Jerusalem  which is so closely linked to our history  religion and culture throughout the ages  is undergoing systematic erosion and a painful loss of identity as an annexed body. It is as if the Israeli authorities wish to eradicate from the world's memory centuries of history and tradition and of spiritual  moral and cultural ideals.23.	How  under such conditions  can a just peace and genuine coexistence come about in the Middle East? How can peace be achieved between an occupying Power that refuses to engage in an equitable dialogue and the people it has sought to vanquish and suppress? How can Israel convince the world that it wants peace and stability while refusing to change its outlook and its methods of dealing with the environment around it?24.	Students of Zionist and Israeli political thought have realized for some time that Israel treats the Arabs around it not as part of a human environment with which it aspires to coexist but as a human barrier which it must seek to demolish. This is evident in Israel's daily attacks on southern Lebanonâa beautiful and peaceful country  a small countryâcarried out under a variety of pretexts. Again  it is as if Israel intends this cruel approach as a substitute for facing up to its responsibility for the catastrophe that has beset the Palestinians and the ravages that have plagued hitherto peaceful Lebanon. It is also evident in the failure of the Israeli leadership  over the long years  to come up with a genuine peace proposal which neighbouring Arab countries can look at with any degree of objectivity.25.	The official Israeli political line has never once provided a glimpse of possible recognition of the Palestinians as a people with a right to a free and secure existence based on self-determination. Rather  it has insistently smeared the Arab image and projected the Palestinians squarely on Arab shoulders. Such claims  however  are meant for external consumption and are part of Israel's war against the Arabs  not Israel's battle for peace.26.	It is for these considerations that we were deeply hurt to see the leadership of Egyptâa country which we love and cherish and appreciateâfall into the Israeli trap aimed at fragmenting the united Arab front. The Egyptian leadership has walked  or has been led  into the trap  but honourable and genuine peace  which can be accepted and lived with  has become more elusive than before. If Israel really wanted peace and was eager to seize the opportunity for peace  it would surely have preferred to deal with the Arabs as a group  and would have presented a positive position  respecting their historic rights  and opening for the Palestinians an opportunity for regaining the exercise of their national and human rights as well as recreating their unity within a truly national entity.27.	Until this very moment  no statement has been made by the Israeli Government to the effect that Israel accepts the right of self-determination for the Palestinian peopleâeven within a framework of reciprocal peace and security. Until this very moment  no statement has been made by the Israeli Government that Israel commits itself to withdrawal from the occupied territories in the context of a comprehensive settlement leading to peace and mutual guarantees.28.	Since 1967  the Arab parties have been ready for a comprehensive and just settlement. They have been ready for the establishment of a just peace  where all can live within secure borders after a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self- determination and sovereignty in their national homeland. But in spite of this declared Arab position  all international efforts to achieve a complete and just solution have met with failure. This is so because  while the Arab parties accepted peace and its guarantees  Israel has chosen a claim to Arab territories over and above peace. In place of security and coexistence  Israel has insisted that the Palestinian people should suffer continued dislocation outside their homeland or submit to a life of captivity under occupation.29.	Even after the unfortunate Egyptian withdrawal from the joint Arab front  the entire Arab world re- emphasized at the Ninth Arab Summit Conference  held in Baghdad in November 1978  its commitment to a just and honourable peace based on respect for recognized Arab rights.30.	Jordan  which I am honoured to represent here today  has a thorough understanding of what is and what is not possible in the context of war and peace in our region. Jordan has always advocated reason  moderation and a search for the just and durable  both by virtue of its proximity to danger and its close involvement in the tragedy from the very beginning. The Jordanian people have always shared the sufferings and aspirations of the Palestinian people. Jordan earned the major burden of the human tragedy that befell the Palestinians  and absorbed the human  economic  social and political results of this tragedy.31	In 1950  Jordan entered into a voluntary union with the Palestinian West Bank in order to protect the people and the land as well as out of a conviction that Jordan shared with the West Bank a common destiny and a brotherly obligation.32	On 24 April 1950  the joint Jordanian Parliament  in taking its historic decision on unity  did not neglect to record Jordan's unwavering stand concerning the historic rights of the Palestinians and the support of Arab Palestinian rights in any future settlement in accordance with national aspirations and international justice. Thus when we speak today of the right of self- determination for the Palestinian people  we do so because it is something we have always believed in and have always attempted to bring about within the framework of a just and comprehensive settlement.33.	Israeli officials have constantly reiterated that Jordan must solve the Palestinian problem by absorbing the Palestinians itself. But the answer to this argument is a very simple one. When we speak of Palestinian rights we speak of a clearly defined territory and an equally clearly defined people who with their ancestors have inhabited that territory  situated west of the River Jordan in Palestine for countless centuries. The subject is thus not a matter of terminology or semantics. In 1948  Israel managed to uproot distinct people from their homeland. It then took another major step and placed 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs under its control. The case of this nationâhalf in exile and half under occupationâis the case of the Palestinian people.34.	Playing with words will not solve the problem. Israel must withdraw from the territories it occupied in June 1967  must respect the right of the displaced Palestinians to return to their homeland and must stop its denial of the Palestinians' right to self-determination  including their right to establish an independent state if they so wished. We in Jordan  together with the other Arab countries  stand behind the Palestinians in demanding this right. We support them in the exercise of their free choice and will respect the choice they make.35.	Let me now return to the question of what is possible and what is not possible.36.	We in Jordan support any sincere international efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement. We have co-operated with such efforts  within our announced principles  from the very beginning. We cooperated with Mr. Gunnar Jarring and with the Security Council when it attempted to tackle the Middle East problem through the efforts of its permanent members. We co-operated with initiatives made by the United States during the Johnson  Nixon  Ford and Carter presidencies. We accepted the proposal of President Carter in September 1977 to reactivate the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East under the United Nations and under the co-chairmanship of the Soviet Union and the United States with participation by all parties  including the Palestinian people  in a unified delegation on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the other principles of the United Nations Charter. Even after Israel  consistent with its record  aborted this latest United States initiative  we remained open-minded and positive in our reaction to international efforts. But the tripartite agreement between Egypt  Israel and the United Statesâthe Camp David agreements âresulted in what we perceive as contrary to our national interest  to the interests of the Palestinian people and to the interests of the Arab world. I do not wish to engage in a lengthy critical appraisal of the Camp David agreements. I merely want to emphasize two basic points.37.	First  the occupied territories are indivisible. They are all subject to the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of other peoples' territories through the use of force. The West Bank and Gaza are no different from the Sinai or the Golan Heights. They are occupied territories and the occupation must end.38.	The West Bank and Gaza are the heart of Palestine and the homeland of the Palestinians. The West Bank is not subject to bargaining. There can be no meaning to any international settlement if it leaves the future of the West Bank and Gaza vague or applies to it a status at variance from that which applies to the other occupied territories.39.	It goes without saying that the Israeli theory of autonomy for the people but not the land is unacceptable. The only true equation for a just settlement is one of complete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied territories in accordance with a clear time-table  coupled with Palestinian self-determination  against a commitment to mutual peace and security  and all this should be in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations.40.	Secondly  Jordan does not accept the role of assisting the Israeli occupation authorities in the West Bank while Israel makes daily claims to ownership of the land and refuses even the possibility of the alleged ""autonomy"" eventually evolving towards sovereignty and independence for the people of the occupied territories within their own homeland. Jordan stands behind the Palestinian people in supporting their freedom and the establishment of their free political entity. It stands ready to help them in all fields. It is not prepared to accept from the occupying authorities any vague international formulas designed to gain time while planting the land with settlements and postponing the difficult basic decisions through recourse to tactics aimed at preventing world public opinion from exercising moral and political pressure to end the occupation.41.	I should like to emphasize here that the destiny and the future of the area cannot be decided in the absence of the parties concerned  foremost among them the Palestinian people  or in the absence of the rest of the international community. Developments have led us to believe that the United States by itself cannot exert a constructive influence in achieving a just settlement and the establishment of a durable peace as long as its policy is committed to supporting Israel by alt political and material means and by supplying armaments  while Israel persists in refusing total withdrawal and the recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people on their national soil  as well as respecting the rights of all States in the region to live in peace and security.42.	I have emphasized these points in order to place before you the realities of our region and make clear where we stand with regard to what is possible and what is not possible. At the same time  I would like to reiterate that we in Jordan  together with the rest of the Arab world  continue to stand for a just  honourable  viable and durable peace.43.	The objectives of the peace efforts are clear and simple. Once the world community agrees on them  they are easily achievable. The form is not important. What is important is the substance.44.	The world community must realize that comprehensive peace will not be achieved until the armed forces of Israel withdraw completely from the Arab lands they occupied in 1967. If the Israeli forces withdraw completely  then the world community can arrange a smooth and lawful transfer of authority and responsibility to the people of the occupied territoriesâthose living there now as well as those who belong thereâthrough internationally recognized and voluntary means. The right of self-determination is as sacred to the Palestinian people as it is to any other of the world's peoples. It is the only way by which they can establish a free national entity and regulate their relations with their neighbours  in full freedom.45.	A third point is the right of the displaced Palestinians to repatriation or compensation in accordance with successive United Nations resolutions since 1948. This can be achieved within a legitimate framework of peace and in the light of their wishes as expressed by their free choice under neutral international supervision.46.	If the world community accepts these basic principles  which are indispensable for a just peaceâand the world community has in fact fundamentally accepted them for a number of yearsâthen the way will be open for their implementation in a reasonable and appropriate manner. I need not point out that there are various methods  forms and formulas of reasonable implementation.47.	For example  we  the Arab parties  have in the past accepted the idea of an international conference in which the Arab parties would be represented by a unified delegation under United Nations auspices. During the past months  I have personally called for the problem to be taken back to the Security Council with the purpose of agreeing on a formula for implementing these accepted principles which should underlie a settlement.48.	We are also ready to consider suggestions from any quarter with regard to the implementation of a just settlement  so long as they abide by the principle of withdrawal and an equitable solution of the Palestinian question.49.	We believe that the United Nations  with its Charter  its flag and its successive resolutions  provides the natural framework for the achievement of the comprehensive settlement we all seek.50.	The Arab countries today have sufficient confidence in themselves to consider all suggestions and ideas leading to a just peace. They are fully capable of consultation and co-operation among themselves  as well as with the rest of the world for the achievement of peace. The Palestine Liberation Organization  through its international activities and announced positions in recent months  has proved that it wants to participate  in the name of the Palestinian people which it represents  in steps leading to a just peace which will ensure the liberation of the Palestinian people from occupation and the pursuit of a free and independent existence within their national homeland.51.	We in Jordan are co-operating in good faith with the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization and with the rest of the Arab countries for the good of the brotherly Palestinian people and the Arab world at large.52.	The opportunities for a just peace are better now than at any other time in the past. It is important that they should not be frittered away either because of inaction in the international quarters  wherein lies the responsibility of preserving peace and international justice  or on account of intransigence on the part of those who harbour grandiose dreams of expansion and domination and thus close their eyes to the real possibilities of peace and security.53.	If I have spoken at length about the problems of our region  it is because they are fateful problems affecting the life and future of my nation and touch in a very direct manner on the peace of the world.54.	In seeking peace for our region and justice for our nation  we seek peace for the whole world and justice for all nations.55.	Our cause is inseparable from the cause of a just and equitable world order.56.	Our cause is inseparable from the cause of international detente  co-operation and mutual trust.57.	Our cause is inseparable from the struggle of nationsâand that of the United Nations itselfâagainst racism  colonialism and foreign domination.58.	Our cause is inseparable from the aspirations of the nations of the world for economic progress  national stability and a better life for mankind.59.	Our Arab nation stands with all other nations in the battle for freedom  peace  progress and international co-operation.60.	May God help all our nations and guide the United Nations."
"71",3608,"JPN",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government and the people of Japan  I should like to extend warm congratulations to Mr. Salim on his election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that  under his impartial guidance based on superb wisdom and wealth of experience  this session will be a most fruitful one.117.	I should also like to express my heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Lievano  who contributed greatly to the successful conclusion of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.118.	I take this opportunity also to pay a sincere tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. We deeply appreciate his dedicated efforts towards the maintenance of international peace and security as well as towards the promotion of international co-operation  thus helping to realize the goals of the United Nations.119.	Let me also take this opportunity to express a sincere welcome to Saint Lucia on its admission to the United Nations. My country looks forward to deepening its co-operation with Saint Lucia within the United Nations as well as in other contexts.120.	The year 1979 is significant as the transitional year from the 1970s to the 1980s. As we recall our experiences of the 1970s and reflect upon their implications for the future in our quest for world peace and prosperity  this session of the General Assembly  held at such an important time  should  in my view  provide us with a new vigour and perspective for the coming decade.121.	Looking back on the 1970s  I consider it a time mixed with promise and disappointment in terms of world peace and prosperity.122.	While tensions have relaxed among certain States with different political systemsâas seen  for example  in the progress in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union and in the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic of Chinaââelsewhere  in such areas as the Indo-Chinese peninsula  the Middle East and Africa  regional confrontations and conflicts are continuing. In some regions we have even witnessed the intensification of tensions.123.	While there have been real international efforts to promote the stable expansion of the world economy  as exemplified by the five summit meetings of the major industrial nations and the GATT Tokyo round trade negotiations  energy problems cast a vast and gloomy shadow over the future of the world economy  and there is no solution in sight to such problems as inflation and recession.124.	While nation-building programmes of developing countries are progressing  the non-oil-producing developing countries are experiencing extremely serious economic difficulties stemming from sharp increases in the price of oil. Prospects concerning North-South problems are complicated by a great number of difficulties  due in part to the stagnation of the economies of industrialized countries.125.	While  in the international political and economic arenas  interdependent and complementary relationships among nations are generally deepening  co-operative relationships between oil-producing and oil-consuming countries have not yet taken hold. Industrialized and developing countries continue to grope for an international order that is mutually beneficial.126.	These are no more than simple illustrations. Yet  as we look ahead on the basis of these experiences to the coming decade  the prospects for the international community do not allow us to be totally optimistic. At the same time  we need not be unduly pessimistic.127.	As I pointed out last year at the thirty-third session of the General Assembly  mutual dependence among nations and regions of the world transcends differences in social systems  size  abundance of natural resources or stage of development and this interdependence is growing at an increasingly rapid pace.  Thus  no nation can maintain peace within its own borders unless peace prevails elsewhere in the world; and no country can plan its own economic prosperity in isolation from the development of the world economy as a whole.128.	These are the realities which all the countries of the world must approach dispassionately. In our quest for world peace and prosperity we must recognize the interdependence among nations as well as regions and help each other and complement each other in a spirit of accommodation. If each nation bases its foreign policy on that recognition  I am convinced there will be a way to solve the difficult problems besetting all of us. One of the major tasks for the 1980s will be for each of us to renew our efforts in this direction.129.	My country maintains as its fundamental national principle the pursuit of peace and the refusal to become a military Power that could pose a threat to another country. Thus the basic objective of Japan's foreign policy is to contribute to world peace and prosperity by fully wielding its economic strength and political influence. This policy  of course  is based on the recognition that there can be no peace and prosperity in Japan unless there is peace and prosperity throughout the world. We are determined to strengthen Japan's diplomatic efforts in international political  economic and social areas in order to contribute further to the peace and prosperity of the world community in the coming decade. In so doing  it is the policy of my Government to explore actively from a global perspective the ways in which it can help to achieve the stability and development of countries in various parts of the world  giving attention to the Asian and Pacific region in particular  but also recognizing the importance of the Middle East  Africa and Latin America.130.	With this perception of the present  and looking ahead to the future  I should like at this time to explain briefly my Government's position on the major problems confronting the international community today.131.	I should like to comment first of all upon the situation in Asia.132.	One of the most urgent tasks confronting us now is to secure peace and stability in South-East Asia.133.	The members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] are steadily pursuing courses of national development based on the progress of regional co-operation. However  serious anxiety regarding the security of these nations is resulting from the conflicts and tensions in the Indo-Chinese peninsula and from the outflow of the refugees from that area. In particular  the problem of Indo-Chinese refugees is no longer solely a matter of humanitarian concern; it has become a destabilizing element in the Asian and Pacific region.134.	Although the United Nations Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia  held in Geneva last July  achieved significant results  thanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General and other United Nations officials  as well as to those of the various countries concerned  the problem has not been fundamentally resolved. Indeed  each country is called upon to strive even harder in its own way to help to alleviate the difficult situation.135.	First  it is necessary that Viet Nam should continue to exert every effort to stop the illegal departures of its people as it stated it would do at the Geneva Conference.136.	Secondly  in order to provide relief for the refugees as well as to lighten the burden of the first-asylum countries  international co-operation should be further strengthened in the fields of the permanent resettlement of refugees and of financial contributions to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.137.	Determined to take an active part in this international endeavour  Japan decided to provide half the funds required this year for the High Commissioner's Assistance Programme for Indo-Chinese Refugees. At the same time  we are making efforts to promote the resettlement of refugees in Japan and intend gradually to expand the target figure for resettlement in Japan  depending on the progress of the programme.138.	I feel it is important to stress  however  that the Indo-Chinese refugee problem cannot be solved in any real way unless the peace and stability of this region is assured. In order to secure peace and stability in IndoChina  it is essential that lasting peace be restored in Kampuchea. I am of the opinion that the only way to accomplish this is for all foreign forces to withdraw from Kampuchean territory so that the Kampuchean people may determine their own political future  free from any foreign intervention.â139.	This is in no sense an easy task  but we must do everything possible to accomplish it. I think it is important for us  as a first step  to make every effort to promote the common recognition among the countries concerned  including all the parties to the Kampuchean conflict  of the importance of restoring lasting peace in Kampuchea. It is on the basis of this belief that I have repeatedly proposed that a conference be convened in which the countries concerned  including all the parties to the Kampuchean conflict  would participate.140.	In conjunction with these long-range efforts  I should like to call attention to the very urgent task that demands immediate action in Kampuchea. In the devastated nation of Kampuchea  millions of people are stricken with disease and are in danger of starvation. There is undoubtedly a wide range of political positions and opinions regarding Kampuchea's future. But whatever political position one may take  one cannot ignore the millions of Kampuchean people facing death due to starvation and disease.141.	I am convinced that humanitarian concerns must transcend political differences and that it is of absolute importance for all parties  both inside and outside Kampuchea  to take concerted action to bring to the Kampuchean people relief from the starvation and disease that makes a living hell for them. What the Kampuchean people urgently need right now is not an exercise in political polemics  but rather food and medical supplies. It is our responsibility as human beings to see that the Kampuchean people get the supplies they need.142.	First of all  I should like to appeal for the co-operation of all the parties to the conflict in Kampuchea in ensuring that these humanitarian relief supplies reach those who are in need of them. I call specifically upon all the parties to the conflict to come to an immediate agreement with the international organizations concerned on a practical arrangement to ensure that such international relief measures be implemented safely and promptly.143.	Secondly  I should like to urge strongly that all the countries concerned exert every possible effort to make such an arrangement  and that as many countries as possible participate in and co-operate with such international relief measures.144.	The Government of Japan is prepared to cooperate to the fullest extent of its abilities in these international relief measures.145.	Given the widespread and profound sympathy the Japanese people have for the Kampuchean people in their catastrophic privation  the Government of Japan is determined to do everything possible  by mobilizing the resources of both government and private sectors  to extend such co-operative assistance and relief.146.	Even as I express these views on the Kampuchean problemâthe most serious problem in Asia todayâthe implementation of relief measures is being further delayed. Profoundly distressing are the movements that appear to be starting in Kampuchea which might lead again to an intensification of the fighting there.147.	No action must be allowed which would further aggravate the situation in Kampuchea  whatever the reason for such action may be.148.	I therefore strongly urge all the parties  including Viet Nam  who are directly involved in the conflict in Kampuchea to exercise prudence and restraint and I reiterate my appeal to all the countries and parties concerned to make every effort to achieve peace in Kampuchea.149.	Another major task confronting us in Asia is the relaxation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. At present  the dialogue between South and North Korea is suspended. The tripartite talks  proposed jointly to North Korea by President Park of the Republic of Korea and President Carter of the United States  have not yet come about. Since the building of genuine peace and stability on the Korean peninsula is a matter of deep concern to Japan  we hope that a substantive dialogue between South and North Korea will be resumed as promptly as possible. For our part  we will continue to co-operate with all countries concerned to foster an international climate that is conducive to the relaxation of tensions on the peninsula.150.	The problem in the Middle East is one of the most serious problems confronting the world today. Japan maintains the position that it is essential that peace in the Middle East be just  lasting and comprehensive. Thus  Japan thinks the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel should be a first step towards achieving a comprehensive peace in the area. We believe that such a peace should be achieved through the complete implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (L967) and 338 (1973) and the recognition of and respect for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination in accordance with the United Nations Charter.151.	We believe that the future development of the negotiations now under way between Egypt and Israel on the question of the autonomy of the West Bank and Gaza will have a serious influence upon whether or not a comprehensive peace will be achieved in the Middle East. From this point of view  we strongly hope that  to avoid further delay in establishing peace in the area  the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the peace process will be realized  with Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization mutually recognizing each other's position.152.	I strongly call on the participants involved in the talks regarding the autonomy of the West Bank and Gaza to display courage and flexibility in the negotiations in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions in order to achieve a result that is satisfactory to all the parties concerned. In this connexion  I should like to urge Israel to refrain from any measures that would be detrimental to the atmosphere of the negotiations  such as the establishment of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and its military actions in southern Lebanon.153.	Firm in the belief that stability and development in the Middle East are essential to the peace and prosperity of the entire world  Japan will continue  in accordance with its independent policy  to co-operate actively in the development efforts of the countries in that region  Out of this concern as well  we strongly hope that a just and lasting peace will be established as soon as possible.154.	The nations of Africa are Japan's vital partners in promoting world peace and prosperity. It is thus my country's policy to extend vigorous co-operation to the nation-building programmes of the African States.155.	The situation in Africa is  however  troubled in some areas. In particular  it is a matter of deep concern to Japan that a great number of people in southern Africa continue to suffer under the yoke of racial discrimination. I am profoundly distressed that progress towards the elimination of apartheid policies in South Africa has been so meagre.156.	Regarding the question of Namibia  the Government of South Africa has embarked upon a dangerous course by seeking an internal settlement and totally disregarding the efforts of the United Nations. This is a serious situation and must be considered a challenge to the international community. I strongly urge South Africa to reconsider its policies and to co-operate with the United Nations in achieving Namibia's independence through elections held under the supervision of the United Nations. I should like on this occasion to confirm once again Japan's readiness actively to participate in and co-operate with the United Nations efforts to foster Namibia's peaceful transition to independence.157.	With regard to Southern Rhodesia  Japan sincerely hopes that independence under genuine majority rule will be peacefully realized as early as possible  and thus highly appreciates the agreement reached at the last Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting  On the basis of this agreement  I earnestly hope that the parties concerned will continue  in a spirit of accommodation  their constructive talks at the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference now under way in London with the aim of establishing genuine majority rule in Southern Rhodesia.158.	The nations of Latin America are extremely important and are expected to assume increasingly greater responsibilities and roles in working for world peace and prosperity.159.	Recently I visited several Latin American nations  and was encouraged by the efforts they are making toward economic and social development and democratization. There is a growing trend among the nations of Latin America to search for peace and prosperity in an interdependence of broader scope which would extend beyond a regional framework. I believe it will be the task in the 1980s of nations in other regions of the world to co-operate with the nations of Latin America as they strive to attain the fulfilment of their aspirations.160.	There have been movements to direct attention and criticism to specific issues in the democratization processes of certain countries. I rather feel that democratization in these countries would be best promoted if we tried  while making conscious efforts to understand the positions and processes unique to each country  to help them with their democratization efforts.161.	Concurrent with the efforts to resolve the various regional problems which I have just mentioned  our important task is to effect  step by step  feasible disarm-ament measures.162.	I therefore welcome the signing of the second SALT Treaty by the United States and the Soviet Union  and I wish to express the hope that future negotiations at the third round of SALT will result in further concrete progress in the quantitative reduction and qualitative control of strategic arms. I should like at this time to make a strong appeal once again for the strengthening of the regime for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  establishing as soon as possible a comprehensive nuclear test ban  and promoting disarmament negotiations relating to non-nuclear weapons  including the prohibition of chemical weapons.163.	Efforts exerted solely in the areas I have mentioned will not suffice to secure world peace and prosperity. Problems pertaining to the world economy present us with important and urgent tasks.164.	First  the world economy is beset with a number of difficult problems  notably those having to do with energy  inflation and unemployment. In order to foster the stable expansion of the world economy under the current difficult circumstances  it is imperative that each country seek to strengthen its efforts towards international co-operation with a view to achieving its own economic prosperity within the framework of the stable expansion of the world economy as a whole  and in consideration of the interdependence between domestic and world economies.165.	Fully recognizing the responsibility and the role it must assume in the world economy  Japan will continue to make efforts that will foster international cooperation  including those designed further to open its domestic markets.166.	With regard to the energy question which will surely have a major impact on the future of the world economy  I should like to point out that it is very important for industrialized countries to ensure that the various measures agreed upon at the Tokyo Economic Summit are faithfully implemented. These relate  in particular  to restraints on petroleum imports  the increased utilization of nuclear and alternative sources of energy  as well as to the research and development of new sources of energy. I believe that restrained oil consumption by industrialized countries  including my own  will help to foster mutual trust between oil- producing countries and oil-consuming countries and thus lead to the creation of a more co-operative relationship between them regarding the efficient utilization of energy  which is a task for all mankind.167.	Further  because the energy problem is an important matter that concerns countries throughout the world  I believe it would be useful for the United Nations to consider how it could be best dealt with. Thus I shall follow with interest the initiatives to be taken by the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  on this subject.â168.	Another area of importance is the nation- building and human resources development efforts of developing countries. The qualitative improvement and quantitative expansion of economic and technical cooperation with these efforts must continue to be one of the most important policies of industrialized countries  including Japan. I should like particularly to emphasize that these efforts are all the more important at this time when the world economy is confronted with many difficult problems. Further  industrialized countries should make positive efforts to respond to the expectations and aspirations of developing countries for stabilizing their export of primary commodities and for the stable expansion of their export of manufactured products.169.	Japan  itself an Asian country  was late in joining the modern international community  and thus had to struggle resolutely in order to catch up with developed countries. Consequently  Japan has deep sympathy with the desires and aspirations of developing countries for economic and social development. We believe that it is the responsibility of industrialized countriesâ including Japanâto respond to the legitimate expectations of developing countries regarding their economic and social development.170.	Accordingly  Japan makes it a basic policy to co-operate to the utmost of its capabilities with developing countries in their self-reliant efforts to promote their economic and social development.171.	The fact that Japan is making efforts to double its official development assistance within three years; that it is working toward untying assistance as well as softening the terms; and finally  that it has taken an active role for the establishment of the Common Fund  are all in conformity with its basic foreign policy. Japan will continue firmly to maintain this basic policy  and  in particular  intends to make greater efforts to expand the volume of its official development assistance and improve the ratio of such assistance to its gross national product.172.	In order to solve North-South problems  a continuous dialogue is necessary. In my assessment  the fifth session of UNCTAD  held last May  was an important process for lending a future orientation to the North-South dialogue against the background of the agreement on the basic elements of the Common Fund. Through this dialogue an increasing awareness of the interdependent and complementary relationship between the North and South should be developed from a long-term perspective  thus laying the foundation for genuine co-operation. This  in my view  is a prerequisite to the solution of the problem.173.	On the basis of these considerations  I believe it is important that the new international development strategy which we are about to formulate should provide targets for the efforts of the international community in promoting the economic and social development of developing countries. In this sense  the new international development strategy should be a joint undertaking involving both developing and developed countries.174.	Furthermore  the new international development strategy should be formulated on the basis of realistic and practical considerations  giving due attention to the alleviation of absolute poverty  which is said to be still affecting more than 800 million people throughout the world  and in a manner which would enable relatively advanced developing countries to make further progress and thereby contribute to the expansion of the world economy as well.175.	Finally  I should like to say a few words about measures to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace.176.	It is a regrettable truth that the role played thus far by the United Nations in the maintenance of world peace has fallen far short of its original goals.177.	It will be difficult to try to change all at once the way in which the United Nations has functioned since its establishment more than 30 years ago. However  the role of the United Nations must be expanded to meet the changing needs of the international community  where world-wide interdependence continues to develop and the need for international co-operation and harmony is becoming increasingly urgent.178.	Therefore  as a first step in expanding the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace  I should like to propose that its fact-finding functions regarding international disputes be strengthened. If the United Nations could maintain a firm grasp upon situations involving international disputes and present the international community with objective facts  it would be able  by appealing directly to world opinion  to exert pressure on countries concerned and thus facilitate the settlement of disputes.179.	For example  if I may at this point suggest a measure to be taken  each time an important dispute arose a representative of the Secretary-General would be stationed in the area for a certain period to investigate the facts of the situation  and would report to the Secretary-General from time to time. The need for measures of this kind may be readily understood when one considers the developments in Indo-China this past year.180.	Therefore  I believe that the United Nations should make maximum use of the fact-finding functions conferred upon the various organs under the United Nations Charter. In this way the United Nations would be able on its own to investigate the facts which would serve as a basis for debate in the world body. I should like to point out particularly that this is something the United Nations could start doing today if its Member States were willing to have it do so.181.	As I have previously mentioned  I am convinced that  as interdependent relations among countries and regions continue to grow  it will be our task in the 1980s to develop a basis for international co-operation that will lead to world peace and prosperity.182.	This is a tremendously difficult undertaking. But now  with the existence of weapons capable of annihilating all of mankind and with the emerging recognition that the natural resources and space available for man's use are limited  the people of each country must consider their own peace and prosperity as inseparable from that of the world. Each country must realize its responsibility and play an active role accordingly in achieving this common goal of mankind. This is  in my view  the only path open to the international community.183.	There are indeed a great number of problems in the international community  including those between East and West  North and South  and among industrialized nations as well.184.	I am convinced that solutions to all these problems could be found if each country would refrain from adopting attitudes of confrontation by insisting on its own views and interests and would enter discussions open-heartedly for the shared goal of achieving world peace and prosperityâa long-cherished and common hope of mankind. I believe that the willingness of each country to open itself to such discussions will be the key to determining the course for the international community in the 1980s.185.	In closing  I should like to reaffirm my belief in man's powers of reason and innate wisdom. On the basis of this belief  I am confident that  as we look ahead to the decade of the 1980s  the prospects for the international community are promising."
"72",3680,"KEN",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  my delegation has great pleasure in seeing you presiding over this Assembly. Your country  the United Republic of Tanzania  and mine are neighbours  but our peoples are not simply neighbours: they are one people. They have a common history  language and culture and  without any doubt  common aspirations. We therefore truly share in full the pride of having one of our brothers receiving this honour from the international community in recognition of the great personal qualities of leadership and devotion which he has always demonstrated at the United Nations.113.	I wish to pay a tribute also to the outgoing President  Ambassador Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  for the distinguished service he rendered to this Organization during his presidency. I was honoured to serve as one of his Vice-Presidents and I know the skills and devotion he brought to the job.114.	The past year has also seen more and varied initiatives by the Secretary-General in dealing with the many problems that call for the attention of this Organization. Mr. Waldheim's extensive travels to the problem areas to see for himself and render assistance deserve commendation and encouragement.115.	This Organization has continued to grow in size and complexity. The demands on its staff are always increasing. We believe its internal institutional problems and staff pressures are bound to increase  and it is our hope that these problems will receive constant attention to avoid the recurrence of the disruption we experienced last year.116.	We take pleasure in welcoming Saint Lucia as a new Member whose application we were proud to sponsor. It is our hope that the remaining pockets of colonialism and other problems that stand in the way of the universal membership of the United Nations will be eliminated in the coming months.117.	Perhaps I should explain why the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not delivering this statement this year. Our democratic system of government requires that those who represent the people in the legislature and in the Government should surrender their mandates every five years and submit themselves to a competitive electoral process. The President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Daniel Arap Moi  has dissolved parliament  which includes the President himself as well as the Ministers  and has called for general elections on 8 November  which explains why my Minister is too busy in this constituency to be in New York this week.118.	I wish now to join others who have drawn the attention of the international community to the areas of tension which continue to threaten international peace and security. The situation in southern Africa has deteriorated over the past year. In Southern Rhodesia a puppet regime was installed earlier this year despite many voices of warning that it would not provide a solution to the basic problems of that British colony. The puppet regime has behaved no better than its master  the racist minority regime. The military forces of Southern Rhodesia  which are in any case not under the control of the puppet Government  have continued to mount aggressive raids against the neighbouring States. The violence has increased both outside and inside Southern Rhodesia  and the loss of human life and the suffering of the ordinary people have reached levels no one could have foreseen a year ago. The only bright spot in the miserable story of that colony is the agreement of the racist regime and its puppet to negotiate a settlement with the freedom fighters under the leadership of the administering Power. Clearly everyone's hope is fixed on the current negotiations now in progress at the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London  and my delegation can only encourage everyone involved to seek a permanent solution to the problem of decolonizing Southern Rhodesia now. This looks like the last chance for a peaceful settlement. The consequences of failure now are too ghastly to contemplate.119.	The problem of Namibia persists. The racist regime of South Africa has finally implemented its version of the ""internal settlement"". It has accomplished its objective through the transfer of political and administrative power to the puppet Constituent Assembly it had earlier installed in the capital of Namibia. By taking this action  South Africa has clearly demonstrated its arrogance in rejecting a compromise formula which could have brought independence to Namibia through peaceful means.120.	The introduction of ""internal settlement"" was implemented at a time when South Africa was engaged in protracted negotiations with the five Western Powers. It is now clear to the whole world that South Africa used the negotiations merely to buy time while preparing its own plans. Kenya has always warned that the racist regime cannot and should not be trusted. The negotiations are quite clearly being used to buy time for South Africa to carry out its plans to install and entrench a puppet regime in Namibia. It is now possible to conclude that the United Nations effort to solve the problem of Namibia peacefully has been frustrated by South Africa. In our view  therefore  the United Nations should take decisive action to end South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia. We must call on the Security Council to impose mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa.121.	While on the question of decolonization  we must express the hope that Morocco will quickly find a way of co-operating with the OAU to end the problem of Western Sahara through the exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of that Territory. We cannot see any viable alternative open to Morocco. Therefore it is our duty to encourage Morocco to take the bold decisions required now  rather than later.122.	The problem of the policies of apartheid of South Africa is bound to continue to call for determined and sustained action by this Organization and all right- thinking people in the world. It is a crime against humanity that needs to be eliminated from human society before it spreads its destructive cells  as cancer does in the human body. This Organization must continue to lead the way in the fight against apartheid and initiate measures calculated to bring about change in South Africa. We must always remember that over 20 million of our brothers and sisters in South Africa continue to suffer under this inhuman system and that we have a responsibility and a duty to help them win their freedom.123.	Now I should like to refer to the situation in the Middle East. While we note current efforts to solve the problems of that troubled area  we should reaffirm out total commitment to the full implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  while recognizing that the Palestinian people must be a party to any durable peace settlement. Failure to do so will only perpetuate a situation that endangers international peace and security. We have consistently expressed our view that three conditions must be satisfied if the problem of the Middle East is to be solved. These are: first  the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab lands occupied since 1967; secondly  recognition of the right of all States in the region to live in peace within recognized boundaries in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council; and  thirdly  the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to an independent and sovereign homeland.124.	We believe that efforts that overlook these basic requirements  whatever the motivations may be  are bound to fail. It is for this reason that we would urge all concerned to be realistic and go the whole distance rather than take half measures that may only serve to complicate the situation.125.	The problem of Cyprus continues to cause anxiety since little progress has been achieved in resolving it during the past year. We continue to believe that  if left alone  the people of Cyprus would be capable of resolving their differences. However as long as one section of the population continues to rely on aggressive external support  the chances of developing the climate of cooperation and accommodation which is needed for fruitful negotiations will remain slight. We believe the willingness of the Government of Cyprus to discuss the establishment of a federal form of government in Cyprus is a step forward which should lead to the solution of the problem. We would therefore encourage and support further initiatives in that direction  and hope the Secretary-General will report more progress in the months ahead.126.	The tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted entirely to disarmament  was an important factor in the long but slow effort to achieve disarmament. It gave us the opportunity to examine more critically all aspects of disarmament and to draw from that examination a comprehensive disarmament programme that  if implemented  would lead to a more secure world  free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.127.	From the time of the establishment of the United Nations  whose birth coincided with the first explosion and use of nuclear weapons  the world body has pressed Member States to heed the danger involved in an unchecked arms race. That request has not been heeded and  as a result  we are faced with the grim picture of escalation and proliferation in the manufacture of those horrible weapons. The first Disarmament Decade  which was declared by the General Assembly in 1969  is now coming to an endâand yet the international community has done very little to check the arms race. The end of the Decade finds the world faced with economic problems that are closely linked in many ways to the arms race. The arms race is a waste of scarce economic resources that no country can afford to ignore and in many cases it has reached absurd levels. It is reported that last year alone 48 nuclear-weapon tests were carried out. That is nearly one test per week. There is clearly an urgent need for a comprehensive nuclear test ban covering all environments. The Committee on Disarmament in Geneva should at its annual session in 1980give priority to the consideration of  and meaningful negotiations on  a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We believe that if that is done  it will be an important step towards the eventual ban of all nuclear-weapon tests and the total destruction of all stockpiles of nuclear weapons. The accumulated experience of human history shows quite clearly that if we do not end this mad rush to manufacture more and more terrible weapons of destruction  we are headed for self-destruction and the annihilation of human civilization. It does not make any sense  nor is it logical  to spend $400 billion annually on the manufacture of armaments when inadequate re-sources are devoted to economic development and the social welfare of people everywhere.128.	The progress of negotiations on a convention on chemical weapons in the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva was very slow indeed. Kenya is disappointed that some States members of the Committee on Disarmament did not appear ready to start concrete negotiations on the item. We hope that those States will take a positive approach when the Committee resumes its negotiations early next year.129.	The need to build and strengthen trust and confidence among nations is urgent and imperative and Kenya stands ready and willing to play its part. The time has come for the adoption by this Assembly of a convention that would guarantee the security of non- nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons  as a first step on the road to strengthening international understanding.130.	While on the subject of disarmament  my delegation continues to support the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. There has been no progress in the preparations for a conference to further this declared goal  since the two Powers most directly concerned have not yet played their part. We trust that there will be a change of heart in the months ahead  to allow negotiations to be undertaken for the establishment of a zone of peace in the region. Success in that effort would itself be a contribution to the larger effort for disarmament.131.	I wish to turn now to the subject of the ongoing negotiations at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We consider that the time has come for the Conference to conclude its work. It has now taken it more than 10 years to conduct negotiations but no convention or treaty has emerged from its deliberations. Although Kenya recognizes the intricate nature of the issues involved  that is not to say that negotiations should go on for ever. We would therefore appeal to all concerned to make a deliberate effort to reach agreement at the next session of the Conference and to present to us an authoritative instrument to facilitate the orderly exploitation of the vast resources of the sea.132.	Last year  we learned that the Conference was about to conclude its work at the session to be held this year. We were therefore disappointed to learn that that did not prove possible. However  we note from the results achieved thus far that the time was well spent. We wish to reiterate our sincere belief that the next two sessions of the Conference will mark an end to the negotiations and that a draft convention will soon be submitted to this body for adoption. We have noted with appreciation the progress made in the various negotiating groups. It appears that most of the areas of"" disagreement have been the subject of more or less successful negotiations  thus paving the way for an eventual agreement on the issues involved. The Kenyan delegation to the next session of the Conference will therefore seek to persuade other delegations that the work of the Conference should be concluded without any further delay because we believe it is possible to conclude the work in the coming year.133.	The world economic scene continues to be unstable and threatening to the survival of many economically small nations. The progress of the negotiations in the United Nations and in other international forums towards the achievement of the New International Economic Order has been very disappointing. Most developed countries appear to approach the North- South dialogue without any enthusiasm. The fifth session of UNCTAD held in Manila in May 1979  ended in complete failure  to the great disappointment of the developing countries. To date  no substantive agreements have been reached on the creation of an Integrated Programme for Commodities  despite the commitments entered into at the fourth session of UNCTAD  held at Nairobi in 1976. The Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy has so far not achieved positive results in its work. The list of such failures is long and I could go on enumerating them.134.	We consider that the international community should resolve to tackle these problems with determination in the months ahead if progress and agreement are to be attained.135.	My delegation supports the move to transform UNIDO into a specialized agency. This transformation should enable UNIDO to carry out its mandate more effectively. We hope that the Third General Conference of UNIDO  to be held in New Delhi next January  will elaborate concrete measures for the accelerated and effective implementation of the Lima Declaration and Plan of Action within a specified time-frame.136.	I wish now to turn to the question of science and technology. We believe that science and technology should be directed towards improving the quality of life by enriching the social  economic and cultural needs of man and fostering the development and rational utilization of natural and human resources. Bearing this in mind  my Government supported fully the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held in Vienna in August this year. Although the Conference did not meet all our expectations  it made a significant contribution to the continuing effort to deal with the question of science and technology for development. The decision of the Conference to create an Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development was a major step in itself. If this is followed vigorously by the projected study by the intergovernmental group of experts on all relevant arrangements for the operation of that Committee  we have no doubt that a suitable framework for international co-operation in this field will have been established. My delegation regrets  however  that the Vienna Conference did not reach agreement on other important issues to which the developing countries attached great importance. I sincerely hope that the Intergovernmental Committee on Science and Technology for Development which this Assembly will be called upon to establish formally will be charged with the duty of continuing the discussions and negotiations on the remaining issues.137.	The transfer of technology to developing countries is of crucial importance to the economic and industrial development of those countries. There is an imperative need to strengthen the indigenous technological capabilities of the developing countries in order to accelerate the process of their technological transformation and development  while increasing the international flow of all forms of technology on favourable terms. The developed countries should facilitate the acquisition  adaptation  development and application of technology to development by the developing countries in order to speed up their economic development. These measures cannot be achieved without the full co-operation of the developed countries at all levels. My Government has established a national centre which serves as a focal-point for monitoring and co-ordinating national and international activities in the field of technology  including those relating to the serious problem of reverse transfer of technology.138.	While noting with appreciation the efforts made so far to resolve the remaining issues in the negotiations within the United Nations Conference on an International Code of Conduct on the Transfer of Technology  my delegation expresses grave concern at the lack of political will which explains the very slow progress made in negotiations so far.139.	 The United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries  held in Buenos Aires last year  demonstrated very clearly that the developing countries have the ability and willingness to co-operate in many areas of mutual interest to them and that they can utilize their own resources to the maximum and to the mutual benefit of their peoples. It is my hope that the United Nations system as a whole will support the developing countries in their endeavours in this field. My delegation would like to reaffirm our conviction that economic co-operation among developing countries is a vital element in the over-ail effort towards the establishment of the New International Economic Order. There is plenty of scope for co-operation among developing countries in trade and technology  and it is our sincere hope that there will be more evidence of this in future.140.	My Government views with grave concern the current energy crisis  which threatens the entire world community. We should have taken notice after the crisis of 1973/1974 that world petroleum supplies would soon be depleted and that it was therefore necessary to make greater use of alternative sources of energy. The oil-importing countries should have taken steps to develop their indigenous energy resources more urgently. We have for several years now felt that the international community should convene a conference on new and renewable sources of energy in order to deal with this global problem. The General Assembly wisely decided at its thirty-third regular session last year to convene the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy in 1981  I hope that my Government's offer to play host to that Conference in Nairobi will receive favourable response from this Assembly.141. In conclusion  I should like to state that  despite the many problems that face the world community today  the future is bright. It is not possible to look back to a past when it was possible for so many nations to gather as we do today in this forum to discuss and plan what actions to take jointly to solve problems that face man. When all else looks frustrating one must pause and recognize that there was never a time like this in the history of man. We must be realistic  and if we are we cannot help but be filled with optimism for the future."
"73",3751,"KHM",34,1979,"ï»¿Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Democratic Kampuchea  I wish first to extend my warmest congratulations to you upon your unanimous election to the high office of President of this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. It is a well-deserved tribute to your intense and fruitful activities as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoplesâa tribute to your wisdom and experience  as well as to your great country  the United Republic of Tanzania  with which my country  Democratic Kampuchea  maintains friendly relations. My delegation wishes to assure you of our complete cooperation in ensuring that this session may prove most fruitful.273.	I also wish to pay an enthusiastic tribute to Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly  who guided our work last year with wisdom and perspicacity  thus contributing to the strengthening of the United Nations Charter and enabling our Organization to fulfil its role in defence of world peace and the independence of States.274.	May I further pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who during the past year has spared no effort in the search for ways to ensure peace and security in the world  particularly in South-East Asia  where the situation has been steadily worsening as a result of Vietnamese aggression against Kampuchea.275.	I also extend a warm welcome and sincere congratulations to Saint Lucia on its admission to the United Nations.276.	Lastly  I am pleased to convey to all the representatives here of countries that cherish peace  justice and independence the cordial greetings and profound gratitude of the people and Government of Democratic Kampuchea. We shall never forget the sympathy  encouragement and support which their peoples and Governments have given and will continue to give  both within the United Nations and elsewhere at the international level  to the just struggle of the Kampuchean people to ensure that an independent  united  peaceful  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea shall live forever.277.	The past year has seen the struggle of the peoples committed to peace  justice and independence in the world win new political and economic victories despite the armed interventions  threats  pressures and manoeuvres of all kinds to which they have been subjected by the forces of expansionism  imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  zionism  racism and apartheid.278.	The role of those peoples who are devoted to peace  justice and independence is asserting itself more and more on all five continents.279.	The countries of South-East Asia are taking a growing part in international affairs as a new factor for world peace  stability and security in the face of mounting perils threatening the entire region  particularly since the war of aggression and genocide perpetrated by Viet Nam against Democratic Kampuchea. We are gratified that the concept of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality initiated by the ASEAN countries is gaining ground.280.	In East Asia the just struggle of the valiant Korean people to achieve the independent  peaceful reunification of their country in accordance with the three principles and five-point guidelines formulated by President Kim II Sung is enjoying ever-broader support throughout the world. We are most pleased with the progress achieved in the cause of the reunification of Korea. We are pleased also to see the countries of the Pacific facing up firmly and successfully to the expansionist aims of hegemonism.281.	Most of the countries of South-East Asia are vigorously defending their independence and are looking to their security with increased vigilance. The coastal countries of the Indian Ocean  their existence as independent countries threatened by the presence of foreign military bases and by great-Power rivalry  have succeeded  through their persevering and united efforts  in gaining support for their just appeal for the transformation of that region into a zone of peace.282.	The People's Republic of China is more devoted than ever to the noble principles of anti-hegemonism and to the defence of the just struggle of peoples for independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  peace and justice. We warmly hail the historic victories won by the great Chinese people over the last 30 years.283.	In the Middle East  peace and security must of necessity be preceded by the exercise of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  whose valiant struggle under the leadership of the PLO  its sole authentic representative  remains in the last analysis the decisive factor for victory. The people of Kampuchea  themselves the victims of a war of aggression and genocide  feel deeply the tragedy of the Palestinian people. Our Government and people are against the Israeli fait accompli and against Israel's illegal occupation of Arab territories since 1967. This is a matter of principle.284.	In southern Africa  the indomitable struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and Azania for their independence and freedom  under the respective leadership of the Patriotic Front  SWAPO  the African National Congress of South Africa and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania  is dealing powerful blows at the puppet Salisbury regime and the Fascist apartheid regime of Pretoria. We are convinced that  whatever trials may have to be surmounted  the peoples of southern Africa will most certainly win final victory.285.	In Latin America  the countries of that continent and of the Caribbean region are waging a determined  united struggle to strengthen their political and economic independence and preserve their natural resources.286.	In America and in Europe the peoples are resolutely pursuing their struggle for peace and independence  increasing more and more their opposition to recourse to the use of armed force for the purpose of interfering in the internal affairs of other States  and refusing to play the dangerous game of the superpowers.287.	But  alongside this positive record  important political events have marked the international scene during the past year and continue today to arouse profound concern in the international community and in the United Nations itself. Two painful tragedies dominate these events in South-East Asia: on the one hand  the war of aggression and genocide  of which Democratic Kampuchea and its people are the victims; and  on the other hand  the tragic fate of more than a million people from Kampuchea  from Viet Nam and from Laos who are the victims of persecution by the Hanoi authorities  who by their inhuman policy have compelled them at the risk of their lives to seek refuge in the countries of South-East Asia and throughout the world.288.	There is one irrefutable fact known to all the world. On 25 December 1978  Christmas Day  the Hanoi authorities sent 120 000 soldiers  supported by several hundred tanks  heavy artillery and many planes and warships  to attack Kampuchea from all sides  to put it to fire and sword and thus to trample underfoot the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of a sovereign  non-aligned State and Member of the United Nations  in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of non-alignment and of the United Nations Charter.289.	After 10 months of frenzied destruction  plunder  and massacres by the Vietnamese aggressors  Kampucheaâthat old and glorious land of Angkor  with a host of artistic and cultural treasures  with a wealth of natural and agricultural resources which the skilful hands of our people  after the devastating five-year war of 1970-1975  lovingly transformed into a country which was verdant in all seasons  with dikes  water reservoirs  irrigation channels and an immense expanse of paddy- fieldsâhas today  become a country of desolation  an arid country where nothing grows  even at the height of the rainy season. Entire cities  administrative centres  thousands of agricultural co-operatives  schools  institutes of scientific and technical training  factories and hospitals  dikes  water reservoirs  thousands of kilometres of irrigation channelsâthe result of three years of toil by our peopleâhave been systematically razed and destroyed by the Vietnamese aggressors. More distressing and serious still is the fact that the Vietnamese aggressors have already massacred more than 500 000 of our fellow citizensâmen  women  children and old people. At the same time  in their criminal design to make our people die of starvation so as to break their resistance  they have prevented them from doing work in agriculture and have destroyed more than a million hectares of our paddy-fields and countryside  all our agricultural implements and more than a million of our beasts of burden  oxen and buffaloes  which are part of our livestock. It is because of this criminal and Machiavellian policy of the Hanoi authorities that our people suffer so gravely today from famine. Already more than half a million of our fellow citizensâand especially women  children and old peopleâhave died of hunger  thus bringing the total number of victims in the course of the 10 months of the Vietnamese aggression to more than 1 million.290.	Concurrently with this policy of genocide  the Hanoi authorities have chased hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens from their homes  from their ancestral lands  reducing them to the status of miserable refugees in Thailand. In so doing  the Hanoi authorities have unmasked before international public opinion their true annexationist and expansionist aims in Kampuchea  in whose eastern regions  maritime provinces in the south-east and the area of the Great Lakes they have implanted  in place of our compatriots who were massacred or chased from their homes  more than 250 000 Vietnamese settlers brought directly from North Viet Nam.291.	Today  all of Kampuchea is the scene of plunder by the Vietnamese hordes who have carried away to Viet Nam whatever they could find: objects d'art of gold or silver  precious stones  rare pieces from our museums  from the Silver Pagoda and from the Royal Palace  our stocks of rice and textiles  machinery dismantled from our factories  cars and trucks  and so forth. As for the sculptured and bas-relief masterpieces at Angkor  high points of the Khmer civilization and the cultural and artistic heritage of all mankind  the Hanoi aggressors have concealed them in coffins so as to carry them off to Viet Nam.292.	This war of aggression has caused immense devastation in Kampuchea and immeasurable suffering and grief to a degree never known before in the 2 000-year history of our people. It has brought to nought all the economic and social achievements of our peoples. This genocidal war is intended to exterminate the nation and people of Kampuchea by famine and massacre  and to make Kampuchea an integral part of Viet Nam. It is the most cruel and barbarous war that has ever been waged in this twentieth century in which we live.293.	All these undeniable facts prove that the words of the Hanoi authorities  which seemed so charitable  about the suffering and misfortunes of our people  are in the last analysis nothing but political hypocrisy and slogans in the service of their criminal design.294.	In their vain attempts to justify their aggression against Democratic Kampuchea  the Hanoi authorities have not hesitated to resort to the most vile and outrageous lies  slander and half-truths. Nevertheless  they were no longer able to camouflage their regional expansionist ambition  the reality of which is no longer debated. Everyone is aware of the danger it poses to world peace and security.295.	This Vietnamese expansionism is not something recent. Already in the seventeenth century  the Vietnamese  coming down from Tonkin  which is present- day North Viet Nam  annexed and completely absorbed the Islamic Kingdom of Champa  which is now central Viet Nam  so that at present there is no longer any Cham citizen.296.	After the absorption of Champa the Vietnamese expansionists went even farther south and  up to very recently  annexed 65 000 square kilometres of Kampuchean territory formed by the western bank-of the Donai River and the Mekong Delta  and which constitutes present-day South Viet Nam.297.	The Vietnamese Communist Party has  since 1930âwhen it came into being (it was then called the Indo-Chinese Communist Party)âset for itself as a target the establishment of an ""Indo-Chinese Federation""  made up of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  and placed under the domination of Viet Nam. This ""Indo-Chinese Federation"" was but a way-station towards the total absorption of Kampuchea and Laos by Viet Nam  as it had already done in the case of the Islamic Kingdom of Champa and the Cham people. It is also to serve as a spring-board for the expansion of Viet Nam throughout South-East Asia.298.	That is the hidden meaning behind the official slogan ""special Vietnam-Laos-Kampuchea solidarity and friendship"". That slogan has for us throughout our long years of struggle for national liberation and until after our national liberation meant a policy of division and of subversion of our internal affairs. The so-called ""special Vietnam-Kampuchea solidarity"" is in fact nothing other than a long series of crimes and betrayals committed by the Hanoi authorities against the people of Kampuchea.299.	The objective of the Vietnamese expansionists was to absorb Kampuchea on the quiet without arousing international attention  as they succeeded in doing with Laos through the so-called Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation  which was signed on 18 July 1977. To do that  from the time of our first struggle for national liberation in 1947  they infiltrated numerous agents one by one into Kampuchea to carry out underground activities of sabotage and subversion  attempts at coups dâEtat and assassinations of Kampuchean leaders who showed themselves to be independent of the Vietnamese. They obstinately carried on all these treacherous activities without respite before  during and after the five-year war of national liberation.300.	During this five-year war the Vietnamese expansionists took advantage of the sanctuaries and the multiple forms of assistance  particularly in food  means of communication and hospitals given them by our people and our Government  to try to create the conditions needed for a take -over of the powers of State immediately after the liberation of Kampuchea  After many failures in their attempts in May 1970 to form a Vietnamese-Kampuchean joint command in the army and the State Administration of Kampuchea  they even went  so far as to create a State administration and an army parallel to those of Kampuchea. They took over almost all the Chinese military assistance intended for us  in order to prevent us from doing battle ourselves.301.	In the course of the Paris negotiations with the United States  the Hanoi leaders arrogated to themselves the right to decide on the destiny of Kampuchea instead of leaving it to its legal and legitimate Government. They openly revealed to their opposite 'partners their desire to annul the independence and neutrality of Kampuchea and to make it their satellite. By the Paris agreements of 27 January 1973  they sought to force the people of Kampuchea to abandon their struggle for national liberation and place their destiny in their hands. But our people  moved by an ardent patriotism and an unswerving will for independence  decided to pursue the struggle alone and made the heaviest sacrifices until the total liberation of Kampuchea on 17 April 1975. This liberation of Phnom Penh  before that of Saigon which occurred only on 30 April 1975  prevented the Hanoi authorities from sending their divisions in order to ""liberate"" our capital as they put it  and at the same time annex Kampuchea under cover of that ""special solidarity"" and that ""special friendship"". But immediately after the liberation of Kampuchea  the Vietnamese expansionists  redoubled and intensified their criminal activities in an attempt to overthrow the Government of Democratic Kampuchea from within. Without let-up the agents of the Vietnamese fifth column proceeded clandestinely and systematically to sabotage the work of reconstruction and national defence and then publicly laid the responsibility for that on numerous independence-loving patriots whom they ferociously repressed with the black design of casting discredit on the Government of Democratic Kampuchea and fomenting revolts. At the same time  from outside they carried out aggressive attacks against Democratic Kampuchea. In May 1975 they occupied the island of Poulo Way and  while refusing to leave the sanctuaries established on Kampuchean territory since 1965  they constantly carried out attacks in violation of our frontiers.302.	Recognizing at last that they could never absorb Kampuchea unnoticed  the Hanoi authorities in December 1977 launched their first undeclared large-scale war of aggression  which was at once totally crushed by our revolutionary army on 6 January 1978. In May 1978 there was yet another failure in their manoeuvres to destabilize Kampuchea through their fifth column. It was after these failures that the Hanoi authorities signed the military treaty with Moscow on 3 November 1978  and it was with vast military assistance from the Soviet Union that on 25 December 1978 they began their second war of aggression against Democratic Kampuchea on a far larger scale than the preceding one.303.	No longer being able to make use of the slogans of ""special solidarity"" and ""special friendship"" to annex Kampuchea  the Hanoi leaders are today pursuing their interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea through what they call ""genocide"" in Kampuchea in order to justify and carry out their aggression against Kampuchea. All peoples throughout the world that love peace  justice and independence have by their unanimous condemnation of Vietnamese aggression against Kampuchea clearly shown that under international law no pretext can justify this Vietnamese aggression. By committing aggression against Kampuchea Viet Nam sought to overthrow the Government of Democratic Kampuchea which had emerged from the heroic struggle of the people of Kampuchea  a legal and legitimate Government recognized by the entire international community and by our Organization. But to justify its aggression in Kampuchea the Hanoi regime did not fear to defy world public opinion and the United Nations.304.	It is obvious that international public opinion has not forgiven the Hanoi authorities  as they had hoped  for their crimes of aggression against Kampuchea. At the outset the Hanoi leaders tried to exonerate themselves by denying that they had troops on the territory of Kampuchea. However  when they were caught red- handed engaging in flagrant aggression with more than 100 000 soldiers in Kampuchea  the Hanoi authorities then hastened to invoke the so-called Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation signed with the Phnom Penh puppets on 18 February 1979  two months after their aggression. It is obvious to world public opinion that the Hanoi authorities will stop at nothing to justify their invasion and occupation of Kampuchea and that they continue to trample underfoot the fundamental principles of the Charter.305.	History and events show that the real cause of Vietnamese aggression against Kampuchea is the policy of expansion  domination and blocs of the Hanoi authorities  who have always opposed the constant policy of independence  peace  neutrality and non- alignment of Democratic Kampuchea. Furthermore an independent Kampuchea  refusing to align itself with the bloc of the so-called ""natural allies of the non- aligned countries"" represents a major obstacle to the strategic aims of the Hanoi authorities' regional expansionism and of world expansionism which seek both dominance in South-East Asia and then control of the strategic maritime waterways  particularly the Straits of Malacca  which link Asia with Europe and Africa.306.	The war of national resistance of the Kampuchean people against Vietnamese aggression is an integral part or the struggle in which the desire for independence and the right to self-determination of all people and nations that love peace and justice is pitted against the determination of regional and international expansionists to subdue peoples and nations. It is an active part of the struggle to gain respect for the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules which govern international relations.307.	This is why the Hanoi authorities  in their unrestrained efforts to fulfil their expansionist ambitions  did not hesitate to embark on the genocide of the people and the nation of Kampuchea. Nor were they afraid to threaten all the countries of South-East Asia with reprisals. With unprecedented arrogance the Hanoi authorities defied the unanimous condemnation of all countries and peoples that love peace  justice and independence. They did not scruple to use the vilest lies and slander  as well as the logic of gangsters  in trying to force the international community to legalize aggression against Kampuchea and to endorse the violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter and the introduction by Viet Nam and its supporters of the law of the jungle into international relations.308.	The vote of the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September last was the expression of the firm and resolute opposition of the international community to the violation of the United Nations Charter by the Hanoi authorities with their expansionist aims. That expansionism constitutes a grave danger as it threatens the independence of all countries throughout the world  particularly the small and medium-sized countries. That vote was also a striking rebuttal of the so-called ""consensus"" by which was adopted the unilateral and arbitrary decision of the host country at the Havana Conference two weeks earlier.309.	Ten months have already passed since the Vietnamese aggression  but the people's war of national resistance  far from being extinguished  intensifies daily. The revolutionary Kampuchean Army  reorganized into a large number of guerrilla units  is attacking the Vietnamese occupiers throughout the country. Each day they inflict upon the invaders heavy losses of both men and materiel. The Army organizes and gives impetus to the struggle of the people against the Vietnamese enemy. They are liberating new villages and enlarging the liberated zones. The Vietnamese aggressors  hiding behind the puppets whom they have installed in Phnom Penh  at present control barely a quarter of our national territory  which includes the cities and certain parts of the main roads  with bands of territory between two and three kilometres wide on each side. The rest of the country is made up of zones controlled by the Government of Democratic Kampuchea and by the zones and bases of our guerrilla army. The enemy cannot move easily in these areas.310.	It has become obvious to everyone that the Vietnamese aggressors are becoming increasingly bogged down in the popular war of national resistance being waged by the Army and all the people of Kampuchea under the leadership of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea. It has also become obvious to world public opinion that if  as the Vietnamese expansionists claim  the Government of Democratic Kampuchea had really so maltreated its people  it would not have enjoyed such strong support from them. Nor would the people have agreed to further sacrifices in the difficult war of national resistance against the Vietnamese invasion to the point where they are overcoming 200 000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Only a Government that represented the genuine aspirations of its people could enjoy such support. As for the puppet regime in Phnom Penh  imported lock  stock and barrel from Viet Nam  it has no roots in our society and is but the shadowy reflection cast by 200 000 soldiers of occupation. All the decisions are taken and all the affairs are administered from Saigon under the personal direction of two members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Viet Nam  Le Duc Tho and Pham Hung. At Phnom Penh itself the puppet administration has been placed under the direct control of a Vietnamese triumvirate. The Phnom Penh puppets have no armed forces  except for a few hundred soldiers who have been incorporated by force into the Vietnamese army and are strictly controlled by Vietnamese officers. What is more  those soldiers  as well as the bodyguards  the ""self-defence corps"" and the members of the ""village committees"" which have been set up and armed by the Vietnamese occupiers  are rising up in increasing numbers against the occupiers. They are turning their weapons against them and are returning to the zones which are under the control of our Government. Furthermore  the morale of those 200 000 Vietnamese troops decline daily as they are becoming bogged down in Kampuchea. The political programme of the Front of Great National Patriotic and Democratic Union of Kampuchea has aroused clear echoes at every level of society  both inside and outside the country  and this has given great impetus to the already forceful war that our people are waging against- the-aggressors. .Indeed  this united Front has mobilized all the national forces regardless of their past or their political tendencies or beliefs  because they have the common objective of struggling against the war of genocide waged by the Hanoi authorities. This is no ideological battle but a battle for the very survival of the nation  the people and the civilization of Kampuchea.311.	The situation created by the Vietnamese aggression in Kampuchea is not irreversible  as Hanoi claims. History has proved that in no case can foreign aggression create a fait accompli. And yet despite being bogged down in Kampuchea  despite its immense political  economic and social difficulties in Viet Nam itself and despite world condemnation of its policy of aggression and expansion  the Hanoi regime is obstinately pursuing and intensifying its policy of aggression and its crimes of genocide against Kampuchea and its people.312.	In the course of these last months the Hanoi authorities sent to Kampuchea several additional divisions and large amounts of modern military equipment as part of their preparations for new offensives during the dry season which is beginning. A dozen or so Vietnamese divisions have been deployed along the border with Thailand. Far from improving the situation in South-East Asia  such an action makes it worse. Peace  security and the stability of the region are seriously threatened because of the continuation and intensification of the Vietnamese aggression in Democratic Kampuchea. With the constant reinforcement of Vietnamese troops and the establishment of new colonies of Vietnamese nationals in Kampuchea  the Vietnamese war of aggression is assuming new proportions. At any moment the whole of the South-East Asian region runs the risk of being engulfed in the flames of this war. The independence and territorial integrity of all the countries in the region are directly threatened.313.	In order to break the stubborn resistance of the people and army of Kampuchea the Hanoi authorities are disseminating from aircraft toxic chemical products which  on contact with the skin  cause death after 24 hours. The Vietnamese hordes have for three weeks been carrying out military operations to destroy all the rice  corn  potato and other crops planted during the rainy season under the leadership of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea. In the areas under their provisional control they take over all the harvests and forbid the population to go to work in the fields and the rice paddies. These military operations and criminal measures are designed to cut off the food supply of the people of Kampuchea.314.	The famine deliberately created by the Vietnamese aggressors in Kampuchea is aimed on the one hand at breaking the resistance of the Kampuchean people and on the other at obtaining recognition for the puppet regime of Phnom Penh by the international organizations through their supplies of humanitarian aid.315.	The Government of Democratic Kampuchea draws the attention of the international community to the monstrous crimes of the Vietnamese expansionists and calls on all international organizations and all friendly countries that wish to provide urgent humanitarian aid in the form of foodstuffs  medicines  clothing and so on to the people of Kampuchea to do so in such a way that this assistance may directly reach our people and not be diverted by the Vietnamese invaders and their puppets to serve their war of aggression. It is now known to all that the Vietnamese invaders who have received this aid have resold it to the population for payment in gold  as they do in the case of the Vietnamese refugees  the ""boat people"". It has also be distributed to some of their soldiers  so that certain humanitarian aid has unintentionally served to strengthen the troops of aggression in massacring the Kampuchean population.316.	The Government of Democratic Kampuchea  the only legal and legitimate representative of the people of Kampuchea  concerned to ensure the survival of the nation and people of Kampuchea  calls on all international organizations and all countries that cherish peace  justice and independence to provide their humanitarian aid to the Kampuchean people. Such aid will constitute an effective weapon against the attempts by the Vietnamese aggressors to exterminate the people and nation of Kampuchea. The Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the Red Cross of Democratic Kampuchea are grateful for all such humanitarian aid and will make every effort to co-operate in ensuring that all this aid will directly benefit the people of Kampuchea.317.	This humanitarian aid and assistance will certainly lessen the immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings of our people threatened with extermination by the Hanoi authorities. But it certainly cannot put an end to them. The danger of extension of the Vietnamese war of aggression to the whole of South-East Asia will exist until there is a final solution of the problem.318.	At all times  in conformity with its desire to maintain close relations of friendship with all countries and particularly with those that have common borders with us  on the basis of equality and strict mutual respect for independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  Democratic Kampuchea has sought to solve its problem with Viet Nam peacefully. From 1970 to 1976 we held about 100 negotiations with Viet Nam at the highest level and innumerable other negotiations at other levels.319.	In June 1975  despite the many urgent and important post-war problems to be solved on the spot  Democratic Kampuchea sent to Hanoi a delegation at the highest level to negotiate  and it proposed to Viet Nam the signing of a treaty of friendship and non- aggression based on mutual respect for independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of others  together with mutual benefits. Such a treaty would have made it possible to achieve a fundamental solution to the problem of achieving friendly relations between Kampuchea and Viet Nam. But the Vietnamese side did not take any account of the Kampuchean proposal. Nevertheless  the Government of Democratic Kampuchea reiterated that proposal several times  in particular on 29 September 1978  three months before the Vietnamese aggression of 25 December 1978.320.	Today  faced with the escalation of the Vietnamese war of aggression in Kampuchea  it behoves the United Nations and all countries that cherish peace  justice and independence and are devoted to the sacred principles of the Charter to exercise the necessary economic and diplomatic pressures to prevent the Vietnamese expansionists from intensifying their war of aggression in Kampuchea during this dry season.321.	In this regard  it should be recalled that on 15 January and 16 March in the Security Council there were 13 votes in favour of and 2 votes against two draft resolutions  one submitted by the non-aligned members and the other by the five ASEAN countries  calling on Viet Nam to halt its aggression against Kampuchea and withdraw all its forces from Kampuchea. Only the veto of a great Power  a permanent member of the Security Council  prevented the adoption of those resolutions. Today  more than ever  it behoves the United Nations to take the necessary measures so that the people of Kampuchea may live in peace and in security within their boundaries  with honour and nation^ dignity  in an independent  united  peaceful  neutral and non-aligned Kampuchea  and so that peace  security and stability in South-East Asia may be restored. To that end it is essential and urgent that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam put an end to its aggression against Kampuchea and immediately and unconditional withdraw all its armed forces of occupation and all its settlements from Kampuchea  in strict compliance with the United Nations Charter. In a word  it is essential and urgent that the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam respect the independence and sovereignty and territorial integrity of Democratic Kampuchea and the right of the people of Kampuchea to self-determination  free from foreign interference. The internal problem of Kampuchea will be solved in accordance with the political programme of the Front of Great National Patriotic and Democratic Union of Kampuchea  which means that the social and political regime of Kampuchea will be decided by the people of Kampuchea themselves through general and free elections  by direct and secret ballot  elections to be supervised by the Secretary- General of the United Nations.322.	In that regard  it is important to point out that in the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization  dated 11 September 1979  Mr. Waldheim stressed:""The United Nations has been especially preoccupied this year with developments in Indo-Chinaâ developments which not only raise fundamental questions of Charter principles but also have been accompanied by vast and tragic humanitarian problems."" The Secretary-General added that:"". . .the long and cruel war in Indo-China ... not only threatens the peace and stability of South-East Asia; it could very well also become a threat to world peace."" Finally he concludes:""In this as in other situations that have recently arisen  it is imperative that all efforts be directed towards finding a settlement in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  in particular respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of all States  non-interference in internal affairs and the non-use of force"".323.	In this connexion  the initiative taken by the five members of ASEAN to have our General Assembly adopt agenda item 123 entitled ""The situation in Kampuchea"" is praiseworthy. We once again express our most sincere gratitude to its sponsors for their support for the just struggle of the Kampuchean people and their efforts to restore peace  security and stability in South-East Asia. My delegation would like to express its firm hope that we might see the debate in our Assembly on this agenda item crowned by success with the adoption of a resolution compelling the Hanoi authorities to put an end to the war of aggression in Kampuchea and to withdraw from Kampuchea all their armed forces and their settlers. In doing so  our General Assembly will certainly be making its contribution to the defence of peace  security and stability in Southeast Asia and in the world  as well as to the defence of the United Nations Charter.324.	Our people  for their part  however great their sacrifices  are resolutely determined  together with our army  under the leadership of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea to continue their battle to chase out all Vietnamese aggressors from our country. They are convinced that with the active aid and support of the international community  and of all countries and peoples who love peace  justice and independence  victory will be theirs.325.	On behalf of our people and our Government  we wish solemnly to reaffirm here our unswerving devotion to the cause of peace  independence and freedom for all peoples and countries throughout the world. We would particularly like to stress our commitment to our traditional friendship with neighbouring peoples and countries. Towards all of them  including Viet Nam  when the Hanoi authorities have ceased their aggression and withdrawn all their forces from Kampuchea  we shall without delay pursue our policy which is based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence. As a founder member of the non-aligned movement and a Member of the United Nations  Democratic Kampuchea remains ever faithful to the ideals and principles of non-alignment and of the United Nations Charter."
"74",3865,"KWT",34,1979,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to express to you  Sir  on behalf of the Government and people of Kuwait  heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election is a tribute to the high status which you enjoy in international circles as a diplomat with wide experience  and a recognition of your country's role in international affairs  especially in Africa.262.	I should like also to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for the manner in which he conducted the work of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.â263.	I should also like to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has worked hard to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security  and for his concern with the problems of the developing countries.264.	Kuwait has consistently advocated respect for the principle of the universality of the United Nations  which should make the world Organization a real microcosm of international society. In that respect  I should like to congratulate Saint Lucia on its admission to the United Nations. We are confident that it is now ready to discharge the responsibilities of statehood and to participate actively in the work of international organizations.265.	International developments during the past year have not been encouraging and in many cases have given rise to pessimism. Rivalry increased among the big Powers to expand their spheres of influence and to tighten their grip over other regions subordinate to them. Flagrant interference in the affairs of other States intensified. This period was also characterized by dependence on force to solve differences among States  and the threat to use the means of armed invasion to bring pressure on legitimate Governments to compel them to pursue policies inimical to their interests.266.	In today's world  there is a great need to end the vestiges of colonial and foreign domination and to consolidate the freedom and independence of the newly independent countries. The disparity between the developed and developing countries  which is widening  is leading to an increase of social  economic and political tensions. Non-aligned and developing countries are faced with the prime tasks of economic growth and raising the standards of living of their people and  as a concomitant to those  of making scientific and technological progress.267.	During the past month most of us attended the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Cuba. Although we are living in a rapidly changing world  the need for non-alignment is more urgent today than it was before. An essential purpose of the policy of non-alignment is the reduction of tension and the creation of accord and international harmony among nations.268.	The policy of non-alignment is intended to serve the needs of a developing country by keeping it free from military entanglements and enabling it to devote its energy and resources primarily to the development of the standard of living of its own people. It is a cause of regret that such a policy should incur the active hostility of some big Powers. Many a non-aligned country has been subjected to political pressure by powerful countries wishing to establish their hegemony over other nations. Non-aligned countries have received less external economic assistance than those countries which are members of military blocs.269.	Though the path of non-alignment has not been an easy one if has stood up to the test of the past two decades. The non-aligned countries have not adopted a passive or neutral attitude in the face of glaring injustice and violations of the Charter of the United Nations. In spite of some short-comings and setbacks  non- alignment still retains its validity and character. On the whole I feel confident that the non-aligned countries will continue in the future  as they have m the past  to play a vital role in the promotion of peace and international harmony.270. Kuwait's membership in the Security Council will expire in a few months. I should like  therefore  in this context  to make a few remarks on the work of the Council during the past two years  which were crowded with international problems. Some of those problems constituted a challenge to the Council. It would have been possible to solve many of them had the Council showed determination and firmness. I am sorry to say that that was not the case. The failure of the Council to discharge its responsibilities was not due to reluctance on its part  but rather because the interests of the big Powers prevailed and the veto was used to assure their ascendancy over its work.271.	To cite some examples  the Council failed to deal with the problems in South-East Asia and was unable to adopt a resolution recognizing the right of the Palestinian people to decide their own future and to establish an independent State of their own. The Council also failed to resolve the Lebanese problem and that of the Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories. The shortcomings or ineptitude of the Council emboldened many countries such as South Africa and Israel and encouraged them to persist in their aggressive policies. We call upon the big Powers to let their international responsibilities prevail over their immediate interests in southern Africa and the Middle East where vital issues of international peace and security are at stake.272.	The paramount factor in Africa is the sense of nationalism and the determination of all African peoples that the whole of the African continent shall be free from the evils of white racism. Within Rhodesia  Namibia and South Africa  and within the nations immediately bordering them  the commitment to the struggle against minority or colonial rule overrides all other matters.273.	The evils of colonialism are well known. The evils of racism are even greater. In South Africa  Namibia and Southern Rhodesia the entire state machinery is directed to organizing and upholding the domination of a small minority over the indigenous population. No wonder that the minority regimes have defied the authority of the United Nations and used legislation and sham elections to deny elementary political  economic and social rights to the black majority.274.	The situation in southern Africa poses a threat to international peace and security. South Africa rejected Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  dated 29 September 1978  thus flouting the will of the international community  although SWAPO had accepted it.275.	The policy of South Africa is to transform southern Africa into a geographical enclave subordinate to it so as to exploit its natural resources  use it as a buffer zone  separating it from independent African States  and use its people as cheap labour to be exploited in its development plans.276.	In Zimbabwe  sham illegal elections were held in which the majority did not take part; they were used as an African mask to disguise the white minority. We pay a tribute to the struggle of the Patriotic Front and reaffirm our support for that struggle. Kuwait also commends the sacrifices of the front-line States  which sustain great losses  are exposed to aggression and willingly accept this because of their faith in self- determination and the indivisibility of the cause of freedom everywhere.277.	Some Western countries  which sympathize with the minority regimes  have advocated negotiations as a means of resolving the conflict by peaceful means. We do not object to negotiations if they do not compromise majority rule or independence and are used as a means of organizing an orderly transfer of power from the white minority to the black majority. South Africa and Rhodesia must be isolated economically  politically and socially until they abide by United Nations resolutions and accept the will of the international community.278.	The littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean held their first meeting last July. Our main object should be to formulate a draft treaty to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace. Our desire is to see the littoral and hinterland States become parties to the treaty  and to convince the major maritime users of the Ocean of the necessity of respecting the provisions of the treaty by ratifying a separate protocol. Hence  the goodwill and co-operation of the maritime users of the Indian Ocean will be crucial.279.	The rivalry among the military Powers in the Indian Ocean has not yet abated. A new ominous manifestation of this rivalry has been the attempt to prevent the States concerned from freely disposing of their wealth and natural resources. The need for raw materials is becoming so great that it leads some big Powers to impose constraints on the freedom of the developing countries to dispose of their natural resources on remunerative terms and use the proceeds to accelerate the economic and social development of their peoples. Kuwait firmly believes in the inalienable rights of all the littoral and hinterland States to dispose freely of their natural wealth and resources without any threat or pressure designed to shackle their freedom or disrupt their self-sustained growth.280.	We welcome the formulation of a comprehensive programme of disarmament and voice our hope that the negotiations within the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva will promote this end  which the world yearns for and dearly cherishes. However  we must note  in light of the existing political realities  that the major military Powers may have accepted the principle of arms control  but are far from accepting the goal of general and complete disarmament advocated by small countries. Their present efforts are aimed  at best  at stabilizing and preserving the war system with its destructive capability  at a lesser financial cost to alleviate their economic burden. We believe that this limited objective cannot achieve either peace or security in the long run. Only comprehensive disarmament can end the threat of nuclear annihilation and permit the devotion of the time  money and resources now dissipated by the war system to improving the quality of life on our planet.281.	The situation in Cyprus is a cause of world concern. We have repeatedly affirmed that the policy of Kuwait is to support the unity of Cyprus and its territorial integrity and non-alignment. We also support the 10-point agreement which was reached among the Turkish and Greek communities and in an effort to find a solution to the problem under the aegis of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.282.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has been rightly described as the most important conference of this century. It has also been the longest in duration and the most complex in terms of the diverse issues involved. For almost a decade nations have been afforded ample opportunity to define their national interests. Resolving the conflict in the interests of States requires statesmanship and an extraordinary degree of international co-operation. The stalemate in the Conference is largely caused by the conduct of coastal States which make exclusive claims to resources in vast marine areas near their coasts contrary to the traditional freedoms of the seas  together with the eagerness of technologically advanced States to assume exclusive control over ocean minerals in the area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.283.	It seems that the industrially advanced States are determined to gain access to new sources of raw materials and enable their corporations to enter into competition with land-based suppliers of the same minerals. The Conference has recently succeeded in organizing its future sessions in a manner that promises the solution of the intractable issues. It is our fervent hope that the Conference will recognize that there must be elementary equity in a future convention  if it is to survive.284.	Grave developments have taken place in the Middle East which have greatly aggravated tension and jeopardized international peace and security. These included the bilateral peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel  which ignored the inalienable and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The Treaty has been rejected by all the Arab countries  as well as by the people of Palestine. The decisions of the Ninth Arab Summit Conference  held at Baghdad in 1978 reflected this rejection. It has also received condemnation by the Tenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Fez  Morocco  in addition to the open condemnation expressed by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Havana  which called on the non- aligned countries not to recognize the Camp David agreements or the peace Treaty concluded on 26 March 1979.285.	The people of Palestine will not abandon their sacred right to self-determination  political independence and sovereignty. It is certain that  without the exercise of the right of self-determination by the people of Palestine and their right to sovereignty and return  there will never be peace in the Middle East.286.	Scores of countries have already obtained independence  and some Territories will obtain it soon. Only the people of Palestine among the peoples of the world have been suffering from displacement  from foreign occupation and from the undignified life of the refugee camps. No one can be silent over this tragedy which has occurred when the United Nations Charter has been promulgated and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights has been adopted. The Middle East will remain as explosive as ever unless Israel withdraws its forces from all the occupied Arab territories and unless the people of Palestine exercise their right to self- determination.287.	In this context  I should like to emphasize that Jewish settlements being built almost every day on occupied Palestinian and Syrian lands are part and parcel of the concept of colonization and expansion pursued by Israel since its creation  despite Israel's repeated condemnation by the international communityâthe latest example of which was reflected in Security Council resolution 452 (1979) of 20 July 1979.288.	The conduct of Israel in the occupied Arab territories is a reflection of Zionist colonization through the acquisition of land  the building of settlements  the expulsion of Arab nationals  the restriction of means of livelihood through the seizure of water resources  the building of colonies and  finally  the sanctioning of the purchase of land from Arab nationals. All these instances are ample evidence that Israel is determined to annex Arab territories on the basis of flimsy pretexts which contravene the United Nations Charter  international law and human rights.289.	It is the duty of the United Nations to support the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and its struggle to achieve the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  and to reject partial solutions aimed at liquidating the Palestine question.290.	It is also the duty of the Security Council to take action under Chapter VII of the Charter against Israel in view of its persistence in violating the principles of the Charter and flouting the resolutions of the world Organization  and its continued attacks on the Arab countries and the people of Palestine.291.	Israel is pursuing a policy of genocide against the Palestinian people  as is evident from the daily aggression against the sovereignty of Lebanon. This policy  intensified after the Camp David agreements  was designed to wreak havoc on southern Lebanon and to destroy the spirit of resistance of the Palestinian people. It also constitutes a war of destruction and genocide against the sister people of Lebanon  and creates a rift between the people of Lebanon and the Palestinian people. We pay a tribute to the steadfastness of the people of Lebanon and the endurance of the Palestinian people in face of daily attacks in which Israel uses the most sophisticated weapons it receives from the United States. It is therefore our duty to support the efforts of the people of Lebanon to protect their sovereignty. The people of Palestine  who are the victims of this campaign of horror and genocide  are entitled to our political and material support.292.	The North-South dialogue has been progressing at a very slow pace at a time when changes to cope with world economic problems are most urgent. The disparities in income and standard of living separating the developed and the developing countries are constantly widening. The present economic disorder and the break-down of the Western-dominated post-war monetary and trade system is almost complete. This chaos that we are witnessing leaves its adverse imprints in the most pronounced manner on the developing countries and their peoples. The damage that has been done to the ancient economic order is beyond repair  and any attempts to patch it up will prolong the suffering of the people of the developing countries. Interdependence in all walks of life is a reality and the premeditated resistance to the acceptance of this fact is adding fuel to the fire and barring the establishment of a new international economic order based on justice for all.293.	The balance-of-payments disequilibrium of the developing countries have their roots in the structural problems  recession  and high rate of inflation in the developed countries. The increased protectionist measures taken in the developed countries in recent years against the products of the developing countries are hampering the industrial growth of those countries and affecting adversely their balance of payments. Inflation in many of the industrial countries has reached two digits and is being exported to developing countries. The industrial goods imported by the developing countries increase in price automatically  reflecting the inflation rates prevailing in the exporting countries  while the prices of many primary products have moved upward very slowly or remained stagnant. The developing countries are in urgent need of economic assistance and of ending the stalemate so as to find solutions to their economic problems.294.	The Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries in Havana  which mapped a strategy to strengthen mutual co-operation among the developing countries and start international negotiations within the framework of the United Nations on all the social problems  is a major step. The developed countries should show sufficient flexibility and co-operation to bring that initiative to a successful conclusion. As that step signifies a way out of the stalemate  we should like it to be the focus of negotiations between the developing and the developed countries in the future. However  if the initiative were to go unheeded  the interests of many developing countries would suffer because of the burden of the scarcity of resources. It is in the interest of all of us to alleviate this burden and come to the assistance of the developing countries before their collapse. If we talk about interdependence  about the new economic order  then we have to be serious in our efforts to translate words into action.295.	Kuwait is doing its utmost  either separately or in collaboration with other developing oil-exporting countries  to help the developing countries and is striving to expand co-operation and investment in these countries. The other developing countries should create a better investment climate within the framework of their national policies. These investments must receive satisfactory guarantees and preferential treatment in order to foster self-reliance among the developing countries.296.	The challenge before us is to remove the impediments to an orderly utilization of world resources for the benefit of present as well as future generations. This can be done only within the context of the new international economic order. The new order is designed to herald a new era in the international system in which the sovereignty of the developing countries has finally come to mean more than political independence. The new order  for the first time in many centuries  gives the developing countries a better chance to increase their share in the world's wealth. The ultimate aim is to enable the common man in these nations to emerge from his misery  to enjoy basic human rights and ultimately to move into the mainstream of human civilization. As the new order is designed to guarantee more equitable relations in the international system  it is bound to contribute to peace  security and justice for all mankind. To try to check this significant trend would be simply to try to reverse the course of history."
"75",3910,"LAO",34,1979,"ï»¿7.	Mr. President  first of all allow me  on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  to express to you my heartfelt congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that thanks to your eminent qualities as a diplomat and your great experience of the United Nations  you will honourably discharge the responsibility entrusted to you. Rest assured that m this task you can count on the full collaboration of my delegation. I would also like  through you  to extend my sincere congratulations to all the Vice- Presidents.8.	I should also like to congratulate and thank Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the outgoing President  for the wisdom and effectiveness with which he guided the proceedings of the thirty-third session.9.	I should like to express my great appreciation to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his persevering and tireless efforts for peace and international co-operation. I wish him the very best of health and every success in discharging his noble mission.10.	Finally I should like to heartily congratulate the people of Saint Lucia  whose country has just been admitted as the one hundred and fifty-second Member of the United Nations  thus occupying its rightful place in the family of nations.11.	Since the last session of our Assembly  several events have taken place in various parts of the world. Some of them have fortunately created conditions conducive to the consolidation of detente and international co-operation  while others  on the contrary  are extremely disquieting  not only for the reasons I have just mentioned  but also to peace and security in the world.12.	For all the non-aligned countries  which make up two thirds of this Assembly  as for the entire international community  the most significant event of 1979 was indisputably the sixth Conference of non-aligned countries  which was recently held in Havana  the magnificent capital of the Republic of Cuba. That Conference was a great victory  not only for the Government and the welcoming and hospitable people of Cuba  who so carefully and impeccably prepared it  but also for all peoples who cherish peace  independence and justice in the world. At the same time it was a crushing defeat for imperialism and the reactionary forces which expended immense effort to sap the unity of the non- aligned movement in order to wreck it. To judge by the result of the Sixth Conference  on which we do not wish to linger  it is absolutely impossible to doubt the effectiveness of the movement and its staunch resolve to assume its responsibilities in the conduct of international relations.13.	As a fully-fledged member of that community 9f non-aligned countries  the Lao People's Democratic Republic heartily welcomes the success of the Sixth Conference and intends to play its full part within that movement  as we do in other international bodies  so as to make an active contribution to the common struggle against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  apartheid and racism  and for peace  national independence  detente and the development of international co-operation.14.	Other events have contributed to the strengthening of international peace and security  and these are the resounding victories achieved by the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America in their heroic struggle against the anti-democratic and anti-national regimes which are the instruments of imperialism and international reactionaries.15.	However encouraging that situation may be  we must never lower our guard. On the contrary  we must persevere and step up our struggle  because experience as proved that the more the imperialists and international reactionaries suffer defeats  the more cruel and perfidious they become  both in their policies and their actions.16.	We warmly welcome  first  the brilliant victory achieved by the people of fraternal Kampuchea  which finally  on 7 January 1979  overthrew the barbarous  genocidal and repressive regime of its tyrants. On this subject we should recall that  after having finally vanquished the United States imperialists and their Lon Nol henchmen  on 17 April 1975 the heroic people of Kampuchea  instead of being able to enjoy their hard- won peace and independence  because of the treachery of the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique and who obey only the reactionaries of Peking [Beijing]  met with a most tragic fate. Indeed  practising an abject policy of genocide  the Pol Pot regime massacred more than 3 million Kampucheans and transformed Kampuchea into a vast unspeakable ""neo-Nazi slaughter-house"".17.	Futhermore  in addition to the ghastly crimes they perpetrated against their own people the bloody regime of Pol Pot  on the one hand  created a permanent situation of tension in the border regions between Kampuchea and my country and  on the other hand  entered into conflict with Viet Nam  beginning with murderous border incidents which became an open war against Viet Nam and which ended in the resounding victory of Viet Nam over the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary forces. That victory prompted the spontaneous uprising of the Kampuchean people which resulted  on7 January 1979  in the overthrow of the regime of the tyrants and the establishment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea.18.	Thus  the Kampuchean people  under the guidance of the People's Revolutionary Council and the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea  became the true master of its country and its destiny. Independence  sovereignty and freedom are once more firmly in the hands of the people of Kampuchea  who are practising a foreign policy of peace  independence  friendship and non-alignment  thus consolidating peace and stability in Indo-China  South-East Asia and throughout the world. Thus  the present situation in Kampuchea is irreversible.19.	It is a regrettable fact  however  that  after that great victory  the international reactionaries  in collusion with the imperialists  have persisted in trying to resuscitate the genocidal regime of Pol Pot which has been consigned to the past  by helping it still to claim a seat within our Organization. These actions constitute a cynical interference in the internal affairs of the Kampuchean people.20.	As far as we are concerned  the Lao People's Democratic Republic  in accordance with its position which has been repeatedly voiced  recognizes the People's Republic of Kampuchea as an independent and sovereign State which cannot and should never be subjected to threat or aggression by anyone. The People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea  which is the sole legitimate and authentic representative of the Kampuchean people  must take possession of its seat in the United Nations and in all other international bodies. No question relating to Kampuchea can be resolved without the participation of the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea.21.	To respect the memory of the 3 million innocent Kampucheans who were massacred and to render justice to the further 4 million who survived and who have suffered so much at the hands of a genocidal regime unprecedented in the history of humanity  we request the expulsion from the United Nations of the representative of the murderous gang which in fact controls not one inch of the territory of the country and which no longer represents anyone  so that the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea may take its rightful seat.22.	The Lao people salute the victory of the Iranian people  who overthrew and abolished a feudal  bloody  absolutist regime  thus becoming the true master of their country.23.	We hail the brilliant victory of the people of Nicaragua  wrested by force of arms from the Fascist Somoza dictatorship. That victory will give great momentum to the struggle of peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean against imperialism and in order to consolidate their national independence.24.	In the Middle East  the situation continues to be explosive. The Palestinian Arab people have suffered and continue to suffer from the exploitation and aggression of the Israeli Zionists and of the imperialists. The quest for peace through the Camp David agreements and the so-called Egypt-Israel peace treaty16 only make the problem more serious and serve imperialism's designs for domination in the Middle East. Those agreements are not in the interests of the Palestinian Arab people  nor in the interests of the other Arab peoples  nor indeed those of the Egyptian people themselves.25.	A lasting and equitable settlement of the problem must involve the total withdrawal of the Israeli forces of""Treaty of Peace between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the State of Israel  signed at Washington on 26 March 1979.occupation from all occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  and the unequivocal recognition of the inalienable right of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination  as well as their right to establish an independent and sovereign State in Palestine.26.	The Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic supports the just struggle of the Arab people of Palestine under the guidance of the PLO  their only legitimate and authentic representative. It supports the just position of the people of Syria and other Arab countries that are victims of Zionist aggression  to the effect that they will not associate themselves with the separate deal. We favour the independence  sovereignty and unity of Lebanon which is opposed to the attempts to dismember its territory by Israel  and condemn the Zionist aggression against Lebanon.27.	Furthermore  the Lao People's Democratic Republic is in favour of the independence  unity and non- alignment of Cyprus. We are in favour of a peaceful settlement between the two Cypriot communities.28.	We support the people of Afghanistan in their struggle to consolidate their independence against the subversive and perfidious manoeuvres of the expansionists and the imperialists.29.	Our unreserved support likewise goes to the peoples of Democratic Yemen and of Ethiopia in their efforts to develop their societies  free from any domination or imperialist interference.30.	We staunchly support the struggle of the Korean people to bring about the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea and we condemn the presence of foreign troops in South Korea.31.	In the African continent  colonialism  racism and apartheid  which are already too anachronistic for the end of the twentieth century  still continue in their misdeeds  their domination and savage exploitation of peoples and of the abundant natural riches of Namibia and Zimbabwe. Thus the minority and illegal racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia have resorted to all sorts of lies and tricks  such as the rigged election farce and the establishment of puppet regimes.32.	The Lao people will staunchly side with the Namibian and Zimbabwean peoples and with the peoples of the front-line countries  who are the victims of the barbaric aggression of the minority racist regimes of southern Africa. The Lao People's Democratic Republic has recognized the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic as an independent and sovereign country. We support the struggle of the Saharan people under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO for independence  sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic.33.	In Latin America  the fraternal Cuban people continue to be subjected to an arbitrary blockade. The Lao People's Democratic Republic  like all countries that cherish justice throughout the world  condemns that blockade and demands the immediate handing over of the naval base of Guantanamo to Cuba.â34.	The Lao people wish to see the fruitful implementation of the treaties regarding Panamanian sovereignty over the Canal Zone.35.	We give our greatest sympathy and our unconditional support to the struggle of the Chilean people to restore their democratic rights. We support the struggle of all the peoples of Latin America against the imperialist monopolies to ensure full sovereignty over their natural resources.36.	Over the last 12 months  the world has noted with indignation the multifarious alliances formed by the imperialists and international reactionaries for purposes of infiltration in all regions of the world in order to provoke dissension and to sow discord among peoples. To carry out their policy of domination and expansionism  the imperialists and reactionaries do not hesitate to provoke conflicts and engage in armed aggression.37.	Thus  in South-East Asia the international reactionaries  flouting the elementary norms of international law and the traditional conduct of nations  have become embroiled in a wide-scale armed aggression against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which they have accused of having assisted the heroic people of Kampuchea  threatened with extermination  in overthrowing their tyrants. Since then protests such as ' 'Hands off Viet Nam"" have been made on the international scene and recently  during the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries  thanks were expressed to Viet Nam and support was offered for its firm resolve to safeguard and to build up its beloved homeland and for its active participation in the work of national independence and peace among the peoples of the world. But  notwithstanding the universal condemnation of the aforementioned aggression  the international reactionaries have continued to display an arrogant attitude stating that they would teach Viet Nam a ""second lesson"" if they deemed it necessary. Such acts of aggression could be committed against anyone as long as the Peking leaders arrogate to themselves the right to teach sovereign States lessons.38.	Today Viet Nam is the victim; tomorrow it may be the Lao People's Democratic Republic  the People's Republic of Kampuchea or  indeed  other countries. In view of this grave situation now prevailing in South-East Asia  we appeal to the international community to demonstrate vigilance in order to prevent another war  which might have incalculable consequences.39.	As things stand as regards my country  the champions of reactionary power in Peking  through their manoeuvres and hostile acts  oppose the revolutionary work of the Lao people. They have massed several divisions of troops along our borders; they have sent spies and pirates to Laos  provoked constant disturbances  sown subversion  brought about division among the ethnic minorities of Laos and gathered together all the exiled Lao reactionary exiles into a trumped-up ""Lao Socialist Party"".183 . Worse yet  in order to conceal their dark and evil designs  they have  under the fallacious pretext of ""taking in refugees""  on the one hand  goaded young people from Laos to flee their homeland and to become refugees  and  on the other hand  attracted to south China several thousands of former soldiers and people who are hated by progressive Lao society and who had sought refuge in Thailand.184.	At the same time  they have deployed enormous efforts to sap the friendship and solidarity existing between Laos and Viet Nam and between Laos  Viet Nam and Kampuchea in the hope of weakening those three countries and of making preparations for the eventual overthrow of the new regime in our country.185.	The Lao People's Democratic Republic is an independent  sovereign country  a member of the non- aligned movement and a Member of the United Nations. We have a domestic and foreign policy that is independent and we are masters of our own fate and will allow no country to interfere in our internal affairs.186.	After the total liberation of the country  the multinational Lao people more than any other strives to live in peace  friendship and co-operation with other nations  especially with our neighbours  in order that we may concentrate all our efforts and national potential on rebuilding the country  which saw heavy destruction during the war  on improving our living conditions and on contributing to peace and stability in South-East Asia and throughout the world. The Lao People's Democratic Republic is a small country with a population of 3 million and a backward economy. Therefore it is not in a position to threaten a country of about a billion people such as China. The Lao people and the Chinese people have long enjoyed good relations of friendship. The Chinese authorities alone are responsible for the deterioration in the relations between our two countries. Their derogatory remarks and fallacious propaganda will never succeed in turning the people of the Lao People's Democratic Republic away from our independent policy or to break the great militant solidarity and friendship between the Lao people  the Vietnamese people and the Kampuchean people. We demand that the Peking leaders put an end to their threat to Laos and respect our independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.187.	The abiding foreign policy of the Lao People's Democratic Republic is one of peace  independence  friendship and non-alignment. That policy is in line with the geopolitical situation in Laos and our future and long-term interests and is a response to the profound aspirations of the peoples of Laos and of South-East Asia.188.	We heartily welcome our relations of militant solidarity  friendship and fraternal co-operation with the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the People's Republic of Kampuchea  which are becoming ever stronger and more developed each day.189.	We are continually developing our good relations with the Soviet Union and the other fraternal socialist countries. We are delighted at the fruitful good- neighbourly relations that we enjoy with the Kingdom of Thailand  and we strive to make the common border between our two countries one of peace and friendship. We want to do our utmost to develop friendly relations and many-sided co-operation with the countries of South-East Asia in order to work to make that region a zone of peace  independence  neutrality  stability and prosperity.190.	The focal-points of tension still to be found in various regions of the world as a result of imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism and expansionism are a serious obstacle to the development of detente and disarmament  towards which countries which cherish peace  independence and justice are striving.191.	In the field of disarmament  we consider that the results of the work of the tenth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is an appropriate basis for concrete action. It is up to us more than ever before to envisage necessary provisions so that those results can be translated as quickly as possible into action.192.	Peace  and the security of peoples  can never be ensured by stockpiling weapons. Every effort to curb the arms race  in conventional as well as in nuclear terms  and to reduce the existing stockpiles  deserves strong encouragement. It is in this spirit that my delegation is delighted by the recent signature of the treaty resulting from the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in Vienna by President Brezhnev and President Carter. We support the policies and efforts of the Soviet Union  as well as the other socialist countries  for peace  international detente  and disarmament. We consider that the treaty will open the way to several others on a more far-reaching scale  thus increasing the momentum of the process of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.193.	In this context  we await with interest the conclusion in the near future of other international treaties  particularly that concerning the non-use of force in international relations  since we are convinced that that type of treaty will help to promote a climate of trust which is useful for disarmament.194.	For these same reasons  we appreciate  and  indeed  support the initiative taken by the Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic in requesting the inclusion of an additional item called: ""Adoption of a declaration on international co-operation for disarmament"" in the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly  and we welcome the decisions taken at the last session of the General Assembly regarding the item on the preparation and education of societies for life in peace as well as on international ""Disarmament Week""  proposed respectively by the Polish People's Republic and the Mongolian People's Republic.195.	We likewise consider that the convening of a world disarmament conference  the need for which has been recognized by everyone  will enable us to achieve measures which will speed up our march towards the final goal of general and complete disarmament.196.	We reaffirm our support for the proposal to make the Indian Ocean a nuclear-free zone of peace   free of any foreign military base; we support the demands of the coastal peoples and Governments for the dismantling of the military and nuclear base on Diego Garcia.197.	We share and support the idea that the dissolution of blocs  pacts and military alliances will help strengthen  develop and render irreversible the process of international detente.198.	Accordingly  we consider that the inclusion on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly of an item called: ""Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations""  proposed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  is most timely  and we fully support it.199.	We favour the creation of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace wherever this is possible  with the consent of all States concerned.200.	As regards detente and reducing tension between nations  we welcome the fact that negotiations between the Soviet Union and China for normalizing their relations have been resumed. We appreciate and support the just position and serious attitude of the Soviet Union in trying to achieve concrete results  and thus extend the sphere of detente to all regions of the world.201.	The gap between the developed countries and the developing countries becomes ever wider. This situation  which cannot last much longer without endangering international peace and security  is a result  as we all know too well  of the persistence of the unjust basis on which international economic relations rest. These relations  characterized by dependence  exploitation and inequality  have shown themselves for a long time now of being incapable of stimulating the development of under-developed countries and contributing to the elimination of their economic and social ills  which were engendered by centuries of colonial  neo-colonial and imperialist exploitation.202.	In order to remedy that serious situation  the sixth special session of the General Assembly  which met in 1974  examined the problem of international economic development in all its aspects  and adopted by consensus a Declaration and a Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order that would be more just and more equitable. Five years have elapsed since the adoption of those texts  and the economic situation of the developing countries  far from improving  has continually grown worse. However  despite this highly disturbing fact  negotiations have proceeded within the United Nations and in various specialized bodies to implement measures which have been advocated to establish the new international economic order; but the results have been meagre be-cause of the lack of political will on the part of most of the developed market-economy countries  which are hanging on to their vested privileges. The recent failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD  held in Manila last May  is a perfect demonstration of that point.203.	It is imperative  in the interests of balanced and harmonious development of all countries  both developed and developing  as well as in the interests of safeguarding international peace and security  that the developed market-economy countries put an end to their dilatory practices and adopt a policy of real effective co-operation with the developing countries. This could make it possible for the new international economic order to emerge.204.	Before concluding  I should like to reaffirm the commitment of my country to the purposes and principles of the United Nations  which have always guided our conduct in our relations with other countries. We are convinced that scrupulous respect for these principles by all Member States will help to contribute to the advent of a better worldâa world where detente  disarmament  co-operation and peaceful coexistence will reign. The work of this session will bring us closer to that goal. The delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic will spare no effort to make an active contribution to that goal  and we hope for the brilliant success of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly."
"76",3956,"LBN",34,1979,"ï»¿Sir  it gives me great pleasure to extend to you the sincere congratulations of the Lebanese delegation on your election as President of the General Assembly for this session. We are confident that your great personal qualifications  wisdom and vast experience in international affairs  as well as the unanimous trust you inspire among Member States  will ensure the effectiveness and success of this session.4.	I also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the ambassador of Colombia  for the important role he played during his presidency of our last session.5.	May I also take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the superb efforts which the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has been ceaselessly making to strengthen the role of the world Organization and to enable it to fulfil its noble ideals. Yearning for the blessings of peace more than any other country  Lebanon feels particularly appreciative of and grateful for the courageous initiatives and zealous activity which the Secretary-General has taken in order to bring about a just peace.6.	My delegation joins in welcoming Saint Lucia on its admission as a Member of the United Nations and looks forward to its contribution to the work of the Organization.7.	For the fifth consecutive year  the delegation of Lebanon comes to this Assembly burdened by the weight of a nation's tragedy in all the complexity of its manifold aspects and causes. I should have liked to devote a major part of my statement to a discussion of the political  economic  social and cultural problems and attendant troubles which rack our world with conflict today. I should also have liked to discuss the various items on our agenda and offer our modest contribution to the common efforts and measures to find appropriate solutions to the problems we face. My country's well-known and consistent positions on these questions Eire based on its strong commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and on out- constant dedication to the promotion of friendship  cooperation and solidarity among States  on the basis of mutual respect and understanding.8.	However  the magnitude of the ordeal which has befallen my country compels me to concentrate on the tragedy prevailing in and around Lebanon  in order to reveal its dimensions to the conscience of the world  represented by your Assembly  to denounce everything that has so severely victimized my country and to inform you of the aspirations of the people and Government of Lebanon and of what they expect from the international community.9.	Lebanon  in whose name I have the honour of addressing you  has safeguarded the essential elements of its existence in spite of the ravages of war which have rent it apart. Maintaining its faith in the efficacy of the principles of collective solidarity  it appeals to international organizations and seeks their assistance in overcoming its problems.10.	A country which enjoys so much natural and human wealth and which has been chosen for Divine revelations  Lebanon has become a model of harmony and human fulfilment. Yet today  the forces of rejection carried to their extreme have combined together with the expansionist designs  selfish desires and will for domination harboured by some States to destroy its moral values and material resources.11.	Whatever impressions one might have acquired about the Lebanese  the fact is that they have firmly resisted and have been and will continue to face up to this challenge to their survival. In the course of the successive stages of their tragedy  with its multiplicity of facets and protagonists  and after each cycle of violence  which has caused thousands of innocent victims and wreaked total destruction  the Lebanese have emerged with remarkable resilience and vitality to heal their wounds and to reconstruct their country. Their strong attachment to the values and fundamental principles which constitute the pillars of the Lebanese way of life has prevented the collapse and disappearance of their homeland. They have even made progress in some areas. The dynamism of hope and confidence in the future have helped them to transcend the consequences of their recent past and has strengthened their natural faith in a common vision that national reconciliation  unity and security will be restored. Thus the desire of the Lebanese to make progress along the path of understanding and unity has become more solid.12.	Nevertheless  despite the support and the praiseworthy initiatives undertaken by some brotherly and friendly States  this objective is beset by obstacles which are of concern to us because they are alien to our aspirations and our will and which give rise to forebodings  and even the certainty  on our part that we the Lebanese both as individuals and as a group of communities have fallen victim to something external to us which is far and away beyond our possibilities and our means of action.13.	In no way are we seeking to repudiate our responsibility or to deny the existence of factors of discord on our own soil. There is no shortage of political  economic and social problems in our country  as indeed in every other. But the grave dangers which their country has had to face in recent years has engendered in some individuals and groups of our compatriots a new state of mind which is not always averse to violence or excess.14.	Of course we bear the responsibility because it is our country and our cause. The Lebanese people and their leaders are in duty bound to take the appropriate initiatives and make the necessary sacrifices to extricate themselves from this ordeal  rehabilitate the country and restore security and prosperity everywhere and for everyone.15.	However  the problems which we have been facing for live years have certain causes and ramifications which we must point out here frankly and clearly since they extend far beyond the borders of Lebanon and its possibilities and energies and require the international community to come to grips with its real responsibilities.16.	Yes  Lebanon is the victim of international politics and it is important for us here to review  even if only briefly  those factors that are threatening the very existence of a people and a nation which certainly does not deserve their perpetuation.17.	Lebanon is not only a victim of the violation of the Charter of the United Nations and this Organization's inability to find a just solution to a problem it has helped to create  but it is also as a member of the international community a victim of the exploitation of its unique structure and its democratic regime.18.	Indeed  Lebanon is the victim of the Israeli usurpation of the Arab land of Palestine  the expulsion of the Palestinian people and the tense crisis that has constantly held the region in its grip following that aggression.19.	Lebanon is the victim of vicissitudes in the inter-national balance of forces in the Middle East which have touched off the crisis prevailing in the region and this crisis has  in turn  constantly exacerbated the international play of forces  unleashing active international currents which have disrupted the country and placed the cohesiveness and unity of our people in jeopardy.20.	Lebanon is a victim of attempts at partial solutions of the Middle East crisis  which we cannot endorse  especially since the principles on which they are based fail completely to take account of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and in particular their right to self-determination in their own country.21.	Lebanon is the victim of contradictions in the Arab world of which it is a part. These contradictions have exploded on our territory in different ways  without counting irregular activities that sometimes use the Palestinian cause as a pretext for pressing dubious goals having nothing to do with the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.22.	Lebanon is the victim of the burden imposed upon it by the ever increasing presence on its soil of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The ideologies adopted by some of them as a result of their plight inevitably come into conflict with the philosophy of the State and its vision of the future and with the beliefs of a number of national groups. The varied and dangerous excesses which this situation breeds cannot fail to affect adversely the unity of the country and the authority of the State.23.	Lebanon is the victim of interference by various States and groups in its internal affairs; this is a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law and is a serious derogation from sound principles and objectives.24.	Lebanon is the victim of the Israeli aggression  particularly in the south  and its strategy of preventive attack for political and military objectives  a strategy which we firmly repudiate as prejudicial to the Lebanese State.25.	Lebanon is the victim of its unique structure as a point of convergence of many religious and spiritual communities which live together in complete freedom under a regime which ensures that each may play an active role in the national life. The events as perpetrated by their instigators have tended to make this particular feature of our country  which is in itself a source of national and human richness  a factor making for conflict and discord.26.	Lebanon has since its accession to independence been the victim of its selection of a liberal democratic system based on the recognition of fundamental human rights  respect for the sanctity of the human person and a total openness to all civilizations and peoples. Several foreign parties have abused the advantages of this system to infiltrate the city and  by taking advantage of this freedom  to try to destroy the Lebanese State by under-mining its very foundations.27.	Before our destiny became the plaything of foreigners  we were able in a spirit of co-operation  dialogue and compromise to solve all our problems within the framework of our democratic institutions. That is why in the light of what I have said I can state that there is no reason to hold Lebanon responsible for everything it is undergoing and suffering today  unless we consider a spirit of tolerance and open-mindedness  allegiance to feelings of brotherhood  generosity in human relations  faith in right and justice  compassion for the oppressed and a desire to preserve the unity and sovereignty of the country as weaknesses for which we can be politically blamed to such a point that Lebanon has become the victim of them and is rapidly becoming the main one. Friendly and brotherly States as well as the world Organization apparently forget this fact or pretend to forget it. Let us beware of creating in the Middle East a cause in the development and complications of the Lebanese tragedy that will eclipse and overshadow the Palestinian cause in all its gravity and dimensions.28.	The best illustration of the current phase of the continuing Lebanese tragedy is the violence and destruction that is occurring in the south. That cherished part of our country has for months been the scene of the devastating war that is being waged there. Its innocent civilians  if they are not killed by the hundreds  are scattered by in their tens of thousands and deprived of their means of earning a livelihood. They have become refugees in their own country  thus swelling the sad ranks of those Lebanese who have been driven by war out of their towns and villages into a life beset by all imaginable misfortune and perils.29.	The grave situation prevailing in the south of Lebanon  which has been caused by Israel's failure to withdraw completely  by the fact that the United Nations Force has been prevented from carrying out the mission assigned to it by the Security Council  and by continuous Israeli aggression  is of concern to our Organization for more than one reason.30.	A year ago  Lebanon was in a state of great turmoil. The decisive role played in that turmoil was played not only by internal elements but also by the serious repercussions of the Israeli-Egyptian negotiations. Hardly had we emerged from that period when we were confronted with constantly and increasingly deep-seated and serious problems concerning the country's security and its future as well as the role to be played by the United Nations in the region  to say nothing of the role of the great Powers. These grave problems bring the Security Council face to face with its responsibilities and pose a challenge to the international community.31.	As everyone knows  there is no more serious threat to international peace than the situation in the Middle East. And there is no more immediate or direct threat to peace in the Middle East than the situation in southern Lebanon  where UNIFIL has been operating under Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978).32.	We can hardly fail to stress the vital role played by these forces and to express our appreciation and gratitude to all the Force's officers and men. We should like once again to express our profound thanks and gratitude to the Security Council  to the States contributing forces to UNIFIL  to the members of the United Nations Secretariat and especially to the Secretary-General himself.33.	To best bring out the vital importance of the UNIFIL presence in southern Lebanon and its decisive role there  I shall merely quote the very lucid words of the Secretary-General himself in his report on the work of the Organization;""I am firmly convinced that UNIFIL has performed  and is performing  an absolutely essential task of conflict control in one of the most sensitive and explosive parts of the world. This seems to me to be an overriding argument for maintaining it in spite of all difficulties and disagreements. While I shall persist in my efforts to achieve the objectives set for UNIFIL by the Security Council  I think it is important that the current value of the operation  in all its difficulty  should be more fully recognized. The easiest way to prove the value of the task UNIFIL is now performing would be to withdraw the Force. In present circumstances this would undoubtedly be a highly irresponsible and almost certainly disastrous experiment  and I do not believe that anyone properly informed of the situation would seriously advocate it.""34.	However  the extraordinary difficulties encountered by UNIFIL in carrying out its mandate call for a review of the situation and the adoption of measures commensurate with the responsibility assumed by the Security Council in conformity with the exigencies of peace in the region and the principles of the United Nations Charter.35.	There can be no doubt that the task of UNIFIL in southern Lebanon differs from the mandates given to such forces in other regions of the world. In view of the circumstances in which the Force must operate and the purpose for which it was created  the Security Council saw fit to give it a role which was not limited merely to supervising the disengagement of the belligerents and maintaining an observation mission. In Lebanon the Force is required to play a much more active role than that of mere mediator. The proof is that UNIFIL was ordered to ensure the withdrawal of military forces and to assist in the restoration of Lebanese sovereignty throughout the region  and was assigned a theatre of operations in the true meaning of the term. Furthermore  when the Security Council adopted resolution 425 (1978) it was fully aware of the situation prevailing in southern Lebanon. Accordingly  the idea arose to empower UNIFIL to defend itself and to overcome by force anything that might constitute an obstacle to the accomplishment of its mission.36.	UNIFIL is an embodiment of the unanimous international will and carries with it the prestige of the United Nations. We must therefore spare no effort to equip it to carry out its obligations in a manner compatible with the objectives for which it was created so as to avoid compromising the credibility of the Security Council  and thus diminishing its effectiveness and its ability to deal with threats to the peace both now and in the future. Any failure of UNIFIL would  we believe  become a totally unacceptable precedent for the international community.37.	I should like  in this connexion  to emphasize that Lebanon has fully co-operated with UNIFIL since its inception. Lebanon is making progress in the direction of revamping its armed forces; thus  despite all obstacles  it was able  in co-ordination with UNIFIL  to dispatch a Lebanese army battalion to the south on 18 April 1979; moreover  it already operates most of the administrative services in the theatre of operations. The Lebanese Government is prepared progressively to take over its share of the responsibilities in the south of the country.38.	The main factor enlarging the dimensions of the danger and instability in the south is the policy officially proclaimed by Israel to the effect that it arrogates to itself the right to make preventive military strikes anywhere in Lebanon on the pretext of checkmating the Palestinian resistance.39.	As a preliminary to its intentions and policy with regard to southern Lebanon  Israel opposed the deployment of the Arab Peace-keeping Force  which performed so well in other regions of Lebanon  south of the line which became known as the ""red line"".40.	Now Israel is constantly launching murderous military operations by land  sea and air against Lebanese towns and villages. I shall confine myself to mentioning the operations initiated on 23 January  11 April  30 May  10 and 23 July  and 4 and 22 August of this year  all of which caused many casualties and have each been the subject of a complaint which we have brought before the Security Council. 41.	It is absolutely out of the question to tolerate such a policy  even if Israel claims that these-strikes are reprisals for prior operations undertaken by the Palestinian resistance in the occupied territories.42.	I honestly wonder what would become of the principles of the Charter if Israel's point of view was accepted. What would remain of the standards of inter-national public law which prohibit aggression and tyranny? What would be left of the Security Council resolutions relating to southern Lebanon  which were included between resolution 425 (1978) and resolution 450 (1979)? What would become of all the hopes which the peoples have placed in our Organization as the comer-stone of a new  healthy and just international order whose mission is to prevent international relations from being governed by the law of the jungle? Israel's claims that infiltrations sometimes take place across UNIFIL lines is devoid of foundation but  even assuming it were true for the sake of argument  what has that got to do with Lebanon?43.	UNIFIL comes under the orders of the Security Council  not Lebanon. Lebanon proclaims from this rostrum that it is determined to regain its sovereignty and authority in the south up to its international frontiers not only in relation to Israel but also to all other forces present in the theatre of operations. Lebanon has frequently made this claim and has expressed this view in its correspondence with the Secretary- General and in its notes to the Security Council.44.	The continuance of military operations in southern Lebanon is likely to create a climate of instability which might have negative repercussions on any attempt to control the situation in the region and bring about a peaceful settlement of the Middle East crisis.45.	In this connexion suffice it for me to quote what was said by the President of our Assembly  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  in his address:""The tragic situation in Lebanon continues to cause serious concern to the international community. The senseless bombing of civilian targets  causing considerable loss of life and destruction  further threaten the peace and security of the region. The world community must redouble its efforts to bring an end to this tragedy  so that the freedom  independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon are respected.""46.	It is neither just nor logical that our country should be prey to factors of disintegration because the Palestinian people wish to recover their legitimate rights and their right to self-determination  which Israel refuses to grant them. Similarly it is neither just nor logical that Lebanon should be the principal victim to undergo the martyrdom imposed upon it by the oppressor without  however  being spared by the oppressed  whose cause  though just  pushes him to excesses that are sometimes ascribed to his state of despair. Is Lebanon condemned to suffer injustice from the hands of the oppressor and also sometimes the oppressed?47.	It is high time that southern Lebanon  and consequently Lebanon as a whole  should with the help of the international family be removed from the toils of the infernal game of war and peace and that its own case should be given absolute priority  so that it will no longer be a hostage in the Middle East turmoil or a football tossed about by the parties according to their desires and interests. Its sons have spilled too much blood and shed too many tears and lost too much of their property and have paid too great a price for faults and injustices committed elsewhere for which they bear no responsibility. Lebanon has reached a threshold beyond which it is no longer able to carry on without risking the loss of its own identity.48.	Before concluding my statement  I should like to reply to a question which  I imagine  all present are asking themselves  namely  what is Lebanon asking of the United Nations at this stage and what can the United Nations do?49.	Lebanon's requests are addressed not solely to the United Nations but also to each of its Members and especially to the most powerful among them. These requests are the following.50.	Because of its geographical location  its Arab obligations and commitments and its faith in the principles of right and justice in international relations  Lebanon believes that the United Nations must in its search for a radical solution to the Middle East crisis deal with the substance of the Palestinian question  so that the Palestinian people may be able to exercise their legitimate and inalienable rights  the first of which is their right to self-determination and to the establishment of a Palestinian State on Palestinian soil. This naturally implies the total and unconditional evacuation of all occupied Arab territory in accordance with United Nations resolutions.51.	Furthermore  it is equally self-evident that the idea must be finally and definitively rejected that the Palestinians can be settled anywhere outside their own land  and in particular Lebanon's categorical refusal to agree to their settlement in our country  in the interest of both Lebanon and the Palestinians themselves  must be regarded as the final word.52.	Lebanon has often stated  through its President  on behalf of the Lebanese people as a whole that it absolutely refuses to agree to the settlement of the Palestinians on its territory and rejects any attempt which would in one way or another effect such a settlement or impair its sovereignty or the independence and unity of its territory and people. Lebanon rejects any solution to the Middle East crisis that may be made at its expense.53.	Until such a radical solution is found  agreed upon and implemented  we believe we are within our rights in asking the United Nations and all its Member States to consider that they must deal also with the Lebanese crisis in its own terms and not as part of the Middle East crisis. Because of what our country represents geographically and politically as well as in human terms  it deserves to be a focus of the attention of the international community with a view to preserving its unity  independence and sovereignty as a model for the Middle East and even  perhaps  the world. It also deserves the support and help expressed not by mere words but by positive and concrete acts.54.	We ask that a speedy  definitive and firm stop should be put to all Israeli aggression against Lebanon whatever the form it may take  particularly the form of a preventive attack against Lebanese territory. We also demand the full reintegration of southern Lebanon into the Lebanese State  which should be given the means of recovering its full sovereignty and authority throughout that area with respect to all individuals and groups without exception  of restoring security and of preventing  any subversive activities on its territory.55.	Apart from the diplomatic activity that must be exercised by our Organization and the Member States concerned  the best means of achieving that goal is first of all to strengthen the role of the United Nations Force in the south of the country so as to enable it to carry out its task in a comprehensive way. UNIFIL can then prevent any military activities of whatever origin in the south  control the situation and  in conjunction with the Lebanese forces  ensure the progressive pacification of the territory and the exercise of the jurisdiction of the State over the area in accordance with the letter and spirit of Security Council resolutions  without fear or favour. It would then become necessary to provide the Force with the means of action and the directives it needs to give effect to that goal  and the Lebanese authorities are ready and willing to work with UNIFIL for that purpose.56.	We ask that with your support and in the interests of international peace an area of stability and calm should be established in southern Lebanon where the provisions of the Lebanese-Israeli General Armistice Agreement   which is still fully in force and which has been ratified by the Security Council and reconfirmed again in its last resolution 450 (1979)  should be scrupulously observed in the interval before a radical and just solution is found for the Palestinian cause in the framework of a global peace.57.	The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] the sole representative of the Palestinian people  which has through its spirit of combativeness and its just cause been able to breach the diplomatic isolation in which it was sought to be kept  is urgently called upon in the present circumstances to prepare to shoulder the heavy responsibility that has been conferred upon it  to live up to the hopes that it embodies and to channel its vitality and its activities in southern Lebanon into political and diplomatic action. In this regard it should undertake positive initiatives which would be likely to reassure the Lebanese people and which would be in keeping with the exigencies of the rights of Lebanon and the security of its territory. It would thus prove its capacity for self-control in all circumstances and would demonstrate its absolute respect for the resolutions of the Security Council and its concern to safeguard both its higher interests and its relations with the Lebanese people  who have suffered more for the Palestinian cause than any other Arab people. Such an attitude is dictated by a spirit of true brotherhood  a sense of responsibility and a clear-sighted long-range political vision.â58.	It goes without saying  obviously  that one of the prerequisites for carrying out our demands is the extent of the support which the great Powers give to United Nations initiatives and the laying of the groundwork for a political climate that would facilitate the acceptance of what logic and the recognition of the rule of law demand. No one can be unaware that these Powers have a multiplicity of means of constraint and persuasion available to them in achieving their goals. This is particularly the case since the arms used for aggressive purposes in southern Lebanon were obtained under agreements concluded with the United States of America which prohibit their use for the purposes for which the Israelis are using them.59.	I am in duty bound to point out that this business has aroused dismay in international political circles  particularly within the United States  where many responsible officials have expressed their interest and concern at the fact that the use of American- manufactured weapons in southern Lebanon is a violation of American law and the undertakings entered into by Israel on the subject. Thus the United States must bear a heavy burden of political and moral responsibility.60.	In conclusion  we are convinced that the United Nations commitment to us does not exonerate us from undertaking our own diplomatic initiatives in another framework with a view to helping to achieve the goals we have set. And I must point out that this type of action is fully consistent with our thinking and is being taken up.61.	Since we are convinced of the need for a frank dialogue with our friends and brothers and since we are firmly convinced that our country should not be the prey of anyone's greed  we have pursued such diplomatic action within the framework of the Arab community and we have requested its highest bodies to work out with us a plan of action that would take due account of the obligations of that community and of our own possibilities now that Lebanon has become what is unacceptable to us: the only battlefield in the Middle East.62.	Last year the General Assembly adopted a resolution to which we attach great importance and which deals with economic and humanitarian assistance to Lebanon  as well as with the coordination of international and local activities with a view to its reconstruction and development.63.	If I have deliberately left aside the question of the assistance unfailingly provided by the United Nations and the specialized agencies  as well as by various States  it is not because we underestimate the importance and usefulness of such assistance nor the gratitude which we owe to its donors. But in view of the urgency of executing the demands which we have put forward and the wholesome impact this would have on the situation in Lebanon as a whole we decided we had to give priority to them.64.	The satisfaction of these demands would contribute to the establishment of a political and psychological climate in Lebanon that would help to strengthen the common goals of all the Lebanese  namely national understanding  which  in turn  would have a positive effect on the situation we have described. Similarly  the recovery by the State of its authority over any particular area would have favourable repercussions over other areas of Lebanon.65.	Both because of its system and the way of life of its people  Lebanon has been and could again become an example of the noble principles that lie at the basis of the United Nations  of which Lebanon has the honour to be one of the founders. Thus preserving this achievement  which embodies all of mankind's aspirations to live in tolerance  brotherhood and love  by helping it to overcome this crisis is a necessity not only for it and for its region but also for all mankind and for the international community's mission.66.	Our history  which goes back thousands of years  includes many pages of black tragedy as well as just as many pages of dazzling splendours. Our mountains and our rivers have looked on throughout the centuries as whole processions of conquerors and usurpers have descended upon the country  but have also seen them invariably beaten back  as the inscriptions on the rocky walls not far from our capital proclaim. Thus Lebanon endures.67.	The people of Lebanon  resolved to preserve their land  to defend their rights and to repel all dangers from whatever quarter  as well as the greeds which surround them and which seek to break their unity  is strong with its own force and with a consciousness of its own powers and its sacred right to live in freedom and dignity. Let our Organization  through the ways and means given to it by the Charter  not begrudge us its aid and support."
"77",4000,"LBR",34,1979,"ï»¿Five years hence a century will have elapsed since Africa stood defenceless before the Powers at Berlin. The very nations that had then long plundered Africa's treasures and snatched its children into slavery were declaring that even in his African homeland the African would not be free. Injustice and indignity would be visited upon the African within Africa  the only place on earth which is his home. At that very time  there had stood undaunted  though defied  for 37 years  the symbol of Africa's invincible soul  the torch of Africa's vindication  the flame of Africa's resurgency  the Republic of Liberia  materially weak but spiritually strong.3.	Alas  the years have fleetingly gone by  and today  on behalf of 49 African sovereignties  comprising nearly one third of this Assembly  a Liberian President appears here endeavouring  humbly yet with pride  to speak not of vengeance but of victory  not of power but of justice  not of confrontation but of reconciliation  not of conflict but of accommodation  not of self-centred action and protectionism but of genuine co-operation for global advancement. We have come to speak not of domination but of development  not of divisiveness but of unity  not of hoarding but of sharing  not of hate but of love  not of human exploitation but of human rights  not of war but of peace.4.	What better evidence could be adduced that Africa is fast gaining its rightful place in the forefront of human affairs? In the span of less than a century since 1884âto which I have referredâAfrica has made substantive advances from the throes of servitude to frontiers of significance; from the depths of exploitation into the councils of human uplift. This new emergence  however  is seen by Africans not so much as the attainment of an inheritance long denied but as a relished opportunity and challenge for a great continent  the cradle of human civilization and of human life itself  to rise from slumber and swiftly make its uniquely African contribution to international relations in a troubled world.5.	Our sense of the historic significance of Africa's role in world affairs in these limes is further heightened  Sir  by your election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. You are  Sir  one of Africa's most outstanding and proven sons of ability. Hailing from the gallant and freedom-loving sister State of the United Republic of Tanzania  both you and your country stand in the forefront of the as yet unfinished task of African liberation  unity and development. On the battlefields of southern Africa where the war for liberation goes on  Tanzania's well-known and constructive efforts place it at the front lines of global freedom and justice. In the halls of international diplomacy and debate  no less than in the realm of constructive ideas and pragmatic action  Tanzania's statesmanship and diplomacy have championed the African cause. All of these reasons  coupled with your personal attributes of experience and knowledge  energy and affability  make us confident that you will guide the work of this session of the Assembly to fruitful and significant conclusions.6.	We should also like to express appreciation to Mr. Lievano of the Republic of Colombia for the successful manner in which he presided over the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.7.	We welcome the State of Saint Lucia as the one hundred and fifty-second Member of the United Nations. In admitting Saint Lucia to membership  the United Nations has thus moved one step further towards the achievement of its goal of universality.8.	Since the close of the thirty-third session  the African continent has been buffeted by muffled winds of mourning  in the home-going of two of its stalwart sons: Houari Boumediene  the President of the People's Republic of Algeria  and Antonio Agostinho Neto  the President of the People's Republic of Angola. President Neto was a heroic freedom fighter upon the last frontier of African independence  while President Boumediene stood valiantly among the pioneers of African and third- world emancipation  both political and economic. Their voices will be sorely missed in the honoured councils of our time  but we trust that their souls will rest within the hallowed cloisters of eternal bliss.9.	Liberia had the honour this past July of being host to the sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU in our capital city of Monrovia. As is now their annual custom  the leaders of Africa  motivated by a prevailing sense of unity and solidarity  were able to meet as brothers in a congenial atmosphere to tackle the momentous problems of Africa. The many far-reaching ""decisions taken in Monrovia are fresh illustrations of Africa's firm commitment to improving the lives of its peoples and of the sincere efforts being made by Africa to explore all reasonable and viable paths to inter-African co-operation  world security and peace.10.	Africa is resolved at this time  more than ever before  to accelerate the gains already made by African countries in the social and economic development fields. Many of the issues which are to be discussed during this session of the General Assembly bear directly on matters before the OAU. Unfortunately  too many of those issues before this Assembly for many years have remained unresolved. For example  nearly two decades after the General Assembly's resolution on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  the question of decolonization  especially in southern Africa  remains unsettled.11.	In the field of disarmament  the arms race between the super-Powers goes on unchecked. Moreover  and most regrettably  an increasingly high level of expenditure on arms continues to be made by almost all countries  including poor countries  whose meagre resources should be used productively to improve the living standards of their people. This trade in the merchandise of death is being pursued most vigorously by countries which  even as they derive great profits particularly in the most volatile and explosive regions of the world  continue to preach peace  whose champion they acclaim themselves to be.12.	A third example is the area of economic development where  in spite of two development decades declared by this great Organization  the development aid programmes of rich countries  numerous studies  and strategies for development  the rich countries are getting; richer while more and more of the poor ones are perishing.13.	Against this gloomy background the annual convening of the General Assembly presents the opportunity for all Members of this Organizationâwhich now embraces most nations of the worldâto meet peacefully  and through calm and consistent debate  and through reasonable proposals  endeavour to evolve a better world for all mankind.14.	While the vast majority of the world's population lives in ignorance  disease and poverty  the endless output of flowery speeches and wordy resolutions at the United Nations and other international forums have brought but little relief to afflicted humanity. Can the voices of so many go unheard for so long by the ears of so few?15.	Africa has the largest number of the world's poor countries  and many millions of our peoples live in abject poverty at a level of human subsistence which is an affront to the dignity of man. In Africa and other parts of our one world can the needs of so many remain unmet for so long?16.	Numerous programmes already being implemented by the United Nations deserve the fullest praise; but the many unresolved items on its agenda for development must remain priority action issues. Concurrently  the OAU believes that through unified and concerted effort within our own regional organization  and through productive alliances with other regions of the third world we who are  let it be saidâ""the wretched of the earth""âcan achieve true economic and social progress.17.	The establishment of the New International Economic Order is essential if the have-nots of this world are to have their just share of the immense endowments that a bounteous God has intended for distribution throughout the earth. Accordingly  the OAU will work even more vigorously in concert with the non-aligned group and other regional organizations  towards the implementation of the programme of action for the establishment of a more just and equitable world society.18.	Justly and equitably  the wealth of South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe belongs to the peoples of those States. Yet Africans who make up the vast majority of the populations there cannot enjoy their own land with dignity  nor can they even enjoy fair recompense for the fruits of their labour. Racism rules supreme  and the abhorrent policy of apartheid continues unabated.19.	The daily violation of the rights of human beings in southern Africa on account of race is a direct slap in the face of the nations of Africa  in particular  and a demeaning affront to this lofty Organization  whose moral and legal obligations to defend oppressed peoples everywhere cry out for discharge.20.	How long will the conscience of decent  civilized mankind allow racism and apartheid to remain a blot on our age? The arrogant racist regime in South Africa falsely believes that dissensions among African States  some of which South Africa itself stirs up  and the problems faced by our nations in the area of economic development will prevent Africa from liberating all Africans throughout the continent. Let the racists live with their misbeliefs  but Africa will not renege on its promise and its duty to the peoples of southern Africa. While the racists persist in their mischief  Africa will not rest until all of Africa stands tall in the sunlight of freedom.21.	The patience of Africa has worn thin  but Africa shall win. Good will triumph over evil! Right will conquer wrong! Victory is certain!22.	Africa is grateful for the stand taken and the support given by many nations of the world in the struggle against apartheid and racism. We anxiously await the day when all who articulate their disagreement with South Africa by pronouncements will courageously match their words with consistent deeds.23.	Motivated thus  we would urge the international community duly to recognize the need for increased assistance to the brave front-line States  which have greatly suffered and continue to bear heavy sacrifices in the struggle to free southern Africa from colonialism and racism. The front-line States  like other developing countries  must use their meagre resources not only to shoulder the inescapable responsibility of their own economic development  but to support the noble liberation struggle. Because of the hardships which they bear from the fury and onslaught of rapist assaults  these brave and heroic States should be given as much moral and material aid as the world community can provide.24.	We realize that no Stateâleast of all a non- African Stateâis compelled to aid the front-line States. At the same time  Africa feels that the acts of no country should give evidence of collusion with the racist regime of Pretoria. It is our fervent hope that all States Members of the United Nations should consider it morally wrong to co-operate in any way with South Africa  thus aiding in the perpetuation of the horrors of apartheid. None  indeed  preaching democracy and the right of the individual to liberty and the pursuit of happiness as a way of life should give support in any form to the evils as are endemic in the diabolical apartheid system.25.	But even if Africa must fight aloneâand may God grant that this will not be the case!âwe will not relent until  in His appointed time and with our combined strength  we shall demolish the vile structure of apartheid.26.	At the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government in Monrovia  Africa called once again for a complete oil and arms embargo and for other economic sanctions to be imposed on South Africa. The nuclear collaboration between South Africa and some Western Powers was deplored  and a strong demand was made that such collaboration should cease forthwith. The making of nuclear weapons available to desperate bands of racists is a most serious threat to world peace and security  and deserves the most urgent attention of this Organization.27.	In brazen defiance of the resolutions passed by the General Assembly and the Security Council  Pretoria continues its delaying tactics in the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of the international Territory of Namibia with the aim of establishing there a puppet regime. Such continued defiance  in our view  has left the Security Council with no alternative but to force an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia  by invoking enforcement measures against South Africa as provided for under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. We therefore call upon the Security Council to convene as soon as possible for this purpose.28.	That the South West Africa People's Organization [SWATO] is the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people is well established in resolutions of this body. It is therefore necessary that we continue to give increased material support to S WAPO in the struggle which it fearlessly spearheads by armed struggle and by negotiation for Namibia's freedom. The economic and moral support already given by the international community and the significant support given by the United Nations to the people of Namibia are greatly appreciated by all members of the OAU. Such support will continue to be required until every inch of Namibia  including Walvis Bay  is free.29.	If the new initiatives reportedly being undertaken by the five Western Powers hasten Namibia's peaceful transition to genuine independence  their efforts will merit our immense gratitude.30.	The events which have transpired in Zimbabwe  particularly the installation of a Government there headed by Bishop Muzorewa  have not deluded the OAU  nor should any other nation in good faith believe that the Muzorewa regime was freely and fairly elected by a majority of the populace.31.	The OAU unreservedly condemns the puppet Muzorewa regime and its view remains unchanged that Rhodesia is still a colony of the United Kingdom  in rebellion against the Crown. The OAU has called upon all of its member States to refrain from recognizing the Muzorewa regime  and any attempt at recognition of the illegal minority regime of Rhodesia by any member of the international community would be considered an act of hostility against Africa.32.	Meanwhile  the economic sanctions levied by the United Nations against Rhodesia must be maintained  for the lifting of those sanctions by any nation would be tantamount to recognition of the puppet regime.33.	In recognizing the Patriotic Front as the sole legitimate and authentic representative of the people of Zimbabwe  the OAU reaffirmed the legitimacy of the armed struggle waged by the Patriotic Front  called for its intensification and resolved to increase political  material and financial assistance to the Patriotic Front. This was the united stand of Africa taken at Monrovia.34.	Notwithstanding this  Africa has never closed the doors to a peaceful resolution of the Zimbabwean problem. That is why the nine-point plan on Zimbabwe adopted by the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held at Lusaka from 1 to 7 August  offered some encouragement to Africa. We are following with consuming interest the constitutional talks now under way in London  which have brought to the conference table the principal parties to the Zimbabwean problem. It is our fervent hope that a constitution and the appropriate modalities acceptable to all the parties concerned will emerge from the talks  so that Zimbabwe may accede to genuine independence with majority rule.35.	Regarding the grave danger to international peace and security inherent in the Middle East crisis  Africa reaffirmed in Monrovia its unrelenting support and un-swerving commitment to the struggle of the Palestinian people for the full realization and exercise of all of their national rights.36.	In pledging its full support and determination to continue to work for a lasting and just peace in the Middle East  Africa  speaking in Monrovia  condemned all partial agreements and treaties which violate the recognized rights of the Palestinian people and contradict the principles of just and comprehensive solutions to the Middle East problem.37.	If current peace initiatives in the Middle East are to lead to a comprehensive  just and durable settlement  it would seem imperative  in our view  that the framework of negotiation be expanded to include the Palestinian people  represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]. For the Palestinian people alone are entitled to speak for themselves  and their participation is indispensable to the success of any peace initiative in the Middle East.38.	The right of the State of Israel to exist must be respected by all  including the Palestinian people. At the same time  we must equally insist on full recognition and respect for the national rights of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel  especially their right to self-determination and a State of their own. Israel must withdraw from all occupied Arab territories. In this connexion  the establishment of settlements on Arab lands and the continued bombing of southern Lebanon by Israel  so destructive of innocent human lives  can only destroy the atmosphere required for a much desired peace and aggravate an already explosive situation.39.	In this  our one world  each human being has an inalienable right of return to a land he can call his home. That being true  each nation must remain safe and secure within its internationally recognized borders  from threats and terror  from intimidations and territorial violations.40.	In furtherance of reconciliation and accommodation in the Middle East  it is our earnest hope that fears will yield to confidence  misgivings to goodwill and conflict to peaceful coexistence.41.	In this spirit  Liberia appeals to all nations of the world to join in enhancing the process of peace in the Middle East  to the end that a comprehensive settlement of the existing conflict can be achieved.42.	As we insist that self-determination be applied to all peoples  we are challenged by the dangerous contentions in Western Sahara. Following mediation in this matter  and on the basis of the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara  the so-called committee of five wise men  the 0 AU decided in Monrovia that a proper atmosphere for peace should be created in the area through a general and immediate cease-fire  and that the right to self-determination be given the people of the Western Sahara in a general and free referendum which would enable them to choose either total independence or the maintenance of the status quo.43.	Having fully assumed its responsibility in this matter  Africa  through the committee of wise men  is continuing its initiatives towards securing the peaceful implementation of that decision. In this process  the sovereignty  territorial integrity and the internationally recognized borders of Mauritania must be respected.44.	Protracted disputes regarding self-determination  to which the people of the Western Sahara are entitled  only unnecessarily postpone more urgent problems of development  which the people of that area must tackle.45.	Violent political turbulence and foreign interferences in South-East Asia and other parts of the world have for too long prevented the upward thrust for progress and development. They have also led to the mass exodus of people from their countries. The flagrant and blatant abuse of the dignity and rights of men  women and children across the globe is clearly an abominable evil because it dislocates and destroys the most important resource of our planet.46.	For us in Africa  where there are now more than 4 million refugees  this problem has reached crisis pro-portions. We therefore address an urgent appeal to the international community for increased assistance to meet this alarming need of our 4 million refugees.47.	Full respect for human rights should be an absolute imperative in our times. An essential rationale of the United Nations is that its activities should lead to the enjoyment by all peoples of their human rights- civic  political  economic  social and cultural.48.	Africa subscribes to the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It was in this spirit that the sixteenth session of the OAU Assembly authorized the preparation of a preliminary draft of an African charter on human rights which would provide for the establishment of bodies to promote and protect human rights in Africa.49.	Our commitment to human rights is further evidenced by the fact that  upon the invitation of the Government of Liberia  and in accordance with a request of this Assembly  the Secretary-General of the United Nations organized at Monrovia  from 10 to 21 September  the United Nations Seminar on the Establishment of Regional Commissions on Human Rights with Special Reference to Africa. That seminar adopted a proposal for the establishment of an African commission on human rights. That Commission will conduct studies and research on African issues in the field of human rights; it will examine and assess the occurrence of alleged violations; and it will make reports and will propose for consideration legislation related to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedom. We shall give the closest attention to these important and constructive proposals  which  in our judgment  will bring us much nearer to our goal of a commission on human rights for Africa  established by Africans and consisting of Africans.50.	Africa desires peace; and we shall never hesitate to do all that is within our power to bring all African disputes to a peaceful settlement in the spirit of conciliation and accommodation. Peace and tranquillity must be established in Africa so that the mighty energies of a vibrant and resourceful people may be focused upon their social and economic development. The OAU is committed to a more important role in the process of human progress in Africa. This course is the more imperative because a large number of African and third- world countries continue to experience a decline in their balance of trade and export earnings  while their indebtedness and the cost of imports  especially energy  dramatically rise. These conditions greatly obstruct development goals and objectives.51.	During the past few years  intense negotiations have been held to establish a more equitable international order. Sadly  some nations of great power  wealth and influence do not seem desirous of ushering in such a new economic order.52.	Consequently  their actions have frustrated developing countries in the North-South dialogue  at the fifth session of UNCTAD  and at other world conferences  including the long-drawn-out Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.53.	Comprising nearly three quarters of our planet  the oceans are our last great frontier of untapped resources for an expanding human family. It is most unfortunate to note again that negotiations since 1958 to bring order and equity to their exploration and exploitation have still not ended. We therefore urge all nations to show every degree of accommodation and bring that historic Conference  now nearing completion  to a successful conclusion.54.	This year  once again  the issues involving the realization of the New International Economic Order are an important part of the Assembly's agenda. Several resolutions of acknowledgment have been adopted  but mere acknowledgment by developed countries is of only limited relevance to the immensity of problems with which developing nations are faced. The implementation of resolutions already adopted and the adoption and implementation of additional and more meaningful resolutions this year are essential to the economic survival of most nations of the third world.55.	The scope of these resolutions must range from commodities to currency stability  from indebtedness to energy. With rich nations staggering under the pressures of escalating energy costs and poor nations being crushed under the increasing weight of declining demand and spiralling product prices  the world community must come to grips with the growing energy crisis. We must work speedily towards the convening of a world energy conference to energize in newer ways our globally strangulated economies.56.	At the same time  we of the third world must translate our interdependence into productive actions  into regional and interregional projects  to the end that we may become self-reliant. The OAU  therefore  once again has fully committed itself to the resolutions of the sixth and seventh special sessions of the General Assembly calling for the advent of a New International Economic Order relevant to our very existence.57.	At the OAU Assembly in Monrovia  Africa resolved upon a co-operative course of coexistence  and adopted the Monrovia Declaration of Commitment for collective self-reliance and interdependent socio-economic development. An extraordinary Assembly of Heads of State and Government is scheduled to convene in Lagos  Nigeria  to tackle the subject of African economic development  highlighting regional and sub-regional development projects.58.	Also emerging from the OAU Assembly in Monrovia was the adoption of a Strategy for Economic Development in Africa  affirming the establishment of an African Economic Community and other recommendations contained in the report of the ECA-OAU Colloquium on Perspectives of Development and Economic Growth in Africa up to the Year 2000  which was held in Monrovia earlier this year. The sixteenth session of the OAU Assembly recommended that the General Assembly of the United Nations consider this strategy as an integral part of the international strategy for the third United Nations development decade.59.	Africa is counting on the continuing support of the United Nations and its specialized agencies for the implementation of this strategy.60.	May I here pay a most deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his continuing dedication to international peace and justice  for his conscientious efforts to make the institutional machinery of the United Nations more responsive to the needs of a growing international community and for his productive attention to the aspirations of the African peoples. His unswerving commitment to the objectives of the United Nations and his concern about the welfare of peoples everywhere were again demonstrated by his presence at the recent Monrovia OAU Assembly  as well as in other parts of Africa  and his visits to South-East Asia  Europe  the Caribbean and other regions of our one world during the course of the year. We extend to him our heartfelt commendation and pledge our fullest support and co-operation as he untiringly endeavours to bring to fruition the lofty goals of this world body.61.	Five years hence  as the centenary of the Conference on Berlin arrives  all in Africa will be confronting yet more dramatically together the challenge of a new age of African development. That challenge will not be met on the drawing-boards of any single nation  or by the perimeters of ideological influence; it will not be met through oppression or through subversion.62.	Neither armaments nor animosities will serve; nor will complexes  selfishness or prejudice. Rather  mankind must measure its varied resources and merge its vibrant energies through unity and solidarity among nations; through accommodation and reconciliation; through co-operation and alliances for progress; through the practice of love and the pursuit of peace and prosperity  for the building of a more wholesome functioning world society.63.	May Almighty Godâthe merciful Allahâprosper the works of the United Nations and bring unity and peace to our one world."
"78",4046,"LBY",34,1979,"ï»¿36.	On behalf of the delegation of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  I should like  Mr  President  to express our pleasure at your election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly.37.	I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for his dedicated efforts in conducting the proceedings of the thirty-third session  and to extend our congratulations to the State of Saint Lucia on its accession to independence and to membership in our Organization.38.	In further commending the efforts made by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  which have been unrelenting in the face of problems and their complexities  my country reiterates its support for his efforts as they are designed to strengthen the role of the Organization and to enhance its prestige and thus to bring about international peace and security  enabling the human race to enjoy the well-being it so desires.39.	Since we last met at the previous session of the General Assembly  the international community in general  and Africa in particular  have lost leaders whose role had been notable in the march of peace and the struggle against colonialism and racist regimes. The passing of the President of Algeria  Houari Boumediene and  more recently  the President of the People's Republic of Angola  Agostinho Neto  was a great loss both for Africa and for progressive and peace-loving forces in the world.40.	Despite the considerable efforts that have been  and are still being  made by the United Nations to achieve international peace and securityâpeace based on justice and Security based on the right of peoples to self-determination and to life and to freedomâone glance at the present international situation clearly shows us that we are still far from realizing the purposes for which this Organization was established or the objectives of humanity such as the achievement of peace  affluence and justice. Far too many peoples are still denied their right to self-determination and far too many peoples are still dominated by racist regimes and colonialism. The colonialist Powers are still clinging to their world privileges and monopolies  continuing in that way to exploit people  control their destinies and prevent them from exercising their national rights. The time has come to embark on a serious assessment of the international situation and of the work of this Organization over the 34 years that have passed since its inception. There can be no doubt that any objective assessment of the role of the United Nations  what it can do and what can be done to strengthen its various bodies and organs to make it more effective would require a revision of its Charter in such a way as to achieve equality and justice among its Members irrespective of their economic  political or military might.41. The present Charter was drafted under difficult international conditions  following a destructive war that had upset the balance of power  and at a time when independent States numbered no more than 51. Those conditions have changed  as has the international political and economic situation  and this necessitates the revision of the Charter and the elimination of the privileges which the great Powers conferred upon themselves under the aforementioned conditions. At their recent Sixth Conference  held in Havana  the non-aligned countries  which represent the international human potential  unanimously adopted a resolution submitted by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya with the aim of eliminating the veto in the United Nations.43.	The achievement of international peace and security will remain the aim of the human race; and the United Nationsâwhich brings together all the peoples of the worldâwill continue to bear the responsibility of realizing that aim  which cannot be achieved without the attainment by the peoples of complete freedom  whether political or economic. One glance at the present international situation confirms that humanity  despite all the various efforts exerted  is still far from reaching its objective. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights still goes unheeded in many parts of the world. Heinous racism  in its various forms and with its inhuman practices  continues. Colonialist Powers still dominate and control the economies of developing countries both by direct monopolies and through their multinational corporations. More than three quarters of the population of the earth still lives in a state of dire poverty  and a minority still monopolizes the world economy and utilizes it to serve its own interests. Peace can never be achieved as long as the world remains divided into a majority that gets poorer every day and a minority that gets richer at the expense of that majority.44.	The situation on the African continent is a source of concern to us all. That black continent  which suffered in the past from racial oppressionâas demonstrated by the transportation as slaves of more than one third of its inhabitants to the other continents  especially to the North American continentâstill experiences  particularly in its southern part  racial discrimination at the hands of a white colonialist minority.45.	The persistence of the racist regime in the southern part of the continent in its practice of racial discrimination and the policy of genocide against the black majority constitutes a defiance of humanity and of the United Nations. The United Nations has an historic responsibility to eliminate the plague of racism.46.	The persistence of the bigger colonialist Powers in arming the racist regimes in southern Africa and in supplying them with funds is a defiance of international will. Not content with their continued support of the racist regimes in southern Africa in the face of the heroic struggle of the people  especially in Zimbabwe and Namibia  the big colonialist Powers have resorted to nefarious methods to impede the struggle of those peoples and have attempted to give a new face or form to the racist regimes  as they did in Zimbabwe.47.	The problem of Zimbabwe will not be solved by rigging elections or falsifying the will of the people of Zimbabwe or by creating an internal racist puppet regime  but rather by enabling the majority to exercise self-determination in accordance with the will of the people. The Patriotic Front  the sole legitimate representative of the people of Zimbabwe  cannot be hoodwinked by tricks. The solution to this problem will be found only in continued support for the Patriotic Front by all of us  just as support of the Namibian people's struggle  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization is the sole solution to the problem of Namibia and the sole means of enabling its people to attain independence.48.	The peoples of Africa have waged a bitter struggle for their independence and have achieved many glorious victories. The mere presence of 49 African States as Members of this Organization is proof of these victories. However  the colonial Powers  which for many long years exploited and colonized the continent  are bent on changing the course of history in an attempt to perpetuate their exploitation and colonialism in Africa. They want to sneak back through the window after having been booted out through the door.49.	The colonial Powers which previously dominated the continent  particularly France  have resorted to acts which  to say the least constitute a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of human rights. The French Government has resorted to the weapons of mercenaries and of assassination of African nationalist leaders to undermine the nationalist regimes and to liquidate them  as in the attacks on the sisterly republics of Benin and Sao Tome and Principe  as well as on other sisterly African States. The story of Bob Denard  the famous French terrorist  is well known to all of us.50.	The French policy initiated by the late President de Gaulle and then pursued by the late President Pompidou of eliminating French colonialism from Africa  and the position taken by the French Government with regard to the just cause of the Palestinian people  were appreciated by us all. It was in acknowledgement of that policy that the Jamahiriya  after the great revolution of 1 September 1969  promoted and maintained co-operation with France on an equal and fruitful basis. Regrettably  however  the French Government has begun to deviate from that policy during the past few years  and instead of the policy of friendship and cooperation it had pursued  it reverted to the colonial policy of France in the nineteenth century.51.	The French Government's invasion last month of the Central African State involving the dispatch of its regular troops from French bases in the continent to attack a peaceful people  is a matter of grave concern and a serious threat to peace and security in Africa. To condone it and to refrain from taking measures to prevent its recurrence would constitute a dangerous precedent and jeopardize the independence and security of the peoples of the whole African continent. In perpetrating this aggression  the French Government has violated the United Nations Charter and renounced its obligations and responsibilities as a State member of the Security Council.52.	It is the right of any people to change and select its government. France  however  has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of an independent State  regardless of the humanitarian character it attempts to confer on its interference.53.	Consistent with the policy of non-alignment it pursues  and with its role as an active member of the non-aligned movement  the Jamahiriya condemns any interference in the internal affairs of African or other States  irrespective of its source and regardless of its causes. However  in denouncing such interference  and in particular France's colonial interference  we are only abiding by the principles of the OAU and those of the United Nations  and we would not attempt to defend untenable regimes or persons  even if we wanted to do so.54.	The French Government has officially admitted its invasion of and infringement of the territory of the Central African State  and this Organization should shoulder its responsibility in the face of such flagrant interference and such a clear violation of the United Nations Charter.55.	Should the policy at present being pursued by the French Government towards Africa continue  not only would it threaten the independence and security of the peoples of that continent but it could also be viewed as a new phase of colonialism that might ultimately lead to the downfall of this Organization  since the peoples of the African continent  faced with such acquiescence in the French aggression  might find it hard to place their trust in the Organization and might not feel honoured by their membership in it. The French Government must realize that the policy of murder  mercenaries and direct colonial interference would not serve  but would destroy  the interests of the French people. The French Government has to realize that history does not repeat itself  that independent Africa will fight this brutal new French invasion with all its might. The nineteenth century has ended  and there can be no return to it. The ""big-stick policy"" which French colonialism developed in Africa when it conquered Algeria in 1830 seemed gone forever. In 1830 France invaded Algeria because the Dey of Algiers had humiliated the Consul of France. And in 1979  France invaded the Central African State because Emperor Bokassa had slammed down the receiver while talking on the telephone to President Giscard d'Estaing of France. History does seem to repeat itself.56.	The United Nations is called upon today to condemn this French policy and not only to put an end to France's interference and military presence in Africa  but also to try to liberate the African continent from French colonialism in the island of Reunion  which is an integral part of Africa  in accordance with the Charter of the OAU  if this Organization is to respect the principles of its Charter and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.57.	It was our hope that the French Government  which justifies its military interference and invasion by claiming to protect Central African children  would' put a stop to its arms shipments to the racist regime in South Africa and thus spare the lives of thousands of African children. We would also have hoped that the French Government would send its troops to Zimbabwe to help its people put an end to the racist regime there and prevent the killing of thousands of innocent Africans  and it was our hope that those troops would be dispatched to Palestine to stand in the defence of human rights and the rights of a people displaced from its land and home  so that the French Government could be true  for once at least  to the history of the French people  their struggle for human rights and their revolution  which was the first in modern times to defend human rights. However  the French Government  by dispatching its troops to invade Africa and kill innocent people and children in the Sahara  Chad and  most recently  the Central African State  has disavowed not only the principles of the OAU and the United Nations but also the very principles of the French Revolution.58.	The situation in the African continent cannot be isolated from the situation in the Arab world. Africa and the Arab world form one geographical  human and spiritual region. The racist regimes in Africa are of the same nature and are organically related to the racist regime in Palestine. The Arab nation's struggle against racist and colonialist zionism in Palestine is the same as the struggle led by Africa against the racist regimes in southern Africa.59.	The so-called Middle East problem is  in fact  nothing but that of a racist colonizing regime created and established by the imperialist Powers in the Arab region  and that is the real problem. Attempts to resolve this problem without understanding the nature- of the racist Zionist regime would only provide partial and provisional solutions which cannot lead to any genuine peace in the area. The Arab nation and the Palestinian people have been drawn into long wars which began  I can say  during the First World War  when Britain promised to giveânay  grantâPalestine to the white racist Zionists emigrating from Europe  just as it had done in southern Africa  where it created the racist regimes. Those long wars the Arab nation engaged in were in defence of its existence in the face of a racist Zionist invasion supported by imperialism which recognized the cultural and economic potentialities of the Arab nation and  consequently  perceived the extent of the danger that Arab unity might pose to its interests in Africa and Asia. Yet  the Palestinian problem is that of a people not only uprooted and displaced from their land but also subject to an attempt to annihilate them  their land- having been given to alien colonizing immigrants. Developments taking place today  the so- called peace initiatives by world imperialism  are but a further attempt to legitimize the usurpers and enable them to expand by occupying and colonizing more Arab territories. The Arab nation is as appreciative of peace as anyoneâif not more soâits various parts having had to endure centuries of annihilation and invasion at the hands of different kinds of colonialism  be it French  British or Italian. What the Arab nation wants  however  is genuine peaceâpeace based on justice and on the right of peoples to self-determination.60. The United Nations  on which the colonial Powers imposed the acceptance of a bogus legitimacy with the admission of the racist State of Israel  has a heavy and historic responsibility. The time has now come to correct that mistake. The time has come for the United Nations to give true legal status to the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]. It is high time for the United Nations to force the Zionist enemy to respect and implement its resolutions  which that regime has violated and continues to violate.61.	I heard the representative of the Zionist gangs speaking in this hall of the automatic majority in the United Nations. This is an affront to this Organization. Does the representative of the Zionist gangs want us to go back to 1948  when a minority monopolized the United Nations? Does he call the will of the peoples of the world an automatic majority? This is a challenge  and this is the ingratitude which the representative of the Zionist gang shows to the United Nations.62.	Allow me to clarify the nature of the so-called peace initiatives and what is now taking place in the Arab region between the Zionist enemy and the Egyptian regime  on the one hand  and the United States of America  on the other. As a super-Power  the United States bears a great and dangerous responsibility for what are described as peace endeavours  but what are in reality plans for the liquidation of the Palestinian people and attempts to terminate their existence and frustrate their national aspirations. The ongoing actions of the United States of America create a dangerous precedent in international relations  one in which a super-Power is coercing a defeated State  Egypt  into signing an agreement whereby it relinquishes the rights of a people  the Palestinians  of whose affairs it has no right to dispose. The same super-Power is also forcing that State  Egypt  after its defeat  to yield its sovereignty and to separate itself from its nationality  its nation  its culture and its history. Under pressure from the United States of America  the Egyptian regime signed the Camp David agreements with the racist colonialist Zionist regime  abandoned the Palestinian causeâin which it has no right to interfereâand violated the resolutions of the League of Arab States  the OAU  the Islamic Conference  and the non-aligned group. Rather  what the Egyptian regime has done by signing the Camp David agreements and the capitulation Treaty at Blair House was to enter into an unnatural and unholy alliance with the Zionist racist regime and the United States of America. By what right does the Egyptian regime sign on behalf of the Palestinian people and on behalf of Syria and Jordan? By what right does that same regime continue to negotiate with those who have no right over what they term ""autonomy"" for the Palestinians? What right entitled the United States of America to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinian people? The United States of America  by virtue of its partnership with the Zionist regime in the aggression against the Arab nations and the annihilation of the Palestinian people  can never be judge or mediator in this issue. The actions of the United States do not have any relation whatsoever to peace. The Arab nation rejected the Camp David agreements in the resolutions adopted at the Ninth Arab Summit Conference  held at Baghdad in November 1978  and the Palestinian people have also rejected them. The Islamic nation  at the meeting at Fez  also rejected the Camp David agreements and condemned them. The non-aligned movement  at its recent Havana Conference  not only unanimously denounced those agreements but also viewed them as destructive to peace and as an aggression against the Palestinian people and the Arab nation. The relevant resolution of that Conference further condemned the policy of the United States in this regard. All this amounts to a condemnation of that policy by the entire world.63.	If the United States wants to play its role as a super-Power and shoulder its responsibility as such  it has to be really neutral  and it would have to support those who are subject to injusticeâthe Palestinian peopleâand not support the oppressor  that is  the racist Zionist minority. Then the intervention of the United States of America would be acceptable and its interference would help peace.64.	What does ""autonomy"" mean? ""Autonomy"" means local and administrative procedures which are implemented in any country. Our recognition of autonomy and our support of the policy of autonomy would be in contradiction with United Nations resolutions  which request the Zionist enemy to withdraw from all the occupied Arab territories. In other words  when the Egyptian regime signed this Treaty and when it negotiates about autonomy  it admits the legitimacy of the Israeli enemy's occupation of the Arab landâan occupation which has been rejected by this international Organization.65.	Even a cursory glance at the speeches by the representatives of the Egyptian regime and the racist Zionist regime would suffice to provide us with an idea of the degree of importance and merit of such agreements and reveal the great and apparent contradiction in the respective positions of the two parties.66.	First  the representative of the Egyptian regime spoke of its country's support for the PLO and indicated that the agreements make that clear and cover the rights of the Palestinian people. However  the representative of the Zionists clearly stated the following:. . it was  in fact  recognized by the parties at Camp David that the PLO could not be a partner to the peace process.""67.	Secondly  the representative of the Egyptian regime states that Egypt does not accept Israel's policy with regard to Jerusalem  whereas the Zionist representative speaks in all clarity of Jerusalem as ""the eternal capital of Israel and of the Jewish people"" 68.	Thirdly  the representative of the Egyptian regime says the question of Palestine is the core of the problem and Egypt is not trying to solve this problem on behalf of the Palestinians; at the same time  his Government proceeds with negotiations over so-called ""autonomy.""69.	If Egypt goes on talking about autonomy  this would mean recognition by the Egyptian regime of the legitimacy of the Zionist rule in the occupied Arab territories. Is this not a violation of all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations? How can the representative of the Egyptian regime speak of Arab Jerusalem  forgetting that his President paid a visit to Jerusalem as the capital of the Zionist enemy?70.	The signing of the Camp David agreements and the capitulation treaty created a new state of tension in the area  which will not only hamper the march of peace in our region but could also lead to the deterioration of the situation and give rise to the danger of war. The Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization referred to this situation of controversy and division  as follows:' 'The dramatic developments which led to the conclusion of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel have created a new situation in the area. It is a measure of the complexities of the Middle East problem that this event has given rise to controversy and division.""71.	I might also add that developments in southern Lebanon and the repeated Israeli acts of aggression against southern Lebanon are a direct result of those agreements signed between Egypt and Israel. So are the concentrations of tens of thousands of the Egyptian regime's troops along the borders with the Jamahiriya  provocations against the Jamahiriya and other African countries by that regime and the dispatch of Egyptian forces to various parts of the continent and the Middle East. Moreover  the Egyptian President has on more than one occasion officially declared that he has been given a role in Africa. Indeed  this role is nothing but one of provocation and of attempting to create conditions of instability in Africa and the Arab States.72.	The situation in southern Lebanon  which is a direct result of the Camp David agreements and the continuing Israeli aggression against an independent State Member of this Organization  without any measures being taken to put an end to that aggression  is a source of concern for us since it can endanger peace and security. The Jamahiriya expresses its support of the fraternal Lebanese people  its solidarity with them and its full backing of their unity  independence  Arabism and security.73.	The solution of the Middle East problem  including the achievement of a just peace in the area  is of the utmost importance. However  it can be brought about  not by devious means  immoral methods and illegal ways  but only by enabling the Palestinian people to liberate their land and exercise their rights to self- determination and to return to their homeland. The representative of the Egyptian regime  in his search for justification of the causes that led that regime to alienate Egypt from its Arabism and the Arab nation  claimed that the Arab nation could not provide any alternative solution. I should like to assure him and all others from this rostrum that there is a solutionâin which he in fact personally believesâand that it is the only solution. The United States of America must first realize that it carries the onus of an historical responsibility and should  for once seek  the interests of the American people and not yield to pressure  terrorism and election-blackmail by Zionist forces within the United States. Since we are eager to maintain our relations with the people of the United States  we of the Arab nation want those relations to take account of the interests of both the American and the Arab peoples. This can become feasible only when the United States Administration becomes aware of the realities and accepts the truth. Acting on the eagerness in the Jamahiriya to reach a genuine solution and achieve a just peace in the region  the leader of our revolution  Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi  recently sent a message to the President of the United States  Mr. Carter  in which he proposed to him and to the international community a solution which will  sooner or later  turn out to be the sole and optimum solution to the problem.74.	For the ears of the representative of the Egyptian regime in particular  here is the alternative solution proposed by the Arab nation: first  the further immigration of invaders into Palestine must be halted; secondly  the settlers must return to their homelands  as did the Italian settlers who left Libya after more than 60 years  the French settlers who left Algeria after more than a century and the Portuguese settlers who left Angola and Mozambique after more than four centuries; thirdly  arms shipments to the region of the Middle East  except to those countries whose territories are still occupied and who must  by right  defend themselves and liberate their territory  must be suspended; and  fourthly  a democratic Palestinian State comprising Arab  Jewish and Christian Palestinians must be established.75.	That is the only solution  whether it comes sooner or later. However  the policy of force  the policy of terrorism  will not cease. The history of Hitler and the history of empires and emperors should serve as a lesson to the racist  colonialist Zionists  who will not last long. Others stayed in the area longer than they did but were forced to leave forever under the pressure of resistance on the part of the Arab peoples. And the Zionists  like the others  will leave also. It is God's will.76.	The question of Western Sahara is still one of the main issues which confront our Organization and for which a radical and decisive solution has not yet been found. However  some positive developments in this respect have occurred this year  notably the agreement between Mauritania and the Frente POLISARIO and that between the Jamahiriya and Mauritania.77.	I should also like to refer to the resolution adopted by the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the OAU at its sixteenth regular session  held in Monrovia last July  which reaffirmed the right of the Saharan people to self-determination  I hope that this session will find a quick and durable solution enabling the Saharan people to exercise their legitimate rights.78.	The problem of Cyprus is also far from a solution  despite the efforts exerted by the Secretary-General and this Organization to resolve it. We fully support direct negotiations between the two communitiesâthe Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriotsâin accordance with the 10-point agreement for the achievement of a just solution to the problem that will guarantee the independence and neutrality of Cyprus and the withdrawal of British colonialist troops from the island. The situation in the Mediterranean also requires that this Organization endeavour to ensure peace and security in the area by taking measures to evacuate foreign bases and fleets so that the sea may become a sea of peace.79.	The people of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya would like on this occasion to pay a tribute to the Government and people of the friendly State of Malta and to support them in their request for the withdrawal of British bases from the island and for the safeguarding of the neutrality of Malta. We affirm our commitment to support the Maltese people in their commendable pursuit of the policy of neutrality.80.	Ever since 1973  when the developing oil-exporting countries adjusted the prices of their petroleum and exercised control over their natural resources  Western capitalist circles have been engaged in an intensive media campaign against the States members of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries [OPEC] designed primarily to divert the attention of the world in general and the developing countries in particular from the real causes underlying the numerous problems which the economies of the industrialized nations face as well as to shun their responsibility to provide assistance to the developing countries and to establish a new international economic order based on equity and justice rather than exploitation and domination.81.	The rectification by the OPEC States of the unjust conditions in which the Western monopolies had sole control of their oil is considered to be an exercise of their legitimate right established in and ensured by international instruments  namely  the inalienable right of countries to permanent sovereignty over their natural resources and all their economic activities.82.	The Western industrialized nations have forgotten  or pretended to forget  several facts concerning the adjustment by the OPEC countries of their oil prices. Among those facts  we point out the following.83.	First  this action strengthened the unity of the developing countries and enhanced their bargaining power in their negotiations and discussions with the developed countries.84.	Secondly  it would have been extremely difficult to develop the oil wells of the North Sea and Alaska had the price of oil stayed at its pre-1973 levels.85.	Thirdly  the adjustment of oil prices has helped the Western industrialized nations to concentrate their efforts on the question of taking the necessary measures to reduce their over-consumption of energy and to use this vital commodity in a more rational and reasonable manner. This is exactly what the developing oil- producing countries have been demanding for years. The oil-producing countries aim to preserve this limited  non-renewable resource for as long as possible; yet available estimates indicate that if oil consumption continues at its present annual level of nearly 7 billion tons  all oil reserves will be depleted in 15 to 20 years.86.	Fourthly  amending the oil prices has prompted the international community to examine the question of other sources of energy as an alternative to oil  sources that are renewable and less polluting. The United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy  to be held in 1981  constitutes an important step in this direction. All of us need to co-operate in order to achieve a smooth and progressive transition from dependence on oil to other alternative sources and to avoid creating a sudden shortfall with all the economic  political and social implications that this might entail.87.	Fifthly  while the industrialized nations attack the OPEC countries for adjusting their oil prices  those same nations invariably waste no time in raising the price of their own oil. Their rates are always parallel with the price ceilings fixed by OPEC.88.	Sixthly  it is a fact that the increases in oil prices were instituted to offset the previous effect of inflation and the decline in the exchange rate of the dollar. During the first quarter of 1979  the rate of inflation in the United States reached 13 per cent compared with 17.6 per cent in Italy  12.4 per cent in Britain  10 per cent in France and 9.6 per cent in West Germany. Since the oil-producing developing countries are the main importers of the products of the industrialized nations  they are most affected by that exported inflation. The remedy lies in curtailing the current of the inflation being exported by the industrial countries  rather than in not raising the price of oil or of any other raw material.89.	Seventhly  there has been repeated talk of energy consumption in developing countries  as if they were the ones that consumed the greatest part of world oil production. Statistics show that energy consumption is concentrated with extreme density in the developed countries  which comprise nearly 30 per cent of the total world population yet consume more than 80 per cent of the world's total energy  whereas the developing countries  whose inhabitants constitute some 70 per cent of the world's population  consume less than 20 per cent of the world's energy production. Evidence shows that private vehicles in the United States of America and Western Europe consume as much energy as the total for all developing countries in their various uses of commercial energy. Britain alone consumes more energy than all the African States put together. Statistics indicate that the industrialized Western nations' consumption of energy at a rate of millions of barrels a day amounted to 74 470 billion barrels in 1976  while the consumption by the rest of the world  excluding the socialist bloc countries  reached 18 297 billion barrels.90.	Overlooking all these facts only proves that the media campaign of the Western industrialized countries directed against the OPEC countries is a concentrated political propaganda campaign  and not one based on facts. This campaign  which is often coupled with threats of overt or covert interference such as starvation  systematic increases in the prices of manufactured goods and threats to occupy the oil sources  clearly proves the extent to which hegemonism and the desire to exploit dominates the thinking of those countries. The OPEC countries are fully aware of these manoeuvres and will  individually and collectively  strongly resist all forms of threat or military  political or economic interference against their peoples.91.	It should be noted that this continuing campaign gains in intensity as the industrialized nations take an increasingly rigid position in their relations with the developing nations. It was this rigidity that prevented the conduct of genuine and constructive dialogue and impeded the establishment of the new international economic order. Protectionist measures  failure to introduce any real improvements in the terms of international trade in favour of developing countries  the imbalance in the world's monetary and financial system and other pending issues have led to the failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD to achieve any objective progress. These factors also led to the disappointing results of the deliberations in the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/ 174  the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy and the multilateral trade negotiations.92.	Instead of trying to make the necessary changes in their domestic economic policies and to shoulder their international responsibilities towards the developing countries as defined by the United Nations resolutions  the Western industrialized countries have been bent on sowing the seeds of sedition and discord between the oil-producing and non-oil-producing developing nations by emphasizing that oil prices are the cause of all the economic problems of the developing nations. They have even gone as far as to attempt to interfere in sovereign matters of the oil-producing States by addressing themselves directly to the subject of limiting the prices and quantities of oil to be produced. The developing oil-producing countries  believing in the inevitability of interdependence and of helping other developing countries to overcome their economic problems  have spared no efforts to provide the latter with the necessary assistance. Surveys indicate that the appropriations for OPEC's fund for assistance to developing countries had reached $1 229 million at the end of 1978. At OPEC's June 1979 meeting  it was also decided to raise member States' contributions to the fund by a further $800 million  thus increasing the fund's capital to $2.4 billion.93.	Surveys also indicate that  while the assistance provided by the OPEC countries has reached a ratio of 2.01 per cent of their gross national product  the ratio of the assistance provided by the industrialized countries to their gross national product had only reached 0.31 per cent in 1977  far below the target of 0.7 per cent to be earmarked for official development assistance to the developing countries as stipulated in the International Development Strategy.94.	The oil-producing States  including my own  have provided this assistance  and other important assistance within the framework of bilateral co-operation or of regional institutions  such as the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa  in Khartoum  and other institutions of Member States  to provide direct support and help to developing countries to enable them to overcome the unjust economic conditions they are at present experiencing. They do this because they believe that development is a joint venture in which each of us must assume the responsibilities that international circumstances and domestic conditions impose.95.	The oil-producing States have provided this assistance despite the fact that they are experiencing abnormal economic situations which require that all their material capabilities be oriented towards establishing the necessary equilibrium in their economies and basing their economic and social development on sound and viable foundations. They are also faced with the problem of the steadily decreasing purchasing power of their oil export earnings due to the continuing wave of world inflation being exported by the Western industrialized nations and to the fluctuation of exchange rates of the major currencies  particularly the United States dollar  in addition to the steady rise in the prices of capital goods which the developing oil countries import. Many in the capitalist industrialized world refer  in the course of their campaign against the OPEC countries  to what they call the surplus financial resources in those countries resulting from their oil revenues. Suffice it to say  at this point  that 9 out of 13 States members of OPEC are debtors and that the remaining ones  allegedly having financial surpluses  see the inflation factor eating away at their reserves and decreasing them by the day. Moreover  the majority  if not all  of the oil countries still lack the necessary infrastructures for building a sound economy.96.	While we welcome any initiatives designed to deal with the development issues of the world and to strengthen the constructive dialogue based on equality and the principles and objectives of the new international economic order  we reject any attempt at stirring up dissension between the developing countries or at exerting any pressures on the OPEC countries because of their positions of principle.97.	The OPEC is part of the struggle of the third world to regain control of its natural resources from the avaricious monopolistic corporations in the capitalist world. The struggle of the oil-producing countries is the same as the struggle of the third world  for what they are doing serves the causes of both the third world and of humanity as a whole. We have listened attentively to the address made by the President of Mexico in which he proposed the adoption of a world plan for energy. This proposal requires further consideration by our energy experts. However  we fear that certain groups might seize upon this opportunity to try and destabilize the countries of the third world.98.	We reject any attempts aimed at discussing the question of energy in isolation from the major economic issues and outside the purview of the United Nations. In our view  the proposal of the Group of 77 to hold comprehensive negotiations  in accordance with the proposal of the recent Conference of non-aligned Countries in Havana  was expressive of the view of the overwhelming majority of the peoples of the world that world economic issues should be dealt with in a comprehensive manner within the framework of the United Nations.99.	For the developing States the road to development must begin from inside their countries  first by eradicating all forms of the monopolistic practices of the transnational corporations against us and against them  then by proceeding to intensify their efforts in promoting and strengthening co-operation among themselves.100.	The declaration issued by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 on 29 September 1977 was a clear reflection of the position of the developing countries with regard to the international endeavours aimed at establishing a new international economic order based on justice  equality and respect for the sovereignty of all States  big and smallâan order that would be free of domination and exploitation and would reject the discriminatory economic policies and practices of the developed countries aimed  directly or indirectly  against the developing countries individually or collectively.101.	In the face of serious political and economic events confronting humanity such as the alarming international contest with its spiralling arms race and the many wars that have broken out during the past years as a result of direct colonial interference in the internal affairs of States  the peoples of the world have increasingly been looking to the non-aligned movement  a neutral  impartial group of States  as one able to play the role in achieving justice in the world  self- determination for peoples and peace and security for the human race.102.	In this connexion I cannot but praise the objective results of the recent Conference of non-aligned countries held in Havana  Cuba  paying a special tribute to the major role which the Republic of Cuba and its President  Fidel Castro  played in the successful outcome of that Conference. The non-aligned group of nations has asserted its effectiveness as a viable bloc  confirmed its obligations to the struggle against imperialism  zionism  racism and colonialism and for the achievement of justice and equality among States  and also reaffirmed its pledge to work relentlessly toward establishing a new international economic order that would take into account the interests of all humanity  particularly the interests of the developing countries and their right to raise the standards of living of their peoples and to achieve development in their territories.103.	That non-aligned movement is now strengthened by the admission of new States  such as Nicaragua  a revolutionary country to which I should like to pay a tribute for having freed itself from a Fascist regime that was an agent of imperialism. That movement has been strengthened also by the admission of Grenada  another progressive revolutionary force. It has been strengthened by the revolution in Iran that resulted in the deposition of the Shah and Iran's admission to the movement after having eliminated the last stronghold of colonialism in the region. It has been strengthened by the admission of Pakistan  now that that country isâand God willing  will long remainânot a party to any military pacts  which were used in the past against its peoples in that region of Asia.104.	Finally  I should like to express my appreciation and gratitude to all  hoping that this session will help us meet the aspirations of our peoples and achieve their hopes for justice  freedom and prosperity."
"79",4151,"LKA",34,1979,"ï»¿I should like to begin by offering my congratulations and felicitations to you  Mr. President  on behalf of my delegation  on your election to the high office of President of the thirty- fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Our two countries  Mr. President  share a common historical tradition  although we inhabit different continents. Together  our nations have contributed to the growth or African-Asian solidarity  on which the structure of the non-aligned movement was built. We are fellow-members of the Commonwealth. More intimately  we have had occasion to appreciate your sense of internationalism  your judgement and your unflinching commitment to the cause of peace and harmony  both in this august Assembly and in the working bodies of the non-aligned movement. We are aware of your outstanding contribution to the success of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and we are confident that you will bring the same skills and dedication to bear on the proceedings of the General Assembly. Your election as President at a comparatively early age adds to the distinction.37.	Allow me to pay a tribute as well to my friend and distinguished colleague  our outgoing President. I need hardly recall that he presided over the work of the General Assembly at a trying period in the history of this Organization. He acted with firmness and fairness  contributing decisively and effectively to the conduct of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. Our gratitude is due to him and is offered in full measure.38.	Previous speakers have commented on the continued assistance the international community has received from our Secretary-General. Let me reinforce those comments  on behalf of my Government and myself. Mr. Waldheim's erudition  his willingness and ability to hold the balance between contending parties and his calmness under the most difficult circumstances are widely recognized. We admire and appreciate his efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in world affairs and we pledge our continued cooperation.39.	It is with pleasure and pride  too  that Sri Lanka welcomes Saint Lucia as a Member of this Organization. The growth of the membership of this Organization underscores its universality  which is an objective set forth in the Charter itself and without which the authority and effectiveness of our Organization would be seriously eroded.40.	Those of us who make the annual pilgrimage to the opening session of the General Assembly must have all realized by now that our journeys are in grave danger of turning into a kind of political tourism. For a long time  pamphlet writers have assured their readers that travel broadens the mind. Perhaps it does. On the other hand  I should like to think that those of us who are entrusted with the task of formulating and implementing the foreign policies of our respective countries were endowed with this responsibility because we had already showed more than passing familiarity with the affairs of the world. If the only purpose served by our annual visits here is to participate in a mind-broadening exercise  then the General Assembly  and indeed the United Nations as a whole  is achieving considerably less than its founding fathers intended.41.	My comments should not be mistaken for carping criticism. I speak as a fervent believer in the United Nations  as one who is convinced that  at this time in the history of mankind  if the United Nations did not exist we would very soon be going about the task of setting it up. I speak  moreover  as the Foreign Minister of a country whose foreign policy has consistently emphasized the need to respect  strengthen  and work within the ambit of  the United Nations.42.	I make my comments in this spirit. I make my comments in the hope that the full potential of the United Nations can be realized within our lifetime in the various aspects of human effort that add up to the sum total of human life. The political  social and economic aspects of human life are all part of our Organization's responsibilities  and they all deserve equal attention. They require attention  moreover  in a practical down-to-earth manner  devoid of polemics  rhetoric and sterile theorizing.43.	As representatives here are aware  it was Sri Lanka's pride and privilege to be the Chairman of the non-aligned movement for the last three yearsâan office that we handed over to the Republic of Cuba only two weeks ago. During the three years of our stewardship  the movement faced many challenges  and some of those challenges threatened the very foundation of the movement  but Sri Lanka is proud that we were able to keep the unity of the movement intact in the face of serious bilateral disputes that arose within the membership.44.	When Sri Lanka assumed the chairmanship in 1976 there were 86 members  and on the threshold of our handing over the movement after three years the membership had grown to 96. This is also a paradox  because every time we met the prophets of doom predicted that it would be the last time we would be meeting. Today  the movement is a dynamic factor in the conduct of international affairs. It has become the un-challenged  the uncontested and the unquestioned official spokesman of the people of the third world. We are happy to report to this Assembly  two-thirds of whose membership is drawn from the non-aligned movement  that Sri Lanka has been able to uphold that sacred trust deposited with us by the membership of the movement and to hand it over at the expiration of our office  as my President  His Excellency J. R. Jayewardene  the out-going Chairman  said in his address at Havana  ""un-tarnished and undiluted"".45.	We wish to take this opportunity to thank all for the support that had been rendered us to ensure that Sri Lanka carried out its responsibilities in the most constructive manner. We wish the new Chairman  the Re-public of Cuba  every success.46.	During the past two and a half years  it has been my privilege as Chairman of the Conference of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Non-Aligned Countries to visit many countries and to discuss international affairs and international strategy with a wide range of the world's political leadership. The overriding impression I have gathered during those discussions and inquiries is that of an international paradox  the coexistence of hope and despair; achievement and stagnation; precept and reluctance to practice it. The result is a reeling of disharmonyâa sense of unfulfilled obligation  of unfulfilled expectation. This is true of almost any aspect of human endeavour in our times.47.	For instance  ours is widely described as the scientific age  an age in which the wonders of science and its handmaiden  technology  are considered capable of solving almost any given human problem. Unfortunately  however  the advantages of the scientific age are not universally felt  as speakers at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held at Vienna from 20 to 31 August  rightly pointed out. The result is a paradoxical mixture of success and failure  of imbalance side by side with growth. Man glories in his conquest of outer space  and in the excitement of successful journeys to the moon. Today's medical technology enables a medical technician to complete simultaneous tests on a single sample of blood. Building technology has progressed to the point where a prefabricated apartment can be assembled in slightly over 30 minutes. New strains of miracle cereal have produced undreamed-of increases in the world's food production.48.	Yet the numbers of human beings who are hungry  malnourished  inadequately housed and poor are counted not in hundreds or in thousands  but in millions. Even more paradoxical  the very societies that nurture millionaires  fast cars  streamlined hospitals and opulent housing are at the same time the scene of sky-scraping living costs  galloping inflation and explosive unemployment. Forget the labels of the North and the South  forget the labels of East and West. The stark fact is that within whatever form of society one may live  the wonders and successes of the scientific age leave large segments of the population untouched.49.	In political terms  ours is considered the age of decolonization  and rightly so. In the nineteenth century  the greater part of the world's land mass and of its peoples was drawn into the fold of imperial hegemony. That was the extent of colonialism in formal terms  with unequal treaties signed and large areas of patrimony ceded. In less formal arrangements  where colonial power was exercised without a permanent colonial presence  the extent of subjugation was wider and deeper. A scholar has calculated that on the eve of the Second World War some 80 per cent of the world's land mass and 75 per cent of the world's population was in one way or another actually under the control of colonial Powers. Let us not quibble over figures. The facts of the colonial period are too much a part of history to need debate. In the same way  the facts of decolonization are beyond dispute.50.	From the late 1940s  when India and Sri Lanka became independent  to the 1970s the world has seen the rapid dismantling of empires  Over a hundred nation-States took  their places in the family of man  and we need not wait for history to assure us that the role and influence of the United Nations and the non-aligned movement in this process were strong and decisive. Cynics sometimes say that decolonization has actually unleashed acute problems and disorder in newly independent States. This argument  in fact  is sometimes used to justify the existence of a few racist and colonial redoubts in the world today. The existence of these pockets of outmoded political forms is in itself a paradox. Yes  these pockets must go.51.	In our times there cannot be  and should not be  one man un-free or one inch of land occupied by an aggressor or colonial Power  whether in the Middle East  in southern Africa or in any other part of the world. Quenching the thirst for freedom is more essential and more satisfying than accepting some artificial form of order superimposed by the might of a distant metropolitan Power. And if today's politically independent nation-States find themselves in economic disarray that  too  is partly the result of another international paradox: the survival of economic domination despite their political freedom.52.	These paradoxes can be viewed from an esoteric perspective  providing hours and days of delight to academics and pundits who pile libraries high and deep with sophisticated but unfeeling descriptions and analyses of the human condition. They can  on the other hand  be set against a background of political confrontation  or  to put it differently  in a perspective of ""we"" and ""they"". Neither approach is helpful. There is a third option  however: that of seeing the situation in human terms and attempting to remedy it  also in human terms. My appeal to representatives today is that all of us accept the third option and strive relentlessly to improve the human condition and not just reduce it to a jumble of platitudes.53.	This is particularly applicable at a time when the North and the South do not seem to know precisely how to get moving again in their faltering efforts at togetherness. The reason for this diffidence is understandable. A common struggle is simpler to mount when a discernible common enemy can be identified  attacked and eliminated. The campaign is more difficult when the enemy cannot easily be identified. Who  for instance  can draw a route map leading straight to the source of monetary imbalance? In fact  the enemy we face today is not a single enemy. There are several enemies: want  hunger  disease  enmity  environmental pollution  unemployment  the waste of precious resources on destructive armaments  inflationâall lurking behind the fact of international paradox. And  just as the enemy is manifold  so too are the results of its activities  which strike rich and poor nations alike.54.	There is a certain pessimism in the air about the inability of the world community to resolve disputes that have now become almost a permanent feature of international life. I do not fully share that pessimism because I believe that in our times we must find solutions to these issues. When I say that  I am not unmindful of the conflicts and confrontations that seem to surface day by day. There is a fresh wave of unrest  suspicion and tension sweeping across the continents. Borders and boundaries seem to pose a challenge to international security and stability. Jockeying for power and position has never been so subtle and scientific. To add to all this  the explosive potential of economic imbalance and paradox is perhaps far greater than has been realized or conceded.55.	The poor  the hungry  the undernourished and the unemployed need immediate relief. We cannot ignore their interests. In human terms  their interests are at the very core of our concerns  because for politicians to lose their sense of humanity is for them to lose the very reason for their existence. In political terms  similarly  their interests are paramount because the continuance of desperation and frustration must eventually raise tensions and hopelessness to the point at which only a violent release is possible.56.	It is against this background that I wish to state the urgent need for a resumption of the North-South dialogue in a meaningful manner. The first phase of the North-South dialogue has come to an end  and  while it is neither fair nor accurate to call that phase a total failure  it has produced little but despair in the South and aloofness in the North.57.	In the first phase of the North-South dialogue some new slogans came into being. Slogans hamper progress  as they give rise to a situation of confrontation  which is of no use to either side.58.	It is clear beyond doubt that the existing economic order is both outdated and lop-sided; it is inequitable and unsatisfying  to both the North and the South.59.	The North  though ostensibly the beneficiary of this system is still grounded by the malaise of inflation  economic stagnation and recessionâproblems that were supposed to be endemic only to the Southâso a restructuring of the economic structure will benefit the North as much as it will benefit the South.60.	The attempt to restructure the present economic order should not be approached with slogans or threats of deprivation. That will yield nothing but a lot of hot air. Hot air will not satisfy hunger in the South  nor will it strengthen the shrinking dollar. The situation must be approached in terms of co-operation  not confrontation.61.	The restructuring of the present economic order is a formidable task. It is not one that can be approached without preparation and rethinking by both the North and the South. The North should enter the negotiations with a definite commitment to set up a new order that would accommodate the legitimate interests and aspirations of the poor nations. The South  on the other hand  should pursue its plan of action and substantive work proposals to back this up. Calm analysis will achieve results and prevent the kind of frustration that followed the end of the first phase of dialogue.62.	In other words  the second phase of the dialogue must go beyond mere discussion directly into the area of negotiation. And negotiation  of course  has to be conducted within an agreed framework. Negotiators cannot be like a musician who says  ""Give me the piano and I will play the tune"". Negotiations need the equivalent of a musical score as well. Producing this score is not beyond the bounds of human ingenuity in an age of manifest creativity. In fact  experts have been working in different forums at producing an agreed set of principles to guide North-South negotiations when they next get together. A composite of their views would provide us with at least the outline of the required framework.63.	It can be argued  for instance  that the framework for negotiation should consist of five broad principles  all of them designed to facilitate understanding and co-operation.64.	First  the need to reshape the international order is not felt only by a particular group of countries or peoples. The discipline of interdependence is being forced on us by circumstances  and that discipline cannot be applied within the existing order  which is largely based on the maxim 'Tm all right  Jack"".65.	Secondly  and this flows from the first principle  it must be accepted all round that the purpose of reshaping the international order is not to benefit a single group of countries  but to improve the human condition as a whole. If this purpose is kept in mind throughout the negotiating process  then there can be legitimate trade-offs which result in all sides feeling the beneficial impact of a reshaped international order.66.	Thirdly  while the concept of basic needs is com-mendable  it is equally true that needs cannot be met until resources are adequate. Resources are not unlimited  but  within natural constraints  resources can be expanded through processes of economic growth in such a way that there is sufficient for sharing. Population planning is quite obviously an integral part of this equation.67.	Fourthly  equitability must be a key objective of the exercise  that is to say  not only equitability as between today's rich and poor nations  but within rich and poor nations as well. It would be a travesty if an international exercise aimed at reshaping the international order were undertaken purely to make the rich in both rich and poor countries richer. Better and more effective forms of income distribution need to be fashioned even as international economic restructuring takes place.68.	Fifthly  restructuring has to take place in an orderly manner  with agreed phasing  targets and appraisals as part of an agreed programme.69.	I do not claim either originality or exclusivity for the principles listed. They can be put in different ways. What is important is that they should be agreed onâand acted on.70.	Sri Lanka's position on issues such as southern Africa  the Middle East  disarmament  the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace and other important questions that will come up before the current meetings of the General Assembly has been repeatedly stated here and in other international forums quite clearly and in detail on many occasions. For this reason  I have chosen not to take up the time of the Assembly by restating it here.71.	Next year's special session of the General Assembly  when we will be taking up development strategy and other matters connected with the third United Nations development decade  will provide us with a golden opportunity to turn our intentions and thoughts into deeds. We can very easily turn that session into yet another talking marathon in which we engage in cease-less recriminations or ceaseless platitudes  or we can use that session as a take-off point for action. The choice is ours. How will we decide?72.	On the part of Sri Lanka there is no hesitation about what choice should be made. We should like to see the entire membership of this Organization enter that session with a prior commitment to action. We should like that session to be the occasion for negotiation on broad lines  not for mere debates. And we should like to see that session end with the acceptance of a concrete programme of action which would then go to bodies such as UNCTAD for implementation.73.	Will the international community accept this challenge? Or will special interests once again deprive the disadvantaged peoples of the world of their right to human dignity? If this is not achieved  we face the danger not only of a deepening economic crisis  but also of political explosion. To ward off this danger and to guarantee permanent peace is the responsibility of the political leadership of our times. We must make some constructive progress towards meeting the minimum economic needs of the underprivileged peoples. This is a duty and an obligation we owe to history."
"80",4195,"LSO",34,1979,"ï»¿Permit me at the outset to express my delegation's deep sorrow and grief at the untimely passing of Mr. Agostinho Neto  the President of the People's Republic of Angola and the Chairman of the Worker's Party of Angola. In him we lost a leader  not only of Angola  but of Africa and the world community. We all mourn this loss  and I take this opportunity on behalf of my delegation  the Government and the people of Lesotho to convey our condolences to the family  the Government and the people of Angola.191.	It gives me particular pleasure to express my delegation's congratulations to you  Sir  on your well- deserved and unanimous election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We are particularly delighted that this Assembly has shown its confidence in you  an illustrious  dedicated diplomat and son of Africa. Your well-known commitment to the eradication of colonialism  racism  racial discrimination and apartheid is a clear testimony that you will guide the deliberations of this Assembly to a successful conclusion.192.	In addition to expressing my congratulations to the other officers of the Assembly on their unanimous election  I wish to convey my delegation's profound gratitude to the outgoing President and his fellow officers for the successful manner in which they conducted the work of the thirty-third session. Our words of thanks are also extended to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our hard-working Secretary-General. His dedication to our problems deserves our commendation.193.	The Lesotho Government firmly believes in the principle of the universality of our Organization. We therefore welcome Saint Lucia to membership in our family of nations. We are particularly happy to see it in our midst since  like Lesotho  Saint Lucia belongs to the Commonwealth of Nations. The increase in the membership of our Organization  though it is proceeding slowly  is an assurance and guarantee that the sovereignty and independence of Member countries  particularly the small States  will be jealously protected  cherished and nurtured. But the absence from this hall of the many Territories now still under colonial and alien rule is a painful reminder that for millions of people the liberation process remains incomplete. These are the Territories of which the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples is seized annually. We do  however  look forward to the day when these Territories will take their rightful seats in our midst. Only then can we take pride in the fact that the United Nations will have successfully completed the process of decolonization.194.	As we meet here again  the crisis in the international economy has gone from bad to worse. This crisis is characterized by high inflation  unemployment  growing protectionism by developed countries and large deficits in the balance of payments of the developing countries. It is a crisis that involves minimal and  in some cases  decreasing transfer of real resources and technology from the developed Western and Eastern countries to the developing countries. There is no doubt that this crisis causes disruptions in the plans of developing countries for social and economic development. It is a crisis in which our people can no longer tolerate the existing conditions of poverty  illiteracy  malnutrition  disease and unemployment.195.	So far the response of the developed countries to our just demand for the establishment of a New International Economic Order has been nothing but rejection and  at best  utter indifference. We call upon the developed countries to recognize their obligations and pledge their commitment to the realization of a New International Economic Order. Without doubt the developed countries have vast amounts of capital  high levels of income and large numbers of trained personnel. Their control of access to technology is indisputable. The characteristic of the prevailing international economic system is that the poor countries lack all these elements. The existing terms of trade militate against the interests of the poor nations. Even though the North-South dialogue is at a standstill and the fifth session of UNCTAD has scored no positive results  we continue to entertain hopes that better counsel will eventually prevail. We therefore look forward to the holding of a special session in 1980 which will accord us an opportunity to re-examine the numerous vital global economic problems.196.	We call upon the United Nations and its Members to address themselves seriously to the economic plight of the least developed  land-locked and island States. Unless this is done urgently  we see a serious danger in the apparent creation of a so-called fourth world. In the ongoing negotiations in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  we urge the members of the Assembly to ensure that our rights and interests as land-locked countries are incorporated and enshrined in the proposed convention. We urge that the proposal of Nepal for the establishment of the common heritage fund be embraced by all. It is our expectation that this fund will benefit all the developing countries  particularly the poorest among them.197.	The problems confronting this Organization are numerous and diverse. We witness with horror the ever-increasing pace of the arms race  the proliferation of nuclear weapons  the production and perfection of new weapons of mass destruction and the stockpiling of biological and chemical weapons. Despite the numerous relevant resolutions and decisions of this Assembly and other international forums  war budgets continue to be inflated and the arms trade has assumed vast proportions. While these problems affect mainly the big Powers  they pose a serious threat to the very existence of our planet. Their solution must therefore be considered a matter of priority for the survival of the world.198.	One of the most frightening aspects of the situation is the transfer of arms by developed countries to developing countries. This is being carried out to the extent that it by far outstrips the transfer of commercial and real technology to developing countries. We cannot avoid the fact that the drive for disarmament focuses on the relationship between the arms race and economic and social under-development. We believe that there is no single human endeavour which matches the arms race in wastefulness and lack of imagination. We therefore cannot keep quiet and ignore our responsibility  in the interests of humanity  to caution all concerned that it is better and more noble to desist from being merchants of death and urge all States to expend resources at their disposal for the betterment of mankind.199.	My Government welcomes the results of the recent Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean. We hope that the results of that Meeting will prove to be a successful basis for the convening of a United Nations conference for the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We must  however  observe that the great disparity between moral commitments and real action continues  regrettably  to contribute to an accumulation of volumes of resolutions  declarations and programmes of action which are never implemented. Since 1971  when the United Nations declared the Indian Ocean a zone of peace  no meaningful action has been taken towards dismantling military bases in the Indian Ocean area. This situation continues to pose a serious threat to the security of the littoral and hinterland States of the area. We therefore appeal to the great Powers and other maritime users of the Indian Ocean not only to associate themselves with the 1971 Declaration but also to implement its provisions faithfully.200.	The phrase ""human rights"" has become an international clichÃ©. Various perceptions of human rights have been voiced with varying emphasis from this very rostrum. Nations have been grouped into various categories on the basis of such perceptions of human rights. The concept of human rights has therefore become a tool easily manipulated to serve man's innate desire to subject to servitude all those who do not in word and deed agree with him. Lesotho is gravely concerned at the disparity between the lofty ideals enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the sad reality of man's existence.201.	The question of human rights is of great concern to Africa. Indeed  during the sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held recently in Monrovia  the leaders of Africa expressed concern over the question of human rights. Representing as we do one of the poorest countries in the world and a former colony  we legitimately and with due sensitivity wish to discuss the question of the human rights of millions of people throughout the world. A great part of humanity is still subjected to foreign occupation  colonization and the most atrocious violation of human rights. The developing world represents nations that suffer from gaping wounds in the form of varying degrees of civil  political  social  cultural and economic deprivation.202.	We therefore call upon the Members of the United Nations individually and collectively to contribute their fair share to the uplift of the ideals upon which our Organization was founded. For our part  we pledge to continue to respect the basic rights of human beings  which are guaranteed in our laws and legal machinery. We accord equality to all people regardless of race  colour  sex  age or religion. Our participation in the human rights deliberations of the social  humanitarian and cultural committee  the Third Committee  clearly reflects Lesotho's concerns at the continued violation of human rights in many parts of the world.203.	Lesotho's concern at the persistence of the pestilential system of apartheid heightens as the obduracy of the architects of the system gains momentum. I do refer to apartheid as a pestilence  which struck that great part of Africa in 1652 with the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck at the Cape of Good Hope and has persisted with great fury and un-abating ruthlessness for the last 300 years. While apartheid has gone under different names at different times for the purpose of camouflage  its philosophy has always remained the same. It is a negative philosophy which denies equality between whites and Africans. It advocates the supremacy of the white man.204.	The apartheid philosophy is deeply embedded in a mentality of white domination  a mentality which transcends all logic. The architects of the system exude a strong desire to maintain their dominant position over the African and all other racial groups which are not classified as white. All efforts at dismantling the system of apartheid must be geared towards a psychological campaign to explode the myth of racial superiority. Therefore  I see it as a primary focus of the international outrage against apartheid to launch a strong campaign to dislodge the mentality which has bred the system. The need for a psychological warfare against apartheid becomes more glaring  seen against the background of the system's entrenchment and its insolent defiance of the international community. The psychological campaign I envisage will weaken the system's credibility to its proponents and resuscitate the determination of the opponents of apartheid.205.	The callousness of this philosophy is evidenced by the fact that 20 million Africans in South Africa are denied their basic human rights and dignity by a small clique of white racists. The basic right to self- determination is denied our people in South Africa. The history of the struggle in this region has gone through several stages. It started with peaceful negotiation  moved to passive resistance and has finally come to armed struggle. Our African brother in South Africa was forced to go through these stages because he had been denied the right and the opportunity to organize himself and to have a political platform from which he could express his basic right to participate in the political organs of his Government. He is not only denied the opportunity to participate in the Government of his country  but a white-controlled Parliament in Cape Town determines all his activities and his very future. All the bizarre laws passed by that parliament are geared towards the maintenance of the status quo. The people of South Africa are corralled into compartments and the white racists put themselves into a special privileged class as a ""chosen race of God"".206.	It has never been our intention to augment and complicate further the problems the peoples of South Africa are facing  nor has it ever been our desire to add to the already long list of the serious racial items on the agenda of this Assembly arising out of apartheid policies of the Government of South Africa. We were  and still are prepared to avoid confrontation and to seek peaceful solutions to our problems as neighbours  despite our most basic differences. We cannot stand by silently in view of the affront of the atrocities committed against the citizens of Lesotho almost daily by trigger-happy Boers along the South African borders.207.	The establishment of a ski resort on our territory at Khoptjoane  to which I referred from this rostrum two years ago  continues to constitute a further action of alienating more of our land. The refusal by our neighbour to negotiate with my Government about our joint boundaries and its insistence on establishing and maintaining Bantustans on our lands are a source of tension. South Africa's defiance of the United Nations decisions continues and its maintenance of such racial monstrosities as the Transkei  Bophuthatswana  Venda  Qwaqwa and other Bantustans is clearly an irresponsible act. South Africa's obstinacy and persistence in refusing to reconsider these questions has already soured our relations and will continue to do so in view of wanton shootings and killings of my people along our common borders and within South Africa.208.	The anachronistic and archaic maxim that ""might makes right"" was discredited and rejected long ago with the founding of the United Nations. The persistence of regimes of chosen races  whether in southern Africa or the Middle East  is an affront to and negation of what the Charter of the United Nations stands for. It is a violation of numerous decisions of this world body and a further challenge to this Organization's effectiveness in carrying out its mandate and responsibility for world peace and security.209.	All States Members of this Organization have a right to existence and to freedom from external interference. However  this confers no right whatsoever on anyone to occupy other people's lands by force or conquest. Lands acquired in battle cannot be permanently alienated. This underlines the urgency of and immediate need for a lasting Middle East settlement. Efforts at such a settlement are doomed to failure if they ignore or deny the rights of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland and to establish a State of their own. The PLO must always be involved in any efforts to bring about peace and a settlement of the Middle East question. Excluding the Palestinians would only amount to perpetuation of decades of misery in the region.210.	The instability of the political situation in southern Africa has often been seen against the background of three distinct areas of conflictâSouth Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe. It is the contention of the Lesotho Government that the problem of southern Africa is one and has its roots in the apartheid system of South Africa. It is in the interests of that system to create puppet Bantustans in South Africa and to maintain the status quo in Namibia and Zimbabwe. Therefore  we welcomed the decision of the United Kingdom Government  the colonial Power in Zimbabwe  to call an all-party conference  currently under way in London. It is to be hoped that the constitutional conference will bring a new era of genuine independence  peace and stability in Zimbabwe. While we believe that violent confrontation should be avoided  it is our contention that the alternatives should not be reduced by the United Kingdom's tacit approval of illegal manoeuvres by Ian Smith and Bishop Muzorewa. No lasting settlement can be achieved unless serious account is taken of the legitimate concerns of the Patriotic Front.211.	We resolutely condemn the steps taken by South Africa to establish an illegal National Assembly inside Namibia following the bogus election held last December. South Africa's action is in contravention of the relevant Security Council resolutions and in defiance of the efforts by the international community to bring legality to the Territory and secure genuine independence for its people. Hence we call upon the members of the Security Council  individually and collectively  to put pressure on Pretoria to end its illegal occupation of Namibia. The people of Namibia should be given the opportunity to determine their own representation without outside interference. Towards this end the role of SWAPO in the final solution of the Namibia issue should be given recognition.212.	Lesotho has followed with disappointment  yet not with despair  the continuing conflict and local skirmishes involving non-aligned developing countries. These conflicts must be resolved without recourse to the use of force. In this connexion Lesotho wishes to congratulate the Republic of Mauritania for withdrawing its forces from the Territory of Western Sahara  and for concluding an agreement with the Frente POLISARIO on the self-determination and independence of the people of Western Sahara. We appeal to Morocco to follow the example of Mauritania and enter into negotiations with the Frente POLISARIO. It is with great pleasure that I inform this Assembly that today  9 October 1979; the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho announced in Maseru that it recognized the Frente POLISARIO as the sovereign government of the Territory and people of Western Sahara.213.	With regard to the situation in Cyprus  we cannot fail to express our concern at the attempts being made to divide and encourage divisions in the island. Cypriot sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-alignment have my country's support. To this end we view as mandatory the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from the island. We hope that the Cypriot people will be assisted to discuss amicably and arrive at a lasting peaceful solution to the problem they have faced for some years.214.	The peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula still remains elusive. We firmly believe that unification can be achieved only through direct North-South dialogue without external interference. Such dialogue should not be prejudiced by prior demands that may threaten the security of the parties concerned. We call on the parties to resume their dialogue  on the basis of the joint communiquÃ© of 4 July 1972. 215.	We are gratified that the co-operation that has been going on between the United Nations and the OAU is being intensified. Early this year  under the auspices of the ECA and the OAU  African States had a chance to consider in detail the transport problems of the continent. We appeal to Members of this Organization to view favourably the declaration of the United Nations Transport and Communications Decade in Africa. For us in Lesotho  a land-locked country completely surrounded by South Africa  the coming decade should enable us to break our isolation from the rest of Africa.216.	Finally  I wish to register my country's gratitude and appreciation to the United Nations  its specialized agencies and the many donor countries for the economic support and assistance we have received pursuant to Security Council resolution 402 (1976) and to General Assembly resolutions 32/98 and 33/128. Particular mention should be made of the Governments of Mozambique  Nigeria  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  the United Kingdom  South Korea  Japan  Denmark  the United States  the Federal Republic of Germany  the Republic of Ireland and Canada for their generous response to the Secretary-General's appeal. It is no exaggeration to say that  since the first ""Farah mission' ' came to my county  there have been tangible and visible signs that the assistance we have so far received has gone a long way towards reducing our vulnerability and dependence on South Africa. We are now in a position to withstand some of the pressures that were contemplated by South Africa when it unilaterally closed our borders. We do  however  hope that Members of this Organization will favourably consider the Secretary-General's report contained in document A/34/393-S/13485 of 22 August 1979.217.	As Lesotho prepares to act as host to a donors' conference in Maseru and to launch its third five-year economic development plan  I find it imperative to mention the peculiar problems my country has had to face. Acute oil problems have dealt a shattering blow to our efforts at development. To date Lesotho has been paying the highest oil prices in the world  simply because we are land-locked within apartheid South Africa. While our peculiar position should not be made an excuse for modifying the world community's punitive measures against those who violate the Charter of the United Nations  we should like to address an appeal to the oil-producing Members of the United Nations to render Lesotho special assistance to offset its predicament with regard to oil. We are grateful for the good example and acts of solidarity already displayed in this connexion by the People's Republic of Mozambique  the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria and the Federal Republic of Germany. This assistance when put into effect will help us to meet the present high prices of oil and shore up our small budding economy."
"81",4263,"LUX",34,1979,"ï»¿It is a very pleasant duty for me to offer you my heartiest congratulations  Sir  on your election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your accession to this high office is a source of joy to us  for we see in you the distinguished representative of a friendly African country  and your experience in the United Nations augurs well for this session of our Assembly.194.	We wish also to express our thanks to your predecessor  the outgoing President  Mr. Lievano  for the manner in which he conducted the work of the thirty- third session of the General Assembly.195.	I should like now to address our Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. For the past 10 years I have enjoyed a constructive and friendly collaboration with him in various forums. My admiration for his talents as a skilled diplomat devoted to the noble causes of mankind is of long standing. There is hardly any need for me to restate the full confidence of the Government of Luxembourg and the total support of my country for his continuing and tireless efforts in pursuit of the ideals of our Organization.196.	I should like also to congratulate our one hundred and fifty-second Member of the United Nations  the State of Saint Lucia  which has fulfilled all the requirements of our Charter and has thereby confirmed the universality of our Organization. While addressing to this young country and its leaders our sincere congratulations  I should like to pledge to them our full co-operation in the attainment of the objectives and ideals of this Organization.197.	From this rostrum a year ago I deemed it fitting to voice a certain optimism during a brief study of the world situation. This feeling of hope was based on the fact that our peoples had finally discovered the merits and advantages of dialogue  and had finally seemed to have repudiated the path of sterile confrontation.198.	But today  although a dialogue is continuing in many areas  we are bound to recognize that the international arena  where we are both actors and spectators  remains fraught with tension in the political  military and economic fields.199.	I do not wish today  however  to yield to pessimism  which ill becomes me and which would help no one. May I be allowed  however  briefly to dwell on certain problems which seem to be a potential threat to all of us and consequently deserve the vigilant attention of the General Assembly in the coming months  if it wishes to justify its existence.200.	Our anxiety over past and new tensions derives primarily from our view of a certain amount of stagnation  the absence of concrete results and a refusal to compromise in the negotiations on the major issues.201.	May I first touch on the many problems of southern Africa  an area long exposed to injustice and human suffering. The representative who preceded me spoke so eloquently on that part of the world  whose problems are due as much to the existence of a philosophy which goes against human nature as to armed conflicts  which claim new victims every day.202.	Everybody's acceptance of the decision of the Security Council which was to lead Namibia to independence filled us with a tremendous amount of hope; yet today we are bound to recognize the fact that those hopes did not yield conclusions we were entitled to expect. Of course  some progress was accomplished  thanks to the continuing efforts  especially of the five Western Powers  which were behind this promising initiative. The support of the African front-line countriesâincluding yours  Mr. Presidentâwas a valuable element in the compromise. Nor should we forget the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General and of his close associates. From this rostrum I should like to express my profound admiration to them for their truly Sisyphean efforts over the past year. Others would surely not have had the courage to overcome so many setbacks or so much frustration. Thanks primarily to their tenacity; we still have the hope today that there will be an equitable solution found for an independent Namibia.â203.	Now I wish to turn to another part of southern Africa which has been beset by so many conflicts  Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. First and foremost  I should like to pay a sincere tribute to the historic initiative taken by Mrs. Margaret Thatcher  the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  and to her Foreign Minister  my colleague Lord Peter Carrington.204.	The Conference in London is now entering its fifth week. Every single one of the opposing parties will have been seated at the same table. That is a positive point  and we fervently hope that the additional time for thought which they ail accorded themselves will bring everybody closer together and closer  also  I hope  to the common goal  which is independence and peace for that part of Africa. Let all those who are negotiating today be keenly aware of their responsibilities to their fellow citizens  who certainly have no other desire but finally to enjoy a life of peace without poverty  suffering and injustice.205.	Turning to South Africa  I deeply regret that the rulers of that country have done nothing to change the unnatural policy of apartheid. It would appear that an exchange of ideas on the system is proceeding  as well as some tentative questioning regarding minor matters  but we are still very far indeed from the fundamental reform which alone can make South Africa a country respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. How much more time  I would ask  will the leaders of that country need before they realize that the policy of apartheid is not only profoundly unrealistic  but also against the elementary rights of human beings? Once again  I would invite the international community to give its full support to those who by peaceful means are endeavouring to alter this sorry state of affairs.206.	Last autumn we were hopeful that the accords resulting from the Camp David negotiations would be the break-through that would make it possible for the whole of the Middle East region to regain peace. As far as direct relations between Israel and Egypt are concerned  the process started at Camp David seems to be proceeding rather satisfactorily.207.	Of course  the progress achieved in normalizing the situation between those two countries can only meet with our support  as does also any step  however small  towards peace. Egypt and Israel have thus provedâif there was any need for thatâthat the political determination of responsible statesmen is capable of overcoming all obstacles through negotiations.208.	On the other hand  it must be recognized that too many questions  too many aspects of questions involving other parties  remain unresolved. As long as there still exists a single serious problem in the Middle East  that part of the world will continue to be a source of tension.209.	The common view of the nine countries members of the European Community was set forth a few days ago from this rostrum by our Acting President-in- Office  my ""colleague  the Irish Foreign Minister  Mr. Michael O'Kennedy  and there is therefore no need for me to revert to this matter in detail. I want  however  to insist on something that is an absolute necessity  namely that there must be negotiations with all the parties concerned  without any exceptions. Whether the negotiations are global or separate at the outset is  after all  only a matter of procedure.210.	Separate discussions  both concurrent and successive  make it possible to discuss the difficulties in sequence  and therefore improve the chances of success. There must be as many approaches to the problem as there are facets of that problem. Therefore  it is fundamental that no interested party be denied a voice in the proceedings or be excluded out of hand. Clearly  as you may well imagine  that applies first and foremost to the Palestinians  who have the most legitimate right to participate in the process leading to peace. Also  they have every right to designate the representatives in whom they wish to place their trust. If they identify with the PLO and feel that they are well represented by that organization  it is hardly realistic to ignore their choice. After all  the choice of spokesman is the exclusive right of the party concerned and not of their opposite numbers.211.	Similarly  it is inadmissible to preach  as some have done  what still seems to be the destruction of the State of Israel. Israel has the right to exist in peace  without continually being the target of the hostility of any of its neighbours. To ignore these historical realities  reflected clearly in the many resolutions of our Organization  strikes me not only as unrealistic but also as a dangerous challenge to the credibility of our Organization.212.	Insisting on pre-conditions  and then demanding the exclusion of certain matters only serves to delay negotiations. I earnestly hope that the General Assembly will make good use of all the time it will devote to the examination of the Middle East conflict in order to bring about a solution by constructive andâI hope- peaceful debate.213.	Similar tensions resulting from similar transgressions of the United Nations Charter have existed for some months in South-East Asia. Our Organization has not been capable of reacting to the clear acts of aggression which  in addition to taking a heavy toll in human life and economic damage  have swollen unduly the wretched mass of what is called circumspectly but incorrectly ""refugees"". But  I ask you  where is their refuge? Who will respect their basic human rights? Who will give them asylum  which is the best that the more fortunate of them can hope for. Nothing can ever replace their home and especially their homeland  which is the land of their ancestors.214.	These people are not truly refugees. They are fugitives who are lost and subject to outrageous blackmail. What help is this finite world of fixed frontiers  even if they are guaranteed by the United Nations  if we must continually witness people fleeing for reasons of religious  ethnic or racial incompatibility? Shall we soon see the emergence of anew philosophy which says that some leaders have the right to demand at will the displacement of millions of human beings for reasons which are the very negation of our Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? I would hope that each and every one of us will give some thought to the implications of such an eventuality.215.	Luxembourg is pleased that by its participation in the Geneva Meeting  it was able to act favourably on the admirable humanitarian initiative of the Secretary-âGeneral. I assure him that we will continue to do whatever we can  within the limited means of a small country  to help to alleviate however little the fate of these human beings out of a pure sense of human responsibility.216.	Seeing so much misery and misfortune  we wonder whether we are dreaming when we read about the tremendous amount of money devoted by the various countries in the world to armaments. In spite of the broad consensus at the tenth special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament arid filled us with hope and optimism  and notwithstanding the second SALT Treaty which we hope will soon take effect between the two super-Powers  the amount spent on armaments throughout the world is constantly increasing.217.	Several years ago people were talking in terms of $200 billion  but today the figure has gone up to $400 billion. When will we be able to put an end to this collective folly  this unbridled race? A few days ago from this same rostrum  His Holiness Pope John Paul II  addressing the General Assembly arid contemplating the senseless accumulation of the means of destruction  exhorted the world to abandon the arms race if we wish to retain some credibility in the eyes of future generations.218.	In approaching world economic problems and after having drawn this rather dismal picture of certain political issues  I would have enjoyed indulging in a certain amount of cautious optimism. Unfortunately  harsh realities do not allow that.219.	I readily admit that the bad situation in the world economy has been with us for some time. At one point some people placed their belief in a modest recovery  but slower-than-expected growth and a too-high level of inflation  an increasingly heavy burden of unemployment and a highly confused monetary situation this year have ruined our hopes  at least our hopes for a slow but proximate recovery.220.	Who is to blame? Who is responsible? This  of course  is the question that inevitably arises. Immediately everyone points an accusing finger at someone else. However  I believe that it is in vain to try to seek one scapegoat. First of all  we would never reach agreement  and secondly  that would hardly help us to find the solution to our present problems. In addition  that attitude would be the negation of the interdependence of peoplesâand that is true of people in both the industrialized and the developing countries. Therefore  I shall refrain from making any subdivisions  or using ideological labels.221.	Is the problem not rather one of an inaccurate assessment of the over-all situation of our countries and of relations between producer and consumer countries that are too irregular and intermittent? Let us deal with these deficiencies and let us all recognize that we are all dependent on each other.222.	My Government firmly believes in the interdependence of all the countries in the world and especially of all their economies. That is why we have tried resolutely to conclude the agreements on bilateral and multilateral co-operation within the framework of the European Communities  which my friend and colleague from Ireland spoke about earlier.223.	Just as in the political field  goodwill alone will not be enough in the economic field. I take as an example the renewal of the Lome' Convention  which establishes co-operation between the European Community and the countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific. Since the inception of that union  my country  aware of its limits at the bilateral level  was one of the most ardent defenders of that form of co-operation which at the time was called ""association"". We felt that this was an innovative means of initiating negotiations between sovereign States on an equal footing.224.	If the nine member States of the European Com-munity by their concessions were not always successful in meeting all the hopes of the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries  that was unfortunately due to harsh reality. Members may rest assured that the sacrifices made by the nine countries were substantial and probably even exceeded what was feasible in some cases.225.	It is true that the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy and even the fifth session of UNCTAD have been unable so far to produce results that will satisfy everyone. However  I am convinced that as the idea of interdependence gains ground  as it inevitably will  it will be possible for us to move closer to a genuine constructive dialogue among our countries which should lead to the harmonization of everyone's interests. However  all sides must show realism and confine themselves to serious  business-like proposals which stand a chance of success.226.	Let us all work towards this noble goal. Let us guarantee for each of our nations and for their citizens existence in dignity  freedom and peace  thanks to an equitable distribution of the wealth of the world. I express my hope here and now that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to development in 1980 will achieve decisive progress for the benefit of all.227.	A source of satisfaction for everyone is the notable progress that has been made in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea during the past year.228.	Under the dynamic leadership of my friend  President Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe  that Conference has reached the point where it is now possible to entertain the hope that negotiations will be concluded in about a year. If that is achieved  I believe I may say that this will be a unique accomplishment in the annals of our Organization. The responsibilities that we are assuming today or in the near future will be very great. Certainly the idea is not to sign a convention of that scope unless each and every one of us implements it. It must be acceptable and capable of implementation. Human rights are not to be limited simply to political and civil freedoms.229.	His Holiness Pope John Paul II stressed that human rights are indivisible. For my part  I fully subscribe to that proposition. Because we are a small country  freedom  independence and human rights  whether political or economic  are particularly dear to us. If we sometimes appear to some of you to overemphasize this point  rest assured that we are not trying to export our views to other countries with other systems  but merely share the sufferings of those whose indivisible rights are disregarded. And if that is our attitude  believe me that it is a sincere and honest one and is in no way the result of any ulterior political  motives whatever.230.	To review the world situation in this distinguished Assembly from the standpoint of a small Member State like Luxembourg is  believe me  not always easy. Certainly it was no pleasure to sketch for the eleventh time this rather gloomy picture  as I have just done. Since we have placed all our faith in the United Nations and in the common sense of the peoples who make it up  we believe that it is always better to give an unadorned view of the problems  in the hope that we will all together find equitable solutions rather than resigning ourselves to a gradual worsening of those problems day by day."
"82",4336,"MAR",34,1979,"ï»¿I am happy to extend to you  Sir  on my own behalf and on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  our most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We consider your election as an honour conferred on our continent of Africa and a tribute to your well-known quality and abilities. We are sure that your political experience will be of the greatest benefit to you in directing the work of this session with the requisite wisdom and impartiality so that it may successfully participate in the consolidation of peace and justice throughout the world.120.	I should also like to commend your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for his wise actions during his presidency of our previous session  and to welcome Saint Lucia  whose membership in the United Nations will help to strengthen the universal character of our Organization.121.	I also have pleasure in thanking the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his unceasing endeavours in the cause of justice and for the realization of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.L22. The political horizon of our world is still clouded with elements of tension and unrest arising from attempts made by certain States which  to satisfy selfish interests  continue to impose political and doctrinal hegemony  persist in abusing the rights of peoples and plundering their resources  and continue to disrupt their political stability.123.	It is indeed distressing for humanity to observe that political relations among countries of the international community still constitute the weakest link in the chain of human and cultural evolution since these relations have fallen short of the appropriate level that would enable them to keep pace with the significant conquests achieved by mankind in the field of science  technology and culture.124.	The major political and economic Powers in the world are still striving to retain their privileged position at the expense of other regions of the world. This policy of hegemony has  unfortunately  been transmitted to some other nations which have recently started to practise it on a regional scale  which in no way lessens its dangerous effects.125.	After enduring the worst kinds of exploitation and colonial rule  and with some of its southern territories still struggling under the burden of racist and colonial regimes  our African continent  with its wounds still unhealed  is once again suffering from the evils of foreign intervention and attempts to impose regional hegemony and destabilization of its countries.126.	The continent of Asia is also suffering from similar onslaughts in its far eastern and central regions. In its western region  the problem of the Middle East puts this area in the first rank among areas of international tension throughout the world.127.	As part of the Arab nation  Morocco has constantly shown the greatest concern for this problem and is giving its full attention to the question of Palestine  which lies at the heart of the conflict in the Middle East region as a whole.128.	The political and humanitarian dimensions of the question of Palestine constitute a blatant example of international political injustice and provide a clear illustration of Israel's contempt for human rights and its violation of the principles and resolutions of the inter-national community.129.	Indeed  the question of Palestine has  in recent years  witnessed a significant and fundamental change brought about by the recognition given by most countries of the world to the inalienable national rights of the struggling Palestinian people and  primarily  to their right to self-determination and the establishment of their independent State on their land  and the wide international recognition given to the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.130.	In spite of this international consensus  Israel is still persisting in its aggressive policy against this long- suffering people and in its policy of colonial settlements on Palestinian land and the physical liquidation of the sons of this embattled people.131.	The Kingdom of Morocco strongly condemns the Israeli policy of aggression  which finds concrete expression in the infringement of every principle of international law  ethics and conventions  and in the most serious violation of human rights  and of the principles and precepts of international relations.â132.	After many long years of occupation of Palestine and of some of the territories of Arab States  we see that Israel is still persisting in its policy based on the reckless demolition of houses  the expropriation of property belonging to the Arab population  the eviction of the latter from their lands and the obliteration of their national and cultural identity. Israel persists in its policy of expansion and annexation  the establishment of new colonies and settlements  and of committing every kind of human and economic exploitation of the land and its inhabitants. To this end Israel regards as permissible every sort of repression and terrorism  thus challenging the resolutions adopted by the international community  the most recent of which was Security Council resolution 446 (1979) concerning settlements.133.	Morocco wishes to draw the attention of the international community to the far-reaching and serious dimensions of the recent Israeli decision to permit its nationals to purchase Arab land in Palestine. This decision is only a screen to disguise Israel's new criminal plan designed to consolidate its policy of colonial settlement throughout the land of Palestine in preparation for the Judaization and complete transformation of the human and cultural identity of this Holy Land.134.	This measure should be immediately censured and condemned by the international community and tangible  practical steps should be taken to render it ineffective before it leads to a fait accompli that Israel will exploit in order to further consolidate its expansionist policy.135.	The Kingdom of Morocco  which regards the question of Palestine and the Middle East as its first concern  reaffirms its commitment to support the Palestinian people and the Arab States  part of whose territory has been subjected to Zionist occupation  and reiterates its commitment to the resolutions of the Seventh Conference of Arab Heads of State  held at Rabat in 1974  of which Morocco considers itself to be the trustee  and to the resolutions of the Baghdad Conference.136.	On the basis of these resolutions  Morocco believes that any partial solution not including complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories and  primarily  the holy city of Jerusalem  and recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of their own independent State in Palestine  will be rejected since  by its very nature  it would not meet the requirements for peace  which can only be established in the Middle East on the basis of a just and comprehensive solution.137.	My country had the honour to host the Tenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held in the city of Fez last May  and subsequently had the honour to welcome the meeting of the Jerusalem Committee  presided over by His Majesty King Hassan II.138.	Those two important Islamic meetings resulted in an overwhelming Islamic consensus in which the assistance for the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.139.	With regard to the situation in the holy city of Jerusalem  which is so dear to the hearts of Moslems as the site of the nocturnal journey of the Holy Prophet and the cradle of divine religions  the Jerusalem Committee  meeting in the city of Fez  regarded the liberation of the city of Jerusalem as a responsibility incumbent on all Moslems throughout the world and stressed that the preservation of its Arab-Islamic identity and its restoration to Arab sovereignty was a joint and collective Islamic duty to be discharged by all Moslem peoples and Governments. This Fez resolution is in conformity with the numerous resolutions adopted by our Organization and  primarily  by the Security Council in 1969 and by UNESCO and the Commission on Human Rights  which condemned Israel's actions in changing the status of the City of Jerusalem and in violating the sanctity of the Holy Places therein.140.	In the face of Israel's persistent defiance of all these resolutions and its violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter  we call for preventive measures to be imposed against it in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.141.	It is with extreme concern that Morocco is following the repeated Israeli attacks on Lebanon  which have recently assumed the form of the occupation  either directly or by proxy  of its southern territory. Morocco most strongly censures and condemns the barbarous raids which the Zionist regime is launching on the towns and villages of Lebanon  and which constitute a serious and continuous threat to peace in the Middle Eastern region as a whole. Morocco reaffirms its full solidarity with the people of Lebanon in their ordeal  and its desire to see that Lebanon is fully independent and sovereign and that its territorial integrity is safeguarded.142.	The African continent  which  during the past two centuries  witnessed the worst forms of colonial exploitation  is even today suffering from the adverse effects of colonial dependence which bequeathed to the land of Africa an enduring legacy of chronic economic backwardness  ignorance and political fragmentation.143.	Southern Africa is still suffering under the burden of odious racist  colonial regimes and is waging heroic wars of liberation in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa.144.	While saluting the southern African peoples' just struggle for emancipation and liberation  we reiterate our firm resolve to continue to provide their liberation movements with every kind of aid and support. As a dedicated proponent of dialogue and negotiation  Morocco hopes that the current negotiations in London will result in a solution which will guarantee the inalienable right of the people of Zimbabwe  represented by the Patriotic Front  to full independence and elimination of all vestiges of the racist regime.145.	Pending the achievement of this desired solution  Morocco declares its solidarity with the front-line. 146. In keeping with its standard practice  Morocco condemns the hideous racist regime of apartheid in South Africa  which it regards as a stigma of shame on the forehead of mankind in the twentieth century and a crime against humanity. Morocco strongly believes that a concerted international effort must be made to isolate and destroy apartheid.147.	With regard to Namibia  which is still subjected to an illegal occupation and domination by the regime of Pretoria  Morocco salutes the struggle of SWAPO  the legitimate representative of the people of Namibia  and declares its continuing support for their struggle to achieve full independence and to preserve their territorial integrity  including Walvis Bay  which is an integral part of Namibia.148.	The problem of disarmament is still an increasing source of concern to mankind since the survival of the human race and the preservation of life itself on this planet depend on the fate of the enormous stockpiles of nuclear weapons and the future course of the frantic nuclear arms race.149.	While expressing our satisfaction at the results achieved by the tenth special session  devoted to dis-armament  by way of defining objectives and priorities and establishing the bodies needed for the achievement of full disarmament  we feel that there is an urgent need for greater political will on the part of nuclear-weapon States in order to attain the goal of ridding mankind of the spectre of impending nuclear annihilation.150.	We are still inspired by the hope that the various committees responsible for monitoring this issue will be able to bring about the conclusion of treaties prohibiting nuclear tests and the production of chemical and other lethal weapons which threaten the very survival of life on our planet.151.	I should now like to touch on a matter of direct concern to my country which the Moroccan people regard as an issue affecting their destiny  namely the so-called question of the Western Sahara  for whose inclusion on the agenda of the General Assembly or of the Special Committee on decolonization we can see no justification  since the decolonization of this Territory has been completed in conformity with the principles of international law.152.	I am convinced that the world will one day realize the true nature of this question and will learn that the problem has been fabricated with a view to the attainment of hegemonistic aims and the aims of vested interests disguised behind the veil of the defence of principles.153.	It may be asked why this is an invented question. It is an invented question because everyone knows that the Sahara is a single geographical area extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea and does not confer any ethnic identity of a special nature that could distinguish the inhabitants of the Sahara from the population of neighbouring States belonging to the same area. In effect  the Sahara only represents a natural geographical prolongation of the States adjoining it to the north and south. There is a Moroccan Sahara  as there is a Mauritanian Sahara  a Malian Sahara  an Algerian Sahara  a Tunisian Sahara and other Saharas belonging to every State bordering on this desert.154.	Consequently  anyone wishing to allege the existence of a Saharan people would be better advised to abide by reason and logic and to refer to the Sahara as a whole rather than only to that part which constitutes a natural prolongation and an integral part of Morocco.155.	I emphasize that history has never recorded the existence of a Saharan people distinct from the peoples of the region.156.	The concept of the existence of a people in the Western Sahara was created by Spain  the State which colonized the Territory  and this colonial concept was subsequently resurrected  following the liberation of this land  for reasons relating to a policy of hegemony and expansion out of keeping with the purposes and principles of our Charter.157.	The inhabitants of the Territory are Moroccans who  after their liberation from the yoke of colonialism  have re-joined their homeland  and henceforth  no one can separate them from this homeland.158.	In this context I should like to recall certain facts relating to this matter. It is common knowledge that Morocco  because of its strategic location  was a coveted objective for many colonial Powers  and this finally led to the fragmentation of its territorial integrity and the partitioning of its lands into several zones of influence controlled by more than one colonial Power. Hence  the elimination of colonialism from all of the territory of Morocco was accomplished in several stages and at different periods.159.	Morocco tried hard to recover its remaining territories  which had been colonized by Spain and  when it realized that the latter country had resorted to a policy of prevarication and procrastination  it was obligedâin view of its desire to follow peaceful proceduresâto refer the matter to the United Nations. In resolution 2072 (XX) adopted in 1965 the General Assembly did  in fact  request Spain to ""enter into negotiations on the problems relating to sovereignty"" in the Moroccan territories of Ifni and Spanish Sahara.160.	At the time  Spain turned a deaf ear to that request and persisted in its policy of procrastination  after returning the Territory of Ifni to Morocco in 1969  until its manoeuvres reached a climax in 1974  when it declared before the United Nations that it intended to create an artificial entity in the Saharan Territory  which had always been Moroccan  with a view to keeping the spurious entity that it wished to create under its effective control.161.	There is no need to recall the successive stages through which this issue subsequently passed and which ended with the administering Power's giving in and consenting to the signing of an agreement on 14 November 1975  whereby the responsibility of Spain over this Territory would terminate on 26 February 1976.162.	The return of the inhabitants of the Territory to their homeland was the result of a free act of will  fulfilling a desire they had long expressed under colonial rule by the resistance operations in which they had engaged in full co-operation with their Moroccan brethren in the north. On 26 February 1976  those in-habitants gave a clear  free and honest expression of their desire to join the homeland through their local representative council which  in the presence and with the participation of the then administering Power  took its historic decision to keep the Territory within the framework of the Moroccan State.163.	This free expression was a true and faithful implementation of General Assembly resolution 3458 B (XXX) of 10 December 1975 concerning this matter. It is well known that this resolution confirmed the tripartite agreement concluded at Madrid on 14 November 1975  under the terms of which all the powers formerly exercised by the colonial authorities in the Territory were handed back to Morocco after negotiations  which had been called for by the Security Council of the United Nations.164.	When they were subsequently given the opportunity  the population of the Territory of Rio de Oro gave free  spontaneous and impressive expression  in the presence of numerous observers and within sight and hearing of representatives of the international press  to their overwhelming desire to join the fatherland. They officially confirmed this when the representatives of the Territory declared their attachment and loyalty to the Moroccan State by taking the oath of allegiance to His Majesty King Hassan II  the King of Morocco.165.	Having recovered its territorial unity  for which it strove and fought so long and for which it suffered so much at the hands of the colonialists  Morocco once again declares that it is still ready to make any sacrificeâhowever costlyâto protect and defend its regained territorial integrity since  for every member of the Moroccan people  this is a sacrosanct issue and a matter of destiny on which there can be no going back and no bargaining.166.	We are deeply and utterly convinced of the justice and legitimacy of our cause. However  our firm resolve to defend our rights in no way means that we shall turn a deaf ear to the call of peace  since Morocco has always been an advocate of peace. We have often given proof of our full willingness to seek peace and ways of reaching a mutual understanding even with those who contest our right to recover our territorial integrity and who incite their agents to create a fictitious  artificial entity intended to constitute a focal- point of tension and instability in the region.167.	As an expression of Morocco's desire to over-come this fabricated problem  His Majesty King Hassan II  the King of Morocco  in a letter addressed to the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] on 28 August 1979  proposed the holding of a summit conference of Heads of State and Government of the countries bordering the Sahara  with a view to examining the measures to be taken for the achievement of co-ordinated and joint economic development in keeping with the aspirations of its peoples and for the benefit of all the inhabitants of the greater Saharan region  since the Saharaâas we have already indicatedâis not confined to what used to be known as the Western Sahara  which was occupied by Spain  but extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea.168.	In taking this initiative  Morocco is eager to make its position absolutely clear right from the start. This proposal does not involve prevarication and is not intended to be an ephemeral  ad hoc proposal  vaguely conceived and hedged with doubts. We say here quite clearly that the Sahara  which was under Spanish ad-ministration and which is an integral part of Morocco  has been united definitively with the motherland in a final and definitive manner from which there is no going back.169.	Our proposal is aimed at overcoming the spurious  artificial problem  which was created regarding the question of the Sahara  and calls for a future solution based on sound and true mutual co-operation.170.	We address this call for co-operation to the countries bordering on the Sahara. This vast sea of barren sand has always been a meeting ground for neighbouring countries and has never formed a banner between them. Trade between these bordering countries flourished throughout the ages prior to the colonial expansion  and the inhabitants of this region were linked by solid bonds and ties of ethnic  cultural  religious and economic relations until the advent of the colonial age  when these links were severed. We must now re-establish these links in the interest of the population of the region as a whole and within the framework of a comprehensive view of the future. Hence  in his proposal to the current Chairman of the OAU  His Majesty King Hassan II made the following point:""You will undoubtedly share our view that Africa is currently passing through a crucial stage in its quest for true economic and political emancipation. Instead of dissipating our endeavours and our meagre resources  both human and material  in an effort to solve spurious problems  we feel that it is necessary to devote ourselves fully to work which will ensure the harmonious development of Africa and a more comfortable life in keeping with the aspirations of all Africans.""In this perspective  and in order to co-ordinate our endeavours  we believe that a summit conference  held under your chairmanship  and with the participation of Heads of State and Government of the countries bordering on the Sahara and of the esteemed members of the Committee of Wise Men  would constitute an effective contribution to the quest for this economic emancipation for which we all hope. If we pool our human and material resources and set as a fundamental objective the general prosperity of our continent within a context of mutual assistance and fraternal co-operation  we will have proved to the whole world that we are able to manage our own affairs in a clear-sighted and perspicacious manner.""171.	His Majesty also proposed that these countries should jointly formulate a plan that would enable land-locked countries such as Mali  Niger and Chad to have access to sea ports as a necessary benefit. In His Majesty's own words:""We would thus also be able to jointly formulate a policy based on the right to utilize the sea. Such a right will be of vital importance for life and for the supply of food after the year 2000  yet many countries bordering on the Sahara are deprived of this right as a result of their land-locked position in the centre of our continent.""172.	In addition to achieving fruitful co-operation and numerous other commendable benefits and banishing the spectre of tension and confrontation from this region  this initiative is conducive to the achievement of many other advantages  the beneficial effects of which would be even more far-reaching.173.	One of the aims of the OAU is the promotion and encouragement of co-operation among its members in all fields throughout the continent  beginning at the regional and local level  because this is the natural and practical way to achieve general continental cooperation.174.	This initiative on the part of Morocco offers a practical plan for co-operation within the framework of the African co-operation plan which is being promoted by our African organization.175.	In another broader context  this initiative might represent a connecting link that could give positive  concrete form to African-Arab co-operation and provide new scope for joint and fruitful action  since it is common knowledge that one of the main objectives of the Declaration on Afro-Arab Co-operation15 was to urge and encourage the Arab and African States to implement as many joint projects as possible in order to strengthen and consolidate their mutual co-operation. To that end  a special committee was established  called the Standing Commission on Afro-Arab Cooperation  of which Morocco and most of the African countries concerned with this initiative are members. Consequently  this initiative will open up new vistas for African-Arab co-operation in a region which has until now been neglected.176.	This initiative could also be placed in a wider geographical context in which inter-African and African-Arab co-operation would eventually benefit from the results of European-Arab co-operation achieved through the European-Arab dialogue. If this Moroccan initiative is faithfully implemented  it will turn this region into a natural meeting-point for such tripartite co-operation in which capital from one party would participate side by side with technical expertise from another party in the profitable development of the region's resources for the benefit and general good of the population of the region as a whole.177.	This initiative is in total harmony with the concept of co-operation between the African  Arab and European communities which was highly extolled by the President of the Republic of the Sudan  the former Chairman of the OAU. Indeed  it provides a practical opportunity for the implementation and realization of this concept in a tangible manner.178.	This initiative is aimed  above all  at endowing inter-African co-operation with a lofty significance so that it can stand as a model and a shining example of assistance to help the land-locked countries of the region obtain the right of access to the sea  which could be of considerable benefit to them.179.	In short  this initiative is intended to tum this region into a region of peace and mutual understanding instead of allowing it to remain a theatre of confrontation and tension. As already indicated  it would thus achieve the aims of many regional organizations and institutions in addition to one of the noble objectives for which our Organization is striving  namely the strengthening of international co-operation.180.	This initiative would bring prosperity and development to tens of millions of people who have so often been the victims of natural disasters such as drought  and would help to mobilize abilities and re-sources to put an end to the misery  disease  illiteracy and ignorance which are the distressing symptoms of backwardness.181.	In view of the importance and broad scope of this initiative  Morocco is submitting it to the OAU  the United Nations  the League of Arab States  the Islamic Conference  the European Common Market and the FAO.182.	In so doing  Morocco is offering to the world a sincere and living example of true co-operation and firm solidarity for which it is striving in the interests of the peoples of the region at a time when the world is deluged with narrow-minded selfishness  controversies  doctrinal disputes  interference in the affairs of others and armed aggression.183.	The international economic situation is still a matter of grave concern to us since the gap between the wealthy and the poorer nations of the world is increasing at a time when we had hoped that it would be narrowed or closed.184.	This situation has caused most of the poorer nationsâand the majority of them are African countriesâto lose hope of ever escaping from the clutches of economic backwardness 185.	Although the international community has realized the extreme urgency of bringing about a radical and thorough change in international economic relations  the lack of political will on the part of the industrialized nations for the establishment of a new international economic order still constitutes a stumbling- block against which the hopes that most of the countries of the world entertain regarding the establishment of such an order have been shattered. This can clearly be seen in the failure of the North-South dialogue to achieve the desired results.186.	The new international economic order has be-come a necessary alternative to the currently prevailing system of economic prejudice and injustice  especially since the principle of international integration and interdependence has become a self-evident reality in economic relations among States.187.	It is truly distressing for us to see the industrialized nations resorting to subterfuge  hiding behind the walls of economic protectionism and turning a deaf ear to the developing countries' appeals for aid and assistance. Those nations should realize that the basic interest of their peoples lies in the abandonment of the old economic order and in agreeing to make economic relations more democratic. 188. We are still living in a world in which the main fulfilling a desire they had long expressed under colonial rule by the resistance operations in which they had engaged in full co-operation with their Moroccan brethren in the north.

Morocco is once again endeavouring to help to create a better political and social climate for the inhabitants of its region by calling for fraternal  local co-operation in which hands and minds can join together for the general good in order to build  develop and improve by turning away from the sources of enmity and the evils of war.190. The promotion of local neighbourliness is a first step towards reconciliation among nations and greater mutual love and respect among mankind  which would enable the human race to devote its energies to building a better and happier life in which brotherliness  prosperity  progress and dignity would prevail."
"83",4431,"MDG",34,1979,"ï»¿It is my unhappy duty to present on behalf of the Malagasy delegation our heartfelt condolences to our sister delegation of Angola on the passing of President Agostinho Neto. The loss the Angolan people have suffered is felt even more deeply by us since we consider ourselves  like the Angolans  committed to the struggle for a common causeâa struggle in which President Agostinho Neto was one of the prime movers and one of the most ardent combatants. The work which has been undertaken will continue. We owe this to his memory  to our peoples and to an independent and militant Africa.109.	The excellent and fraternal relations which prevail between the United Republic of Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Madagascar give me every reason to express to you  Sir  the joy and the pride which we feel in seeing you preside over the thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly. Your qualities as a diplomat  combined so naturally in you with those of an honourable man have been known to us for some time  as has been the wealth of experience which you have acquired in defending the interests of Africa  the non-aligned movement and the international community as a whole. All this guarantees the success of this session  for which we all earnestly hope. I hardly need to tell you that we are prepared to give you our complete co-operation  particularly in upholding the ideals which are common to us all.110.	To Mr. Indalecio Lievano  we should like to pay a particular tribute for the calmness  the equanimity  and the perfect objectivity with which he conducted the work of the thirty-third session and ensured its success.111.	We welcome Saint Lucia on its assumption of its international responsibilities and we wish to assure the delegation of that country of our desire  to co-operate with it in order to achieve our objectives and to promote our interests as island States.112.	Finally  we must recognize what has been done in the inter-sessional period to prepare for this session by our Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  using all his patience  initiative and imagination in order to defuse situations which were sometimes judged desperate  and to ensure  on our behalf  that there is effective participation in efforts to find a solution to a number of international problems.113.	It is customary  at every session  when assessing the role of our Organization  seen as an instrument capable of adapting itself to the most varied and unexpected changes  that we should endeavour to refer to the purposes and principles of the Charter  the incantatory nature of which sometimes overwhelms us  after having very laboriously sought in the events of the past year some justification for an optimism which is becoming less and less justified.114.	However necessary these periodic exercises may be  sometimes they may make us lose sight of the fact that international life cannot be conceived in any restrictive way  and that it would even be dangerous to attempt to isolate certain specific trends simply because they serve a specific policy or make it possible to mask the failures that have been accumulated in other areas.115.	We approached the 1970s with caution  and the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations gave us an opportunity to advocate the institution of a new international society more in keeping with the ideals which had been bequeathed to us by the authors of the Charter. We refrained from indulging in over-jubilation and  after many trials  we have now reached the end of a decade which has simply resulted for many of us in the aggravation of the general state of disenchantment despite the burgeoning of activitiesâ that sometimes lead to nothing.116.	Far from playing down the success of international years which have been celebrated or the decades which we have inaugurated  we should nevertheless wish to ask whether it is not really despite the nobility of their objectives that these initiatives have simply concealed from world public opinion the impotence to which our Organization has been reduced.117.	Undoubtedly the challenges of the 1960s have accustomed us to gain confidence in ourselves  and the projections we made during that period promised that there would be prospects where the watchwords of peace  justice  liberty and progress would not be reduced to mere delusions  and that our adherence to these principles would be subordinated to events which we could not have faced up to with more determination.118.	But what has in effect occurred? We are floundering in a peace which has been sundered by limited wars  by direct and indirect aggression  the threatened use of force  state terrorism  annexationist adventures of all kinds  the denial of the rights of peoples  and the violation of the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States.119.	The reduction in the number of military alliances has been accompanied by a concentration and redeployment of strategic objectives  by a recrudescence of interventionism  by the extension and consolidation of spheres of influence and by the upward spiralling of military expenditures  thus leaving the world in a state of dangerous and uncontrollable over-armament.120.	What is worse  we consider all these phenomena as necessary evils in order to lay to rest the spectre of nuclear war  and we acquiesce in the name of a certain concept of peace in the fact that in Africa  Asia and the Middle East there are continuing explosive situations which are maintained  if not inflamed  by the imperialist Powers and interests.121.	This illusory feeling of peace has brought about detente and decentralization which ought normally to have resulted in an attenuation of conflicts and rivalries. However  through precisely the opposite process  which has been caused by the pre-eminence of certain national interests  and despite the professions of international co-operation  the normal divisions  instead of becoming blurred  have deepened or at best have shifted.122.	In point of fact  in seeking a multi-polar equilibrium  the world has become an unbalanced world which time and again has had its attention claimed by the convergence of new interests seeking recognition. A new matrix of international relations has thus emerged  but in a total confusion of values and a cynical and indistinct choice of means available.123.	The same situation can be observed in the economic field. There has been one conference after another but their results have been meagre. Progress and order have turned into disorder and disintegration  to such a point that the third world  which was simply aspiring to less dependence on external factors  is now facing an impossible choice: forcible reintegration into a system which has so frequently been denounced  or the search for a new order which for some has become a myth sustained by sentimental rhetoric.124.	The capitalist world  for its part  continues to maintain the crisis in order to ensure its orderly re-structuring of capitalism  to strengthen the imperialist division of labour  to perpetuate its economic and financial hegemony  and to increase profits the world over.125.	Where  then  are true co-operation and necessary interdependence? Is the world so doomed to injustice that we must agree not to carry out timely readjustments and simply to content ourselves with what others may condescend to offer us or to promise us? Do the proletarian nations have rights or do they have to make the power centres recognize that fact?126.	Those who warn us constantly against the dangers of confrontation should take up this challenge  because we can no longer accept a global situation characterized by the mediocrity of purported negotiations and dialogues  by the redistribution of political and economic power  while maintaining the structures of domination by the asymmetry of relations in no way conducive to the promotion of genuine international security which would cover all areas.127.	After these general remarks it is quite logical that we should continue this statement by taking up questions which are of particular interest to our continent without  as some do  claiming that they are of sole concern to us.128.	In southern Africa  despite the confusion which the gradualist policies of the western Powers have created  for us the situation has always been quite clear- cut. On the one hand we have the survival of a regime which is a genuine insult to human intelligence  a regime which is surrounded by dominions which it keeps hostage  where are professed the virtues of a so-called outmoded coexistence through which opportunist puppets get rich. On the other hand  we see a growing strength in the liberation movements which the imagination and ethnocentrism of the Western Powers tries to pit against one another  but which continue none the less to benefit from the unconditional support of militant Africa.129.	We have denounced the inconsistency and collusion of the Western Powers  but they do not seem to care  perhaps because one more denunciation does not make that much difference. Instead of Chapter VIIâ which has become inapplicable  because the Pretoria regime cannot be considered by some as an ""enemy"" within the meaning of the Charterâwe are offered plans  programmes and conferences which have been manipulated in advance so as to safeguard interests which will ultimately be condemned.130.	The Namibian people  which the Westerners still treat with benevolent neglect  cannot decide their future without the capitalists and racists making their claims heard  thus making any solution subordinate to their desire for domination and exploitation. The United Nations itself  which has embarked upon the perilous path of negotiations  is bereft of authority  and everything seems to depend on a certain demilitarization  as if this were some kind of kriegspiel of the past that is being played out  while people ignore the legitimate struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of SWAPO.131.	Unreality has reached its zenith in Zimbabwe  because the power given to the renegades of Salisbury is unreal. Maintaining the fiction of multiracialism  which has been a failure for 20 years  if not longer  is unreal. The problem is not simply the fact that a constitution has been drawn up which takes no account of the existence of a new attitude and an environment that is no longer colonial. The Patriotic Front has its demands  and the sacrifices the Front  African solidarity  and especially the front-line States have made over the last eight years will not allow it to cast doubt on the main objective  namely  genuine independence in which a majority will not be held hostage by a minority even for a moment.132.	In a different political and geographical context  we have witnessed  almost impassively  the tragedy that has been visited upon the Saharan people  a pawn in the game of influence and interests played by Powers outside Africa. That people has been claimed as the possession of both sides and its territory has been constantly usurped. Self-determination has been flouted in the name of an ill-defined territorial integrity and an international law which is no longer valid  since the Madrid agreement has fallen by the wayside after its de facto denunciation by Mauritania and its violation pure and simple as a result of Morocco's annexation of the southern part of the Territory. The Democratic Republic of Madagascar condemns the illegal occupation of Western Sahara by Morocco  whose annexationist designs and expansionist plans are not likely to re-establish very quickly the climate of confidence and co-operation so vital to that part of Africa.133.	Turning from southern Africa to the Middle East  we recognize practically the same problems  the same facts  the same attitudes and the same whimsical desire to impose on a people solutions that are inspired by a determination to ensure global domination at all costs.134.	Like the peoples of South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe  the Palestinian people demand recognition and respect for their identity and aspirations in a well- determined context. The United Nations has endorsed those just claims  but the fact that one or two States  with their allies whose ranks are becoming ever thinner  stubbornly refuse to recognize those realities is not something that should prevent us from breaking the vicious circle of isolation and ostracism which surrounds the PLO  or from reaffirming all those principles contained in the programme of action designed to implement the rights of the Palestinians and to give priority to the Palestinian question in any consideration of the over-all situation in the Middle East.135.	But  as a result of the Camp David agreements and the Israeli-Egyptian treaty  those rights have been reduced to the hypothetical enjoyment of an ill-defined autonomy. Even the colonialists at the beginning of the century did not go that far in their retrograde policy. How can we therefore fail to condemn the separate and partial treaty which was the outcome of the Camp David agreements and which deals so cavalierly with the Palestinians? How can we accept that the future of a region which is so vital for international peace and security should be left to the whim of one  two or three States which vie with each other in finding ingenious ways to control it politically  economically and militarily? How can we endorse the tripartite plot and the betrayal of which the Palestinian people have been the victim? And  finally  how can we still let people believe that a peace process has been initiated at a time when the end-result of that so-called peace has simply been the negation of the Palestinian nation and increased Israeli arrogance  aggression and extortion of Arab land  particularly in the southern part of Lebanon? There can be no simple solutions for settling the Palestinian and Middle East problems; but  at least  a little more equality and sense of responsibility before history should enter into whatever action is undertaken.136.	We could collectively have exercised that responsibility before history last week when we took up one aspect of the situation in South-East Asia. Excessive insistence on principles  which in the final analysis simply amounts to interference in the conduct of bilateral relations between sovereign States and in the choice that a people makes of its own political  economic and social system  has led us down a path when it will be even more difficult for the United Nations to give proper co-operation and assistance to the Khmer people and bring about a solution of the situation in Kampuchea. Everything seems to indicate that the previous outright condemnations have been followed up by gestures of political appeasement explained away as legal constraints. In our naivete  we believed that this somewhat cynical game belonged to a different era.137.	We would hasten to emphasize that  as a matter of principle  the Democratic Republic of Madagascar recognizes not governments but States. Nevertheless  in our relations with any particular Government we must be mindful of three classic criteria  namely  control of the territory  the loyalty of the people and the exercise of political power. As a matter of principle also  it is our hope that the disputes which may arise between States in South-East Asia will be settled  above all  by negotiation and conciliation  if only in the name of the struggle which their peoples have constantly waged against colonialism and imperialism.138.	The final point that we should like to raise in this consideration of specific situations relates to the Korean peninsula. Despite the efforts made by the United Nations and despite the fact that for seven years now we have had before us a joint communiquÃ© which could have served as a reasonable basis for a lasting settlement  two essential problems remain: the withdrawal of foreign troops from the peninsula and the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean homeland.139.	Electoral promises were made three years ago regarding the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. That represented a very encouraging commitment; but  unfortunately  those promises have been belied by subsequent facts  to such a point that South Korea has become a vast American aero-naval base  which is supplied with the most sophisticated arms and even nuclear weapons.140.	Equally  reunification  which was the subject at that time of proposals that took into account the political realities prevailing in both parts of Korea  was downgraded when it was made subordinate to the initiation of tripartite ""talks"" that were then extended to the point where they altered the bilateral Armistice Agreement which was signed on behalf of the United Nations. 141.	We vigorously denounce that anachronistic desire to create a state of cold war in the Korean peninsula at a time when other people are preaching detente and normalization. We cannot agree that the Korean people should continue to be the victim of out-and-out interference and subject to an aggressive and permanent threat.142.	The situations which we have just described have been engendered  maintained and magnified in spite of our efforts  in the name of those realities which are a reflection of the diversity of our world  and also because of our inability to provide a global basis for peace  and to preserve and reinforce it. The machinery which is provided for this purpose by the Charter has never been completely or effectively utilized  and the alternative system  which is centred on the Security Council  has yielded only relative results  allowing conflicts and tensions to develop at the whim of our indecision and or commitments which are incompatible with collective responsibility.143.	Furthermore  the hindrances to the normal functioning of the Security Council  such as the abusive use of the veto or efforts to produce a consensus more formal than political  have undermined the authority and credibility of our Organization and given a chancy and even discriminatory character to the way in which the provisions of the Charter concerning the maintenance of peace are applied.144.	Therefore  we have to provide  and even devise  machinery which is more adequate  which will make it possible for us to impose respect for our principles  and which will lead States to make their conduct subject to the provisions of the Charter and to settle disputes in a peaceful way according to established procedures.145.	We must make the best possible use of the institutions available to us  adapting  reforming and transforming them  and we are among those countries which attach the highest importance to the work of the Committee entrusted with the revision of the Charter. However  this exercise would be pointless if it were not accompanied by a change in thinking  if we continued to equate peace with the mere absence of conflict  and if we did not adopt a more positive and active approach to it.146.	This is indeed our conviction. It is also the main message which emerged from the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  during which a number of measures were proposed or reiterated to strengthen international peace and security. Among these measures was that of making of the Indian Ocean a zone of genuine peace 147.	The creation of this zone of peace should normally be the result of compatible interests on the part of the countries in the region  those that fear for the security of their supply routes  and those that feel that that part of their territory which is adjacent to the Indian Ocean is threatened. No progress can be achieved  however  if some seek to arrogate to themselves the rights and privileges of international policemen. We cannot acquiesce in accepting this  and we shall not rest until all foreign military bases are dismantled and until all foreign military presence in the Indian Ocean is removed.148.	The way to the demilitarization and the denuclearization of the Indian Oceanâin other words to the full implementation of the principles and objectives of resolution 2832 (XXVI)âis long and arduous. But a new stage was indeed reached at the recent Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean. A Final Document was drawn up which set forth the implications of the concept of such a zone of peace as well as the obligations of each category of States concerned.149.	The participation in that Meeting as observers of the permanent members of the Security Council and the main maritime users was significant  and it encouraged us to propose at the present session of the General Assembly that a conference on the Indian Ocean should be convened if possible before the holding of the next special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament.150.	This still remains our attitude despite the vicissitudes which have marked the bilateral negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. It is still our position because it is based on the pre-eminent value of collective action and of equitable co-operation  which should be a feature of our common enterprises.151.	The machinery which was set up after the tenth special session of the General Assembly  devoted to disarmament  is designed in the same spirit and is aimed at promoting the role of our Organization as a centre for study  negotiation and action in an area in which in principle it holds the main responsibility. It is possible that it is not perfect  but at least it has the merit of responding to most of our desires and taking account of realities  such as the existence and continuance of bilateral negotiations between certain nuclear States.152.	In this connexion  we welcome the conclusion of the Treaty reached at the conclusion of the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT]  which  inter alia  will make possible the entry into more decisive stages of the reduction of strategic weapons and the taking of genuine disarmament measures. Indeed  such agreements should be seen as part and parcel of the objectives which we have laid down in our desire to achieve not only general and complete disarmament but also concerted and orderly disarmament.153.	We shall not rehearse the problems with which we have been dealing for 20 years  nor shall we go into the priorities which have been established in the overall disarmament programme adopted by consensus. Now  as was emphasized by the Group of 2 at the end of the session of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva "" we must go beyond the stage of general discussions and take up genuine negotiations. We share the concern of that group at the lack of real progress on the main items on the Committee's agenda  whether relating to nuclear disarmament  to the general prohibition of nuclear tests or to international arrange merits guaranteeing the security of non-nuclear States.154.	On all these points States must demonstrate a genuine political will. They should also establish and reinforce a climate of trust among themselves; otherwise it will not be possible to have valid negotiations. Finally  they must all be convinced of the importance of disarmament in order to usher in a new international order which will make it possible for all peoples to pursue their economic and social development in full liberty and security.155.	In the economic field  it would be somewhat tiring for us to formulate and rehearse in detail the concerted positions of the Group of 77 and every session of UNCTAD  in the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 and then in the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy. Every thing is happening as if the art of the negotiator should be confined to drawing up documents without practical scope but likely to satisfy the sporadic objections of the developed market-economy countries.156.	The latter countries have shown no essential initiative and have made no critical analysis of the economic system; nor have they made any proposals  except those designed to bring about a rebalancing of the forces in the capitalist camp or to meet the threats they perceive to their supplies of raw materials and energy products. To illustrate what we have just advanced  all we have to do is to refer to the multilateral trade negotiations and to the problem of energy.157.	The Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT has given the group B countries one more opportunity to settle certain questions which have arisen from changes in their competitive positions  and the agreements which were initialled in Geneva simply formalize the measure of agreement reached among them. It was not thought important that the subjects regarded as essential by the developing countries should not have been dealt with or should have been dealt with inadequately. The same is true of the maintenance of certain quota systems and the introduction into the safeguards code of a selective clause making it possible for certain countries to be treated in a discriminatory way.158.	On the energy problem  responsibility for which it is sought to lay at the door of a certain group of countries  it is not up to us to leap to the defence of these countries since they are exercising in a sovereign way their right to pursue a policy of sale  control and management in conformity with their interests. But we will continue to maintain that  despite the urgency which the developed countries attach to it  the subject of petroleum is inseparable from the over-all problem of commodities and raw materials. To attempt to establish any kind of hierarchy in this connexion which would favour the interests of the industrialized countries would be  to say the least  unfair.159.	Furthermore  the problems of supply and the need to stabilize petrol consumption are felt in different ways by countries according to their levels of development and the resources available to them. Their common concerns can therefore be focused only on the price of this product  and it is not certain that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is solely responsible for this. Let us rather say that the increase in petroleum prices is being maintained and encouraged by those who allow the dollar to devalue so as to boost their own synthetic petroleum industry  thereby strengthening their supremacy in the fields of energy  industry and technology.160.	Furthermore  this is not a question of ascertaining whether the developing countries are the only principal losers. In any case  they are the losers and grow poorer still whenever they have to export more and more local products in order to obtain the same equipment and products from abroad. And they grow poorer more especially since they cannot bring about an increase in their productivity that is equal to or higher than the rate of exported inflation and hence able to compensate for its effects.161.	It is therefore not surprising that we question the powers held by those who  deliberately or inadvertently  are adapting themselves to the present chaos  are opposed to price indexing for primary commodities and are hindering the realization of the objectives set for the industrialization of the countries of the third world by multiplying protectionist measures and by strengthening their control  if not their monopoly  over technology.162.	Who is it in fact that is preaching to us gradualism and patience because the Western economies are going through one of the gravest crises in their history? Who is it that is deciding that public aid to development  which has already been cut by inflation  must be reduced or at best maintained at its present inadequate level and at the same time insisting that the national defence budgets of a group of countries be increased  not by 3 per cent  but by 5 per cent in real terms? Who is it that is praising the virtues of free enterprise but at the same time masking the reprehensible dealings of the transnational corporations  completely absorbed as they are in pocketing the super-profits being repatriated by the latter?163.	They are the same circles which  despite their skill in forecasting and their sophisticated instruments of analysis  have not hitherto demonstrated that they are capable of understanding the nature  scope and urgency of our needs or the development requirements of the countries of the third world  which require radical reforms not always subjected to the laws of the market alone.164.	The fifth session of UNCTAD  which was the first international conference that specifically studied the problem of structural changes by dealing with trade and monetary  financial and technological questions as a whole and in a correlated way  resulted in failure  for which we are far from being responsible. Consistent with the policy which we have adopted since the sixth special session of the General Assembly  we merely wanted to study thoroughly and further spell out the concept of interdependence and promote the positive evolution of the rules and principles governing international economic relations.165.	We hope that  in view of their importance  these problems will be at the centre of the global negotiations proposed by the Group of 77 which are to take place during the special session in 1980. We wish to recall in this connexion that the resolution adopted by the non- aligned countries in Havana  which was introduced by our group in the Committee of the Whole  emphasizes that"" . . .the establishment of the New International Economic Order. .   demands new concrete and global solutions and cannot be brought about by piecemeal reforms and improvisations intended to resolve the present economic difficulties"" 166.	It is in the light of that that we subscribe to the following three series of measures: first  a readjustment of world production  consumption and exchange structures  which implies a rethinking of the imperialist division of labour  the dismantling of industrial monopolies and the jettisoning of the concept of an integrated programme of commodities; secondly  the reform of the institutional framework as well as the rules and principles governing trade and technological  monetary and financial flows with a view to their democratization and an equitable sharing of rights and obligations; and  thirdly  the organizing of the third world  on the basis of this reform and this readjustment  so as to ensure its collective autonomy  which should not be a simple closed-circuit growth formula  promote co-operation among the countries of the third world  enhance their potential and increase their power of action and negotiation.167.	The establishment of the new international economic order will undoubtedly encounter resistance  entrenched arguments and negative reflexes. We all profess our attachment to international co-operation. We have all pledged ourselves to have recourse to international institutions in order to promote economic and social progress for all peoples. This tenuous and theoretic link  which nevertheless is based on good faith  can be further strengthened. It will not hold up for long if some come here not so much to negotiate as to listen to complaints  not so much to consider reforms that are required as to defend the status quo.168.	The rigorous analysis which we have made of certain negative aspects of international relations  at a time when we are called upon to negotiate conditions for our interdependence in all fields  should not be interpreted as a refusal on our part to shoulder our responsibilities in this Organization. The fact that we have chosen confrontation in the realm of ideas in no way means that we have given up the idea of having recourse to a universal and equitable dialogue and seeking solutions in keeping with the interests of our peoples.169.	Indeed  whichever way we turn  however we take up and deal with these problems and no matter how severe are our judgements  we cannot deny what is obvious: the need to bring our differences before this Organization in order the better to understand them and determine to what extent they can help us to adapt ourselves to the profound changes in the world. One approach is as good as another  and it would be pointless at this level to try in any way to circumscribe the scope of our debates in the name of realism and pragmatism or to ignore existing relationships of force.170.	Our concerns are not necessarily the same  our methods are manifestly different and our priorities are far from coinciding. Nevertheless  it remains true that the present political and economic crisis has evoked in all of us the same feelings of uncertainty  frustration and disquiet  to such a point that we are condemned to find together  and above all within the framework of the United Nations  the ways and means to get out of the deadlock which has been brought about by years of lack of understanding  claims and selfish practices.171.	In our opinion  any solution should originate at the United Nations  from our principles and purposes  if we wish to overcome the ambiguities which have been engendered by partial approaches and give our thinking and our actions a generally acceptable content. At the same time  it is up to us to see to it that the commitments undertaken at this level are not designed to conceal from international public opinion a deliberate desire to repeat the errors of the past. We call for a new order  which in its turn requires that all States adhere to a new morality  and it is in this way that we can really take up the challenge of the 1980s."
"84",4469,"MDV",34,1979,"ï»¿I wish to extend to the President my delegation's sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to his high office in this Assembly. His election not only represents a well-deserved tribute to him personally as a distinguished diplomat with a long association with the United Nations  but also to his country  the United Republic of Tanzania  which in the past has played a significant role in the promotion of the aspirations of the peoples of the third world  and Africa in particular  in the international arena. My delegation is confident that his vast experience in the work of the United Nations will provide him with clear insight and guidance in the proceedings of this important session of the General Assembly. We pledge to the President our full co-operation in making our deliberations a success.205.	I also wish to express our deep appreciation to the President's predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  who presided over the thirty-third session  for the efficient and dedicated manner in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly  which won him our admiration and great support.206.	I also take this opportunity to extend to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  our sincere gratitude for his unremitting efforts to promote peace and international understanding and to thank him for his most comprehensive report in which he evaluated the work of the Organization giving us the guidelines and the hopes for a better accomplishment of the objectives and the ideals of this Organization  and the realization of a better life  based on justice and freedom for the millions of people who are plagued by poverty  hunger  disease  aggression  oppression and subjugation.207.	My delegation is extremely happy to see our Organization grow every year  enabling us to achieve our objective of the much desired universality of our community. We are particularly pleased this year to welcome to our midst Saint Lucia  a small country like ours  which has determined to come forward and share the responsibility for world peace and justice in accordance with its means  and to express the will of an independent nation contributing to the progress of mankind as a whole.208.	While focusing our attention on the issues and problems included in the agenda of this session  we are conscious of the grim background of increasing political and economic tension in the present world  which could have negative effects and might even frustrate our unceasing efforts to formulate the process of establishing a new pattern of international relations based on friendship  mutual respect and peaceful coexistence  and a more equitable infrastructure for international co-operation. In this context it is heartening for us to see that  despite severe constraints  sustained and determined efforts are being made to respond to the aspirations and hopes for the establishment of a new international economic order.209.	My delegation is confident that this Organization  with its lofty objectives which no one can dispute  will be able to stand up firmly and victoriously to the challenges that mankind faces today  as it has done before. We remain more than ever convinced that this great Organization will continue to justify the hopes and expectations of mankind for peace  security  progress and prosperity  even though all forms of colonialism  imperialism and racial discrimination are putting up a fierce struggle before their death. We are confident that this great community of nations of the world can and will uphold the great principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. For our part  in all humility  we pledge our support to all efforts aimed at achieving the noble objectives of this Assembly.210.	Maldives continues to be guided by the policy of non-alignment and has always endeavoured humbly to contribute its modest share in order to strengthen the unity and character of the non-aligned movement in a sincere desire for international peace  friendship and co-operation. We fully support the concept of establishing zones of peace in different parts of the world  trustingâand convincedâthat such achievements will constitute a major contribution to the consolidation and preservation of global peace and security.211.	Turning to our region of the world  I confirm our full endorsement of the proposal to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  not only because of our strong opposition to the existence in our part of the world of foreign military bases and facilitiesâor to a foreign military presence in the context of great-Power rivalryâbut also because of our awareness of increasing tension there. This situation forces us to divert our attention to  and exhaust our energy and resources on  progressively greater security measures  while the promotion of the welfare of our people most urgently requires our unimpaired efforts and every available resource.212.	We welcome the outcome of the Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean  held at Headquarters from 2 to 13 July  and we look forward with great hope to a United Nations conference on the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. In this connexion  we appeal to the major Powers of the world to co-operate sincerely with the littoral and hinterland States  so that our peoples' aspirations to peace  stability and progress may be realized.213.	We firmly support the initiatives and efforts sponsored by the United Nations seeking to bring about world disarmament. We remain convinced that disarmament can never be a reality until the production and sale of all conventional weapons are brought under control.214.	As a small and unarmed country  we always look forward with hope and confidence to a positive and favourable outcome of the disarmament negotiations at various levels. We were greatly encouraged to see the birth and maturity of a second treaty on the limitation of strategic arms between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although we share the view of many others in this Assembly that the second SALT Treaty has not solved the problem of the reduction of nuclear arsenals and of the development of more destructive weapons to the extent desired  we feel that it is a positive step towards the realization of the cherished hope of the entire human race. We fervently trust that this step will pave the way to the achievement of eventual genuine disarmament.215.	We in Maldives are very distressed at the turn of events in the Middle East. We find that the aggressor  backed by international Zionism  flagrantly and persistently refuses to bow to the demands of justice and human values. Instead of finding a solution to the grave dilemma of a people who have been subjected to untold misery  humiliation  expulsion from their homeland and extermination  and instead of finding a solution to a situation created by aggression and occupation by force  we find that the atrocities and the inhuman treatment of the people of Palestine are being continued by the Israelis  and that the lands illegally occupied by force are being destroyed and distributed among the population of the invader. This great international community condemns those atrocities and aggression and deplores the occupation. While we in the United Nations adopt resolutions expressing the feelings and decisions of this community  the situation deteriorates further by reasons of the encouragement given the Israelis under the provisions of the Camp David agreements  which in the first instance appeared to be a bold initiative to find a lasting solution to the Middle East problem. But because the framework of peace envisaged by that approach did not contain a solution to the heart of the problem  namely  the attainment of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State  as expressed clearly by the Palestinians themselves and by the vast majority of the international community  the Camp David agreements have turned out to be not only an abortive act  but also a source of serious damage to the cause of justice  freedom and international peace  contrary to the notion entertained by its optimistic advocates. 216.	Israel's practices clearly show that it is bent on territorial expansion and not interested in peace. This has been demonstrated clearly by the Israelis' recent activities in establishing new settlements in the occupied territories and their persistent refusal to accommodate a comprehensive solution through the denial of the rights of the Palestinian people  the legitimate owners of the land.217.	We all agree that the settlement of the Middle East question cannot be achieved through resolutions which do not embody a settlement of the problem of the Palestinian people. Nor could it be achieved through any partial solutions which meet the interest of only an individual country or the views of a particular group of people. We are convinced that peace  security and stability will not be attained in the Middle East or  in fact  even in the whole world unless there is a just and comprehensive solution of the Palestinian problem which ensures the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to establish a State of their own on their national soil. Any deliberations aimed at the fulfilment of this objective must be conducted in consultation with  and involving fully  the Palestinian people themselves  represented by the PLO  which we all recognize as their legitimate and authentic representatives. We also reiterate that any settlement that does not lead to the restoration of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty  in the custody of the Moslem world as it always has been  is totally unacceptable. The question of Jerusalem is for many of us here more than a question of a part of the occupied territories; it is also one of historical facts  prestige and security for the believers and worshippers of three great religions. The solution itself should be a comprehensive one in the sense that it should lead to the complete withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all Arab lands  the return of Jerusalem to Arab custody and the fulfilment of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination.218.	We fully endorse and support the resolutions adopted by the United Nations on the question of the Middle East  which are truly an expression of world opinion. We also endorse what has been declared by the Heads of State of the non-aligned countries in their recent Conference in Havana and join the other countries in the third world in rejecting all attempts being made to jeopardize the deliberations of this international community for the purpose of finding a lasting solution to this great problem.219.	Over the past few months South-East Asia has been in the limelight as a tragically troubled area of the world. I do not believe that it is necessary for me to go into the details of this unfortunate situation. However  my delegation views it with serious concern  for we believe in absolute freedom for the people of any country to decide and resolve their own political issues without any foreign military intervention. We must recognize the principle of respect for the independence of all the States in any region and the sovereign rights of all States to define their national policies. States must be left alone to solve their own problems in accordance with their aspirations and national interests.220.	Resort to military intervention by one country in the affairs of another inevitably increases international tension  endangers the security and the independence of the peoples of the region  and carries with it the added grave danger of impairing international peace and security. Such interference makes it impossible to build a strong and vibrant region whose States and their Governments can devote their efforts to the economic development of their respective peoples. We cannot condone the imposition of foreign will on any sovereign State by military intervention. And we must not allow such situations of the violation of the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States to become precedents in this great Organization.221.	We believe that one of the most pressing issues on which we should have consultations and reach agreement is the elimination of the remnants of colonialism  particularly in Africa. I do not intend to repeat at length the details that have already been stated here by the representatives of so many peace-loving nations on the subject of southern Africa. But it is evident that the question of southern Africa remains one of the most serious issues which the world community has faced up to now. It constitutes a challenge by a minority regime with a record of continued open and flagrant violations of all human values by subjecting the majority of the South African people to untold forms of humiliation  repression  torture and even murder. The situation is a continuation of colonial interests and racist ambitions. We wish to reiterate our continued support of all measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination and oppression and we shall continue to abide by the universally accepted measures of sanctions against the racist minority regimes of southern Africa.222.	In observing the International Anti-Apartheid Year Maldives joins those who struggle to eliminate the scourge of apartheid  a crime against humanity and a defiance of the conscience- and dignity of mankind. We express our opposition to all policies of apartheid and to the continuation of all forms of colonialism.223.	Namibia is a characteristic example of injustice which remains resistant to the human conscience and the demands of the civilized world. The case itself stands as a symbol of the failure of the collective will of our community to apply adequate measures for the implementation of what we resolve and to act with more determination against the regimes which pursue the policies of racism and apartheid. Maldives will continue its consistent support for the just struggle of the Namibian people under the leadership of their national liberation movement  SWAPO  until total liberation and the independence of Namibia as a whole is achieved. In this respect I wish to reiterate our opposition to and condemnation of South Africa's efforts to annex Walvis Bay in clear violation of international law  the Charter of the United Nations and  particularly  Security Council resolution 385 (1976). We also stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe and with the leaders of the Patriotic Front in their struggle for genuine majority rule and true independence. The recent developments regarding the issue of Zimbabwe both at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka and the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London have strengthened our hopes that the prospects for a negotiated peaceful solution of the problem have not yet been exhausted.224.	Maldives  whose main industry is fishing  is relieved to note that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea approved  during its last summer session  a programme of work which provides for the adoption of a new and comprehensive convention on the law of the sea next year. My delegation wishes to express its appreciation for that significant decision. Such a convention will enable us to initiate the exploitation of deep-sea resources. We hope that the ninth session  which is scheduled for next year here in New York  will complete the negotiations  despite the fact that the eighth session did not achieve its goal of finalizing a formal text.225.	As we focus our attention on a new development decade  it is essential that we have a clear perception of the great disparities that exist between the so-called developed and the developing countries. The economically advanced countries have a very apparent stranglehold on the resources of the world; and  unless some meaningful results emerge from the North-South dialogue  it will not be possible for us to evolve a viable and dependable infrastructure on which to base our hopes for a new system of world economy. The developments of the past few years have shown us very clearly that the protectionism and monopoly exercised by the developed countries will not assist anyone to find a solution to the profound crisis of the international economic system that we face today. This instability results in the building up of political tensions throughout the world  often leading to catastrophic results.226.	In spite of sustained efforts in the various forums of the United Nations to evolve structural changes in the world economic order during the past several years  it is most disheartening to see that no real progress has been achieved. That is due  mainly  to alack of political will on the part of some of the most developed and advanced countries of the world. It is in the face of such critical and adverse developments that we now have to seek new initiatives and approaches in order to achieve solid and practical results  aimed at long-term solutions of common interest  in the relentless endeavours for the establishment of the basic infrastructure of the new international economic order.227.	In this connexion  we must all bear in mind that the world economy today does not provide for economically independent units  either on a regional or on a global basis. The world has become extremely interdependent. Thus  if the developing countries are ever to succeed in their search for a more equitable economic system  those countries that are most developed industrially and technologically  and thus possess the greatest economic and financial potentials  must demonstrate more positively their willingness to co-operate with the developing countries.228.	We sincerely feel that the decision of the Group of 77 to initiate sustained negotiations on international co-operation for development at the special session of the General Assembly in 1980 is a novel and bold initiative in an effort to overcome the present stalemate in the North-South dialogue.229.	While we are in the process of formulating new ideas  plans and strategies towards a new global system of economic relations  I feel I should mention for the record that the situation  particularly in the least developed countries  needs special consideration by virtue of the fact that there is an extreme dearth of natural resources to exploit. I have no doubt that the situation in the least developed countries is receiving due attention from the appropriate organs both in this Organization and in other international forums.230. In conclusion  I should like to reaffirm our faith and trust in this Organization as the most effective instrument for the peace  progress and prosperity of mankind. For this reason my country is determined to enhance the scope of its modest contributions and cooperation in the work of the United Nations.231. Quite undeniably  we are bound by constraints. However  our aspirations encourage us to make renewed efforts in our search for greater means to extend more support to the efforts of the United Nations in its search for a more peaceful  more just and better world for the generations to come. We are determined to do this because we believe that the effectiveness and the strength of the United Nations as a universal instrument to better the prospect of man lie in the extent of the sincerity of every one of its Members and their devotion to the noble principles and objectives enshrined in its Charter."
"85",4515,"MEX",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is significant and encouraging that we have an outstanding African personality presiding over our debates  in well-deserved recognition of the honourable and consistent role that has been played on the international scene by his country  the United Republic of Tanzania.3.	We recognize  too  the dedication the Secretary- General has shown  and the great effort he has made in carrying out the functions of his position against the backdrop of the controversial happenings of our times.4.	I have said on another occasion that in this world of inequalities and contrasts  North-South and East-West tensions and pressures are crucifying a substantial portion of mankind.5.	In 1973  the disorder of the world economy culminated dramatically in the conflicts marking the availability and real price of hydrocarbons  which in turn had a direct or indirect effect on that long-standing disorder by giving rise to generalized energy problems and thereby affecting the well-being  the development prospects  the standard of living and even the very survival of nations.6.	For 7 000 years peoples have inhabited this earth  and throughout our existence our history has been marked by the search for a common denominator that would identify  bind and unite us all.7.	Our present circumstances seem to indicate that that unifying element  in connexion with which all of us have a responsibility  may well be the lack of energy sources.8.	The energy crisis exists; it is an actual fact. We are witnesses to an obligatory transition period in the world energy situation. We can be authors of that change  and channel it  or we can be simple spectators  and become its victims.9.	Unless we make a timely effort to define our reality as the problem it is  the transition could become a conflagration  perhaps the most violent in all history.10.	Beginning during the final third of this twentieth century  it is a transformation whose duration  scope and consequences have yet to make themselves known. As a result  the cost of adjusting our economy  science  techniques and political determination will be high.11.	Let us be fully conscious of this in order to under-stand what is happening. Within a few decades  the age of petroleum as a major basic fuel will come to an end. We have reached a watershed between two different eras in the life of mankind.12.	We are the protagonists in that mutation process  which involves both danger and opportunity. That is why we speak of crisis  and not yet of catastrophe.13.	It may be the beginning of a new era. It may be the end of them all.14.	If we are to set our course  find the rhythm of our stroke and move ahead  the truly important thing is to seek not culprits  but responsible men; not to accuse  but to explain; not to vanquish  but to convince.15.	Let us develop a consciousness that is based on rational thought  the gift that is ours alone among all earth's species. Of them all  we are the only beings capable of programming and premeditating our actions. Let us use those abilities to overcome instincts  fear and mistrust  and turn them into determination and reason.		16.	Paradoxically  advances in knowledge and ways of doing things are sometimes dehumanizing and do not always contribute to civilization. Zones or groups appear in which simple realities become vital ones  and even the powerful countries run the risk of relapsing into under-development.17.	Energy has now enabled us to travel at supersonic speeds and to receive communications at the speed of light.18.	Thus  we have shortened distances and accelerated time; but also  where many people today are concerned  we have halted the course of historical time and broadened social gaps. There is a dramatic dualism between our conquering space and reaching other planets and the continued existence  on our own  of stone-age hunger and insecurity; on the one hand  we see what we can be and  on the other  what we really are. Overcoming that dualism is a basic imperative of justice  and will be feasible if we prove ourselves capable of making reasonable use of the opportunity offered us by the existence of a non-renewable resource while it still lasts.19.	Let us base our relations on what we have in common  and use the differences among us to enrich our analysis. Let us make those relations lasting by basing them on mutual benefit and reciprocal respect. Let us shape our behaviour to the circumstances involved. We cannot extend equal treatment to those who are in unequal conditions. Let us treat others as we would be treated ourselves.20.	No country on earth is entirely self-sufficient. We all have need of the others.21.	The surplus earnings of wealthy  industrialized or petroleum-producing countries become the deficits of the weaker economies  and sooner and later have a backlash and a damaging effect on their own cause.22.	We may distinguish five basic types of conditions as a means of grouping the different countries: those which are large-scale producers and at the same time exporters of petroleum  almost all of them developing nations; those which are producers and importers and have attained a high or medium level of economic development that provides them with the resources they must have to cover their remaining needs  in spite of price rises; those with a relatively low level of development which produce but must also import  and to do so confront the difficulties involved in acquiring foreign petroleum without cancelling economic and social projects of national benefit; those which are importers only  have attained high or medium levels of development and have been able to adjust their growth to their energy needs; and those which are not only exclusively importers but are also under-developed  and must therefore make enormous sacrifices  even where essential national projects are involved  to obtain the petroleum and petroleum derivatives they need.23.	From another point of view  it should also be remembered that the industrialized  market-economy countries absorb 60 per cent of all the energy produced in the world. With less than one fifth of the world's population  they consume two out of every three barrels of petroleum produced.24.	In that context  we might ask ourselves the following questions: How much longer will we be able to keep the world moving at its present rate with our available sources of energy? At what cost? To what end? And for whose benefit? How and when can we and must we find substitutes for our present sources of energy?25.	I prefer not to mention the ideological or political aspects which would add to the complexity of approaches to the problem. I want to speak only of the facts  to say things that have been said beforeâthings that  in one way or another  everyone thinks or knows. I trust I shall be saying nothing new. It would be grave indeed if at this point in the crisis there were still something new to be said.26.	We must race against time to find new solutions before our present sources run out. Let us place a proper value on what we have  before we lose it.27.	An extravagant and wasteful use of petroleum was made in the decades when its price was low; it was only when prices were raised in order to revalue this resource that efforts to develop alternate sources began For the most part  it has been used as a fuel. That period will be branded with the stigma of folly  for having burned petroleum that could have been turned into food-stuffs and petrochemical products of prodigious benefit to the whole of mankind.28.	We have turned the petroleum industry into a gigantic mechanism for producing profits and tax revenue to meet urgent short-term needs.29.	We had forgotten the importance of the future  which in recent years has become a drastic present! What is in short supply becomes expensive. What then  is the price of a commodity whose supply is running out? What is the price of that which no longer exists?30.	The countries that produce petroleumâa non-renewable resource and one that for many countries represents the sole resource provided them by nature- want to invest in ways that will permanently ensure their future. Now organized  they are for the first time successfully defending and revaluing a raw material  They attribute the escalation of prices to monetary and trade disorders and to the ensuing devaluation of foreign exchange  and refuse to discuss oil prices alone  outside the context of a complete new international order.31.	The industrialized countries feel they are being victimized by the petroleum-producing countries  which they accuse of being responsible for inflation and recession. Not yet fully organized themselves  and as consumers par excellence  they collectively follow a system of circumstantial and therefore fleeting rationalization; they draft unilateral policies designed to reduce their dependence and consumerism  and they insist on discussing the price of crude oil exclusively without considering other questions of vital importance to all.32.	The poor countriesâthose without oil  dependent  coerced and sometimes distressed; those without the ability of the wealthy countries to transfer the impact of oil prices to their exports  since these consist solely of under-priced raw materialsâare forced to import everything from energy to inflation and recession. They see with despair that  despite the noble and singular  albeit insufficient  efforts of the organized petroleum-producing countries  petrodollars continue to be recycled in the powerful economies.33.	The developing world's joint strategy for enhancing the value of all its raw materials runs the risk of being divided since  to date  although oil has itself been revalued this has not served to trigger a proper revaluation of other raw materials. We must take care to preserve the unity that was achieved with such difficulty.34.	Hydrocarbon prices cannot be considered a matter for bargaining and for a testing of strength between producers and consumers  particularly when their respective positions are made more extreme by the intervention of other  generally transnational structures  many of which no longer recognize any home country and consequently acknowledge neither social obligations nor political solidarity. Let us reconcile conscience and national values with the interests of fertile and harmonious internationalism.35.	Conflicts of interests among countries must be resolved not through the annihilation but rather through the dialectical integration of such opposing interests.36.	What is not foreseen becomes a problem. Problems that are not solved accumulate  and accumulated problems discourage evolution and foreclose possibilities of development.37.	In order to avoid being overtaken by events  and as a means of facing the challenges that clearly loom before us  we must not wait until crisis compels us to take hasty  piecemeal decisions and then find ourselves bound to those that outweigh the rest by reason of the force  and not the right  they represent.38.	Men are dying today. Let us not offer remedies for tomorrow. In the face of harsh reality  let us not propose idealized stoicism; in the face of true but difficult roads  artificial  dead-end labyrinths; in the face of concrete obstacles  would-be short cuts; in the face of hard-tip-overcome lethargy  ephemeral and selfish solutions; in the face of sound arguments  threats and lies; in the face of the power of intelligence  the brute force of arms; nor  in the face of problems shared by all  partial  bilateral or bloc solutions. We would make little progress if we allowed ourselves to be caught up in the illusory reflections of such a mirror game.39.	It would be inexcusable if  in full knowledge of the trends and their implications  we were to fail to take decisions leading to appropriate solutions that will keep the threat of a bitter and conflict-ridden future from becoming an irreparable present.40.	We cannot openly sustain high expectations while concealing evil intentions  for to- do so would be to offend justice with irrational acts that would abolish hope and dignity for many millions of human beings.41.	On the basis of those premises  we fully identify with the countries that are struggling to revalue their raw materials. We share the interests of the petroleum- producing countries  but we also realize that it is essential to dismantle a bogged-down system that works to the detriment of all. We are irrevocably pledged to the principles of self-determination  non-intervention  the peaceful solution of controversies  the economic rights and duties of nations  and solidarity  which are the guidelines of our international conduct. That is why we want to cut this Gordian knot.42.	We know that among individuals  as among nations  respect for the rights of others is peace  just as we also know that on occasion we must take on new responsibilities so that law  respect and active peace will again come to the fore. The time has come to make renewed progress in establishing the norms and regulations of international law  which must no longer be merely public law but must acquire an authentically social nature.43.	My country  which long ago affirmed the nation's primary ownership of its land and subsoil  a principle that is embodied in our Constitution  was in 1938 the first country to nationalize its oil industry as part of its decolonization process. Today  an important potential producer of hydrocarbons  it desires solidarity with all the nations of the world  and particularly with those which are struggling for their freedom and are most needy and most deserving.44.	We are prepared to back these words with deeds by assuming both normative and operative obligations in efforts to bring about the advent of a new  more equitable and better-balanced world order.45.	With all due modesty as regards our situation and understanding  we would like to offer the following considerations.46.	The first problem  in the presence of so many protagonists with opposing interests  undefined policies  unresolved claims  accumulated resentment and articulated reproaches  is how to pose the problem without giving rise to suspicions of partiality  manipulation or complicity.47.	Defining the problem constitutes a substantial part of the solution. Nevertheless  what I am about to say is so simple that I confess it may appear  in view of the controversial situation in which we find ourselves  to be mere romantic ingenuousness.48.	Energy sources are the shared responsibility of all mankind. Energy sources must not be the privilege of the powerful. All abundance is relative. Such sources have a limit  and will come to an end. Moreover  they must not be used as a disturbing element to offset the insecurity of those who have no other means of ensuring their legitimate survival and self-determination.49.	We want to bridge the gap between extremes by making present-day petroleum supply  demand and price structures compatible with the alternatives we seek for the future.50.	The order that must come aboutâand soonâcan come either as the result of the participation of sovereign nations  of their convictions and their free will  or be violently imposed by the most powerful of those nations. And it is not impossible that it may come as the result of a senseless holocaust  which  in pointless emulation of the punishment of Sisyphus  who was doomed never to finish his task  would nullify what it seeks to gain  and  to our eternal shame  would again loose the horsemen of the apocalypseâthis time  how-ever  riding the unleashed energy of millions of horsepower.51.	That is the dilemma before us and the reason for the proposal I am making here today.52.	The United Nations is the only rational and institutional means we have for combating political and economic hegemonies. Only here is it possible for sovereign nations to deal with one another on an equal legal and moral footing; only in this manner will we together be able to settle controversies and to banish abuses and excessive power  so as to develop within a framework of justice rules that  once approved by the majority  will be binding on all for the achievement of well-reasoned and effective solutions.53.	But this forum is criticized as if it had sprung up by spontaneous generation. It is said that it is too bureaucratic  that it is a frustrating quagmire  or that it is excessively politicized  that it has become an instrument for the exercise of the veto of the big Powers  or for misuse by the majority made up by the weaker nations.54.	Be that as it may  it is our own creationâthe best we have been able to devise. If we do not agree on its usefulness  let us change it  but let us not invalidate it.55.	We propose a formula of teamwork  aimed not at pretence or at intervention  but at harmonious participation that will integrate and amplify isolated efforts.56.	The subject of energy has attracted and occupied the attention of this Organization for several years past. Hydrocarbonsâas a catalysing element of the economic crisisâhave been a recurring theme of the debates  which have revealed varying interests and opinions  good ideas and mistaken ones  and agreement and disagreement cutting across each other in all directions whenever the subject of energy comes up.57.	To mention all the reports and resolutions that have been produced at different levels would take far too long. There are those who persist in thinking of energy matters in terms of the energy source involved; to split up the question in this way into separate parts is illogical and incompatible with the interdependent nature and magnitude of the problems we face today.58.	On what objective criterion could the treatment of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes be based  if we failed to take the production of hydrocarbons into account? Would a conference whose purpose was the study of new and renewable energy sources make sense to us if it excluded consideration of older conventional sources? Would it not be more consistent to co-ordinate all energy matters within one over-all policy  while respecting the special characteristics of each energy source?59.	Neither does it seem justified to allow the shortcomings and problems left over from the past  or the antagonisms of the present  to lead us to classify in separate  watertight compartments matters that are inseparably linked together.60.	We want to make use of what is usable  capitalizing on experience and on what we learn from daily life  in order to draw up a common programme for the development and equitable distribution of energy resources  both existing and potential. Therefore  research should be directed towards optimizing energy production and productivity  so as not to base solutions on reserves  but rather on the available potential for generating resources that are indeed renewable and for the common good.61.	We face what appear to be fundamental problems that are really questions of form and methodâof a method for reconciling divergent interests and clarifying the political will of the international community  each one of whose members must claim its rights and agree on and carry out its mission.62.	We are hampered in this endeavour  on the one hand  by the inability to put together in a coherent way the different approaches to the energy problem  the most vital of all for ensuring the continuity of progress; and  on the other hand  by the difficulty of linking them to a much vaster and more complex whole: a new world economic order.63.	Resolving this contradiction means deciding not only what to do  but how to do it; it means dealing simultaneously with both aspectsâthe new international strategy for development and the means of implementing it.64.	Were we to do otherwise  we would be dissociating what we want from what we do; we would be opposing principles to norms  norms to procedures  and procedures to creative action. We would be running the perilous risk of getting bogged down  of perpetuating the unjust contrasts between scarcity and extravagance  between humiliating backwardness and dazzling progress  between a sterile existence and a decent life.65.	We already have economic norms and provisions that are generally accepted by States. By basing our efforts on these norms  and thereby giving them substance  it will be possible to design an all-encompassing and balanced joint development strategy that would be expressed in legal form and based on international law. As at Bretton Woods we were able to establish an orderly structure for handling monetary and reconstruction matters  so today we could  in this now fully instituted forum  establish a new and more orderly structure for handling energy and revitalization. Because of all this  I am in a position to assure you that a general debate on this subject is not only essential  but possible.66.	I therefore propose the adoption of a world energy plan that covers all nations  both the haves and the have-nots  one that is binding on all and that has as its fundamental objective the assurance of an orderly  progressive  integrated and just transition from one age of man's history to the next.67.	The plan must contain programmes designed to accomplish the following goals. It must guarantee the full and permanent sovereignty of each nation over its own natural resources. It must rationalize the exploration  production  distribution  consumption and conservation of present-day sources of energy  particularly hydrocarbons  by providing financial and technical assistance. It must ensure and increase the systematic exploitation of potential reserves of all types  both traditional and non-conventional  that have not yet been exploited owing to lack of financing or applied research  including the sun that heats our tropics and burns so many deserts ; the water that runs uselessly down so many mountainsides  eroding the soil along its path; the disregarded heat within our earth; the unused energy of the wind  and that of the sea  of the atom and of life itself. It must make it possible for all nations to draft energy plans that are compatible with world policy  so as to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of objectives  content and instruments. It must devise measures for the promotion in developing countries of the formation and integration of auxiliary industries in the energy field  and especially of capital goods in that field. It must establish a short-term system  to be put into effect immediately  for resolving the problems of developing countries that import petroleum  a system which would guarantee supply and the honouring of contracts  stop speculation  provide for compensation for price increases  and even ensure considerate treatment on the part of the exporting countries. It must set up financing and development funds  which could be made up of proportional and equitable contributions from the developed consumer countries and from producer and exporter countries  in order to meet both the long-term objectives and the urgent needs of the underdeveloped oil-importing countries. It must institute a system for disseminating and transferring technologies  together with their respective training programmes  that would include a world-wide registry of advances and follow- up in energy research and experimentation. It must support the establishment of an international energy institute. This proposal  which coincides completely with the ideas expressed here  has already been made by the Secretary-General of this Organization  whom I wish to thank for his guidance in this regard.68.	To carry forward this world energy plan  I propose the establishment of a working group  composed of representatives of the petroleum-producing countries  of industrialized countries  both capitalist and socialist  and of developing petroleum-importing countries  which would prepare the documents and pertinent specific proposals.69.	In only 21 years we shall have reached the horizon of the year 2000; by then the babies who are born today will be grown men and women. Then  the only substitute for petroleum will still be the petroleum that remains to be discovered; it will not be until the dawn of the twenty-first century that other energy sources will begin to be of real service to us. Hence the imperative need to rationalize the use of hydrocarbons and the purposes they serve.70.	For all this to come about we shall have to apply our greatest efforts to the task  giving of our best in good faith and with intellectual honesty  imagination  constancy and determination.71.	May the union of our diversity give rise to the conditions for universal peace. May it be a productive peace  bringing to all the opportunity to live and earn the right to lasting happiness for ourselves and for all our children.72.	The challenge is for all of us  because we are all part of the problem  and therefore we are all part of the solution as well.73.	That is Mexico's proposal."
"86",4610,"MLI",34,1979,"ï»¿My opening words must be addressed to the valiant people of Angola  whose great sufferings on this sad occasion we share. I refer to the untimely death of President Agostinho Neto  who was struck down at the helm. Agostinho Neto uncontestably belongs to the line of great men of noble ideals who devoted their lives to the defence of the interests of their peoples and who  because of their thinking and their actions  have shaped history. He was a man of culture  a poet and a humanist  and his loss was painfully felt by all the people of Mali  who admired him and who were planning to welcome him happily during the official visit he was to make to Mali next November. Bowing again in reverence to his memory  we remain convinced that his Party  the MPLA  will continue to work towards the goal to which he dedicated his efforts.44.	This year  tradition has led us to Africaâto East Africaâand more specifically to the United Republic of Tanzania  a country friendly towards my own and one whose wise policies Eire well known to all of us  serving a stable and strong nation. Apart from the honour done your people and the continent of Africa  Mr. President  the General Assembly's warm-hearted election of you to guide the work of the thirty-fourth session is without doubt a reflection of your perfect knowledge of international affairs and your own great qualifications as an enlightened diplomat  which have allowed you to preside successfully over the work of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for almost eight years. These qualifications are highlighted by your youth  your dynamism and your affability  which were noted and acknowledged by the representatives of member States of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] when it unanimously proposed you as a candidate to assume the heavy duties of your very responsible post. I am extremely happy  laying aside all protocol formalities  to congratulate you on behalf of my delegation. We are deeply convinced that you will carry out your high duties with the ability  effectiveness  respect and careful attention which have always been the hallmarks of your personality.45.	I have pleasure also in reiterating our appreciation of the great qualifications and vast experience of your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  which he displayed during the course of the last session. A worthy representative of Latin America  he did honour to his continent and to his country  Colombia  and made a valuable contribution to the achievement of the noble ideals of our Organization.46.	I am also happy to express once again our gratification at the positive way in which our indefatigable Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has carried out his own delicate and complex mission. We are convinced that  being able to count on the constant and effective support of his competent advisers  he will continue to persevere in his efforts to safeguard the gains made by and the prestige of our Organization and the achievement of its noble objectives.47.	As a member of the Special Committee on decolonization since its inception  my country is happy at the accession of Saint Lucia to international sovereignty and we express our happiness at seeing that new State join us here. This event is another step towards the implementation of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and brings us closer to that universality to which our Organization is tending. In offering a cordial and warm welcome to the delegation of Saint Lucia  my delegation wishes to assure it of our complete readiness to co-operate with it in a friendly and dynamic way.48.	The yearly meetings of the members of the inter-national community which the sessions of the General Assembly have become show without doubt the noble ambition to open the road to a collective search for ways and means to maintain and strengthen international peace and security  the primary concern of the United Nations.49.	However  peace and security cannot be strengthened when millions upon millions of human beings are still suffering brutalizing; misery  daily humiliation  unpunished racial discrimination  anachronistic colonial exploitation and unacceptable foreign domination. The United Nations must redouble its efforts not only to settle conflicts but also to adopt applicable and urgent measures to encourage the economic and social development of all peoples.50.	That is the only way to establish an era of true peace  and when our Charter was drafted 34 years ago its authors were aware of that  for the Preamble firmly states that the peoples of the United Nations are determined ""to promote social progress and better standards of life"". There can be no doubt that peace through justice is more fruitful than peace through lawâa very unprofitable mission which finally exhausted the defunct League of Nations 51.	Peace is the work of justice. Peace and justice are one. But what is justice? First and foremost justice is respect for the inalienable rights recognized as belonging to all human beings. It is that simple reality that led those who lived through the Second World War to proclaim in the Charter of our Organization their ""faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small"". Human rights  which cannot be dissociated from the rights of nations and peoples  are at the basis of an essential principle set forth in many provisions of our Charter and taken up in numerous resolutions of our Organization  namely  the principle of the right of peoples to self-determination.52.	Justice  without which there can be no peace  lies first in the recognition of the right of each people to decide for themselves  but justice  the sole guarantor of true peace  also involves the recognition of economic  social and cultural rights. Human rights are so indivisible and interdependent that the authors of the Charter have assigned to our Organization the primary task of achieving ""international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian character"". In other words  34 years ago all was foreseen  all was said and reiterated about the need to put an end to all forms of domination.53.	Taking together all we have done since the last session of our General Assembly  we are forced to note that many are the problems which still concern us and that there are still many to be solved. This has happened purely and simply because some of our partners who are now present in this hall of peace violate with impunity the principles of our Organization  principles according to which the rights of our peoples to self- determination and to a decent existence are still the most flouted.54.	The right of peoples to self-determination is not only a principle set forth in the United Nations Charter; it has become the prime moving force and a general and constantly reaffirmed principle. There can be no doubt that it is a typical example of one of the imperative principles of general law. It is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community as a whole. But we are forced to note that disregard of this sacred principle of the right of peoples to self-determination is the true cause  if not the only cause  of tensions and wars that continue to contaminate international relations.55.	In this world of upheaval and suffering Africa is still the continent in which that principle is ignored by those who do not wish to learn the lessons of history. The persistence of anachronistic colonialism in Namibia and in Zimbabwe  the tolerance shown to the contemptible system of apartheid in Azania  are the result of the refusal of the white minority in southern Africa to respect this cardinal principle of our Organization  namely the right to self-determination.56.	The valiant people of Namibia under the leadership of its sole representative  because it is its authentic representative  SWAPO will continue their struggle for liberation and will defeat all the manoeuvres which seek to stifle its heroic struggle in the maze of a so-called internal settlement. The outcome of the struggle is known because it is a natural battle to insist upon a natural recognition of the right that belongs to the Namibian people  namely that of self-determination. The struggle of the Patriotic Front has finally led to the present negotiations in London  which have not been successful because the Ian Smith clique and its sorry puppets have resorted to sordid electoral manoeuvres and have refused to accept the prior condition of respect for a people's right to self-determination.57.	In Azania the black majority of that African country is still being deprived of its elementary rights to dignity in its own land of Africa. Certain Western Powers  which are so prone to seek out respect for human rights throughout the world  assist and even encourage the apartheid regime to continue in its role of denying the very principle of people's right to self-determination.58.	My country has constantly struggled for just causes. Therefore  from this rostrum we wish to reaffirm our unshakable support for these martyred brothers  with whom the people of Mali identify. We are ready to give all material  military  diplomatic and political assistance to speed the inevitable process of their liberation.59.	This is the moment at which to pay a well-earned and solemn tribute to the brave peoples of the front-line States who  with courage  calmness and determination  are fulfilling their sacred duty together with the peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe and Azania.60.	It is also timely to repeat the pressing appeal made recently by the Head of State of Mali  General Moussa Traore  during our national holiday and addressed to certain Western Powers who were invited:""... once and for all to hear the anguished appeal of Africa and decide to serve the cause of justice and all mankind by helping the international community to force perfidious  arrogant but unfortunately tolerated South Africa to obey the rules"".61.	The principle of the self-determination of peoples  so clearly stated in the well-known charter of decolonization  namely resolution 1514 (XV)  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  adopted on 14 December 1960 by our Assembly  cannot be ignored by the independent and new States of Africa  who appreciate its weight since they judiciously used it when they themselves recently achieved their own independence.62.	It is for these reasons that at its sixteenth ordinary session the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held in Monrovia in July  with political courage and maturity which warrants emphasis here  upheld clearly this principle of self-determination as the key to the fratricidal and distressing conflict in the Western Sahara. Colonized by Spain in the past  the population of that north western zone of our continent cannot be denied this principle  which allowed the brother people of Morocco  of Mauritania and of Algeria to recover their own dignity and freedom.63.	Speaking of this crisis which besets an area very close to the heart of my country leads me to state the principle of self-determination and to say again that this right is not being enjoyed. The OAU clearly defined the new mission entrusted to the new Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara which  in order to improve the climate in the region  must properly define the modalities required for a final settlement on just and acceptable lines agreed to by all the interested and concerned parties  and I stress the word ""all"". 64.	The voice of wisdom of Africa  the voice of maturity of the leaders of the region  has always spoken out in favour of the brother peoples  with the same history  culture and primary concern for development in order to avoid the confrontations which must inevitably lead to a loss of our sovereignty through the actions of those who wish to internationalize this dispute by dramatizing it in order subsequently to play the part of arbiters.65.	That is why my country  the Republic of Mali  wishes this General Assembly of the United Nations  while supporting the historic decision taken in Monrovia  because it is based on the principle of the right of people to self-determination  to continue to place its trust in the African process which has already proved that it can succeed as long as the Powers outside Africa keep out of the dispute.66.	Outside of Africa there are hotbeds of war and sources of tension also deriving from the same disregard of the right of peoples to self-determination.67.	The crisis in the Middle East and the question of Palestine  which is still its epicentre  continue to beset us because the leaders of Israel in their arrogant intransigence refuse to recognize the right to self-determination of the brave Palestinian people.68.	Many of the aspects of the Middle East conflict have been linked to that refusal to accept that principle  respect for which would have prevented the occupation by force of Arab territories and allowed Jerusalem to achieve a status more in keeping with the glorious religious past of that historic city. The Republic of Mali is deeply attached to the search for solutions to conflicts by peaceful means and will never reject any initiative for peace. At the same time  we believe that any peace process must take into account the following facts that are germane to the conflict.69.	First  the inalienable right of the people of Palestine to self-determination  including their right to national independence and the creation of a sovereign State  must be unambiguously accepted by all parties signatories to a peace agreement. In that regard  Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which were adopted in circumstances of a balance of power that is well known  would be enhanced as a useful source for a true peace agreement by being supplemented in accordance with General Assembly resolution 3236 (XXIX)  which recognizes the national rights of the people of Palestine.70.	Secondly  the PLO  being recognized as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people by the summit conferences of the Arab countries and the OAU  being a full-fledged member of the non- aligned movement  enjoying a privileged status at the United Nations and in the specialized agencies  being represented in more than 100 countries of the international community  and making its voice heard constantly in the public opinion of Europe and even America  must imperatively be closely associated in the search for any true peace in the Middle East.71.	Thirdly  the total and unconditional evacuation of the Arab territories occupied by force in the course of the 1967 Israeli aggression is  in our view  a prerequisite for any true peace agreement.72.	Fourthly  Jerusalem must be given a status more in keeping with the religious past of that Holy City  and that  too  is a basic condition for peace.73.	Fifthly  Arab unity  which alone can guarantee that peace will be true and comprehensive  must be maintained.74.	For these reasons Mali  which at the appropriate moment expressed its doubts regarding Israel's good faith in negotiating a true peace treaty  once moreâ specifically in July in Monrovia and in September in Havanaâfreely took the part of those who have indefatigably supported the PLO in its struggle to ensure that the Palestinian people succeed in their efforts to achieve self-determination.75.	Those doubts regarding the true will of Israel to live in peace with its neighbours were reinforced by the unspeakable actions committed by the Israeli forces which  with full impunity and with the complicity of the international news media  worked themselves into a rage against the peaceful population of troubled Lebanon  whose southern portionâdespite the unfortunately only symbolic presence of United Nations forcesâis now no more than a province of Israel  which blithely continues its expansionist and annexationist policies.76.	The other areas of tension warrant the same type of analysis: the crisis of Cyprus  the conflict of Korea and the dismemberment of South-East Asia.77.	The problem of Cyprus comes up each year before our Assembly  which has been dealing with it since the distressing events of 15 July 1974.78.	As a member of the contact group set up by the non-aligned movement  the Republic of Mali  after much discussion  is convinced that only the renewal of the talks between the Greek and Turkish communities  under the auspices of the Secretary-General and with the assistance of an even more limited contact group that could be set up by the present session of the General Assembly  can possibly lay the groundwork for the implementation of the 10 points contained in the agreement of 19 May 1979  and allow the people of Cyprus to exercise their right to self-determination so as to safeguard independence  their sovereignty  their territorial integrity and their national unity.79.	If the principle of self-determination of peoples were to be recognized in the case of the valiant people of Korea who for 30 years have struggled for the legitimate reunification of their occupied country under peaceful circumstances  that nation  having become a democratic and unitary State  would take its rightful place in this Organization and make a fine contribution to our work. United by its history  its geography  its civilization  its genius and the profound aspirations of its peoples  Korea must be reunified in accordance with the pertinent provisions of the agreement contained in the joint communique of North and South Korea dated 4 July 1972   and of the important General Assembly resolution 3390 B (XXX).â80.	The worthy people of Asia have by force of arms wrested their right to self-determination from colonialism and then from imperialism  and have all acceded to international sovereignty.81.	We in Mali had thought that the peoples which had for more than 30 years made enormous sacrifices would have turned their victories over the forces of domination and ""puppetry"" into an unprecedented effort to reconstruct one of the most promising areas of the globe.82.	But recent events have led us to doubt  and almost to pessimism. Yet we still nourish the hope that the lucidity  courage and age-old wisdom which characterize those peoples and which allowed them to emerge victorious from even greater trials  will help them to solve the problems that have been created by untimely foreign interference in their affairsâwhich seeks to prevent them from freely achieving economic  social and cultural development.83.	After this review of the international realities  it is inevitable that we note that all these areas of tension and of war are strictly confined to the third world. A leader of one of the great Powers even declared recently and with justification that ""we live in a world without major conflicts; we live in a world where we are constantly concerned over matters of security; but we no longer fear that war is just around the corner"". He added  it is true  that ""... there are local conflicts  repression  troubles  but the idea of 'the next war' has somewhat evaporated"". This may perhaps be the best description of the present stage of international affairs; while one part of the planet  that occupied by the so- called developed nations  enjoys the benefits of detente  the other half of the world  where ""the wretched of the earth"" are dying  still suffers from tensions which are cunningly maintained to ensure the continued well- being of about a quarter of the population of the world.84.	To be sure  the present world political system is not automatically being drawn into a major conflict. To be sure  while events in Africa  in the Middle East and even in South-East Asia do create situations of confrontation  it has been possible to prevent them from setting off a world confrontation. Nevertheless  let us remember that for the first time since its appearance  mankind has found the means of self-destruction.85.	The causes of tension  namely  the mad arms race  especially with the intensive production of nuclear weapons and the maintenance and even reinforcement of military alliances  bases and presences  remain matters of concern. Nuclear proliferation carries with it the seeds of a possible world war. The Republic of Mali  one of the founder members of the non-aligned movement  is pleased with the results  albeit modest  obtained since the tenth special session of our General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament.86.	Therefore we are following with interest the efforts under way within the SALT negotiations  even if progress is slow and uncertain.87.	It is essential for us to continue to work together openly in order to make headway along the difficult road to general and complete disarmament  to the dismantling of all military bases forcibly stationed in third- world countries and to the stopping and reversing of the arms race. It is only that type of co-operation that can lead to the creation of a more secure world where peace would depend less on weapons and would no longer be founded on the outmoded theory of a balance of terror and mutual destruction.88.	My country  the Republic of Mali  true to its policy of dynamic and intransigent non-alignment  continues and will continue to make its modest contribution to this necessary relaxation of tension in international relations. As soon as it recovered its sovereignty  the Republic of Mali demanded the evacuation of all foreign military bases on its soil  and since  aware of its national and international responsibilities  my country has signed and will sign no bilateral or multilateral agreement which does not give it a completely free hand in defence matters.89.	It is in order to remain faithful to these cardinal principles of the non-aligned movement that my country often preaches prudence regarding regional or sub regional military projects or even defence pacts between countries that  while belonging to the same geographical area certainly  are often linked bilaterally to Powers outside Africa. We must always bear in mind that any military bloc with links  however tenuous  with Powers outside Africa can only lead to the creation of a new bloc  without taking into account the fact that a defence pact  whatever precautions are taken  is always perceived as machinery for warfare against one State or group of States.90.	That is why the Republic of Mali  fully concerned with development  the only guarantee of stability in our States  reiterates its political and legal commitment never to attack any State  even less a neighbouring one  and to give full fraternal assistance to any State in our region which may be the victim of an attack.91.	The right of peoples to self-determination  disarmament and detente are not the sole components of international peace and security.92.	We have already said that peace is also and perhaps above all economic and social justice. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that peace depends largely on the solutions we find together for the serious imbalances which characterize the world economy.93.	Poverty is not only a scandal which the third- world peoples reveal to wealthy tourists. Poverty is also a danger to the balance of the world.94.	The reality of this poverty can be seen on all the street corners of the proletarian nations and the figures which sum up this tragic condition of the majority of mankind are so huge that they even lose all meaning. Some of these figures are really discouraging: according to the World Bank  800 million people in the world live beneath what is termed the ""line of absolute poverty""; more than 800 million human beings are illiterate; 400 million suffer from serious diseases; 500 million  or more than three quarters  suffer from chronic or permanent malnutrition; and 50 millionâI repeat  50 millionâ die of hunger each year  while elsewhere  in countries which get much of their riches from third- world resources  people sometimes die from overeating.95.	These statistics are global and impersonal. Their very size helps to make them abstract  removing any elementary emotional content.96.	However  behind the figures we should look for reality: the extreme poverty of most of them; a large proportion of illiterates; a runaway population growth with a meagre economy; malnutrition and mediocre infrastructures; a third of the children dying before the age of five; and denial of the right to education  hygiene and employment  and of every vestige of dignity. In short  they drag out their existence in shame  exploitation and degradation.97.	This is especially revolting reality  even if it exists far from the eyes of an overfed world which wastes and destroys its surplus food. The citizens of the developed countries should know that beef cattle in a so-called developed country are better protected and better fed than peasants in Asia or Africa.98.	For how much longer must millions die in order that thousands shall live?99.	In the face of this situation  which it is difficult to describe  it is no longer enough to profess the correct sentiments as a sop to one's conscience.100.	It is just as dangerous to regard this situation as a matter for academic speeches  a sterile ritual at seminars and international conferences  and a repetitive litany of statements  reports and studies made in order to gain time while hunger and injustice increase. It is intolerable and explosive that three quarters of the world's population should represent less than one fifth of the general economic weight. To be selfish or unaware in the face of such a situation is an insult not only to morality  but also and above all to the common interest of all of us.101. Now what do we see? On 1 May 1974  at the impetus of the developing countries  our General Assembly  at its sixth special session  proclaimed in its resolution 3201 (S-VI) the urgent need to set up a ""new international economic order""  that is to change the institutions and laws which govern the world economy  to reorganize monetary  scientific  technical and material exchanges and the distribution of the power of the rich countries  and to create a more democratic worldâ in sum  to decolonize the world economy which  during the seventeenth  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries  was dominated by Western Europe and its offshoots.102.	After the last 10 years and session after session of UNCTAD and various meetings within the framework of the North-South dialogue  we are now convinced that most of the proposals concerning structural changes in the international system  as well as those put forward with a view to the taking of urgent measures on pressing problems  have unfortunately not been the subject of any agreement.103.	What is a more significant phenomenon is the fact that stagnation  if not regression  is taking place in official development assistance. In a word  the financial flow  including bank loans  to the third world in 1978 represented some $77 billion as compared to $65 billion in 1977. It will be noted that  because of inflation  the financial flow has hardly varied from one year to the next at 1978 prices. It will be noted that the debts owed for this reason by the developing countries exceed $300 billion whereas expenditures on armaments exceed $1 billion a day while official development assistance is 20 times less than that.104.	Such is the state of the world  an unhappy world  unhappy because it does not know where it is going and because it imagines that if it did know  it would find that it may be heading towards a catastrophe. That was a prophecy made by one of the great Powers  certainly a prophecy of doom hanging over us because it means that the problems of economic and social balance have not been solved. The needy and the wealthy have to get together to seek ways of overcoming the economic and social phenomena.105.	The Republic of Mali considers that we should still trust in measures of concerting our efforts rather than resorting to the strategy of confrontation. We must seek to progress through peaceful negotiations. Doubtless the way will be difficult because these negotiations would have to take place among more than 150 sovereign States that are unequal throughout the range of economic and social activities. The task may appear to be a Utopian one  but it is still within the grasp of mankind.106.	The North-South dialogue already taking place will have at least allowed contacts and helpful clarifications to be made  particularly since it has shown the lack of political will on the part of the developed countries. But in the course of these talks they will have to realize that they will be assuming a tremendous responsibility if they continue to limit themselves to empty promises. More and more  political action for change is prompting the cry for a more rational management of the world economy.107.	In that regard  some new ideas are receiving greater attention. First of all  under-development is no longer taken to mean slow development  that is  as a phase in a process of expansion from which the countries of the third world will one day emerge. Under-development is indeed a result of development  a distortion resulting from the relations between the dominant States and the dependent States  Under-development is the result of the exchange relationship in raw materials and the consequence of the exploitation of our resources. A second  very fruitful idea is to study the fact that the life of human society largely depends on factors other than economic ones. There does not exist any human action without its spiritual dimension.108.	These are realities that increasingly lead to a certain conduct that is seen above all in the developing countriesâto fall back on their own resources and to organize the collective power of the poor countries in negotiations with the rich ones.109.	It is  however  true that among the wealthy nations a certain slow awareness is growing of the need to overcome these economic phenomena. The most concrete expressions of this took place at the meetings of the Guadeloupe Summit  held from 4 to 6 January 1979  and of the Tokyo Economic Summit  held on 28 and 29 June 1979. If they have not yet finally understood that an economic organization on a collective basis  even if it disturbs and upsets selfish interests  would be a global system that would be more advantageous for all  they have at least become aware that a world monetary and economic system must be established. This calls for an agreement on the part of the principal partners  an agreement that is difficult to achieve because of their great number and the extent of national self-interest.110.	The true problem  the true debateâand it is in this Assembly that it is most appropriate that we discuss itâlies in knowing whether the necessary political conditions exist in the developed countries to allow this new strategy for development to take root and grow. There is where the most difficult task to be accomplished lies  because there are many who enjoy privileges that they wish to retain within the framework of their present anachronistic orientation. But on the other hand  they cannot blind themselves to the changes made necessary by the deadlocks and inevitable contradictions.111.	It is up to the authorities of the developed countries to convince themselves and their peoples that they must adapt to the new state of the world  that they cannot return to the previous situation of exploitation of foreign resources and that the era of a general prosperity that was most unequally shared is definitely over.112.	They must try to adjust to a world that is bound to arrive and not wish to stick to a world that is on its way out. Therein lies the key to all that can and should be done. We are assuredly at a cross-roads. ""If one panics  one will not dare to advance and will instead retreat. If  on the contrary  one continues to advance  all of a sudden one will discover something new: a new- state of the world""  a political  economic  social and cultural world that is more just and more equitable. There is still time ""to make haste slowly"" to save man and mankind through true justice  the only guarantor of peace."
"87",4651,"MLT",34,1979,"ï»¿The lengthy debates we have had at this session and over the past three and a half decades  particularly on the theoretical parameters of important economic and political issues  should be more than sufficient  at least to identify reasons for lack of progress  to pin-point priorities  to select the best means to render our performance more efficient  and thus to alleviate the crisis of confidence besetting our Organization. A survey of the past decade helps to focus our attention on the main contributing factors. 143.	The most serious consideration immediately stands out: peace in the worldâsuch as it isâremains precarious. Detenteâthe golden concept of the 1970sâhas promoted intensive debate  which  however  has rarely been translated into genuine dialogue. Consequently  very little of the great expectation generated by the fanfare surrounding detente has been converted into practical achievement. There is still much uncertainty on the code of detente  which often turns hot or cold.144.	Detente was predicated on the perceived need of preserving a stable balance between two opposing military blocs. It followed as a corollary that a wildly spiralling nuclear and conventional arms race enhanced neither side's security and should therefore be avoided. It also followed that avenues of co-operation in responsible political conduct should be encouraged and explored at the same time.145.	Neither of these two essential corollaries has been applied in practice  although both have been debated at length in theory here and elsewhere  and have often been quoted in negotiations. This observation hardly needs elaboration.146.	The failure of disarmament negotiations provides striking evidence. Both major Powers have a declared common interest and a legal commitment to control and reverse the nuclear arms race. Lengthy negotiations were held on a bilateral basis at the stated preference of the parties. These were therefore the optimum conditions for negotiations. Yet neither one of the two accords signed so far has achieved its declared objective. The very notion of arms control  which surreptitiously replaced that of disarmament  has proved illusory. The arms race keeps on escalating: from 1 000 warheads on each side in early 1970  the number has increased to around 9 000 at present  with an anticipated 20 000âconstantly more refinedâby 1985. To look beyond is perhaps too optimistic.147.	In contradiction of theory and declared policy  the practical result of 10 years of negotiations has been escalation of the arms race  which has not brought about increased stability  but only an increase in the tragic cost and the serious risks inherent in nuclear deterrence. Additionally  new doctrines of limited nuclear war and first-strike capability are attracting increasing attention among military strategists. Unfortunately  the agreements reached at the first and second rounds of SALT have not eliminated any single weapons system that has been deployed. By no stretch of the imagination can this process be considered as arms control  still less as disarmament.148.	Promise remains for the future  in the agreement to go on talking and in a resigned acceptance of the fact that any treaty is better than no treaty at all. It is too pessimistic to conclude that neither of the two ideological systems is capable of halting what each one of them has defined as insane. We cannot but encourage the major Powers to ratify the agreements and to proceed without delay to the next round of negotiations  for which far better results are augured.149.	At the same time we note that the major impetus for disarmament comes from the non-nuclear-weapon States  which have assumed the responsibility of substituting for the inertia of the major Powers. Arising from these efforts  machinery for disarmament negotiations has been broadened and democratized to allow for the participation of all potential contributors. A programme of action has been agreed to  at least in theory  and the concept of zones of peace has been defined for the first time; this concept offers prospects for regional initiatives which would reduce tension through cooperative efforts by the States concerned  with the tacit acquiescenceâpreferably even the supportâof the major Powers. The Mediterranean Sea  the Caribbean Sea and the Indian Ocean are promising areas to explore and have already attracted wide interest among the States concerned.150.	Lack of progress in disarmament has been matched on other political issues which this Organization has spotlighted for too many years. They are areas of regional tension  which are among the most dangerous threats to peace  principally on account of the diametrically opposed policies of the two military alliances.151.	The Middle East is probably the most dangerous potential flash-point at present. After a dangerously static period  an element of movement has been introduced  which so far  however  fails to tackle the central issue of the Middle East tension and hence gives rise to uncertainty.152.	It is becoming increasingly urgent for all countries to realize that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people can no longer be thwarted arbitrarily and that as long as the PLO  as the representative of its people  is kept out of the search for peace  no just or permanent solution can be envisaged. The United Nations has prepared a comprehensive peace plan. This has already gained wide acceptance  which I hope will be even more pronounced at this session.153.	My delegation has been actively involved in this process. Malta is striving to convince all countries  particularly Israel  that their best interests and the interests of peace will be served best if they act to recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian peopleâa gesture of statesmanship which would pay rich dividends in future. The time is approaching for difficult decisions of reconciliation and recognition to be taken by all sides to the conflict and also by those countries in a position to influence positive decisions. Those countries which are still hesitant will probably find it convenient at worst to be highly critical of the United Nations plan  or at best  to qualify the plan as wishful thinking.154.	I respectfully ask those countries to consider the following main questions. First  since the approaches of the past have brought no solution  but only bloodshed and misery  over the last 30 years  is it not time to give priority to a peaceful approach based on fundamental justice? Secondly  can an approach be considered democratic  peaceful and just if the people whose future is at stake is not represented in the negotiations by its recognized representatives? Thirdly  why is it assumed that a people working for its economic future within its own homeland is less peaceful than the same people forcibly denied its dignity and political aspirations and living in deplorable conditions? Fourthly  why can we not concede to others the rights that we ourselves recognize as fundamental? Fifthly  and finally  on what basis should the Palestinians uniquely be considered by a few countries as ineligible for independence?155.	Until these questions are settled there will be no peace in the Middle East. In the meantime  Lebanon also continues to suffer  caught in the instability of the region. It is evident that security has not been attained by the injection of massive armaments into the area in the past; a new approach is necessary  one which overlooks no important element essential for success. The United Nations has pointed a way out  and it would be tragic if once again a critical opportunity were by-passed  with dire consequences for the economic and political future of the entire world.156.	In Korea the situation remains tense  the country divided  despite the wish of the people concerned for peaceful reunification. The most visible obstacle to reunificationâforeign troops stationed in the south  potentially armed with nuclear weaponsâremains. This symbol of division frustrates the peaceful dialogue which is the prerequisite for the solution of the economic and political problems hindering reunification.157.	Similarly  there is a stalemate in Cyprus  and the country remains artificially divided  its economic and social progress inhibited  with foreign troops threatening its territorial integrity and violating its sovereignty. Malta has played its part in the Commonwealth  in the Council of Europe and in this forum to encourage progress  but so far reason has not prevailed. None of the protagonists benefits from the present stalemate  least of all the people of Cyprus.158.	There is  at least and at last  some room for optimism that the shameful repression of the oppressed minorities in Namibia and Zimbabwe is nearing an end. I am glad that the first contacts between the parties to the conflict in Zimbabwe were held in Malta. These have since progressed and at the recent Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  in Lusaka all participants finally came to the realization that a truly representative Government must be installed. We trust that the consultations at the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London  despite last- minute complications  will still end in a positive outcome  and that the example of majority rule will promote further advances throughout southern Africa.159.	There are other danger-spots  and some new ones looming ahead  which we will have to discuss on our present and future agenda  these are  admittedly  the most extreme examples of political problems inherited from the past  on which progress has been alarmingly slow or practically non-existent. They must of necessity now constitute our priorities for the future  before our attention is diverted by other events.160.	Even in a new field of human endeavour  in an area when we were trying collectively to plan for the future rather than to undo the events of the past  our progress was tardy  clouded by suspicion and conditioned by outdated concepts of the national interest.161.	I refer of course to the question of the utilization of the resources of the ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction  and to the concept of the common heritage of mankind. After more than a decade of effort  a treaty is within the grasp of the international community. Yet  in the negotiating process  the original concept has been shorn of much of its imaginative content  and ocean- fronting States have laid claim over the maximum extent of their continental shelf  to include the slope and the margin  even when these extend beyond the 200- mile exclusive economic zone  and thus they seek to encroach on the area that would otherwise be considered international.162.	Consequently  the potential impact on economic equity and co-operation from exploitation of the resources within the ""common heritage"" area risks being greatly eroded  and thrust further into the future. Nevertheless  Malta hopes that next year the negotiations will be concluded  and we remain willing to play host to the proposed international sea-bed authority.163.	The reasons for our lacklustre performance on issues that have become almost permanent features of our agenda are undoubtedly many and complex. It would be unfair to ascribe the paucity of progress to only one source. But the negative influence of the most powerful nations remains without question the principal determining factor.164.	The mutual fear and suspicion of the major Powers continues to prevail and  with few exceptions  their interests pull in opposite directions  and hence cancel each other out  rendering our Organization ineffectual. The Security Council has become the living embodiment of this present phenomenon  which is certainly not what the founding fathers of our Organization had anticipated.165.	It is trite but true to observe that there can be little significant progress in the complex  highly volatile questions facing the international community  unless there is a change of attitude among the protagonists. Uneasy  occasionally provocative coexistence is not enough  even when it is labelled ""detente"". After so many years of debate  the mere repetition of stated positions  in which each side conveniently blames the other for all imaginable ill-will  no longer carries much conviction; in fact  it has lost all credibility and should be discontinued. We must henceforth try to understand the preoccupations and concerns of the other side and seek the most efficient modalities and opportunities for progress.166.	In the past year the calendar of activities in the economic field has been particularly full. No doubt some will claim that results are encouraging  if only because of the concentrated attention that has been generated.167.	Without going into too many details  my delegation shares the serious concern at the lack of results of the negotiations aimed at the establishment of equitable relations between developed and developing countries  as stated by the Ministers of the Group of 77 at their meeting here last week.168.	This acute divergence of opinion cannot be explained away as a mere affirmation of the instinctive  initial bargaining attitudes adopted by both sides. The significance runs deeper. The developing world defines as failures not only those negotiations where no conclusions have been reachedâeven though agreed deadlines have long been passedâbut  more especially  those negotiations where the formal conclusions arrived at are moulded in the classic patterns of North- South relations. It is the essential objective of the New International Economic Order to reshape these patterns.169.	The persisting economic crisis in the industrialized world has been singled out as the main factor which makes it impossible for Governments in the developed countries to take bold measures at the national level which would lead to structural changes at the international level.170.	However  this argument rests on an incorrect premiseânamely that evolution of the dialogue depends upon concessions which the North decides to give to the South at a time  and under conditions  which the North deems appropriate. This premise runs counter to the whole foundation of the New International Economic Order  and is itself  perhaps  the major reason for the dialogue to be regarded by the developing world as completely sterile and frustratingâa dialogue of the deliberately deaf and indifferent.171.	No one denies that the present international economic situation is extremely serious  even though  once again  there are fundamental divergencies between the North and the South in the emphasis which is laid on the various factors contributing to this situation.172.	For instance it is ironic that the developed world sees the roots of the current economic crisis in the only area where the developing world has finally been able to utilize the prevailing international circumstances to remedy or to lessen its previous disadvantage.173.	I refer to the question of supplies and prices of oil. Together with the rest of the developing world  the oil exporters had long been seeking a radical adjustment of the prevailing economic structures  from which the real cause of the present international economic malaise arises. Therefore  the malaise itself  far from serving as an excuse to retard structural changes  should serve as an added inducement to speed up the necessary reforms.174.	The noble  challenging objective of the New International Economic Order is the achievement of a humane and equitable living environment for the whole of mankind. This is a challenge which none should shirk  and from which none should be excluded. It should be recalled that one of the most fundamental elements of the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order was the emphasis placed on the diverse economic adversities as they manifest themselves in the different parts of the developing world.175.	This approach in turn is premised on the understanding that poverty and social injustice  if they are to be effectively eliminated  must be tackled at their roots  not only at the level of their most obvious manifestations. Furthermore  in identifying the roots of the problems as and where they exist  we have tried to move away from rigid notions and definitions based on criteria and perspectives peculiar to advanced market economies.176.	As an island developing country  Malta is particularly aware of the different types of constraints which lie in the path of development. We find it difficult to understand the attitudes of some developed countries which insist on defining the problems of development in a rather simplistic manner  refusing to acknowledge the different constraints which exist  and refusing to apply the various remedies which have been proposed.177.	The net result of our endeavours is that  as we approach the end of this decade  most of the fundamental issues posed at its inception are as yet unresolved. Persistent  unalleviated adversity consequently has made militants of us all. But let us not forget  we are militants for the shared objectives of peace  justice and equity. We seek to pursue our objectives through a mutually receptive dialogue  through common endeavour and through collective action.178.	We therefore invite our partners in the developed world to understand our objectives and to join us in our sincere endeavour to make the world kinder  healthier and happier for all peoples. Only through such a partnership approach can we resolve the problems which we face in elaborating a new strategy for the 1980s  in preparing for the General Assembly's special session next year and in agreeing upon an effective format for global negotiations in the years to come.179.	Against this somewhat negative over-all assessment of our performance  we can still derive comfort from the fact that the major problems confronting us have been thoroughly analysed and that the parameters of potential solutions have been indicated.180.	In the process of that analysis we have also indirectly acquired long and practical experience of the techniques of conference procedures. We have among us in the Secretariat and in delegations many experienced participants who have been involved in these conferences  both as representatives of Governments and as international civil servants. I believe it would be useful to attempt to derive benefit from this experience.181.	There are some areas where an updated  concise study by a small panel of these experts could perhaps indicate to us procedures designed to facilitate our work in future  as the membership of our Organization continues to expand. A few tentative areas for investigation come to my mindâwhich I hope others will supplement: for instance  first  how can we make the general debate more productive and less time- consuming; secondly  what techniques can we devise to render the process of ascertaining a consensus more rapid and more substantive; thirdly  what is the best means of ensuring an adequate follow-through on decisions reached by consensus; fourthly  what is the optimum or average time-frame in which we can reasonably expect significant progress between one meeting and another; fifthly  how can the press and the public at large be better informed about the complex activities of our Organization so that we may generate continued world-wide support? I urge the Secretariat to consider these points as it pursues its probe into the working methods of our Organization 182.	Certainly  the United Nations has firmly established its role as the moulder of international opinion  as the spotlight for crisis  as the centre for defining universal standards and as a place for large and small countries to meet on an equal footing. We can anticipate the world's problems and we can point out considered solutions. But the contribution of individual countries  or of a spontaneous grouping of individual countries  then becomes the most direct and efficient means for producing tangible results. This has been demonstrated in the remarkable progress made  for instance  by the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and of the European Economic Community  acting in concert in the pursuit of common objectives  forgetting their past differences and gradually expanding the spheres of their co-operation. This is only natural. The application of universally agreed principles calls for flexible supportive mechanisms that respond to the perceived interests and specific issues arising in the various geographical regions. The countries in any one region  through better perception  greater commitment  consistency and proximity are in the best position to make effective contributions to various situations of particular concern in which they are directly involved. This applies equally for political  social  economic and cultural issues. These regional initiatives deserve every encouragement and would be enhanced and expanded in their application through interregional contacts.183.	There remains the essential contribution made by each individual country  and in such a dangerous  complex and inequitable world  what can a small country like Malta offer as a contribution to peace and security  without which economic progress would elude us?184.	My own Government has applied in practical terms the considerations I have just outlined. We recognize that coexistence must be enhanced by understanding  and that co-operation must eventually replace confrontation; we have found that the constraints of a military alliance thwarted initiatives for peace and perpetuated confrontation; we have discovered that the advocates for peaceful change were among the ranks of the developing and non-aligned countries  so much maligned in the Western press; we have therefore decided irrevocably to move away from our past history as a base for military confrontation; instead  we have already assumed a new role as a bridge for peace and co-operation in our region; we put these options before our people  to be decided by them through a democratic electoral process. In 1971 and again in 1976  the new approach was preferred by the Maltese electorate.185.	The challenging objective which Malta set itself in June 1971 contemplated a radical transformation of its centuries-old history. It entailed enormous upheavals in the structure of our national economy. We were not deterred by the sacrifices involved. We were convinced that the decision was correct and in the interest not only of the people of Malta  but also of all the neighbouring States of the Mediterranean. We gave ourselves a breathing-space of only seven years in which to accomplish our objective 186.	Malta pursued its chosen programme consistently over that period. We attempted to change our economic sinews to be able to sustain us in the chosen role. Although our economy still requires foreign support  nevertheless we felt that we had to fulfil at the appointed time our voluntary commitment to the imperatives of peace in the region.187.	Last year I informed this Assembly of our intentions.  Today I am pleased to confirm their implementation. On the historic day  31 March 1979  through peaceful negotiations  in friendship and without rancour  the last British troops departed  never to return. Warships and warplanes have been replaced by tourist liners and civilian aircraft  military personnel by tourists.188.	Our neighbours can be assured  once and for all  that Malta will not be used as a spring-board by any Power in acts of aggression against them. At the beginning of this decade  we were considered the unsinkable aircraft carrier of the Mediterranean  a base for a military alliance. Today I solemnly affirm before this Organization that there is not one single foreign soldier on our soilâ neither today or in the future.189.	Despite the economic burden which our new role entails  by popular choice and of our own free will  unilaterally  we have therefore made our maximum contribution to non-aligned objectives and to the promotion of peace in our region. We have lit a small beacon of hope for a brighter future. Our aim is to turn the Mediterranean into a zone of peace and cooperation by promoting Arab unity and by strengthening the common interests that European and Arab countries share  something that will give our region its best guarantee for independent action and security  free from big-Power rivalry.190.	Last year in Belgrade and this year in Colombo and in Havana  the non-aligned movement hailed Malta's contribution and expressed support. We welcomed this expression of intent. We are anxious to see it applied in practice  both to Malta's national development as well as to the pursuit of tangible cooperation in the Mediterranean region. I take this occasion publicly to express Malta's gratitude to our Arab friends  some of whom are already giving moral and material support to Malta's newly acquired status. We are seeking to enlarge this circle  in the common interest.191.	We also sense that other countries would prefer us to resume our previous role as the military watchdog of the Mediterranean. We tell them frankly and firmly that our decision is irrevocable  and that from them  too  we would welcome understanding and support for our economic development and peaceful policies  which require our immediate  undivided attention.192.	I also give assurance that our commitment to the imperatives of genuine peaceful co-operation will not come to an end with the closure of the foreign military bases on our soil. In our region for years we have sensed unease over the acute confrontation that persists in the Mediterranean. We have understood the popular longing for peaceful change that cries out for tangible fulfilment among the countries of the region. We have noted that the enduring obstacles to progress  particularly the questions of the Middle East and Cyprus  required our urgent attention and constant endeavours for a regional and equitable solution. To these objectives  we have ceaselessly contributed  as the record shows.193.	As a centre for peace and a bridge of friendship between Europe and the Arab world  we have stressed the important fact that the Mediterranean countriesâ the first to suffer from the existing Middle East confrontationâshould take the lead in concerting their views so as to promote unity and progress in a regional setting. We have repeatedly urged our European friends to play a protagonist role in the search for a comprehensive solution of the problems besetting our region. I renew that call today.194.	We had harped on this message as soon as the dawn of detente led to an all-European conclave. At the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe we were the ones first to raise the relevance of the Mediterranean and  as a start  we secured the contributions of non-European Mediterranean States in the proceedings. At the end of the first marathon meeting  a chapter on the Mediterranean became a permanent feature of The Final Act of the Conference  signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975.195.	Since then  of the follow-up meetings of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  one has been held in Valletta. On Malta's initiative  in February 1979  an examination of potential sectors for projects of concrete co-operation among participants in the Conference and all Mediterranean countries in the economic  scientific and cultural fields was carried out  for the first time in the history of the Mediterranean.196.	The meeting  despite early-warning signals of divisive influences promoted from outside the region  ended on a positive note; many concrete areas of cooperation were singled out  and new initiatives envisaged. These matters  as well as the overriding question of security  will be taken up in the forthcoming Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe to be held in Madrid next year.197.	We look forward to this meeting  in the expectation that it will be action-oriented  and that the participating countries will not find  as happened in recent meetings  that once we had laboriously defined principles we had great difficulty in reaching agreement on their practical application  and had to content ourselves with polite exchanges or  at times  vituperative accusation and counter-accusation 198.	In particular  we attach importance to the advantages of prior consultation  during the first half of 1980  between the Mediterranean States of the non-aligned movement and the Mediterranean States participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  to launch practical projects of co-operation and to prepare for the Madrid meeting of the Conference next year. Malta will be glad to play host to such a gathering at the Mediterranean Conference Centre in Valletta  and is prepared  together with other Mediterranean countries  to embark on the necessary consultations in order to devise the agenda and modalities for such a meeting.199.	Before I close  I wish to reassert that Malta is proud of its membership in the United Nations  and will pursue its contribution to the causes of peace. It will be evident from what I have said that we share the insight  the preoccupations  the dedication and the objectives of our Secretary-General  whose thoughtful analysis in his report on the work of the Organization. We have carefully studied.200.	We welcome the additional step towards universality that has been taken through the admission of Saint Lucia  another developing island country  among the growing family of nations.201.	We hail the accord over the Panama Canal. We were greatly encouraged by the inspiration in the timely message of His Holiness Pope John Paul II who reminded us that our activityâall political activityâ""comes from man  is exercised by man and is for man"".202.	We congratulate the President on his appointmentâwe also congratulate his predecessorâand on their contribution to the work of this Organization. The President has already steered us successfully into adopting procedural improvements in our work. He has introduced the essential discipline of punctuality  and a recognition of the need for cost-efficiency in our work. That is a good start  long overdue perhaps  but all the more welcome on that account. Malta's hope and constant striving is that this is but a precursor of even better things to come.203.	Let us close the door on the 1970s as the decade of debate on the principles that guide our actions  and of persistent probing for equitable solutions to enduring obstacles. Let us enter the 1980s resolutely determined to apply objective  practical and peaceful remedies to long-outstanding and long-discussed problems. Let 1980 be the first year of the decade of accomplishment  as our Organization enters it prime of life."
"88",4698,"MMR",34,1979,"ï»¿May I begin by conveying to Ambassador Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania the warm congratulations of the delegation of Burma on his election to the presidency of the thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly. We are confident that his wide knowledge and experience of world affairs will stand us in good stead in guiding our deliberations to a successful conclusion.209.	We wish to pay a tribute also to our former President  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for his distinguished services in conducting the affairs of the last session of our Assembly.210.	To the delegation of Saint Lucia  we extend our friendly greetings on the occasion of its admission to the family of the United Nations.211.	We meet at this session this year amid developments which  since our last session  have affected significantly the pattern of international relations. The course of events that have taken place has brought about a fundamental realignment of forces in world affairs  We are faced with a situation where the interplay of political  economic and social problems has greatly exacerbated international relations. This calls for the highest degree of collective responsibility on the part of all of us in this family of nations to contribute to the solving of the major problems which confront us and trouble the world today.212.	The world will recall that the United Nations was founded on a commitment and a hope: commitment to the maintenance of peace between nations  and hope that the essential community of interests and aspirations  even between States differing in their political  economic and social systems  would strengthen that commitment through mutual co-operation and mutual endeavour.213.	The present session of the General Assembly is a most timely occasion to appraise the gravity of the world situation. It offers us a favourable opportunity to seek solutions to the major international problems  in keeping with the purposes and principles of the Charter  so as to achieve the peace and well-being of mankind by meaningful universal consensus. The nations of the world will therefore welcome the fresh vigour with which the United Nations measures up to the task before it as the co-ordinator of man's efforts for his betterment  and not for his destruction.214.	Interference in the internal affairs of other States is one of the main causes of present international tension and its escalation into armed conflicts in many regions of the world. No State has the right to interfere  directly or indirectly  in the internal affairs of any other State. Consequently  armed or other interference  or threats  open or concealed  against the personality of a State or against its political  economic and cultural system is inadmissible.215.	Every nation has the inalienable right freely to choose its political  economic  social and cultural system without interference of any kind by another State. These principles have been adequately elucidated in the Charter and other relevant declarations of the United Nations with a view to promoting friendly relations and co-operation among States. Accordingly  any violations of these norms of international relations can only be of disservice to the community of nations.216.	May I take this opportunity to report on how and why Burma has ended its participation in the non- aligned movement  and explain our thinking on the subject. I led the Burmese delegation to the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  recently held at Havana and placed the views of Burma very clearly before it. May I be permitted to reiterate the gist of them here?217.	Burma went to Havana with hopes that the principles which had inspired the founding of the movement could be preserved and given new life. What happened at the Conference only disappointed and disillusioned us  and we saw that something decisive needed to be done if those principles were to be saved.218.	Burma therefore decided to submit to the Conference an urgent motion: to appoint a drafting committee charged with the task of defining the inviolable principles of the movement  the qualifications for and rules of membership  the functions and powers of the principal organs of the movement  and the procedures. After the draft was done  Burma suggested  it could be discussed and adopted  and the movement could start again  purified and renewed.219.	The Burmese delegation submitted the motion to the Conference  explaining that otherwise the movement would continue to exist only in name and be ever vulnerable to exploitation. We also reported to the Conference that  if it reached no decision on the motion but let things drift  we would withdraw and Burma's participation in the non-aligned movement would end. That was a decision made after serious thought 220.	The Burmese delegation left Havana on the day it had originally planned to leave  before the Conference was extended. The Conference  in any case  failed to take heed of our motion  and concluded without even a mention of it. Burma's decision to end its participation in the non-aligned movement therefore became operative from the end of the Conference. And Burma stands by that decision.221.	It may well be asked if Burma intends to organize a movement and has the ideas and invitations ready. That would be a pertinent question  but the straight and simple answer is No. As I have already stated  we submitted our motion to the non-aligned Conference at Havana with the sincere intention of preserving the true original principles of the movement  and not with any other motive or plan. If  however  like minds should move one day towards a community of nations sharing similar views and values  and willing to dedicate themselves to clear principles of non-alignment  Burma might feel persuaded to take its place as a member of that community.222.	May I reassure the members of the General Assembly that Burma will continue to practise the independent and active foreign policy which has been a constant article of faith with it  to cultivate its existing friendly relations with all countries  and to remain pledged to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the universal principles of peace and mutual respect.223.	The establishment of peace in the Middle East region is essential for all the peoples of that area  the security of the Mediterranean basin and the maintenance of world peace.224.	Burma is of the view that any solution to the Middle East problem  to be viable  should be comprehensive in nature. The basic prerequisite for the establishment of a just and lasting peace is the restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish their own State. Another requirement is the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Arab territories occupied in 1967  as any acquisition of territory by war is inadmissible. It is also clear that the state of belligerency should be effectively terminated in the area. Further  the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of all States in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries should be respected. These principles also apply equally to Israel.225.	The Palestinian question is the key to the solution of the entire Middle East problem  and without the settlement of this issue there can be no just and lasting peace in the area. Therefore  it is imperative that in any negotiations for a comprehensive settlement  the Palestinians should be represented with all other parties.226.	For the achievement of progress in negotiations and an ultimate settlement  there must be a sense of political will and reciprocal accommodation. Intransigence on the part of parties concerned will not be helpful in any way in the quest for a lasting settlement.227.	The struggles against colonialism  imperialism and racism continue to mount in Africa. Burma has consistently supported all struggles against colonialism  imperialism and racism  and I wish to affirm once again that Burma continues to support with fullest sympathy the struggles being waged today by the African peoples. Should this deteriorating situation persist there exists a real peril that Africa will emerge as a zone of tension endangering international peace and security. It is therefore evident that the relevant resolutions of the United Nations must be implemented in goal faith to improve the situation. If the existing resolutions are found to be inadequate in resolving outstanding issues  it might perhaps be necessary to seek more appropriate formula for adoption.228.	Burma has consistently supported the principles of sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of States as stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations. We stand strongly for the solution of all outstanding problems by peaceful means rather than by resort to the threat or use of armed force.229.	The situation in Indo-China is a source of deep concern to Burma. In principle  if the overthrow of an existing Government of a country by forces opposed to it  with the armed intervention of an outside Power  were to be condoned  the elementary rules and accepted norms of international relationships would be greatly impaired.230.	In common with other Member States  Burma views disarmament as a matter of universal concern and therefore does not  in principle  favour the rigid bilateralization of negotiations on any disarmament issue. However  given the complexity and the unique nature of the problem of strategic weapons  Burma shares the view that direct negotiations between the two principal nuclear-weapon Powers could be more effective.231.	Accordingly  at the General Assembly  we welcomed the opening of bilateral negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States in 1969 on the limitation and reduction of strategic weapons. Subsequently  we were gratified at the successful conclusion of the first round of SALT in 1972.232.	We welcome the recent second SALT Treaty as another significant step towards complete nuclear disarmament. We are particularly glad to know that the agreement would also place qualitative restrictions on the strategic arsenals of the two parties. However  we cannot help feeling that the agreed numerical ceilings are still far too high. Therefore  we hope earnestly that further negotiations will be undertaken without delay directed towards achieving a phased  balanced and significant reduction in the quantity and quality of strategic arms with a view to the ultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons from the arsenals of States.233.	To reinforce the viability of the SALT agreements  the conclusion of an underground test-ban treaty has clearly assumed greater urgency. Such a measure can help arrest the further qualitative development of nuclear weapons. Besides  it would complement the 1963 partial test-ban Treaty and lead to the final achievement of a comprehensive test-ban.â234.	The Second United Nations Development Decade is coming to a close but the expectations it had roused have been largely unfulfilled. There is still a wide gap between the rich minority of developed countries and the vast majority of developing countries. Gaps in income between the rich and the poor  and between the urban and the rural populations  still continue to exist. In fact  these gaps have become wider.235.	We believe that the entire international community  both developed and developing  shares the view that these gaps should be narrowed as soon as possible. To this end we should all work together to achieve a more equitable sharing of the growth of world output  which in fact is the primary aim of the new international economic order. Experience has shown that this task involves long  tedious  protracted and often exasperating negotiations between the developed and the developing countries. Furthermore  the current international economic situation does not provide us with cause for being optimistic about achieving significant results from these negotiations in the near future.236.	To be more fruitful and constructive  we wish to suggest that our immediate objective should be to achieve a just relationship in the world market  namely an improvement in the terms of trade between the prices of main exports of the developing countries and those of their imports. Our endeavour should also include promotion of processing of raw materials and expansion and diversification of exports  particularly to developed countries  and the improvement of the share of developing countries in transport  marketing and distribution of primary commodities. In seeking the goals of the new international economic order it will be necessary for all countries  developed and developing  to work together in greater economic co-operation  and on the basis of collective responsibility.237.	On the basis of what has been said  the Burmese delegation hopes that the thirty-fourth session will bend its energies towards meeting the many challenges before the international community."
"89",4754,"MNG",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  first of all  permit me  on behalf of the Mongolian delegation  to extend to you our most sincere congratulations on your well-deserved election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Like previous speakers  we consider this unanimous election a worthy tribute to your outstanding personal qualities and at the same time a recognition of the important and growing role of your country and the African continent in furthering the cause of peace  national independence and social progress. We are confident that your vast experience  skill and long association with this world body will certainly contribute to making this session yet another successful world meeting for the good of mankind  and we wish you every success in discharging your responsibilities.117.	I should like to take this opportunity also to express on behalf of the Government and people of the Mongolian People's Republic our deepest condolences to the delegation of the People's Republic of Angola and the Angolan people on the untimely demise of President Agostinho Neto. He will be remembered and cherished as a great son of the Angolan people  the founder of the glorious People's Republic of Angola and an outstanding leader of the national liberation and revolutionary movements of Africa.118.	A review of the events of recent years  and in particular of the decade of the 1970s now drawing to a close  convinces us that the world situation has substantially improved. This has become possible thanks to the steady growth and further strengthening of the forces of peace  national independence and social progress  and to the consolidation of their decisive link  that is  real socialism.119.	Evidence of the fresh successes of the national liberation and revolutionary movements of peoples can be found in the historic victory of the Vietnamese people in its struggle against the aggression of the major imperialist Power  the creation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  the victory of the people's democratic revolution in Afghanistan  the establishment of people's revolutionary power in Kampuchea  and the overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua and of the monarchist regime in Iran  and so forth. The further deepening of the process of social liberation of peoples is manifested by the profound socio-economic changes in socialist Ethiopia  the People's Republic of Angola  the People's Republic of Mozambique  the Democratic Republic of Madagascar  the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen  the People's Republic of the Congo and other young States.120. Today we welcome Saint Lucia  another young State which has joined the family of the United Nations.121. The non-aligned movement plays an ever-more positive role in world affairs. The Sixth Conference of the non-aligned countries recently held in Havana was an event of great international significance. It will undoubtedly occupy an important place in the struggle of peoples for the deepening of detente  for disarmament and for their national and social liberation  and against imperialism  racism and neo-colonialism.122.	Thanks to the initiatives and efforts of the socialist countries  a substantial shift has taken place in the relations among the States of Europe  which was reaffirmed in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  signed at Helsinki on 1 August 1975  in the corresponding bilateral treaties of the USSR  the Polish People's Republic  the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany.123.	An increasing role in the vital cause of strengthening peace and developing international cooperation is played by the United Nations. An important step has been taken towards harmonizing its activities with the world movement of the peoples for the prevention of a nuclear world war and for disarmament  a movement which is growing in strength.124.	In the 1970s a series of treaties and agreements on limiting the arms race and on disarmament has been concluded. Among them  the new Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Armaments  which was signed at Vienna on 18 June 1979 between the USSR and the United States of America  is of exceptional importance. This Treaty lays the necessary foundation for subsequent substantive steps on the quantitative and qualitative limitation and reduction of the most destructive types of weapons  gives a further impetus to the ongoing disarmament negotiations and favourably influences the international climate as a whole. We are convinced that the earliest possible ratification of this Treaty would be responsive to the vital interests of the peoples of the world. The Treaty is too important for mankind to become a subject of political manipulations by groups in a particular country.125.	Steady change in the correlation of forces in favour of peace  national independence and social progress of peoples has brought a positive shift in international relations  which is today called detente. We certainly do not minimize the importance of the display of reason and realism in the ruling circles of the West  of their recognition of the fact that there is no alternative to detente.126.	At the same time  we cannot and should not fail to take into account the fact that the opponents of detente have not laid down their arms. On the contrary  their actions of late have been intensified through the alarming collusion of the reactionary forces of imperialism and great Power chauvinism and expansionism. Plans to station in Europe new nuclear armaments  the creation of various expeditionary forces  the intensification of the military presence of the United States in the Indian Ocean and the Far East and the attempts to set up new military blocs in the Middle East  in Africa and in some other regions  as well as other similar actions by imperialist and reactionary forces  seriously vitiate the international atmosphere. Heavy responsibility rests with those forces which are to blame for the escalation of the arms race  the aggravation of existing hotbeds of international tension and the emergence of new ones.127.	The arms race and the anti-socialist and anti- Soviet campaign go hand in hand  as one is meant to justify the other. The essence of this policy lies in ensuring military superiority over the socialist world. The extreme danger of such a policy lies in the fact that in the world of today it verges on recklessness and adventurism.128.	The policy based on positions of strength stems from expansionist and hegemonistic ambitions. The essence of hegemonism is the violation of what is most sacred to all peoples  for it denies and encroaches on the undeniable right of others to live independently and freely. I believe that the serious concern of the Mongolian people regarding the policy of hegemonism is quite understandable. On the southern border of the Mongolian People's Republic is a country which in various ways continuously encroaches upon its sovereignty. On the other hand  we fully understand the hostile reaction of the Chinese representative here to the proposal of the Soviet Union to include on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly the item on the ""Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"". Those at whom the finger points always resort to deception and slander.129.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic welcomes the new Soviet initiative as a timely and crucial one. Constructive consideration of this question  condemnation of hegemonism and the adoption of an appropriate decision based on the draft resolution submitted by the Soviet Union would be an important step in the reaffirmation and the strengthening of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter  and would facilitate the improvement of the international situation as a whole.130.	We consider it logical that this question should be dealt with in the Security Council  the main organ of the United Nations for maintaining international peace  with a view to the subsequent elaboration of a binding rule that States renounce any policy of hegemonism in all its forms and manifestations.â131.	For preserving and strengthening world peace and security  the question of ceasing the arms race and preventing the danger of a nuclear world war is of crucial importance.132.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Re-public considers that the main step to be taken in stopping the nuclear arms race is to reach an agreement on the cessation of the production of all types of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of their stockpiles until they have been completely destroyed. A specific proposal on this question was put forward by the socialist countries in the Committee on Disarmament in February this year. We deem it necessary that the General Assembly lend its authority to this important initiative and recommend that the Committee on Disarmament expedite its work on this problem.133.	A general and complete prohibition of nuclear- weapon tests would prevent what is called the technological nuclear arms race  the most dangerous of all. The progress so far achieved at the tripartite negotiations should be furthered in order to reach a positive solution to this vitally important issue in the near future.134.	The strengthening of the regime of non- proliferation of nuclear weapons assumes ever greater urgency  particularly in the light of reports on the intention of additional States to acquire nuclear weapons. The second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be convened next year faces an urgent task that of elaborating further effective measures aimed at promoting international co-operation in strengthening the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.135.	Adoption of measures for the practical implementation of General Assembly resolution 33/72 entitled ""Conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non- nuclear States""  and for the achievement of an international agreement on the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on territories of States where there are no such weapons at present  would facilitate the strengthening of the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.136.	An agreement as early as possible on the text of a treaty on the prohibition of radiological weapons on the basis of the proposed USSR-United States joint document would represent a concrete step in prohibiting another type of weapon of mass destruction.137.	The Mongolian People's Republic is in favour of accelerating the negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons as well as on the reduction of conventional weapons.138.	A concrete programme of international action to put an end to the arms race and to bring about disarmament through the creation of favourable conditions for this purpose was put forward by the socialist States members of the Warsaw Treaty in the documents of the Moscow 1978 meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of that Organization and of the Budapest 1979 meeting of the Committee of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of those countries139.	The Mongolian People's Republic considers  inter alia  most timely the proposal of the socialist countries to convene a conference  at the political level  of representatives of the States which participated in the Helsinki Conference to discuss the questions of strengthening detente and easing military confrontation in Europe. In our view  such a conference could in the first place deal with the problems of reaching an agreement among the participants of the Helsinki Conference on the renunciation of the use of nuclear and other types of weapons against each other. This proposal of the socialist countries is acquiring ever greater urgency in the light of the further build-up of NATO forces in Europe.140.	In this connexion the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic  on behalf of its Government  warmly welcomes the new initiative of the Government of the Soviet Union aimed at reducing military confrontation in Europe  that is  its decision to withdraw from the territory of the German Democratic Republic within the next 12 months up to 20 000 Soviet servicemen and 10(30 tanks  and its readiness to reduce the number of nuclear systems deployed in the western part of the USSR provided that the other side renounces the deployment of additional nuclear-missile weapons on the territories of the European States members of NATO. My delegation hopes that this new act of goodwill on the part of the socialist countries  which meets the interest of strengthening peace and security in Europe and the world  will find a positive response on the part of the Western countries. I should further like to point out that this positive step by the socialist countries offers new possibilities for furthering the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. Progress in these talks clearly depends on the readiness of the Western countries to abide by the principle of equal security.141.	The delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic is convinced that the consideration of the whole complex of disarmament problems in the widest and most authoritative international forumâthe World Disarmament Conferenceâcould facilitate the adoption of effective disarmament measures  in particular in implementing the main provisions of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly [resolution 5-/0/2]  devoted to disarmament. We are in favour of the early convening of such a Conference at a level sufficiently high to permit the adoption of practical decisions.142.	The Mongolian People's Republic  like many other States  favours the speediest elaboration and conclusion of a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations which would represent an important political guarantee of the security of States  and would considerably strengthen mutual trust among them  thus creating a favourable political climate for furthering disarmament objectives.143.	The disarmament talks would be greatly enhanced by the adoption  at this session of the General Assembly  of a declaration on international cooperation for disarmament  the draft of which has been presented by the delegation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Such a declaration  which unifies the political principles in the approach of States to the vital issues of disarmament  would facilitate purposeful and effective negotiations in this field.144.	The Mongolian People's Republic naturally attaches particular importance to the problems of strengthening peace and security in Asia. In many parts of the vast continent people are still suffering from continual armed conflicts provoked by the forces of international reaction. Dangerous focal-point of tension continue to exist in Asia and even new ones are being created  threatening world peace and security. Moreover  there is evidence of the intensification of co-ordinated actions of the forces of imperialism  hegemonism and militarism in the Far East and in Asia as a whole. If further development of such events is not prevented  Asia could become a source of real danger to the cause of peace  national independence and the social progress of peoples. The Mongolian people  who 40 years ago  experienced the harmful consequences of the policy of connivance with the forces of war and reaction  cannot remain aloof in the face of the present trend  when the policy of hegemonism  spearheaded primarily against the socialist countries  is being encouraged in every way. In May 1939  militaristic Japan  which served as the Far Eastern bastion of the then ""anti-Comintern pact""  attacked the Mongolian People's Republic in great strength in order to convert it into a springboard of its further aggression against the Soviet Union. On the basis of the 1936 agreement between the two countries  the Soviet Union came to Mongolia's aid. The joint victory of the members of the new socialist world over one of the vanguards of imperialism in a fierce war  which was waged until 31 August 1939  that is to say  until the very beginning of the Second World War  remains of historical importance in the struggle of peoples against the forces of war and reaction.145.	Events occurring on the Indochinese Peninsula demonstrate the great danger posed by the hegemonistic  expansionist actions of forces which consider that it is their right to ""teach a lesson'' to other peoples and countries by the use of armed force.146.	The Mongolian People's Republic  like the rest of the world community  has resolutely condemned the armed aggression and continuing intrigues of the Chinese authorities against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and fully supports the struggle of the Vietnamese people in defence of its revolutionary gains  independence and the territorial integrity of its country.147.	Our people also strongly condemn Peking's encroachments on the national independence  territorial integrity and revolutionary gains of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Kampuchea. We express our warm solidarity with the peoples of Laos and Kampuchea.148.	In this connexion  I should like to note that the decision of the General Assembly to recognize the ""credentials"" of the representative of the bloodthirsty regime of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary  rejected by the Kampuchean people  is a black mark against this Organization and is in flagrant contradiction of the aims and principles of its Charter.149.	We wish to state once again that only the representatives of the lawful Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea are entitled to represent that country in the United Nations and the other international organizations.150.	The events in Afghanistan reveal that the reactionary forces are not willing to accept the fact that the new Government of Afghanistan is carrying out radical progressive transformations  having opted for the road towards building a society free from man's exploitation of man. We express our solidarity with the friendly Afghan people in their struggle in defence of the fruits of the people's democratic revolution from the encroachments of international reaction and their accomplices.151.	The Mongolian People's Republic holds the view that the Camp David deal and the so-called peace treaty between Egypt and Israel have betrayed the vital interests of the Arab peoples  in particular those of the people of Palestine  have created new obstacles to the achievement of a just peace in the Middle East and help to strengthen the position of imperialism and its allies in this region. The expansion of the Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the incitement of the separatist forces in the country is clear evidence of this. The Mongolian people stand on the side of the long- suffering Lebanese people in their struggle for the defence of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.152.	The Mongolian People's Republic upholds the well-known position on the comprehensive and just settlement of the Middle East problems which is supported by the peace-loving world community 153.	The Mongolian People's Republic consistently supports the struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful and democratic reunification of their country and is in favour of the immediate implementation of resolution 3390 B (XXX)  which provides for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the southern part of Korea and the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Command.154.	We advocate the strict implementation of relevant resolutions of the United Nations which reaffirm respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and its non- aligned status. In the opinion of the Mongolian delegation  the most appropriate instrument for the settlement of the Cyprus problem would be the convening of an international conference under the aegis of the United Nations.155.	The present situation in Asia urgently requires from the Asian States active joint efforts for the prevention of dangerous developments on that continent  for the strengthening of mutual understanding  trust and co-operation as the basic prerequisite for ensuring peace and security.156.	The Mongolian People's Republic  which consistently advocates the improvement of relations and the development of mutually advantageous co-operation among all States  welcomes the beginning of negotiations between the USSR and the People's Republic of China on the normalization of their relations. The progress of these negotiations would help to improve the political climate not only in Asia  but in the world at large. I would hope that both sides will equally be guided by this objective.157.	The situation in southern Africa remains a dangerous hotbed of international tension. The major Western Powers  in collusion with the racist regimes  are intensifying their intrigues aimed at slackening and undermining the national liberation struggle of peoples. Various manoeuvres  designed to impose neo-colonialist regimes on the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe through the so-called internal settlements and bogus elections  are being stepped up.158.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic believes that a genuine solution to the problem of southern Africa should be found through the elimination of the racist and colonialist regimes and the system of apartheid  and through the transfer of full power to the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe in the person of their legitimate representativesâSWAPO and the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe. In this connexion my delegation attaches great importance to the decisions taken by the OAU and the Sixth Conference of Heads of States or Government of Non- Aligned Countries on the question of southern Africa. The Mongolian People's Republic also advocates strict implementation of the relevant decisions and resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations in this area as one of the main prerequisites facilitating the struggle of the peoples of this region.159.	Thirty years have elapsed since the establishment of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistanceâ the organization of equal co-operation of the socialist States. This co-operation is an important factor for the dynamic development of their economies  the increased well-being of their peoples and for bringing the economies of all the members of the Council to the same level.160.	The share of the socialist community in the world production of national income and industrial output  as well as in other important economic indicators  has steadily increased. Today the countries members of The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  whose population constitutes 10.4 per cent of the world's total  account for one third of the world's industrial output and 25 per cent of the world's national income  as against 18 and 15 per cent  respectively  30 years ago.161.	The ties between the socialist countries develop the new type of international relations based on the principles of equality  respect for sovereignty and mutual assistance. This new type of relations  in its essence  represents that very new international economic order which the developing countries are striving to have universally established.162.	The democratization of international economic relations on the basis of equality  mutual advantage and mutual support has an important role to play in overcoming the economic backwardness young States have inherited from their colonial past.163.	At this session  we have heard repeated appeals by the representatives of the Western Powers to display solidarity and to recognize the need for interdependence in order to overcome economic difficulties. It is axiomatic  certainly  that no country  however economically powerful it may be  can manage without inter-national economic links. All countries benefit from equal economic co-operation. But when the developing countries raise the question of the democratization of existing international economic relations  of making them free from exploitation and diktat  the entire matter comes up against a blank wall erected by the West. Such hindrance of natural and legitimate processes gives rise to abnormal and crisis situations.164.	My delegation would like to point out that within the framework of the United Nations much has been done with regard to the elaboration of principles and programmes of action aimed at promoting the establishment of the new international economic order. In particular  we have in mind the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New Inter-national Economic Order adopted at the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. It is now imperative that practical measures be taken in the 1980s. In our opinion  this places a great responsibility upon the major conferences on economic matters that will be held at the beginning of the 1980s  such as the special session of the General Assembly on questions of economic development and co-operation. Preparations for these conferences should have as their aim the elaboration of concrete measures for the normalization and democratization of international economic relations.165.	My delegation expresses the hope that the present session will see the adoption of decisions that will promote the cause of deepening detente  strengthening international peace and developing co-operation. It is precisely along these lines that the Mongolian delegation will make every effort to contribute to the successful conclusion of the work of this session."
"90",4796,"MOZ",34,1979,"ï»¿On taking the floor for the first time in this session of the General Assembly  we respectfully bow in memory of a great statesman and freedom fighter  Mr. Agostinho Neto  President of the MPLA  Worker's Party and President of the People's Republic of Angola. His highly regarded humanistic nature and his commitment to justice and the struggle against imperialism make him an historic figure to be remembered forever. Not only did President Neto win admiration and affection from his own Angolan people and the struggling people in our own zone  but he was admired and loved by all peace-loving people throughout the world. For us  he was and will always be a symbol of fighting Africa. He will continue to be a symbol of that Africa determined to break loose the chains of colonialist and imperialist domination. For us  President Neto was and will always be the symbol of that Africa which builds on the happiness of the people. For us  a people fighting for a society free from exploitation of man by man  we believe the best way to pay homage to his memory can only be through the pursuance of his ideals of struggle for freedom and justice.179.	For us  who come from a zone of confrontation between liberty and domination  it is with special emotion that we congratulate you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. You come from the United Republic of Tanzania  a front-line State with which the People's Republic of Mozambique is united through ties of blood shed by our two peoples in the common struggle against colonial domination and imperialist aggression.180.	The party  the people and the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania were always with us in the struggle against Portuguese colonialism. Today we are together in the same trench in the struggle for the political and economic emancipation of our countries. The United Republic of Tanzania remains in the front line of our common struggle against racist and minority regimes in southern Africa. For its commitment to the struggle for liberation of the world in general  and of Africa in particular  your country became a permanent target of imperialist aggression. The invasion and massacres recently perpetrated by the racist horde of Idi Amin against the United Republic of Tanzania were intended to destroy a secure bulwark of national liberation movements. Once again justice and liberty triumphed. Once again terror and oppression were defeated.181.	Since 1971  Ambassador Salim Ahmed Salim in his capacity as Chairman of the Special Committee on decolonization has demonstrated not only the qualities of a great diplomat but also those of a true fighter for people who are subjected to colonial and racist domination. We are certain  Mr. President  that  with your experience and dedication to the ideals of liberation as well as your commitment to peace and progress  the work of this session will  under your enlightened guidance  be rewarded with a success which will be important in the coming decade.182.	The decade which will elapse in two months' time has been a qualitative success in terms of the liberation struggle of the peoples of the world in general and of Africa in particular.183.	In Asia  the peoples of Afghanistan and Iran succeeded in deposing dictatorial regimes which were part of the siege of imperialist fire against socialist forces. However it is the historic victory of the peoples of reunified Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea over the major imperialist Power that continues to inspire and encourage mankind's struggle for just societies  free from the exploitation of man by man.184.	In Latin America  the people of Nicaragua and Grenada swept away oligarchic dictatorships  paving the way for new possibilities of liberation in that region.185.	In Europe  following the collapse of the Salazar- Caetano Fascist-colonial dictatorship in Portugal  and that of Franco in Spain  the people of those countries re-established the freedom denied to them for more than 40 years through systematic terror and repression.186.	In Africa  for centuries subjected to pillage and colonial and imperialist domination and exploitation  the collapse of the Portuguese colonial empire; the in-dependence of Seychelles  Comoros and Djibouti; the overthrow of the backward imperial regime of Ethiopia; the destruction of the corrupt and dictatorial regimes of Uganda and Equatorial Guinea; and the revolutionary transformations in Benin  Madagascar  the Congo  Ethiopia and Seychellesâall constitute important victories for peoples that love peace and freedom.187.	In North Africa  the military  political and diplomatic successes of the Frente POLISARIO which resulted in the peace agreement between it and Mauritania have contributed to a greater isolation of the colonialist regime in Rabat. By signing the accord  Mauritania regained the dignity it had lost during its association with the expansionist and colonial adventures of Morocco. The new leaders of Mauritania have in that way shown a greater sense of responsibility and a comprehension of the inevitability of the victory of the peoples' struggle for self-determination and national independence.188.	On the other hand  Morocco has persisted in refusing to recognize and accept the existence of the nation of the Saharan people. Morocco is flagrantly violating the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations  particularly resolution 1514 (XV). Shamelessly  the Kingdom of Morocco is occupying by force that part of the Territory of Western Sahara which only yesterday it said belonged to Mauritania and is now claiming ownership of it. This clearly reveals how fallacious are the arguments of Morocco  which has no intention other than to camouflage its expansionist aspirations.189.	The international community must condemn this occupation and demand the withdrawal of the Rabat regime from Saharan territory so that the people of Western Sahara  under the enlightened leadership of the Frente POLISARIO  are able to promote in peace the development of their country. The People's Republic of Mozambique reiterates its total solidarity with the just struggle of the Saharan people.190.	It is in southern Africa  however  that the most significant changes have taken place. The proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola and of the People's Republic of Mozambique has shaken the imperialist strategy of the domination and exploitation of our peoples and of our natural resources. In Angola and Mozambique  the flag of proletarian internationalism is flying in the sight of the last bastions of racist and colonial domination. The independence of our two countries signalled the eventual collapse of the system of apartheid racism and colonialism. Imperialism does not readily accept that. Thus  while at the international level imperialism spreads calumnious campaigns of lies and defamation against the People's Republic of Mozambique and the People's Republic of Angola  it organizes  finances and intensifies military and logistic support for the racist regimes to attack our countries.191.	Desperate at their inability to liquidate the national liberation movements  the imperialist Powers are trying to co-opt movements by appearing as defenders of the liberation of the people of Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa.192.	In Washington  London  Paris  Bonn and other headquarters of power in the Western countries  plans are being orchestrated to safeguard what is euphemistically called' 'Western civilization''  something that was imposed on our people by whips and shackles  through cruelty and terror.193.	That is how the Anglo-American initiatives for Zimbabwe and the initiatives of the five Western Powers for Namibia came into being. Those initiatives were engendered to maintain hunger  misery  illiteracy and disease in Zimbabwe and Namibia. This is done to ensure that South Africa remains a farm  a private property for the transnational companies and a strategic base for aggression against and domination over the rest of Africa. Imperialism does not care that children are massacred in Nyazonia  that women are assassinated in Kassinga  that men are decimated by undernourishment in the plantations of Rhodesia or that young people are brutally murdered in Soweto for refusing ""acculturation"". Those are the ""Western democracy"" and ""Western values"" which are heroically resisted by the peoples of our zone.194.	The brutality of the racists and the imperialists finds an answer among our people  who  with weapons in their hands and with their own blood and through the sacrifice of their best sons  have drawn a frontier between freedom and oppression  between human dignity and servitude.195.	In Zimbabwe and Namibia  the armed struggle is gaining momentum and is tying the noose ever tighter around these centres of domination and exploitation. The Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe and SWAPO in Namibia  through the determination shown and the sacrifices made during their respective liberation struggles  have proved to be the only legitimate representatives of their respective peoples  and in this way have won the admiration and respect of the international community.196.	The legitimacy and justice of the struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia were unanimously reaffirmed by the International Conference in Support of the Peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia  which took place in Maputo in May of 1977.  As a result of that Conference  the racist and minority regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury were subjected to increased international isolation  and the manoeuvres of those two regimes  aimed at the establishment of puppet regimes  were denounced.197.	During that Conference  the international community reiterated the need for the implementation and application of sanctions decreed by the Security Council against the British colony of Southern Rhodesia and made an appeal for the imposition of a mandatory arms embargo against South Africa  which persists in the illegal occupation of Namibian territory.198.	That Conference condemned certain Western Powers which  in violation of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations  continue to supply military and other types of support which help to maintain the colonization of Southern Rhodesia and Namibia and encourage aggression against the front-line States.199.	On the other hand  the Conference made an appeal to the international community to increase political and financial assistance to the national liberation movements as well as to the front-line States. However  we must note with regret that  although we were united in making that decision  we are divided in implementing it. Thus we find that in Mozambique  Angola  Zambia and Botswana the aircraft inflicting massacres are of French patent  the weapons killing defenceless people are of Belgian make  the helicopters transporting mercenaries and machine-gunning schoolchildren are of American origin  and the fuel enabling the illegal regime to attack us is provided by the United Kingdom. With all this  they intend to impede the advance of the national liberation movements. The friends of exploitation and domination continue to support racism and colonialism.200.	In contrast  the socialist countries  the Nordic countries and other countries whose peoples prize peace and freedom have substantially increased their support for the liberation movements and the front-line States. It is from those countries that we receive ambulances and blankets for the refugee camps and seeds and tractors for our agricultural centres  which are being destroyed daily by the racists. Those countries supply us with physicians  engineers and technicians  with whom the liberation movements and the front-line States are building together the social progress of their peoples.201.	The socialist countries have been supporting the needs of our struggle. They supply us with the necessary weapons for the strengthening of our defence capacity  thus implementing the decisions of the Security Council.202.	The peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia answer the obstinacy of the colonialists and racists by intensifying their armed liberation struggle.203.	In Zimbabwe  the colonial Power has been compelled to face up to its responsibilities in the decolonization process primarily as a result of the political and military victories of the Patriotic Front as well as of the pressure of the international community.204.	It was within that framework that the United Kingdom agreed during the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries held recently in Lusaka to convene a constitutional conference in London with a view to sorting out a negotiated solution of the Rhodesian problem.205.	The Patriotic Front  in agreeing to participate in that conference  demonstrated again that the forces waging the fight for freedom can also negotiate a peace aimed at bringing about liberty and dignity for their people. The Patriotic Front  determined to contribute to the successful conclusion of that Conference  has shown maturity and flexibility in the negotiation process. It is the Patriotic Front that is making substantive concessions. As an example  in agreeing that 20 per cent of the seats in the Legislative Assembly in Zimbabwe be reserved for whites  the Patriotic Front has sacrificed an important aspect of its anti-racist principles  with the aim of facilitating the search for a solution.206.	The Patriotic Front is the main force in Zimbabwe leading the armed liberation struggle. The Patriotic Front is the legitimate representative of the Zimbabwean people. The Patriotic Front represents the ideals of freedom and justice. Therefore  all our support and solidarity must be given to the Patriotic Front. Nobody is more able than the Patriotic Front to determine whether or not the objectives for which it is fighting have been achieved. Only the attainment of these objectives can end the armed struggle and bring peace and  consequently  the lifting of sanctions.207.	The international community cannot accept the unilateral lifting of sanctions  as some of the most conservative circles in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom suggest. We hope that the Governments of those and other countries will resist pressures in that direction. The international community must condemn any Government in Zimbabwe that is not based on criteria established with the full agreement of the Patriotic Front.208.	On the question of Namibia  SWAPO  the frontline States and the international community have accepted the plan of the United Nations Secretary- General for the decolonization of that Territory in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and other relevant resolutions of our Organization.209.	Meanwhile  South Africa continues to refuse to implement that plan  in flagrant defiance of the decisions of the United Nations. Its intransigency results from the complicity of and support given by certain Western countries. 210.	It is the duty of the international community to denounce and condemn the delaying manoeuvres of South Africa and its allies  which seek to create obstacles in the way of the liberation process of the people of Namibia. The United Nations must take concrete measures against South Africa so as to ensure that the plan adopted by the Security Council will be applied. We must intensify our support for and solidarity with SWAPO  which is fighting for a free  united and indivisible homeland. Walvis Bay is an integral part of Namibia. Namibia belongs to Namibians  and no one can claim a right to appropriate any single part of its territory.211.	The main enemy of the peoples of Africa is the racist regime of Pretoria and its devilish system of domination and apartheid. Apartheid is hunger and' misery  disease and ignorance  acculturation and unemployment; in other words  apartheid is a complete denial of the human being.212.	Opposed by South African peoples  denounced and rejected by the international community  the apartheid regime tries to introduce cosmetic changes which do not modify in substance the structure of domination and discrimination. It is in this context that we witness the pseudo-liberalization of the regime in certain social domains. It is also in the same context that the policy of bantustanization was introduced. Through the Bantustans the regime of South Africa tries to create buffer States in order to protect the racist citadel. Through the Bantustans  it can put at its disposal a permanent reserve of a cheap labour force which ensures the continuity of the system of exploitation. Through Bantustans the people which constitute the South African nation are divided. That is why we say ""No"" to the Bantustan of Transkei  ""No"" to the Bantustan of Bophuthatswana and ""No"" to the Bantustan of Venda. And we will say ""No"" to any Bantustan.213.	It is a sacred duty of peace and freedom-loving forces  and particularly the United Nations  to support the liberation struggle of the South African people led by the African National Congress of South Africa.214.	The eradication of apartheid is an essential task of the whole of humanity.215.	We  the front-line States  feel that our own independence will remain incomplete until the day that all the people of southern Africa are free from colonialism and racism. Until that day we will provide a secure rear base of national liberation for the people of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa.216.	That is why in 1975  on the occasion of the admission of the People's Republic of Mozambique into the universal community of nations  we appealed for a complete and total boycott against the illegal and racist regime of Southern Rhodesia and affirmed our decisive readiness to assume all the responsibilities in conformity with our international duties.217.	A few months later  on 3 February 1976  the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique  His Excellency Samora Moises Machel  announced to the world the closing of our borders with the British colony of Southern Rhodesia in compliance with the sanctions imposed by Security Council resolution 253 (1968). This act constitutes our example of solidarity with the struggling peoples. It is not just a mere declaration of principles  because we converted it into concrete action.218.	The fulfilment of that and other pertinent resolutions has caused serious difficulties in the economy of our own country. These difficulties are aggravated by the fact that our economic structure  conceived by colonialism  had been oriented to serve the interests of the racist regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury. Hundreds of thousands of our workers went to the plantations and mines of Rhodesia. Towards Southern Rhodesia were directed important roads and railroad connexions. The main purpose of all these connexions was the transport of Rhodesian goods. The breach of this flow came to overburden our already weak economic situation. However  despite all of these difficulties  the Mozambican people are giving shelter to more than 160 000 Zimbabwean refugees  who are in need of food  health care  housing  clothing. They need hoes  tractors and other means of producing food. The children need milk and books. It is our people in Mozambique who endure the major part of this burden.219.	Our country is a victim of constant armed aggressions from the racists. Why does the enemy attack us? I should like to quote His Excellency Samora Moises Machel  the President of the People's Republic of Mozambique  in this connexion. He said:""What is the main objective of the enemy? It is to impede our support to the liberation movement of Zimbabwe  to obstruct our economic development and the consolidation of our independence. The Smith-Muzorewa regime carries out its role of devoted agent of imperialism in the area. Its tasks are to prevent the liberation of Zimbabwe  to prevent the liberation of South Africa and Namibia and also to destabilize the independent States in the area.""220.	In the beginning of September  just before the present Assembly session started  the enemy forces committed a total of 18 armed attacks and 65 frontier violations. In one of the biggest escalations ever  the Rhodesian forces used 13 Mirage planes  8 Bell helicopters  and 5 reconnaissance planes of other makes.221.	They came to spread death and destruction. Mozambicans were killed and wounded. They had as a main target an important agro-industrial complex in the Chokwe district. In this incursion they destroyed several bridges  factories and means of transportation. The enemy attacked  killed and destroyed without any discrimination.222.	The aggression was mainly concentrated in the provinces of Manica  Sofala and Gaza. The main targets were the civilian population  the refugee camps  the production centres  the means of communication and other strategic economic structures.223.	In their slaughter and plunder operations  the racist forces used a great number of planes and helicopters to spread destruction and terror. They shot old people dead  they cut open the wombs of pregnant women  they turned the children's gardens into cemeteries. They used napalm and fragmentation bombs against our hospitals and schools. 224.	Thus the criminal band violates the fundamental rules of war; they ignore the most elementary principles of human rights. The Smith-Muzorewa forces are seconded by mercenariesâthe famous criminal soldiers of fortune recruited from certain Western countries. Imperialist interests are defended by mercenaries. Hence  when the people's justice sentences them to deserved punishment  the imperialist mass media with a great outcry accuse us of dictatorship and violation of human rights.225.	The Security Council in its resolution 386 (1976) appealed to the international community to provide Mozambique with financial  technical and material assistance to enable it to implement its policy of economic independence vis-a-vis the racist regime of Rhodesia and to provide us with better conditions for complying with United Nations mandatory sanctions. The same Council in resolution 411 (1977) appealed to the international community to reinforce our defence capability.226.	Nevertheless  we find that the majority of the international community has not honoured its commitment.227.	However  it is important to emphasize that solidarity with the peoples of Zimbabwe and the front-line States has been shown in a positive and consistent way  especially by the socialist and the Nordic countries that have  in compliance with the decisions of the United Nations  rendered considerable support to our programmes of economic and social development  national defence and assistance to the refugees.228.	With the support of all peoples of the world and  most of all  relying on its own strength the Mozambican people are very confident of victory. The main factor of victory is men who are fully aware; a mobilized and organized people like ours.229.	In Mozambique  Zimbabwe  South Africa and Namibia the enemy is doomed to defeat.230.	Let us at this stage pay a tribute to Mr. Kurt Waldheim for his relentless efforts to solve all the intricate problems facing mankind today. Particularly  we want to thank him for his role in the liberation of southern Africa and the consolidation of the newly independent countries.231.	The United Nations has since 1947 been discussing the situation in the Middle East. Several resolutions  recommendations and decisions have successively been adopted by the General Assembly  the Security Council and other international institutions and forums. However  the problem is still there without any solution. On the contrary  the situation in loco is worsening day by day.232.	Why does the problem of the Middle East remain unsolved  despite being considered one of the major concerns of humanity? For us the answer is clear and simple. It is imperialism and its ally  Zionism  which persist in opposing the inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine to self-determination and national independence and the creation of their own sovereign State and which remain stubborn in their illegal and repressive occupation of the Arab territories seized since June 1967.233.	Imperialism and Zionism develop manoeuvres in order to maintain the status quo of domination and oppression and intensify aggression against the Arab people  thus increasing the tension already existing in the region.234.	Unsatisfied with the regrettable situation prevailing in the Middle East  imperialism patronizes the capitulation of Egypt and its treason to the cause of Palestinian and Arab peoples  reinforces the aggressive military capability of the Zionist regime against Lebanon and the Palestinian refugees and encourages the Zionist colonization of the occupied Arab territories.235.	A lasting peace in the Middle East is not coadunate with the vile treason to the Palestinian cause  which is now considered ""courage''; and it cannot be in sympathy with the Zionist aggression and colonization of Arab peoples.236.	A lasting peace implies respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinians to self-determination  national independence and the creation of their own free and sovereign State under the leadership of the PLO; and it also implies the unconditional  total and complete withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories. A separate peace is meaningless while all Arab nations and the Palestinian people are still under Zionist bayonets. In this context the People's Republic of Mozambique denounces and condemns the separate accords between Egypt and Israel and reiterates its support for solidarity with the just struggle of the Palestinian people under the leadership of the PLO and with the Arab peoples for a comprehensive and just solution of the problem of the Middle East in accordance with their legitimate aspirations.237.	The serious problems of South-East Asia are the consequences of the very long period of colonial and imperialist domination imposed on the peoples of Indo-China. We believe that forgetting the past leads us to indulge in an incorrect analysis of the recent events in the region. For us this is not a fortuitous conclusion  but the result of the experience and practice of our people recently liberated from colonial and imperialist domination.238.	A military defeat creates a political misfortune and a crisis of international credibility. Furthermore  in the case of a major imperialist Power  defeat generates the disintegration of its system of domination. The core of the South-East Asian problem consists in the attempt of imperialism to erase its shameful defeat in IndoChina. This explains the increased manoeuvres  political  diplomatic and economic pressures and propaganda against the nations of this region  which are following an independent and socialist path.239.	The correct and adequate answer of the international community to this situation must be an increase of concrete material support to the people of this region to enable them to reconstruct their countries ravaged by the war of imperialist aggression and to create that climate of good-neighbourliness and stability among themselves which is very important for their rapid progress and development.240.	In a period in which human rights is the theme of most public statements  we are forced to sit together in this chamber with those who represent bestiality and genocide in Kampuchea. But we are sure that history  which is made by people  will soon rectify this situation and once more condemn those who are against the true representatives of the people. For us  as well as for the people of Kampuchea  the situation in that country is irreversible. The Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea is the legitimate representative of the Kampuchean people and the only one entitled to participate in that capacity in all international organizations and forums  particularly in the United Nations.241.	Still in the Asia region  the situation prevailing in East Timor is of concern to us. The colonization and repression of the people of East Timor forbids us to keep silent  particularly when the Maubere freedom fighters continue to struggle for the liberation of their occupied country  notwithstanding the sacrifices that entails. The representative of the Portuguese Government  the administering Power  very recently declared in this Assembly that the process of decolonization of East Timor is not yet accomplished. The Maubere people reject annexation  and the administering Power does not accept the fait accompli. That is why the international community cannot remain indifferent to the courageous and difficult struggle for national liberation being waged by the Maubere people against Indonesian colonialism and for the regaining of their inalienable right to self-determination and national independence. The United Nations must take the appropriate measures to force Indonesia to withdraw from East Timor and to allow the process of decolonization to go forward to its conclusion.242.	Once again the People's Republic of Mozambique is compelled to denounce and condemn the Indonesian occupation and repression in East Timor. In accordance with the decision taken at the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries  we reaffirm our unconditional support for the just struggle for national liberation being waged by the Maubere people  led by FRETILIN. 243.	We demand the total withdrawal of the foreign occupation forces from the southern part of Korea and we reaffirm our solidarity with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  devoted as it is to the peaceful unification of Korea.244.	We also express our solidarity to the people and Government of the Republic of Cyprus in their struggle to achieve strict respect for their sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment.245.	We feel encouraged by the victories of the Latin American peoples over imperialist  colonialist  dictatorial and Fascist domination.246.	We salute Saint Lucia  a recently liberated country formerly under colonial domination and now accepted by this Assembly as a full Member of our Organization. We offer our friendship and co-operation to Saint Lucia.247.	Our friendship and solidarity goes equally to the people and Government of Grenada  which has liberated itself from a dictatorial regime. We salute its brave decision to sever totally the relations that existed between it and the racist regimes of southern Africa  thereby contributing to the victories of oppressed peoples.248.	We bring special greetings from the people of Mozambique to the Nicaraguan people and the Sandinist National Liberation front for their historic victory over the Somoza dictatorship and oligarchy. Weapons in hand  the Nicaraguan people destroyed one of the most obsolete and hideous dictatorships of Latin America. We reaffirm our militant solidarity with the people and Government of the new Nicaragua in their efforts towards national reconstruction. We appeal to the international community urgently to grant the necessary assistance for the reconstruction of this country  destroyed by the plundering engaged in by Somoza and the war he imposed on its people.249.	The entry into force of the Torrijos-Carter treaties on the Panama Canal is a victory for the people of Panama. We consider this an important step in their conquest of total sovereignty over the Panama Canal. In Puerto Rico and Belize  the colonial situation continues. Guantanamo is still occupied by United States troops. We reiterate our support of and solidarity with the peoples of Puerto Rico and Belize in their just struggle for self-determination and national independence  and we demand the complete and unconditional withdrawal of American troops from Guantanamo  an integral part of socialist Cuba.250.	We condemn the recent decision of the United States Government to reinforce its military presence in Guantanamo and in the entire Caribbean area. This move will endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries of that region.251.	We express our solidarity with the just struggle of the Chilean people for liberty and democracy against the Pinochet dictatorship.252.	We denounce and condemn the military and Fascist regimes of South America that maintain close ties of friendship and co-operation with the racist and minority regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury  which are planning to create an aggressive military pact in the southern Atlantic.253.	Peace  stability and human progress are indivisible. The struggle for peace is an integral part of the liberation of oppressed peoples. It demands concrete and effective measures to bring about general and complete disarmament  including nuclear disarmament. The bases for establishing a new  just and equitable international economic order are liberty and peace.254.	The recent signing of the SALT Treaty  which we hope will soon be ratified by the United States Government  constitutes an important contribution to the solution of the problem of the nuclear arms race. We salute this important Treaty  and we hope that it will encourage the parties involved in these negotiations to proceed to general and complete disarmament  and particularly nuclear disarmament.255.	We feel that if the industrialized countries could reach agreement on lowering the high budgets they are devoting to the arms race and utilize the sums released for the benefit of development  they would be effectively participating in the elimination of the starvation and hunger that are undermining the majority of mankind; this  too  would contribute to the cause of disarmament.256.	The disarmament process is a long and tortuous one. It demands political will  mutual confidence and  most of all  the determination to create a better future for our children.257.	It is this same determination that leads us to denounce and condemn the support the imperialist Powers are giving to the apartheid regime for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The technological and material assistance given to this regime for nuclear purposes can only aggravate the already explosive situation by assisting in the continued existence of racist regimes.258.	We also condemn the increasing reinforcement of the imperialist military presence in the islands of Diego Garcia  Reunion  and occupied Mayotte  as well as the establishment of the South African military base at Simonstown; we forcefully repudiate the United States Government's decision to deploy its Fifth Fleet in the Indian Ocean  as well as the recently declared intention of the President of the United States to increase his country's presence in that region.259.	For us such actions of imperialism constitute a serious and direct threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries of the regionâespecially the southern African Statesâas well as a serious threat to international peace and security.260.	The materialization of the decisions concerned with the denuclearization of Africa and the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace free of nuclear weapons is a must if we want to see general and complete disarmament and world peace.261.	It is with special interest that we address ourselves to the problems of international peace and security. Motivated by the same special interest  we support the convening of the second special session of the General Assembly to be devoted to disarmament  and we are committed to the materialization of the World Disarmament Conference in the near future.262.	The energy crisis constitutes a factor of great concern for the international community. In this context  we are of the opinion that it is important to identify new and renewable sources of energy so that they may meet the demands of economic and social development and those of industrial capability growth.263.	The convening of an international conference in 1981 on new and renewable sources of energy has to aim at elaborating measures conducive to concerted action likely to promote their value and utilization. Such measures have also to meet future needs in the field of energy as part of the efforts undertaken to expedite economic development  particularly in developing countries.264.	At the same time  we deem it necessary to carry out measures aimed at promoting and encouraging research and development in the exploitation of new technologies and the creation of conditions to make them accessible to developing countries. Thus the whole of mankind would benefit from the outcome of that conference.265.	By the same token  we think that the holding of an international conference on the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy for economic and social development will constitute a contribution to peoples' social and economic development.266.	Certain industrialized capitalist countries strongly protest against the rise of the price of oil  to the extent of trying to persuade us that it is the cause of the ever-increasing inflation and recession in their economies. We reject this manoeuvre of accusing oil- producing developing countries of being responsible for such phenomena  which are nothing but the product of contradictions inherent in the capitalist system.267.	We consider legitimate the decision by the oil- producing developing countries to review the price of this raw material as a measure for defending and controlling their natural resources.268.	However  we are mindful that the developing countries are the most affected by the economic consequences of the ever-increasing price of oil. Therefore we deem necessary the adoption of urgent appropriate measures to alleviate the situation of these countries  which not by chance are also importers of all the consequences inherent in the present crisis of the capitalist economy.269.	The many proposals already made in the search for compensatory solutions to this situation allow us to foresee surely positive results in the next negotiations of a global character.270.	In the interval between this thirty-fourth General Assembly session and the previous one  we the developing countries tried to find negotiated solutions to the problems of the present international economic situation through various ways. Nevertheless  that situation is becoming more and more catastrophic to the whole international community  but with greater incidence on our developing countries.271.	It is not by accident that this has happened. There is a deliberate persistence in the way some capitalist developed countries and economic financial institutions behave. They act as instruments of domination  of establishment of zones of influence and of economic division. They are pursuing a policy of interference in the internal affairs of our countries. They impose measures to limit our national sovereignty  thus hampering the exercise of peoples' fundamental right to develop themselves according to the economic  political and social paths chosen by them.272.	Africa is the most flagrant example of this  in the sense that it remains the most seriously affected region as a result of blocking movements imposed on its development and based fundamentally on manoeuvres to perpetuate structures of domination inherited from colonialism  whose consequences have reached the maximum of harm.273.	May I be allowed to mention the particular case of my country.274.	The People's Republic of Mozambique is a developing country ruined by colonialism and devastated by war and is among the most seriously affected by natural disasters. We are engaged in our national reconstruction and in creating conditions conducive to our breaking away from under-development and to the setting up of a society free from the exploitation of man by man. This rupture with under-development will take us to complete independence  which comprises the consolidation of political independence and the materialization of economic independence.275.	In its attempt to perpetuate structures of domination in Rhodesia and South Africa and to spread them to the neighbouring countries  imperialism acts against our efforts through open aggression  economic sabotage and other methods of destabilization. Not with-standing all these manoeuvres  a number of achievements have been recorded by the Mozambican people as a product of their determination to establish a planned economy.276.	The People's Republic of Mozambique has experienced some years of rich undertakings  which culminated in the preparation of the 1979/1980 biennial State plan. This plan will constitute our spring-board to development in the decade of the 1980s known in our country as the ""Decade of the Liquidation of Under-development"". This plan will enable us to embark on a process of the generalized recovery of our economy.277.	This struggle for generalized recovery is not circumscribed within undertakings of an internal character only: it comprises a series of initiatives of larger dimensions.278.	In the field of sub regional economic and technical co-operation  the People's Republic of Mozambique  together with other independent countries of the region  is taking action with a view to reducing its economic dependence by strengthening its links with them which are intended to achieve meaningful regional integration and the mobilization of their resources for the promotion of national  inter-State and regional policies.279.	This action is focused primarily on the improvement of strategic sectors  namely transport and communications  agriculture  industry and trade  the structure of which is inadequate at present as it has been inherited from colonialism and cannot therefore meet the needs of the present stage of development.280.	Allow me in this connexion to quote His Excellency President Samora Machel  who has said:""The People's Republic of Mozambique  as a socialist country  has always raised very high the flag of peace and co-operation among peoples  which is at the same time the flag of solidarity with the just struggle of the oppressed peoples. We are open to the development of economic and trade relations with all countries irrespective of their social system.""281.	The struggle against under-development find for the radical restructuring of international economic relations is shared by other developing countries which in a concerted action in Arusha  at the Fourth Ministerial meeting of the Group of 77  adopted a comprehensive programme of collective self-reliance and a framework for negotiations that would be conducive to successful results for the fifth session of UNCTAD.282.	It is important here to stress the political goodwill demonstrated by the developing countries  which  notwithstanding their diversity of interests and the different social systems prevailing among them  have always been able to set up a framework of understanding in all efforts aimed at the democratization of international trade relations. However  we note with great concern that the developed capitalist countries are using all possible devices to cause the further deterioration of international economic relations  which are already weak.283.	The growing protectionist measures  the ever increasing inflation and monetary fluctuations have led to constant instability in the raw-materials trade and to abuses by imperialist monopolies acting through transnational corporations. We understand this situation to result from an absence of political goodwill on the part of the capitalist countries in the establishment of the New International Economic Order. Their arrogance and persistence  their delaying manoeuvres and the other devices they use with the aim of fragmenting global treatment of matters of international concern  thus evading the fulfilment of their obligations  have led to meaningless achievements at the fifth session of UNCTAD and in other international forums such as the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 and the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy.284.	In order to maintain their privileged position  which was obtained through exploitation of the developing countries' natural resources  developed countries are now introducing new concepts such as ""access to supplies""  ""selective graduation""  utilization of ""a global strategy for basic needs""  ""interdependence"" and ""differentiation""  thus distorting the genuine objective of international co-operation and even distracting us from the development priorities of our countries. That is how imperialism exercises its present subjugation policy in international forums.285.	We are particularly concerned with the present stalemate of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  and we should like here to mention the constant threats of unilateral legislative decisions concerning the sea-bed made by the industrialized countries in an open challenge to the moratorium decision approved by our world today.286.	We resolutely condemn those threats  as well as the moves of the United States of America aimed at concluding mini-conventions with other States outside the framework of the United Nations  thus violating the principles of the United Nations enshrined in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV).287.	We urge all Member States to dedicate all their efforts to adopting  as soon as possible  a universal convention within the framework of the New International Economic Order.288.	Notwithstanding all the divisionist attempts by imperialism among developing countries  the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries  held recently in Havana  Cuba  took an important step in proposing negotiable solutions for the establishment of the New International Economic Order and a set of global negotiations relating to international economic co-operation for development.289.	In this connexion we want to express our appreciation for the endorsement of this decision by the Foreign Ministers of the Group of 77 at the meeting held last month here in New York 290.	My country also welcomes the results regarding institutional and financial issues achieved at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development.  We sincerely regret that that Conference did not take decisions on the majority of important issues on its agenda  because of traditional intransigence and the lack of political will among certain Western countries.291.	On the eve of the adoption of the new international development strategy for the third United Nations development decade  and in the present world political and economic context  we feel it necessary to reaffirm our commitment to the objectives and principles enshrined in the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly 292.	Let the great projects that were initiated in connexion with the International Year of the Child enlighten our works in the next decade so that children of all societies may grow up healthy  with adequate food  clothing and education  and in an environment full of love and affection.293.	Let us apply the national and international directives of the International Year of the Child and go forward towards the construction of a better world for our children. The future of our development lies with them.294.	The International Year of the Child is coming to its end. Let us now unite and commit ourselves to the protection of new generations from the scourge of war  starvation and misery in the forthcoming decade  the decade of struggle against under-development.295.	A luta continua."
"91",4841,"MRT",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of my Government  and also on my own behalf  I should like to convey to Ambassador Salim A. Salim our warm congratulations upon his unanimous election to the presidency of this session. That election is the eloquent testimony of the international community to his competence  his sense of responsibility  and his dedication not only to the cause of Africa but also to that of our Organization. Today more than ever we need those qualities in order to find the right path that will lead us towards the proper solutions to the problems of our world  which has been shaken by so many upheavals.232.	We also extend our congratulations to the former President  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  who guided the work of the thirty-third session with so much skill and efficiency.233.	Finally  we address our congratulations to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his tireless efforts to maintain the credibility and effectiveness of our Organization.234.	I should also like to take this opportunity to welcome Saint Lucia to the international community and to assure it of our co-operation.235.	Our Organization was born of the will of the States which are its Members to be the guarantor of the peace  justice and well-being of the whole of mankind. My country has been and remains firmly attached to these principles.236.	Mauritania is a peaceful country and has always aspired to be an element in bringing countries closer together and not an element of division  an element of balance and not one of discord or confrontation.237.	In keeping with this tradition  we wished to put an end once and for all  at least for our part  to the war which has been raging in our region for four years. In signing the Algiers Agreement of 10 August 1979 with the Frente POLISARIO  my country has clearly indicated its intention to end the war and to recognize the right to self-determination of the Saharan people. At the same time  Mauritania made public a declaration stating its strict neutrality in this conflict and its determination to live within its internationally recognized borders in a spirit of friendship  understanding and co-operation with all its neighbours.238.	The question of the Western Sahara is only one of the numerous and painful problems which our continent of Africa is facing  particularly in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa.239.	In mentioning the scourge of southern Africa  I should like here to pay a tribute to one of the greatest sons of our continent  Agostinho Neto. The premature death of President Neto is an irreparable loss for Angola  for Africa and for the whole of mankind. It further accentuates the drama of the peoples who live in this part of our continent and who are bravely fighting for their independence and dignity.240.	In Zimbabwe  formerly Rhodesia  the rebellion which has tried to assume legal forms has only further strengthened the determination of the freedom fighters  who consider  as we do also  the so-called elections which have taken place in the Territory as a disguised form of colonization and domination. In its manoeuvres  the Rhodesian regime is still continuing to pit Africans against Africans and to interfere in the affairs of the States which border on Zimbabwe by sowing destruction and death there.241.	It is therefore time that our Organization went beyond the stage of theoretical sanctions against the Salisbury rebels in order to adopt measures recommended by the Charter so as to impose the rule of law and justice in this part of Africa.242.	We are greatly gratified to see that the United Kingdom  the administering Power  and the other members of the Commonwealth decided during the course of the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held at Lusaka last August to carry out further examination of the question in order to find a satisfactory solution to it. We think that the support given to this plan by the front-line countries of Africa  and also the fact that the Patriotic Front has committed itself to the dynamic initiative thus launched  will create an auspicious occasion which the United Nations can exploit to help all parties reach a final negotiated solution to the drama of the people of Zimbabwe. The Mauritanian Government  for its part  will continue to give its active and unreserved support to the Patriotic Front until the advent of true and total independence in Zimbabwe.243.	In Namibia  despite the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council  and despite the final opinion of the International Court of Justice  the South African administration continues to impose its presence in a Territory which the United Nations was mandated to lead to independence.â244.	A process had been launched on the basis of the plan of the five Western Powers'8 which embodied a reasonable framework for the settlement of the Namibian question. Having given its consent to the implementation of this plan  South Africa decided  contrary to all expectations  to violate its own commitments by organizing in Namibia elections to which nothing in the world could give legitimacy.245.	The degradation of human dignity has in this part of the world today reached its nadir. The strengthening of apartheid has led  despite the warnings of our Organization  to bantustanization  which today represents a challenge to the international community.246.	The Immorality Act  the Colour Bar Act  the Native Land Act  the Group Areas Act; in every respect  these weapons in the arsenal of laws and rules imposed on the South African people constitute an insult to ethics  justice and right. The paradox is that over the past years  we have been helpless witnesses of this policy of faits accomplis and of the escalation of violence as a consequence of the domination and exploitation of the South African people by the Pretoria administration.247.	The bloody crushing of the Soweto uprisings  and the murder on 12 September 1977 of the leader of the Black Consciousness movement  Steve Biko  have brought about a now irreversible situation of resistance and permanent struggle.248.	But the drama of southern Africa is unfortunately not the only one to pose a threat to international peace and security. In the Middle East  Israel continues to defy the international community and to act in violation of the Charter of our Organization and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council.249.	The peoples of Palestine and Lebanon continue to endure occupation  exactions  repression and murderous bombardments to which they are daily subjected by the Israeli army.250.	All the attempts undertaken in our Organization or in other forums to find a just and lasting solution to this problem have been balked by Israeli intransigence and its determination to continue its policy of occupation and of creeping colonization by occupying the Arab territories.251.	However  our Assembly has  in various resolutions  worked out the basis of a just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East; it has in fact perceived that the whole solution rests on the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. In this connexion  I should like to pay a tribute to the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  and to its President  Ambassador Medoune Fall  for the outstanding efforts they have made in respect of the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The General Assembly endorsed the recommendations of the Committee  which represent an important contribution to the sincere efforts already made to resolve this problem.252.	We believe that a just and durable peace in the Middle East depends on the restoration to the Palestinian people of their inalienable rights  including the right to self-determination  to independence and to national sovereignty. Only such an approach could lead to a lasting settlement of the crisis in the Middle East. My Government is convinced of the need for the participation of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  on an equal footing with all the other parties in all conferences and negotiations.253.	Any attempt to ignore the PLO in the quest for a settlement of the Middle East conflict could only delay a solution to this conflict. My Government will continue to give its steadfast support to the Palestinian people and to their legitimate representative  the PLO  and to the brother Arab States in their bid to liberate their occupied territories; and we should also like to assure our Lebanese brothers of our unyielding support in their struggle for independence and national integrity.254.	Another problem which is still causing great anxiety to the international community is that of refugees. The flow of refugees in Africa and in South-East Asia is a source of deep concern to the international community.255.	My Government would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the laudable efforts that they have made in order to improve the situation and the living conditions of those refugees.256.	My Government believes that the application of various conventions  covenants and other rules of law governing the conduct and responsibility of Governments in this matter will greatly assist in improving the situation of the refugees and will help to alleviate their situation.257.	We nevertheless remain convinced that a final solution to this problem lies in respect by all States for the principles contained in the Charter of our Organization and  in particular  the principles concerning the settlement of disputes through peaceful means.258.	One of the causes of the exodus of refugees in South-East Asia is the conflict raging in that area. My country has never spared its efforts to try to help the countries of South-East Asia  and we do indeed hope that understanding  co-operation and solidarity will return to this part of the world  which a long and loyal friendship with the People's Republic of China and other States in this region has taught us to know and appreciate.259.	Colonization  the exploitation of man by man  racism and apartheid  are scourges of our times with which we have unfortunately become too familiar and against which we have been struggling with some success. But there is another scourge which is an equally dangerous threat to peace and stability in the world  the scourge of hunger. More than two thirds of mankind are threatened by famine. A minority of States continues to become richer; the remainder of mankind becomes more impoverished year by year. This must change. A frank and fruitful dialogue must be established between rich and poor  between industrialized and underdeveloped countries; in a word  a new economic order must be established.â260.	We have had a series of ""development decades "" and others concerned with ""development strategies  the ""deterioration of the terms of trade "" a ""new international economic order "" and so forth. Today it is the problem of energy that is in fashion  so to speak. In this connexion  I would draw the attention of the developing countries in particular to the insidious campaign that has been unleashed against the Arab oil-producing countries  a campaign whose motives and origins we are quite familiar with.261.	Since we last met here  the situation which has now come to be known as the North-South dialogue does not seem to have undergone any improvement sufficient to enable the international community to embark with justified optimism on the third United Nations development decade  the framework and objectives of which we are now trying to define.262.	This stagnation in a field which comprises questions of capital importance and predominates more and more  within our Organization  over all others  whatever their nature  is even more regrettable since  over the past 12 months  several meetings have been held to discuss such important problems as international trade  science and technology for development  agrarian reform  rural development and many others. 263.	My country  which on many occasions has asserted and proved its faith in the United Nations as the sole appropriate framework within which world problems such as those that are now arising at the level of international economic relations can be usefully discussed  placed great hopes in the work of those various meetings held under the auspices of the United Nations.264.	These hopes were  we thought  even more well founded since the daily increasing imbalance in trade relations between North and South  the structural deficit characteristic of the balance of payments of most developing countries and the hunger and malnutrition to which hundreds of millions of human beings seemed to be condemned for ever constitute just some of the problems which continue to threaten the very survival of mankind. The urgency of the need to find adequate and over-all solutions to these problems no longer needs to be demonstrated  for it is becoming more and more clear that such an effort is not just in the interests of the developing countries alone  but in the interests of the international community as a whole.265.	To be sure  it proved possible to arrive at a consensus on a certain number of questions such as the programme of assistance to the least advanced countries. But without denying its importance  the results of the fifth session of UNCTAD  held at Manila this summer  seem quite scant if we consider the crucial problems which were included in its agendaâthe transfer of technology  the indebtedness of developing countries  the international monetary systemâfor which not even the beginnings of a solution was produced.266.	However  we remain confident that the competent organs of UNCTAD  to which the questions that were not solved in Manila have been referred  will be able to make headway in studying them. It would indeed be inadmissible and even dangerous if these problems were to remain intact until the sixth session of UNCTAD. On the other hand  the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held recently in Vienna  has  for its part  established measures which if faithfully and rapidly applied  would without any doubt contribute to remedying the lag of the developing countries in this field.267.	It is to be hoped that the special session which is to be devoted next year to economic development problems will enable us to remove some of the obstacles which still exist on the long and difficult path towards the establishment of the new international economic order.268.	That is why it is necessary to prepare its work very carefully. The Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 has been working on this for more than two years. Born out of the awareness of the international community of the need to have within the United Nations itself a central organ entrusted with following and monitoring at the very highest level the implementation of the measures decided on for the establishment of a new  more just and more equitable world order  that Committee should  in our view  given the predominantly political role entrusted to it  constitute the ideal framework for substantial action-oriented negotiations in which precise commitments should be undertaken and precise measures established.269.	The pace of work of the Committee and the results obtained so far  which we can only term as modest; unfortunately do not encourage much optimism. However  we are convinced that with greater political will from the developed countries the Committee could successfully complete the task entrusted to it.270.	In conjunction with the preparation for the special session of the United Nations General Assembly  preparation is under way also for the third United Nations development decade. The work of the Committee entrusted with determining the outline of the strategy and defining its objectives  does not seem to be going ahead at a pace which would make possible the adoption of the strategy at the special session. It is to be hoped that  on a question of such importance for the future of mankind  solidarity and co-operation will prevail in the end.271.	As a country which is essentially agricultural and pastoral  Mauritania attaches special importance to the measures which will be established in the strategy in order to remedy the lag of the developing countries in the agricultural sector. In this connexion  our participation in the work of the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development  held recently in Rome  clearly reflects our interest in this question. At its twentieth session  to be held in 1981  the General Conference of FAO should take the measures recommended to it by that World Conference  which were designed to help Member States in the implementation of the programme of action.272.	In view of the preponderant role of the agricultural sector in our economy  its evolution and diversification have been greatly influenced by the lagging behind in agricultural production. This delay  as everyone knows  took the form of an increase in agricultural production of only 2.6 per cent per annum for the whole of the developing countries during the course of the second half of the 1970s  a rate much below the target of 4 per cent established for the Second United Nations Development Decade. But the rate was even lower in Africa and in Asia  where it fell spectacularly over the first half of the 1970s in low-income countries.273.	In Africa  this decline is due in part to particularly unfavourable climatic conditions  evidenced by a prolonged drought in the countries in the Sudano-Sahelian region. In Mauritania  the effects of this terrible scourge are still being felt in all sectors of the national economy  despite the pooling of efforts on the national and international levels.274.	In this connexion  I should like to express once again the gratitude of the Mauritanian Government and people to the countries and to the governmental or private organizations that have so generously responded to the appeals made on behalf of our populations  so sorely afflicted by 10 consecutive years of drought.275.	I have come to the end of my statement. On behalf of my Government  I have attempted to emphasize certain matters that  in our view  affect peace  stability and co-operation in our world  that peace and stability for which our Organization was created."
"92",4887,"MUS",34,1979,"ï»¿I bring to the representatives and the United Nations the warm greetings of the people of Mauritius.3.	May I  on behalf of the Government and people of Mauritius and on my own behalf  sincerely congratulate you  Mr. President  on being elected to preside over the present session. It is our earnest hope that the world is now moving into a period that will see the resolution of many of the questions that have preoccupied us for years past  and in this connexion the high office that you have courageously accepted to occupy will place you in many hazardous situations in the front line of the battle for the peace  security and well-being of mankind. Your long and rich experience in government and diplomacy will enable you to guide this Assembly with tact and wisdom. In this arduous task that lies ahead of us you can rely on the entire support of my delegation and of all men of peace and goodwill.4.	May I also express our esteem for you  Mr. Secretary-General  and for your untiring and constant efforts to uphold the United Nations and the vision enshrined in its Charter. You have had to draw upon your inner reserves of faith  wisdom and patience. It is our fervent wish that you will continue to lead this Organization for many more years.5.	Before I go further  I should like to welcome Saint Lucia as a sovereign and independent State in the com-munity of nations and to express our joy and happiness to its people and Government.6.	Franklin Roosevelt declared that the United Nations spelled:""...the end of the system of unilateral action and exclusive alliance  and spheres of influence and balance of power and all the other expedients which have been used for centuries and which have failed.""He went on to say:""...we propose to substitute for these a universal organization which all peace-loving nations have a chance to join.""Yet  the principle of the universality of United Nations membership has not been established to the satisfaction of all  nor has the system of unilateral action and exclusive alliance been abandoned. We have a long way yet to go. A country like Mauritius has great and loyal attachment for this Organization and a special concern for its successful functioning. I have come here to reiterate my country's deep commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter.7.	Given our geo-political appurtenance to Africa  it is but natural that all that happens there is of primary concern to us.8.	After 14 years of illegality and dark despair we now see a distant glimmer of hope for Zimbabwe. All nations belonging to this great Organization have throughout the years struggled for democracy  freedom and the rule of law. In this spirit we welcome the prospective changes to be effected at the London Constitutional Conference on Rhodesia  changes which will bring sovereignty and independence to Zimbabwe and peace to that vast continent.9.	My Government also fully supports the untiring efforts of the five Western Powers members of the Security Council and those of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to find a solution to the Namibia question. But  while we endorse such positive steps and promising initiatives  we are also growing more apprehensive day by day  because we know that the patience of the Namibian people has limits and we are already very near the point of no return when human logic abdicates in favour of relentless armed struggle.10.	It is only too natural that we who live in a multiracial country where equality of opportunities  freedom of conscience and the spirit of brotherhood prevail should  particularly  find apartheid and all forms of racial discrimination repulsive. The policy of separate development is dehumanizing and makes of man man's worst enemy. The delusions of superiority of race and colour exist only in a diseased mind. Ail steps taken to wipe out the evil of apartheid must  overtly and manifestly  be seen as genuine endeavours towards its eradication.11.	I have dealt with the problems facing the southern part of our continent because they are the most glaring instances of injustice and require our most urgent attention. Unfortunately  the problems of Africa are not restricted to white domination; the south is but a visible manifestation of what is true of the rest of the continent. Africa still suffers from inequality and dependence in its economic relations with the industrialized world. There have been no real African conflicts on the continent  but we realize painfully that our only war is against time and under-development and  in this  mass unemployment  inflation  mass poverty and our own security are the main constraints to hamper our efforts to achieve economic independence  and that our sole interest is in moving to catch up with the twentieth century before the twenty-first is upon us. May I remind representatives of His Holiness the Pope's statement on Tuesday that a great solidarity among all the peoples is necessary for the achievement of peace and prosperity.12.	I should like also to state that we staunchly believe in and uphold the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State. In this connexion  we believe that the populations of dependent overseas territories have the right to decide its future freely  without outside interference.13.	The first phase of our emergence is almost over. We have by and large acquired political independence which we are in the process of consolidating while we move into the next phase of our fight for freedomâthe struggle for economic independence and against underdevelopment  inflation  ignorance  poverty and disease. We can eradicate those ills only if there is full participation by the people themselves in such a gigantic task. The North-South dialogue  the efforts made by UNCTAD and the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development have not come up to our expectations  but we keep on struggling in the hope that those who can will eventually realize that they must co-operate fully and sincerely in uplifting the standard of living and the quality of life of the peoples of the world. 14.	Since I addressed this Assembly last year1 certain events have occurred which give us cause to believe that the world is moving towards greater respect for human rights and better understanding of human obligations. We can only welcome the emergence of a universal charter of human rights and obligations in the near future.15.	We in the Indian Ocean are making serious efforts to develop regional co-operation with our neighbours. We are embarked on some regional projects aiming at the economic development of our countries. We therefore invite the great Powers to reduce their military presence or capabilities in this part of the world. That is why we call upon all interested parties to ensure that the Indian Ocean really becomes a zone of peace. We urge all nations of the Indian Ocean to adopt a more positive attitude with the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean so that a conference on the Indian Ocean may be convened shortly. In view of the importance Mauritius attaches to this question we have already indicated our intention and willingness to host that Conference.16.	We in Africa and in the Indian Ocean are not alone in appealing for the denuclearization of this part of the world. States in the Middle East and Asia have the same view regarding their region.17.	My Government is happy to note the first steps that have been taken towards a solution of the Middle East conflict. The Palestinian issues unfortunately remain unresolved and no solution of the Middle East question is possible while 3 million Palestinians are denied their basic human rights. Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] must recognize each other and only then can a global  durable and peaceful settlement  negotiated within the framework of the United Nations resolutions  be achieved. Any steps taken by anyone  in the Middle East or elsewhere  in the direction of peace has our unreserved support.18.	The destabilization process taking place in Southeast Asia is a matter of great concern to us. We can only hope that it will not be a repetition of the Mesopotamian style of dismemberment and the annihilation of its people. We are faced with a pressing humanitarian problem that brooks no delay  for while we procrastinate  innocent people are either dying of starvation in Kampuchea or drowning in the South China Sea.19.	We continue to believe that the reunification of Korea will be realized through the North-South talks even if these talks have unfortunately proved fruitless so far. There is so much in common between those two parts of the country that we are confident the fraternal desire for unity will overcome the present political differences. In the meantime  we believe that the cause of reunification will be best served by the representation of both Koreas in this international Organization.20.	We earnestly hope that the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations towards a solution of the Cyprus problem will prove successful in the long run.21.	It was indeed a happy decision to declare 1979 the International Year of the Child. The hopes we have for a better world tomorrow are based on the faith that the children of today will one day be happier and  God willing  better men than we have been. Towards this end my Government made education free at the secondary and tertiary levels over two years ago with the intention of making equal opportunities available to every child irrespective of his social or economic background. Measures have also been taken in the health  social security and labour fields to ensure the happiness of our children and the opportunity fully to realize their human potential.22.	We also hope that the coming International Year for Disabled Persons will be as successful as the Inter-national Year of the Child and will bring about a heightened awareness of their plight  of a greater need for consideration than that of other men.23.	In spite of sharp international conflicts and setbacks  the nations of the world are drawing closer and closer together. The world has become a unit and demands that it should be treated as one. Today this is not only possible but it is necessary for our survival. Whoever may be the stronger Power  no one will survive a nuclear holocaust. Power undermines itself from within and turns into impotence. As Gautama Buddha said: ""Iron turns to rust and rust devours iron.""24.	The interdependence of nations has become so close that no nation can be hurt without injury to the rest. Belief in the practice of coexistence is not the outcome of expedience or of weakness but rather leads to a better code to rid the world of misunderstanding and intolerance.25.	Peace  which we all so much desire and cherish  is not the absence of war. It is the presence of feelings for one's fellows and the respect of man for man regardless of his race  nation  colour or creed. What is really called for is the disarmament of minds. We should not grieve that rose-trees have thorns but rather rejoice that thorny bushes bear roses.26.	We in Mauritius are convinced more than ever before  that the United Nations remains the only means for the achievement of a stable and peaceful world and we pledge our continuing and unflinching support."
"93",4928,"MWI",34,1979,"ï»¿Allow me  Mr. President  first to join the representatives who have spoken before me  in warmly congratulating you on your election to the presidency of this Assembly. This year's session will be marked by momentous decisions  which the Assembly will be called upon to take on matters of importance both to the Organization as such and  in-deed  to the future development of its Members. Needless to say  you are aware  through the experience you have acquired during your term of office at Turtle Bay  of the extent to which patience and impartiality are required in the high office which you have assumed. I am quite certain that no better person could have been chosen to guide the Assembly in its deliberations at such a crucial time. For my part  I should like to assure you  Sir  of my delegation's fullest co-operation.155.	Secondly  let me take this opportunity to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for the able manner in which he presided over the last session when  as we all know  the Assembly had no less difficult a task to perform. Mr. Lievano was not found lacking in the qualities that are required of a person in that position.156.	Last but not least  I should be failing in my duty if I did not say a word of commendation for the enormous dedication with which the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has always carried out his onerous duties. His total commitment to the cause of the United Nations has gone beyond the call of duty. Thus  we are beguiled by the enchanting thought that  through his personal initiative  some of the problems that beset the world community will continue to be tackled peacefully during the coming year  with prospects of fruitful results. We wish Mr. Waldheim success.157.	A good deal of effort has been exerted during the past 12 months in an endeavour to bring about peace and security among nations  as well as to improve their social and economic status. Similar efforts have been made towards the achievement of self-determination for those of our brothers and sisters still under political domination. Some measure of progress has been made in some areas but  unfortunately  not in others.158.	None the less  my delegation is encouraged by recent developments that may lead to a Lessening of tension in international relations. In that regard  we congratulate the Governments of the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the conclusion of a second SALT Treaty  which was signed between them early this year. We applaud the spirit of co-operation and the willingness to compromise that characterized the long and difficult negotiations which resulted in the signing of the Treaty. We believe that the Treaty represents not only a significant development in the bilateral relations between the two big Powers but also an important contribution towards ensuring the safety of the rest of mankind. As the African adage goes ' 'It is the grass that suffers when elephants fight''. That is to say  tension and conflict among the big Powers have a direct bearing on international relations  even among small nations.159.	That is not to imply that the responsibility for ensuring international peace devolves on the big Powers alone; the smaller nations  too  have similar responsibilities in that respect. I should like  therefore  to recommend to the smaller nations that they keep peace with one another. I know only too well  of course  that in some cases the conflicts and disagreements among us smaller nations are not always entirely of our own making; they are at times instigated by outside forces. To repel the influence of such forces  we  the smaller nations  must stick to the principles of non-interference in each other's affairs and maintain good-neighbourliness.160.	I should like to take this opportunity to restate my Government's commitment to the principles of non-interference and good neighbourliness. We strongly hold that international peace can best be assured by such an approach.161.	It is very pleasing to note that a further step forward has been achieved in the process of decolonization by the emergence of Solomon Islands  Saint Lucia and Kiribati as independent  sovereign States. I should like to take this opportunity to extend to them my Government's sincere congratulations and to welcome them to the club of sovereign States.162.	While on the subject  may I be allowed to express the hope that it will not be long before we welcome Belize and East Timor to this Assembly 163.	This Assembly has been seized of the question of Western Sahara for the past few years. My delegation welcomes recent developments which indicate that a solution is now possible. My Government maintains that any solution of the issue of Western Sahara must take into account the wishes of the people of Western Sahara. In this connexion  I wish to record Malawi's support for the recommendation of the OAU Ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Western Sahara  the so-called committee of wise men  which was adopted in Monrovia  Liberia  in July this year  calling for a referendum in order to determine the real wishes of the people of the Territory  It is my delegation's sincere hope that this Assembly will lend its support to this realistic proposal. It is also our hope that all parties involved in the Western Sahara problem will co-operate in facilitating the implementation of the proposal. In this connexion my delegation also welcomes the recent decision by the Government of Mauritania to renounce any claims to the Territory of Western Sahara and to respect the aspirations of the Saharan people. This courageous step will go a long way towards facilitating the resolution of the matter.164.	When we assembled here about a year ago  there were high hopes that the Namibia question might at last be resolved  following the South African Government's acceptance of the proposals presented to it and to SWAPO by the five Western members of the Security Council  on a formula for resolving the problem under United Nations auspices. Alas  those hopes now seem to be diminishing. It is a matter for regret that  because of the failure of the two sides to agree on certain key provisions of the Western formula and also as a result of subsequent South African attempts to institute some form of ""unilateral internal settlement""  no progress has been made on the Namibia question.165.	When the Western initiative on Namibia was launched two years ago  my Government welcomed it  and subsequently endorsed the formula which the contact group proposed. That was because my Government believed that that formula offered the most peaceful way of achieving a genuine transfer of power to Namibians through the participation of all the political groups in the Territory  including SWAPO.166.	My Government is convinced that this is still the way that offers the most hope of leading to a just and internationally acceptable solution to the Namibia question. It is therefore encouraging to note that efforts are under way to pursue the Western initiative  and I would appeal for good faith among all the parties concerned so as not to lose again an opportunity to bring this problem to a successful conclusion.167.	As with Namibia  the problem of Rhodesia has been the cause of much anxiety and concern. Hope has  however  been revived by the developments of the past few weeks  and a peaceful settlement of the constitutional deadlock in that country now looks possible once again.168.	My Government has stated before that to choose the leadership and Government of Rhodesia is the prerogative of the people of Rhodesia themselves; we do not believe that any solution which seeks to impose a certain leader or type of government can bring about a meaningful settlement of the constitutional dispute in that country. At the same time  however  my Government has also stated that any settlement of the problem must ensure a peaceful and genuine transfer of power to the majority. I should like to reiterate that position and declare the Malawi Government's readiness to support any efforts aimed at achieving a peaceful settlement of the issue of Rhodesia.169.	My delegation  therefore  welcomes the Commonwealth plan adopted at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held at Lusaka in August  for the settlement of the problem of Rhodesia. We are convinced that the plan offers an opportunity for the people of Rhodesia to participate fully in the choice of their own Government  just as it guarantees the genuine transfer of power to the majority. My delegation is encouraged by the positive response of all the parties concerned to the invitation by the Government of the United Kingdom to participate in the constitutional conference which opened in London recently as the first stage in the implementation of that plan. We are also encouraged by the progress which has been achieved so far at the conference  and it is our sincere hope that nothing will be allowed to hamper further progress.170.	The Commonwealth plan was born out of consultation and good faith among those who worked it out. We believe that the same qualities  as well as trust and willingness to compromise among the parties at the constitutional conference  should ensure its successful implementation. My delegation wishes the conference success and looks forward to welcoming the new State of Zimbabwe as a Member of our Organization in the near future.171. The signs of possible change in the political situation in South Africa are less perceptible than they are in the cases of Namibia and Rhodesia. There are  however  clear indications of an awakening  both within Government circles and outside them  to the need for change in the racial policies that the Government pursues. There is evidence of an open debate going on in that country  which represents a self-examination of conscience on the part of the people. We believe that change in South Africa is inevitable and that the open debate to which I have just referred points to its advent.172 . My Government remains resolutely averse to the policies of apartheid and the methods used to enforce it  including the establishment of ""homelands"". This is a stance that is well known to the Government of the day in South Africa. But my Government remains equally convinced that the best way to induce the white people to the south of us to change is by contact and example  by engaging in a dialogue with them. That is why my Government does not support boycotts and ostracism; neither does it support confrontation. Consequently  my delegation urges the international community to create the necessary condition that will induce change in South Africa sooner.173.	My Government has followed closely the developments in the Middle East which culminated in the Camp David agreements of September 1978 and the Treaty of Peace concluded between Egypt and Israel in March this year. My Government regards these developments as a step in the right direction in the continuing search for a just settlement of the Middle East problem. I have already given my Government's view on ""confrontation"" as a means of resolving differences among nations. I can only add that  while war may sometimes bring quick results  it animates hatred to such an extent that in the end it destroys both the victor and the vanquished. I dare say the history of the Middle East problem bears out this contention.174.	I must  however  emphasize that in supporting the Camp David agreements and the Egypt-Israel Treaty  we are not implying that the ultimate objective has been achieved. We are simply acknowledging that the first step towards the desired goal has been taken. I am saying this because there are  as everyone knows  a number of crucial issues still outstanding which call for further attention. And the sooner they receive it the better. Thank goodness that this is being actively pursued by the parties to the Egypt-Israel Treaty  The problem of the Middle East is not between Israel and Egypt alone. We therefore believe that a meaningful and lasting solution can be achieved only through the full participation of all parties in the search for it.175.	Another problem which has been before the Assembly for some time and to which no solution has yet been found is that of Cyprus. My delegation still believes that a solution can be achieved only through direct negotiations between the Greek and Turkish communities of Cyprus. It is our conviction that only in this way can a settlement be reached which guarantees lasting peace and security for all Cypriots.176.	We note and support the efforts of the United Nations in search of a formula to facilitate the resumption of intercommunal dialogue on this problem. I should like to express my Government's hope that the Secretary-General will continue these efforts.177.	My delegation has also noted the proposal made by the President of Cyprus to the General Assembly in October last year that the island should be demilitarized and the security of the island should be ensured by a combined Greek and Turkish Cypriot police force under the guidance of a United Nations force.  It is my delegation's view that the withdrawal of all foreign troops  except those of the United Nations  would contribute to a greater sense of security among the Cypriot communities and thus create an atmosphere conducive to maximum co-operation and compromise between the two sides in reaching a settlement. We therefore consider the President's proposal to be worthy of serious consideration and hope that this Assembly will examine it in greater detail.178.	Another issue which is a source of equally grave concern is that of disarmament. My Government is concerned not only about the threat that the escalation of the arms race poses to international peace and security but also about its drain on economic resources which would be better used in promoting the social and economic development of the peoples of Member States. In this respect  my delegation has noted with disappointment the failure of the recent meetings of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva to produce any positive results. It is our hope  however  that the Assembly will address itself to this important matter and consider ways of resolving it.179.	Permit me to express the hope also that  following the conclusion of the SALT Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union  the bigger Powers will consider utilizing the experience gained in the negotiations for that Treaty in the efforts aimed at achieving general disarmament in the world.180.	My delegation considers it a matter of deep regret that narrow sectional interests continue to hamper progress towards the establishment of a new international economic order. We had hoped that current developments in the economic field would have amply demonstrated the interdependence of the developed and the developing countries and the need for closer co-operation. We have noted with appreciation  though  the moves made by the developed donor countries to reduce the indebtedness of developing recipient States by converting loans into grants. This will greatly improve the solvency of the developing countries.181.	My delegation has also noted with satisfaction that  following the fifth session of UNCTAD  held in Manila in May  substantial contributions to the recently established Common Fund have begun. This is important  because the economic stability and growth of developing countries can be ensured only to the extent that the necessary conditions are established to enable them to improve their capacity to produce more and to sell at profitable prices.182.	Having said that  I would point out  however  that the stabilization of commodity prices alone is not the answer to the economic problems of developing countries. The producer States must also be assured of an adequate market for their commodities. My Government was therefore disappointed at the failure of the UNCTAD meetings in Manila to reach a satisfactory agreement on this and many other important questions. Particularly disturbing was the failure of the developed countries to accede to even the modest request that they consider granting freer access for goods from developing countries to their markets.183.	It is a matter for regret that  despite all the high hopes which preceded the last session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  lack of compromise has once again blocked the successful completion of the task of establishing a new international maritime regime. Nevertheless  we are convinced that  given goodwill on all sides  the obstacles which remain can be overcome. My Government believes that the equitable share of marine resources is relevant to  and has an important role to play in  the creation of the new international economic order. It is therefore my delegation's hope that the spirit of consideration and compromise will prevail when the Conference is resumed in order that the long awaited agreement can be concluded.184.	My delegation wishes to express its appreciation for the work carried out directly by the United Nations through its various agencies in the promotion of the welfare of its Member States. Of equal importance is the awareness which this Assembly has brought  through the observance of the special International Years  to the various ills and problems that afflict the different sections of our world community.185.	We are drawing to the close of the International Year of the Child. My country has participated fully in the programmes marking this special year  as my Government believes strongly in the security and welfare of the young. They are  after all  the future citizens of our world. My Government is therefore convinced that programmes such as those which have been observed in the course of 1979 are a most beneficial contribution to the future well-being of mankind.186.	While appreciating the usefulness of these special international years  my delegation is compelled to point out that having too many of them at once could easily destroy their value. Thus  the Secretary-General's initiative in requesting this Assembly to consider ways of rationalizing them is appreciated. It is our sincere hope that the Assembly will consider this matter carefully and come up with objective recommendations.187.	My delegation has had occasion in the past to express the Malawi Government's concern at the unwieldy proliferation of the organs of the United Nations. We note with pleasure  therefore  that the Secretary-General has requested this body to consider ways of reducing the costs of running the Organization. It is our hope that  in addressing themselves to this issue  representatives will consider also ways of streamlining the size of the Organization.â188.	Last  although certainly not least  my delegation wishes to avail itself of this opportunity to express  once again  Malawi's appreciation and gratitude for the assistance which it continues to receive from the United Nations. This assistance is an invaluable contribution to our Government's endeavour to promote the economic and social welfare and development of our nation.189.	It gives me great pleasure to convey to this Assembly best wishes from my President  the Government and the people of Malawi for success in its deliberations."
"94",4970,"MYS",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  the General Assembly is fortunate this year to have as distinguished and accomplished diplomat as yourself presiding over its thirty-fourth session. Your eminent qualities and wide experience in international affairs are greatly admired and respected. We pay a tribute in particular to the impressive record of your contributions towards helping the struggle of peoples for self-determination and independence. It is a pleasure for me to congratulate you warmly on your unanimous election to your high office. My delegation pledges its full support and co-operation to you  Sir  in the discharge of your heavy responsibilities. We wish you all success.192.	The outgoing President  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  deserves our warm appreciation for the able and competent manner in which he guided the deliberations of the thirty-third session to a successful end.193.	We also congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his untiring efforts in furthering the cause of peace. Mr. Waldheim has in the course of this year played a very constructive role in particular on the problem of refugees in South-East Asia. His initiative in convening the Geneva conference on Indo-Chinese refugees is greatly appreciated by all.194.	I take this opportunity to welcome Saint Lucia on its admission to membership in the United Nations. We look forward to close co-operation with the delegation of Saint Lucia in the furtherance of the objectives of the United Nations.195.	We begin this session with some apprehension about the general uncertain climate in the international situation. As we approach the end of the decade of the 1970s  we find ourselves faced with more and more unanswered problems and questions. The 1970s have seen some negative trends in spite of ongoing negotiations in the North-South dialogue and the process of detente and rapprochement among the great Powers. Dialogue has in some instances given way to polemics  and the world continues to be sharply divided along political  economic and ideological lines. The developing countries cry out for a more equitable new international economic order. But we are in no way nearer to solving the problems of under-development  poverty  malnutrition and hunger.196.	The peace that we at present enjoy hangs on a fragile threat sustained by the balance of nuclear terror. We live in constant fear of the total annihilation of mankind as the spread of nuclear weapons increases  and this is compounded by the development and perfection of more and more devastating nuclear weapons systems. In sum  instead of being reduced  the arms race has continued its upward spiral. Indeed  the peace that we have  tenuous as it is  has been shattered time and time again by regional conflicts that threaten to erupt into wide conflagrations. Many of these conflicts now take place in the countries of the third world. The truth of the matter is that the world we live in today is polarized and there is still a lot of distrust and suspicion among nations in the conduct of international relations. In spite of detente and rapprochement among the great Powers  their rivalry for spheres of influence and domination continues unabated  and this remains a predominant feature of our present-day world.197.	The problems that beset us in the 1970s will  no doubt  be carried forward as we cross the threshold of the 1980s  Much therefore  remains to be done to translate into reality the lofty ideals which serve as our guide in our work towards a more peaceful and secure world order. We can achieve such an order only if we are prepared to act in concert and to co-operate more fruitfully with each other. Indeed  we need to go from rhetoric to meaningful action  to harmonize our efforts and to transform confrontation and polemics into peaceful co-operation. We have a duty  above all  to redress the chronic deterioration of the world economic situation in particular  for in the final analysis it is the bread-and-butter issues which are of paramount importance to nations and to the peoples of the world in general.198.	In your opening statement  Mr. President  you stressed the importance of the United Nations as an instrument for the promotion of peace  freedom  justice  international security and cooperation. You said also that this Organization will fail to meet its lofty ideals as enumerated in its Charter if we  as individual nations  choose to use it as an instrument of periodical convenience. Indeed  we could not agree with you more. When we all became Members of the United Nations  we pledged to uphold the principles and purposes of the United Nations. We pledged to work for world peace  for the reconciliation of our differences and for the common good of mankind. Yet  time and time again we see these very principles trampled upon with impunity. The sovereignty of nations as been violated and the use of force to settle disputes has become an attractive option in the face of the helplessness of the United Nations. We in Malaysia look at this development with great concern  as indeed do all responsible peoples.199.	As a small country of 12 million people  Malaysia is fully committed to upholding the principles and goals of this body. The United Nations is the most effective Organization to harmonize the actions of nations in the search for solutions to our common problems and to promote peaceful relations  international understanding and co-operation. It is in furtherance of the objectives of the United Nations that Malaysia together with its partners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]âIndonesia  the Philippines  Singapore and Thailandâhas embarked on the road to regional co-operation. Our quest for peace and mutual co-operation transcends all ideologies and different political systems. The objective of ASEAN is to promote peace and security through co-operation in various fields for the well-being of our peoples. ASEAN works and we are proud of it. The countries of ASEAN want to share the fruits of their co-operation with the other countries of South-East Asia and to secure their participation in building a prosperous  peaceful and secure region. But we cannot realize these objectives if we do not have peace in the region and if the sovereignty of nations is not respected.200.	It is in this context that Malaysia and others in the region viewed with serious concern the recent developments in Kampuchea. One of the cardinal principles of the United Nations has been violated by the armed intervention of outside forces against Kampuchea  threatening the peace  stability and security of South-East Asia as a whole. Fighting still rages in that war-torn country  causing untold suffering and misery to countless thousands of people.201.	The subsequent development after the military intervention showed clearly how the area of conflict could easily widen  threatening to engulf the entire region in a testing-ground of big-Power rivalry. If this situation is allowed to continue  it will be a standing invitation to others to get involved in the contest of the super-Powers. Accordingly  a long-term political solution must be found  and must be found quicklyâa solution which will restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea. The people of Kampuchea must be given the right to decide their own future and destiny  free from outside interference or intervention. Malaysia  together with other ASEAN countries  has made a call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the area of conflict. My Government stands ready to contribute towards any effort to find a peaceful solution to the problem in Kampuchea.202.	Lest it be construed that Malaysia is taking sides in the conflict  I should like to assure this Assembly that our stand is a principled one. We did not take sides on these developments in Kampuchea and we have no intention of doing so. We want to see peace and stability restored to our part of the world. Our principal preoccupation at present is to find a political solution to the problem. This is Malaysia's main concern. I reiterate that we should like to live in peace with all the countries in the region in a spirit of good neighbourliness and co-operation for the betterment of the peoples in the region.203.	It is in this same spirit that the member countries of ASEAN have made their proposal for the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia.  The events in Indo-China  where the involvement of Powers external to the region was clearly visible  once again emphasize the need to pursue with greater vigour the realization of this concept. Members of this Assembly are no doubt familiar with the concept  and I shall not go into detail. Suffice it for me to say that the concept will provide for the countries of South-East Asia the framework for harmonious and co-operative relations among themselves  and between themselves and all countries outside the region  be they large or small.204.	I would be remiss in my duty if I did not at the same time point out the humanitarian aspects of the conflict in Kampucheaâa tragedy which this Assembly cannot ignore. The loss of innocent lives and the sufferings and hardship faced by the population as a result of the conflict deserve our urgent attention. As if this human tragedy were not enough  there is in addition the impending threat of famine resulting from disruption in the agricultural life of the country. Already  tens of thousands of Kampucheans have been forced to flee their homeland and to seek refuge in a neighbouring country. We in Malaysia know from experience what it means to be saddled with such an influx of people into one's territory. Unless urgent attention is given by the world community to this problem  a further exodus of people from Kampuchea can be expected  causing un-due economic and social problems to neighbouring countries. This is destabilizing; it could exacerbate the situation and could widen the area of conflict 205.	With regard to the refugee situation in Southeast Asia  my delegation is gratified to note the positive results of the United Nations Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in July of this year at Geneva. Malaysia welcomes the commitment made by various countries and in particular by Viet Nam  to solve the problem. We also welcome the pledges of third countries to accept more of the so-called ""boat people"" who are now in the countries of first transit in the region. In Malaysia  there are about 50 000 illegal Vietnamese immigrants still awaiting resettlement in third countries. This is no mean number for a small country like our own to be saddled with. We therefore urge the expeditious intake of these illegal immigrants into countries that have given pledges to take them. Any further delay will only prolong the burden faced by the countries of first transit in the region  as well as the agony being suffered by the immigrants or refugees.206.	The plethora of perennial issues of which this Assembly has been seized will also require urgent solution. Malaysia has followed these developments with concern. Our participation in the various committees of the United Nations demonstrates our concern at the plight of the peoples of Palestine  Namibia  Zimbabwe- Rhodesia and South Africa who are struggling against colonialism  apartheid  racism and oppression.207.	As a member of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  we share the anguish of the people of Palestine who are denied their inalienable rights to return to their homeland. We support all United Nations efforts to restore to the people of Palestine their inalienable rights of self- determination  national independence and sovereignty in Palestine.208.	The Palestine issue remains at the core of the Middle East problem  and unless steps are taken to involve the participation of the Palestinian people led by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  any meaningful negotiation  however encouraging  would not bring about a lasting and just solution to the Middle East problem as a whole.209.	The conflict in the Middle East is also another instance of the use of force to acquire territories against the principles of the United Nations. Israel persists in the further occupation of Arab territories and in building more settlements on the West Bank. We cannot but condemn this act in the strongest terms.210.	In Namibia  the illegal regime in South Africa continues to cling to territories to which it has no right. We hope the racist regime will co-operate with the United Nations in implementing settlement plans for the early independence of Namibia.211.	As for Zimbabwe-Rhodesia  my Government welcomes the current constitutional conference in London and hopes that it will be successful in achieving majority rule for the black people of the Territory.212.	At the conclusion of their meeting in New York a few days ago  the Foreign Ministers of the Group of 77 issued a declaration drawing the attention of the international community to the current serious and chaotic state of the world economy  characterized by static economic growth and development  high-level inflation and unemployment  unabated protectionism leading to restrained and sluggish world trade  as well as a host of other long-standing problems.213.	The fact of the matter is that the existing international economic system has proved totally incapable of overcoming the crisis the world economy is presently experiencing. Any ad hoc decisions and devices adopted by a handful of countries without the full and equal participation of the rest of the international community can only further aggravate an already grave situation. In the wake of mounting economic and financial difficulties  my delegation does not believe  and cannot accept the thinking  that merely by putting a finger here and a finger there to close up holes in the dyke  we can avert global economic recession.214.	Beset as we are by many and acute disparities between the developed and the developing countries  and given the failure of the present economic system to pull all of us out of the present mess  it is no longer useful for us merely to call for and speak for structural changes in international economic relations. We  the international community  must be serious and sincere in wanting to bring about such changes  and we must be seen to act accordingly.215.	We had a golden opportunity to realize these structural changes at the fifth session of UNCTAD at Manila earlier this year. However  we failed. The results of the fifth session of UNCTAD proved to be a profound disappointment to developing countries. We ad another chance at the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held at Vienna in August this year. There again  we achieved very little. While the results of the Conference were at best satisfactory  they were nevertheless not positively conclusive for the developing countries. The same situation is also applicable to the other negotiating process featured under the North-South dialogue. The Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  following the General Assembly's agreement on its mandate last year  has begun work  but its movement forward has been painfully slow. Similarly  the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy for the 1980s has progressed very little  if at all  in its work. We all know the reason for this inertia  despite the international community's acceptance of the concept of the interdependency of nations and global economic cooperation.216.	What we have seen in all these ongoing negotiations is the consistent refusal of the developed countries to accept the reality of the argument that the growth and development of the developing countries  which can be genuinely achieved only through structural changes in the present world economic system  would contribute to the recovery  growth and economic viability of the developed countries as well.217.	With the continued absence of any political willingness on the part of the industrialized countries generally to make this structural change  it is almost inevitable that their economies will drift into deeper recessions. In such a situation  the world economy as a whole can only further deteriorate  with predictably harmful effects on the development of the developing countries. It is a grim picture  butâin truthâthat is what we will have.218.	The present Development Decade  based on the existing pattern of international economic relations  taught us a lesson in disappointment and futility. The basic thrust of the new international development strategy for the 1980s now in preparation is that it should be formulated within the framework of  and directed towards  the objectives of the New International Economic Order in order to promote the development of the developing countries.219.	The New International Economic Order  to which my country is fully committed  seeks to restructure the existing global economic system  and this can only be brought about with the genuine cooperation and support of the developed countries. To this end  my delegation would urge them to undertake greater commitments and obligations towards the international community at large by ensuring that all the ongoing North-South negotiations are concluded successfully and in the shortest time possible  without recourse to  or need for  confrontation.220.	It is also my delegation's hope that in the current negotiations for the new international development strategy  to be adopted by a special session of the General Assembly next year  the strategy's basic thrust may not be lost sight of through the introduction of new concepts of selectivity and global strategy for basic needs that would in no way help in resolving the pressing problems facing the developing countries. Indeed  we would wish to see the strategy contain procedures and mechanisms that would enable the establishment of the New International Economic Order and that  once adopted  it would be earnestly and honestly implemented in order that we may look forward to the 1980s as an era of real and genuine development for the developing countries. Otherwise  the new decade will be no more than a copy of the present one  which has been characterized by frustration  disappointment and the further exacerbation of the position of the developing countries  not without the inherent possibility of confrontation within the international community. The United Nations  as the only truly universal forum for international co-operation  must at all costs prevent this from happening.221.	Although there were trends in the 1970s which were disconcerting  there is no reason to be pessimistic or to feel despair as long as we are willing to face the problems squarely and to take initiatives to overcome them. We should continue with our efforts to make use of the various forums before us to reconcile conflicting national interests and to find the necessary solutions to our common problems. Let us therefore rise to the occasion and show that our Organization can work in harmony and co-operation to bring about the peace  security and prosperity which we all long for."
"95",5043,"NER",34,1979,"ï»¿The international community has welcomed the election of Mr. Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania to the presidency of this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly with hope and satisfaction. As far as Africa is concerned  it is indeed proud  and I congratulate him. His election is a fitting tribute to a career which has been devoted largely to the noble cause of the emancipation of peoples  as typified by his brilliant chairmanship for a number of years of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. It is a tribute also to his country  with which mine has excellent relations  and which has been making invaluable efforts on the ' 'front line'' for the triumph of justice and freedom. Lastly  it is a tribute to Mr. Salim's personal attributes of even-handedness  tact  good humour and constant goodwill.270.	Niger  a founding member of the OAU  has never wavered  since its accession to sovereignty and its entry into the United Nations  from a code of conduct in keeping with group ethics and international law.271.	Scrupulous respect for the rights of others is the corner-stone of our foreign policy. In fact we revere the principle that every nation has the inviolable right to choose the political  economic and social structures which best respond to the aspirations and nature of its people. By the same token  however  we demand similar respect for our historical values  and the same tolerance for our national options. This foreign policy  which categorically rejects any selectivity  justifies  among other things  the place my country occupies in the great family of non-aligned nations.272.	Our non-alignment is dynamic and objective  free of any complicity or complacency. Our policy of co-operation with all countries stems from it; thus we are certain that that co-operation will exist within the framework of respect for our personality and will lead to the development of our mutual interests.273.	This loyalty of Niger's in its international relations  and its conviction that a sense of balance must always prevail in the settlement of disputes and conflicts among States  have earned it the trust of its partners in the OAU and the esteem of most Members of this Assembly. This is something we appreciate  and which encourages us to persevere.274.	However  while my country does not wish to preach  we cannot help reiterating our indignation that resolution 1514 (XV)  of 1960  on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples  in certain respects continues to be flouted. Similarly  we find it scandalous that  at a time when there is constant talk everywhere about respect for human rights  the denial and neglect of the basic rights of the black majorities in southern Africa continue to be tolerated.275.	My country  which for 16 years has constantly joined its voice to those of other members of the OAU to denounce and condemn that state of affairs  cannot but rejoice to see the entire international community reject the sham elections of 20 April 1979  which installed in Rhodesia a regime in the pay of the white minority Power.276.	That is why  while reiterating our support for the Patriotic Front  we are following with interest the current London Conference  which we hope will lead to the final establishment of legality and so bestow upon the people of Zimbabwe their rights.277.	With regard to Namibia  my country's position has been known for a long time. We have never spared our support for the courageous Namibian people and their fighting movement  SWAPO  which are struggling against South African colonialist and racist oppression. In this connexion  we wish to make it clear to the international community that as far as we are concerned  Walvis Bay is an integral part of Namibian territory.278.	As for South Africa  everything has been said again for more than a quarter century about its loathe- some policy of apartheid. But we repeat once again that the Government of Pretoria would long ago have ceased flouting the international community had it not enjoyed outside support  whether overt or covert. On Niger's behalf  I can only launch an urgent appeal to all those countries which consider themselves friends of the continent of Africa and of African peoples  and who uphold and defend the concept of human rights  to put an end to such interference and duplicity as soon as possible.279.	It is in the same spirit that we fervently hope that the other Members of the United Nations will work actively for the adoption of appropriate measures in accordance with the relevant provisions of our many resolutions  recommendations and other solemn declarations in order to put an end to colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination in southern Africa.280.	It is also fitting to pay a warm tribute to the front-line countries  which have borne and continue to bear a heavy share in the liberation struggle which  tragically  is today deprived of the leadership of one of its most courageous freedom-fighters  President Neto  who was prematurely snatched from our midst  and whose active militancy had given Africa one of its most rousing victories over colonialism and foreign domination.281.	I would ask the fraternal delegation of Angola to accept this renewed expression of the deep compassion of the people and Government of Niger 282.	I could not close this chapter without mentioning the volatile situation currently prevailing in Western Sahara  which  if we are not vigilant  may deteriorate into a serious conflict which could engulf our entire sub region. My Government believes that everything must be done to promote the advent of a new era of peace and fraternal co-operation in that sub region  in conformity with the resolutions adopted at the OAU Assembly in Monrovia  which  inter alia  called for recognition of the inalienable rights of the Saharan people to self-determination.283.	Niger's geo-political situation and the historic relations  cultural as well as economic  which have always united us with Islamic peoples  explain why my country remains deeply concerned over the situation in the Middle East.284.	In severing all relations with the Zionist State following the 1973 October War  all of Africa condemned Israel's policy of aggression and its occupation of Arab territories and Palestine. Unfortunately  that aggression and occupation continue  in disdain of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Faithful to its principles  Niger will always stand firmly behind the Arab countries and the PLO in their just struggle to recover their occupied territories and to gain recognition for the Palestinian people's right to a homeland.285.	For my country  no just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem could be conceived of without recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to a homeland; the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories; the cessation of Zionist desecration of Jerusalem  which cannot be considered Israel's property; and full participation of the PLO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in all negotiations aimed at restoring peace and security in the Middle East.286.	Furthermore  my delegation wishes to express its deep concern at the escalation of Israeli aggression against Lebanon. Our Organization must urgently adopt the necessary measures to end such flagrant violation by Israel of the principles of the Charter and resolutions of our Organization.287.	This year we have noted encouraging events in terms of the consolidation of international peace and the reign of harmony among nations. Among others  we wish to mention Panama's recovery of full sovereignty over the Canal and the establishment in Nicaragua of a regime that satisfies the profound aspirations of the Nicaraguan people.288.	With regard to Asia  we wish to see in that part of the world  which has suffered from so many wars and so much destruction in the past  a new era of peace  in which its peoples and countries can work for reconstruction  as well as a better future for coming generations. I therefore wish to appeal most urgently to the major Powers to exercise wisdom and magnanimity so as to contribute to the realization of that noble objective.289.	Many other subjects are the source of grave concern for our young nations  because they could hamper our efforts at building a worthy and stable national society. Disarmament is among those concerns. Indeed  over a year ago this Assembly held a special session devoted to disarmament  its tenth special session  which drew up a programme of action  including in particular measures for nuclear disarmament. My country  which took active part in that session's work  had an opportunity to express its views on that important question.  However  my delegation could not omit to mention here the lack of enthusiasm among militarily powerful countries at translating into action the commitments that they freely undertook at that historic session. That is why we favourably welcomeâthough without too much optimismâ the signing by the USSR and the United States in Vienna of a second agreement on strategic weapons. Indeed  while the Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms is a step in limiting armaments  it does not mark any de-escalation in the production and sophistication of nuclear weapons. The major Powers  as in the past  continue to cherish a fragile hope of maintaining peace in the world by cultivating terror.290.	While attentive to the civil spirits of domination those same Powers  to ease their consciences  prefer to check up on the small countries whose primary concern is the exploitation of their national resources in conditions of peace and harmony. For our part ""We have condemned unequivocally  wherever it seemed necessary to demonstrate this  not only proliferation but also the possession of nuclear weapons . . . . Our concern is over development.""That was the reply given by President Seyni Kountche on this subject to those who intimated that because Niger was a uranium-producing country it might shortly join the club of nuclear-weapon States. It that not clear proof of Niger's commitment to building a world of peace and prosperity in which man can live free from the obsession of a nuclear holocaust?291.	After these few words on disarmament we naturally come to the problems of security. The people and Government of Niger spare no effort to establish and consolidate with their neighbours in the countries of the sub region a peaceful climate of understanding and harmony  an atmosphere of peace that will be both an earnest and a guarantee of our common desire to ensure for our peoples the necessary tranquillity and stability for their economic and social development.292.	It is in that context that we have made efforts on behalf of Chad  a country which  like ours  shares the concerns of a developing country  a Sahelian landlocked developing country. Its peoples  like ours  has suffered from implacable droughts and in recent years has known regrettable internal turmoil and fratricidal struggles which have compromised their ideal of building a united and prosperous nation of Chad. However  today we are proudly and with relief witnessing in that brotherly and friendly country the beginning of a real labour of national pacification and a dynamic and evolutionary process of reconciliation and reconstruction.293.	Those results were recalled by President Seyni Kountche in the following statement to the Conference of non-aligned countries at Havana:""We must draw on the goodwill of which there is no lack in conducting negotiations of reconciliation; because it is harmony  mutual aid and constructive co-operation we need to solve our development problems. It is on the confusion of our enemies that we should erect the city of our solidarity  not over the ruins or the corpses of some of us ""294.	Thus  as in the case of Chad  my country will spare no effort to bring about peace and unity among peoples and harmony and solidarity among brothers who may be temporarily divided by conflicts. In this we shall act with strict respect for sovereignty and national identity and without any selfish or vainglorious motives; because our country and people love peace and are jealous of their sovereignty and intransigent when it comes to their security. Naturally  what they wish for themselves they also wish for others.295.	The thirty-fourth regular session of the United Nations General Assembly is beginning its work in the midst of a sombre world economic context. Years of efforts have been devoted to bringing about better order and justice in international economic relations  but we are not yet able to see light at the end of the tunnel. The world economy is experiencing a serious crisis which can be attributed to the inability of developed countries to overcome their internal difficulties. In their confusion those countries increase their protectionist measures  thus accentuating the imbalance in world trade and in the international monetary and financial system.296.	It is that egocentric attitude of advanced countries  leading to a hardening of their position in international economic negotiations  which undermined the results of the fifth session of UNCTAD and led to conclusions that fell short of the minimum acceptable to the vast majority of the participating States. The eighth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea suspended its work some weeks ago without any notable progress to justify the long months of negotiation.297.	The results obtained after many years of cooperation and dialogue are all too eloquent: the rich become richer and the poor remain poor; the gap widens hopelessly between the nations although they are linked by constant interaction in many spheres  within the framework of an anachronistic international division of labour.298.	Africa's position in this whirlwind of distress is  unfortunately  well known: our continent  the cradle of mankind  which symbolizes the hopes and failures of our world  is experiencing more dramatically than any other region the conflicting effects of development ill- adapted to its environment; it still has 18 of the poorest countries in the world.299.	The gross national product throughout Africa represents only 2.47 per cent of the world product. At an average of $365 per capita  Africa's annual income is the lowest in the world and infant mortality reached the record level of 137 per 1 000 in 1978. There is still in Africa only one physician for 25 000 inhabitants.300.	The facts show that today  after 20 years of political independence  the African economy is still under-developed: low per capita incomes  an excessively large rural population  a low level of productivity  an economy dependent on only a few primary commodities and directed towards un-remunerative exports  a complete split between traditional and modern sectors of production  a high percentage of illiteracy.301.	These results are scandalous and repugnant: thousands of human beings still die of hunger while others have too much. Humanity is suffering from an imbalance which can be overcome only if there is political determination to triumph. For the establishment of a new international economic order is a stroke of luck for the industrialized countries  since their economies  very often affected by acute supply problems  cannot be restructured without the development of the developing countries.302.	In addressing myself to the representatives of my sister nations of Africa  I wish to recall the pledge of our respective peoples to make our Africa a haven of peace  harmony and well-being. These noble objectives can be attained if we undertake the patient construction of integrated economic regional entities.303.	These noble objectives  I should like to stress  can be attained only if  in spite of our enormous potential  brought to fruition by our own efforts and our creative imagination  our Africa continues to depend more on external influences than on itself. In this connexion  the Assembly of the OAU in Monrovia  which brought together in July important African researchers  leaders and leading African economists  is a positive contribution to the definition of a global strategy within the context of a future structural improvement of African economies and societies. I wish to congratulate those researchers and also the OAU and ECA on their initiative and their militant fervour in accomplishing their task.304.	Those were the few remarks we wanted to make on the world economy in general  and the situation in Africa in particular. It is up to our Organization  on the basis of repeated statements of intentionsâwhich have unfortunately remained dead lettersâurgently to envisage ways and means necessary to ensure that our intentions take specific form.305.	The problems of development are many and dis-quieting. Niger  the link between the African and the Arab worlds  considers that the question of dissemination of information among peoples is an essential component among development priorities. Therefore we must study the means of ensuring a well-balanced and continuous dissemination of information among our countries.306.	My Government is pleased to see that the problem of information today is a basic concern in the United Nations and in certain specialized agencies  particularly UNESCO. We are pleased that the last General Conference of UNESCO  held in Nairobi  devoted a major part of its discussions to that question and  in collaboration with the Committee to Review United Nations Public Information Policies and Activities is working towards the establishment of a new world information order.307.	Along the same lines  my delegation wishes to express the hope that the international Conference on the distribution of radio frequencies  which is being held in Geneva  will meet the hopes which our young nations have placed in it  that justice and the need for balance and harmony in the international mechanism for the broadcasting and reception of information will inform the work of the participants.308.	On behalf of my Government  I wish to express our pleasure at seeing the admission of Saint Lucia as the one hundred fifty-second Member of the United Nations. In welcoming this new State to our family  we receive an independent and sovereign nation which shares with us the ideals and principles embodied in the Charter.309.	This opportunity given to the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly to work for the progress of the Organization towards the aim of universality makes it appropriate for me to proclaim once again the commitment of Niger  its people and its Government to the decisive and highly appreciated contribution of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to the building of a world of solidarity  justice and equality among peoples and to the establishment of a new era of peace and co-operation among nations.310.	In this connexion  I wish to greet the Secretary- General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose competence  dynamism and devotion to the service of our common cause evoke in us feelings of profound admiration and esteem. He may be assured of the confidence and support of my Government in the accomplishment of his important and noble task.311.	At this crucial time  when the United Nations is committed resolutely to waging a collective struggle to ensure for mankind a world of order  justice  peace and security  I wish to assure this Assembly of the unswerving commitment of Niger and its President to working tirelessly to promote a better balance in international relations and thus to fulfil the lofty dream of our shared destiny."
"96",5088,"NGA",34,1979,"ï»¿It gives me great pride and pleasure to congratulate the President on his unanimous election and to say that my delegation fully concurs in the highest praise and admiration  which all delegations  without exception  have expressed for his competence and achievement as President of this Assembly. He is an illustrious son of Africa and comes from the sister United Republic of Tanzania  which has never hesitated to be in the vanguard of the just struggle of our people for freedom and independence. Bearing in mind his personal contributions as Chairman of the Special Committee on decolonization  my delegation pledges to support him fully in the performance of his onerous functions and responsibilities.77.	May I also express our congratulations and gratitude to his worthy predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  for his impeccable record as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.78.	Over the years  our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has in the name of our Organization  managed the endless  crises of our age with dedication  compassion and perseverance. The fact that nations tend to judge the successes of the United Nations by his successes is the measure of the hope and confidence we all place in his office. I pay a very warm tribute to him for all his efforts.79.	The vision of the founding fathers of the United Nations was eventual universality of membership. With the accession of Saint Lucia to independence and its admission to the United Nations as the one hundred and fifty-second Member State  our Organization is fast approaching its goal of universality. On behalf of Nigeria  I most warmly welcome the membership of Saint Lucia  with which Nigeria shares many bonds as a result of Commonwealth membership and history. It is our desire to maintain cordial relations of friendship and close co-operation with Saint Lucia.80.	Only a few weeks ago  we all learned with shock and grief of the death of Agostinho Neto  the President of Angola. During the lifetime of that towering architect of Angola's freedom and independence  my country enjoyed fraternal relations with his Government and people. We shared his aspirations and his dreams for his country and Africa. His death has deprived Africa and the entire world of a wise  erudite and humane statesman. We shall all miss his candour and unswerving commitment to the vision of a just international order.81.	Permit me to say how happy and honoured I am to convey to this Assembly the personal greetings and good wishes of Alhaji Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari  the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria  I also take special satisfaction and pride in addressing the Assembly at this major turning-point in Nigeria's history.82.	After 13 years of military rule in Nigeria  we have just concluded a unique experiment of orderly and peaceful transition to a democratically-elected  civilian Government. Last July and August  my compatriots in six weeks went to the polls in five separate national elections to fill 19 state assemblies  the Federal House of Representatives and the National Senate  in addition to electing 19 state governors  and finally the President of our country. All these elections  which were conducted peacefully and in a free  open manner  marked a significant milestone in my country's political and constitutional history 83.	On Monday  I October 1979  the former head of the Federal Military Government  Commander-in- Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria  General Oluse-gun Obasanjo  formally handed over power to the new President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in a solemn ceremony at the Tafawa Balewa Square  Lagos  the same site where the rebirth of our nation was consecrated nearly two decades ago. The moral impact and  I daresay  the political significance of the ceremony cannot be exaggerated.84.	Nations  like men and women  sometimes make mistakes. This is regrettable. But it is more regrettable when they miss the opportunity to make history. The Armed Forces of Nigeria have made history because they have lived up their honour and duty. They took up the sword to defend and preserve our national integrity and sovereignty  which was threatened in 1966. They pledged to hand over power to a civilian Government  democratically elected and freely inaugurated  once the constitutional arrangements had come into effect. They have lived up to this expectation. Given this tradition and precedent of peaceful and orderly transition from military to civilian Government  Nigeria is today not only irreversibly united as a nation  but completely at one and at peace with itself. Not only have we solved our problems of divisions and secessionsâlegacies of a colonialism whose sole raison dâÃªtre was to pit brother against brother in order to consolidate its exploitative strangleholdâbut we have also embarked on an honourable national course that fully respects and promotes all human  social  economic and political rights of every citizen  regardless of race  colour  creed or sex. Above all  we are committed to the simple precept that independence is nothing but the government of the people by themselves. Thus  with their tasks accomplished  the armed forces of Nigeria have now proudly marched back to the barracks of their own volition to perform their traditional role of defending our fatherland against external aggression.85.	New Governments tend to address all issues at the same time. Mine is no exception. But we have the advantage of hindsight  perspective and continuity. This is because the cardinal principles of my country's foreign policy have their roots as deep in the genius of our people as in the history and circumstances of our country and continent. We are proud that many nations and peoples identify with these principles.86.	Those who speculate that our new civilian Government will be less dynamic in the pursuit of our foreign policy objectives will be disillusioned. If anything  and because we shall be operating from a firm foundation  we intend to pursue them with greater drive and greater vigour. Let me therefore emphasize that the quintessence of Nigeria's foreign policy has been  and will remain  the pursuit of international peace and security; strict non-alignment; international solidarity and adherence to the principles and purposes of the Charters of the United Nations and of the OAU; the protection and defence of human dignity; constructive partnership in the campaign for the enjoyment by all states of equitable economic and political rights; an unswerving commitment to the total liberation of Africa; and the eradication from southern Africa of the twin evils of colonialism and apartheid.87.	Naturally  we shall give primacy to the pursuit of peace and security in Africa  without which we can neither be safe nor prosper. In this connexion  my Government condemns most vigorously recent interferences by some European countries  notably France  in the internal affairs of some African countries. Like the Bourbons of old  they have clearly proved that they have learned nothing  and forgotten nothing. Leadership in any State is as good as the people of that State want it to be. Those African leaders who parody themselves after foreign models or who degrade themselves by exploiting their people through insensitivity  corruption or callous brutality will be swept away by their own people into the dust-bin of history  just as their colonial masters were driven out of Africa in ignominy and revulsion. It is only the leadership which grows out of the people that will endure. In recognition of this fact  the OAU long ago affirmed as one of its cardinal principles the ""unreserved condemnation  in all its forms  of political assassination as well as of subversive activities on the part of neighbouring States or any other State"". The era of self-appointed kingmakers for Africa is gone. Africa will no longer tolerate intervention and destabilization exercises in the continent. Dependence of political institutions on foreigners from whatever continent is both anathema and a betrayal of Africa's freedom and liberty.88.	Africa stood on the eve of the 1960s proud and defiant. The promise of independence was vibrant and challenging. If the dream in some cases turned into a nightmare  the fault does not lie on our stars. While we derive no consolation from the fact that no country anywhere in the world has a more glorious account of its first 20 years of history to give than those of most independent African States  and while our detractors must bear in mind that the stresses and changes which have unsettled all nations  developed and developing alike  were bound to take their toll more on the new nations of Africa  it is reasonable to state that  given its enormous resources and potential  Africa has not been left alone to develop its own institutions and to provide for its well-being  as others were allowed to at the comparable stage of their history. Former colonial masters not only left behind time-bombs in the form of latent instability and insurrection  but  nurturing their nostalgias and myths of indispensability  they carefully planned their return for insidious political domination and economic exploitation. In fact  it may be true to say that the colonialists never left Africa. They merely exchanged their roles and masks to make their presence less suspect and objectionable.89.	But as we meet on the eve of the 1980s  let no one assume that Africa has not learned its lesson. Those States which profess genuine friendship for Africa must come to terms with a new relationship with that continent. Africa is for the Africans. It is not for sale  nor for division into spheres of influence. We want no dependent status  nor surrogate roles. We seek external economic aid and assistance  fully conscious of our dignity and inalienable rights. Let all foreign Powers recognize that. Whatever they can do for us now can never compensate for the debt they owe Africa  directly or indirectly.90.	One area in which we intend in Nigeria to subject to the acid test all professions of friendship by each and every State for Africa is in southern Africa. The rabid racism which apartheid represents to all men of conscience; the inhuman exploitation of man by man  unprecedented in the annals of man since the slave trade of the eighteenth century  which apartheid constitutes; the grotesque dehumanization of an entire people which apartheid has institutionalized; the systematic and massive violation of human rights which apartheid promotes  and the blatant and consistent destruction of life which it encouragesâall these and more make apartheid a crime against humanity. That a minority racist regime in a country which has no claims to be a world Power can defy the United Nations at will has ominous implications for the survival of our Organization. How else can one judge the efficacy of the international will  if the United Nations cannot implement its decisions arrived at unanimously and in accordance with the provisions of its Charter? What recourses there for the peaceful resolution of the problems of southern Africa  when South Africa  in violation of international law  bombs refugee camps and invades the territory of neighbouring countries in naked pursuit of a policy of aggression  intimidation  and terrorism?91.	Nigeria has been following closely Zimbabwe's progress to full independence. The colonial Power  the United Kingdom  has recognized  albeit belatedly  that it has to negotiate with the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe for the transfer of power to the people of Zimbabwe  if the hope for a just and durable settlement in Zimbabwe is to be realized. From all accounts so far  the contributions of the Patriotic Front  under the leadership of Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe  to the current Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London have been constructive  imaginative and most helpful. It is Nigeria's hope that justice and realism will prevail  and that the London talks will restore power and sovereignty to the Zimbabwean peoples on a basis which will justify international acceptance and recognition. Otherwise  international sanctions against the illegal regime must continue  and the armed struggle for freedom and independence  under the leadership of the Patriotic Front  will be intensified.92.	The situation in Namibia is no less intolerable. Early this year  we had hoped that the plans of the Security Council for Namibia's transition to independence would be implemented. Events have belied that hope. Instead of progress  the United Nations now seems to have allowed itself to be lulled into inaction. In my delegation's judgement  there has been too much bending over backwards to accommodate the so-called Government of South Africa that is in illegal occupation of the Territory of Namibia. And not enough is being done to assist SWAPO and the people of Namibia to regain their independence. In strict terms of international law  morality or natural justice  the United Nations should not put itself in a position of appearing to condone an illegal and illegitimate act of piracy by a State which has forfeited the goodwill and respect of the international community.93.	The United Nations Charter brooks no double standards. There is no ambiguity regarding how it should deal with errant Member States. It was in recognition of this that the last session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held in Monrovia  called upon the United Nations to invoke the provisions of Chapter VII  in its entirety  against South Africa over Namibia. Nigeria is committed to press for the implementation of that decision.94.	Behind all these problems of southern Africa is the racist minority regime of South Africa  whose conduct now raises the spectre of a racial war in our continent. South Africa continues to be emboldened it its intransigence by its supporters and friends  particularly in the Western bloc  who make a ritual of condemning its apartheid policies  while they increase their trade  investments  arms and technological transfers  as well as their assistance in the development of nuclear capability  with its regime. Perhaps the time has come for the United Nations to undertake a comprehensive study of how much the attitude of some Western States is determined by their dependence on the strategic minerals and commodities of South Africa. We shall initiate the necessary studies in due course. Further  as internal and international opposition to its policies intensifies  it is painfully obvious that South Africa intends  through the employment of mercenaries and subversion  to threaten the peace and security of our continent  In the past year alone  the OAU has had to adopt two urgent resolutions calling attention to the menace of mercenaries and requesting that its convention against mercenaries be reinforced to deal effectively with the problem. Nigeria therefore intends  in co-operation with its African sister countries  and countries such as Barbados  to submit formal proposals for an international convention to ban the recruitment and activities of mercenaries in Africa and throughout the world.95.	The situation in the Middle East continues to pose a very serious threat to international peace and security  For too long has that region  whose ties with Africa are as intimate as they are eternal  has been the tinder- box of hostilities and the cockpit of wars  with the accompanying defilement of its populations. We firmly believe in a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question in which peace and justice triumph together. We cannot therefore but remind the protagonists of any peace initiative in the region that the question of Palestine and the rights of its people remain at the core of the continuing crisis in the Middle East and that  unless this central issue is addressed fully and directly  no just and durable solution to the crisis should be expected.96.	As Nigeria has had cause to state before  the relationship between the problem of the Middle East and the question of Palestine is integral  both in its consideration and in its solution. Consequently  partial treaties and partial agreements will not suffice. The Palestinians  in common with all of us  have a God- given  inalienable right to a national homeland. They must achieve independence with full sovereignty. They must not be held hostages to the security or boundary considerations of any State in the region.97.	We therefore call again upon Israel to withdraw from Arab lands occupied since June 1967. We call upon Israel to desist from building new settlements in the occupied Arab lands and to stop administrative and other measures designed to alter the demographic and cultural character of the occupied lands in violation of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949. We recognize the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians. We re-emphasize that Arab Jerusalem is an integral part of the occupied West Bank  which must be liberated.98.	The harrowing experience and suffering in Lebanon oblige us to emphasize the need for an early and viable peace in the Middle East. It is unimaginable that the United Nations should appear to be so impotent in the face of persistent attempts by Israel to undermine a United Nations peace-keeping operation in a beleaguered Member State. The United Nations should evolve a more strict and practical solution with a view to ensuring the integrity of the Lebanese nation and to guarantee the right of its peoples to live in their traditional peace and freedom.99.	The mandate of UNIFIL to secure the return of the Lebanese Government's authority to southern Lebanon must be fulfilled. As a country contributing to that Force  Nigeria fully endorses the view that an adequate security zone must be established around UNIFIL headquarters  that the renegade Haddad's forces must end their harassment of the UNIFIL troops and that over-all co-operation of all parties concerned must be forthcoming. In addition  Nigeria expects that a more determined effort will be made to remove all the obstacles in the way of UNIFIL; for instance  all Member States must share its prescriptive obligations. It is our hope that delegations will not demur at making their contributions to the upkeep of UNIFIL and in extending it their full co-operation in its complex and delicate task.100.	Another issue which must be addressed in this connexion is the continued harassment by the Israeli authorities in the form of arrests and trials of members of UNIFIL. This raises the question of whether the time has not come for the United Nations to enunciate more precise norms and rules in a convention defining the status and immunities of United Nations peacekeeping troops as international civil servants not subject to capricious blackmail and harassment by a national government. I am aware that there are various peace-keeping agreements relating to this matter  but they all differ. Perhaps the Special Committee on Peace-Keeping Operations  of which I have the privilege of being the Chairman  may be directed to consider the need for an instrument that would establish standard and uniform rights  obligations and immunities for peace-keeping personnel.101.	Many years ago  when UNFICYP was set up  with its double mandate for peace-keeping and peacemaking  it was hoped that it would play the decisive role in ensuring the return of tranquillity to Cyprus and thereby assist in upholding the principles of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of that country  with which Nigeria has close ties of friendship. Just as the stalemate in the intervening years  exacerbated by the tragic events of 1974  has remained a matter of grave concern to Nigeria  so also was the failure to build upon the ten-point agreement reached after the Secretary-General's personal intervention last May. Nigeria believes that the various decisions and resolutions of the United Nations  as well as those of the Conferences of non-aligned countries  provide a basis for a just peace.102.	At the end of its eighth session recently  we learned with relief that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has entered its final stages  and that it is scheduled to end next year. The fact that the negotiations have been protracted and difficult should steel us in our determination to ensure that the convention to be adopted will bequeath to future generations a peaceful regime for the exploitation of the sea. The exploitation of the sea and its resources must be fair and rational.103.	One of the most serious crises facing mankind today is the chaotic state of the world economic situation. There is an ominous indication that the poor developing countries beset by the difficulties of underdevelopment  natural disasters  inflation  unemployment and exchange-rate fluctuations  among others  are being made to subsidize the rich industrialized nations through structural and institutional defects in the world economic system. We had expected that dispassionate discussion of economic matters within the context of dialogues between the developing and the developed countries would have removed these anomalies.104.	We note with deep regret that the economic negotiations held so far this year have been most disappointing. At the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held in Arusha in February  the developing countries agreed on a programme of collective self- reliance  in which great hopes were placed. That was to have been the basis for realistic negotiations between the developed and developing countries at the fifth session of UNCTAD in Manila. Unfortunately  instead of addressing the main issues facing the economy of the international community  the Conference concentrated on matters of secondary importance  and wasted precious time on trying to sow division and discord in the ranks of the developing countries. Similarly  the Tokyo Round on multilateral trade negotiations  which was h6ld in Geneva within the framework of GATT  ended by protecting only the interests of the developed industrialized countries. We hope that the recent agreement on the constitution of UNIDO as a specialized agency  the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development and the decision to convene a special session of the General Assembly in 1980  in order to assess the progress made in the various forums of the United Nations system in establishing the New International Economic Order will remedy some of these short-comings.105.	The goal which the developing countries have set for themselves is the restructuring of international economic relations in a way which would accelerate the narrowing of the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries  through trade and aid  and increased net flows of real resources. To this end they wish to initiate measures that will enable them to deal with their mass poverty  mass unemployment and galloping food deficits. In response  the developed countries have merely demonstrated their hesitation  if not lack of political will  in achieving the desired goal of establishing the New International Economic Order. There is no gainsaying that the struggle to eliminate the inequities of the existing international economic system and to establish the New International Economic Order is an integral part of the struggle for the elimination of colonialism  foreign exploitation and all forms of subjugation and interference in the internal affairs of States. It is against that background that Nigeria fully endorses the new strategy adopted at the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries in Havana to strengthen mutual co-operation among the developing countries  and to begin international negotiations within the framework of the United Nations on all the social and economic problems facing the international community.106.	The economies of many rich  industrialized countries were built and nurtured on the availability of cheap petroleum  to the detriment of the oil-producing countries. However  since they have succeeded in establishing quite satisfactory pricing mechanisms in conformity with the dictates of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  the members of OPEC are being cast in the role of scapegoats. They are being blamed for virtually all the economic difficulties in the world  from inflation to the artificially manipulated price of gold. It is very strange that those who speak lightly of the subject have not stopped to consider seriously what component of international inflation is contributed by oil. It is even stranger that they have not questioned why each of the industrialized countries with economies that work  like Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany  hold far greater foreign reserves than all the OPEC countries put together.107.	Nigeria fully appreciates the plight of the developing countries  particularly the least developed  a majority of which are in Africa. We admit that recent increases in the price of oil have aggravated their hardships. But oil is only a part of the problem. We need to consider carefully and collectively relevant solutions to the global issues of raw materials  development  finance and energy. And this must be done soberly and with full comprehension. The challenge we all of us face collectively is how to evolve during the next United Nations development decade rational procedures for the utilization of the world's shrinking natural resources  bearing in mind  of course  the crying needs of the developing countries.108.	It is superficial to speak of the inherent contradictions and distortions in the world economic system which militate against the poor nations without referring to the disproportionate resources being consumed by armaments  particularly nuclear armaments. Every nuclear testâand there were over 250 nuclear tests in the past year aloneâblights the hopes and aspirations of over 1 million children for education and health care. The annual unproductive expenditure of $400 billion on armaments far exceeds five times the total net flow of resources to developing countries as a whole from all sources  which stood at $63.93 billion in 1977. In fact  it is more than half of the combined gross domestic product of all the developing countries together. Viewed from another angle  the least developed countries of the world had a total outstanding external debt of $10 billion  and as a result had to mortgage 15 per cent of their export earnings in that year for debt payments. How relieved they could have beenâwhat a prospect for a fresh economic start they could have hadâif one fortieth of 1 per cent of the annual armaments budget of the nuclear-weapon States had been diverted to cancel out their external debts.109.	Another illustration will show how resources which could have brought stability and development to some region of the world  say Africa  are being frittered away in the production of nuclear armaments that no one dares to use. The 49 independent African States have with the approval of the United Nations launched a Transport and Communications Decade in Africa  which  they hope  will enable them to integrate their economies and provide a viable basis for accelerated progress. The programme is estimated to cost $8 billion over 10 years. The Powers that do not hesitate to budget $400 billion for destructive purposes are wary of supporting and making pledges for such a constructive scheme as Africa's Transport and Communications Decade.110.	In consideration of these facts  Nigeria had fervently hoped that the text of a comprehensive test-ban treaty between three of the nuclear-weapon States would have been submitted for consideration at this session  as promised. It is a matter of deep regret and concern that once again we are being asked to accept their word on trust. It is also because we believe in the existence of an organic link between disarmament and development that we have over the years supported all moves for the elimination of nuclear weapons during the first Disarmament Decade and  failing that  the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones  particularly in Africa. Hence also our proposal two years ago that perhaps through fellowship grants and enhanced dissemination of public information mankind could be made more aware of the dangers of nuclear weapons and of their debilitating effects on the world economy. And hence we also welcome the agreement reached at the second round of SALT  for that agreement only makes sense because it puts a ceiling on the probable amount of resources that could be burnt up in a mindless nuclear arms race.111.	The dangers we face as we enter the 1980s are too real for us to despair. Beset as mankind is  on the one hand  by economic burdens and  on the other  by fear of a nuclear holocaust  constructive and collective action through the United Nations remains the only hope and opportunity we have to face the challenges of the future. Only thus can we leave a legacy worthy of our civilization to our children  as we meet to consider their prospects and problems in this International Year of the Child."
"97",5134,"NIC",34,1979,"ï»¿We are grateful for this opportunity to be here. We greet the President of the General Assembly  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  and we wish to express our appreciation of the action which Mr. Kurt Waldheim has taken and continues to take on behalf of the people of Nicaragua.3.	For 34 years  the Somoza regime usurped the representation of Nicaragua at the United Nations. For 34 years  intervention spoke in this hall through the voice of Somoza and his followers. For 34 years  the representatives who walked along these corridors and spoke in these forums on behalf of Nicaragua were an offence to the conscience of peoples.4.	In 1945 it was Somoza and his National Guard  both of them the results of intervention  who made themselves members of the United Nations.5.	On 19 July 1979 it was the people of Nicaragua who became a Member of the United Nations.6.	For 34 years the Somoza regime found support in this Assembly among those representatives who were also enemies of their people.7.	The triumph of the Popular Sandinist Revolution in Nicaragua also brought about the defeat of unjust positions  attitudes of surrender  a policy of intervention  crime  torture  theft  genocide  and the exploitation represented by the Somoza dictatorship and defended by his accomplices.8.	But the Sandinist victory also resulted in a modest but resounding triumph for peoples who had fought for national liberation  true democracy and peace. And just as Somoza found accomplices in the United Nations  the people of Nicaragua found brothers in the United Nations.9.	In our victory  we wish to greet the representatives of revolutionary Governments  of progressive Governments  of democratic Governments who sided with the people of Nicaragua.10.	The war waged in Nicaragua was a war of liberation. In our country the people  united and led by the Sandinist Front for National Liberation  defeated in an unequal battle the occupation troops which North American intervention had left behind after assassinating Sandino.11.	In Nicaragua  we always saw in Somoza and his so-called National Guard the exemplification of foreign aggression. Only thus can one understand the great unity of the people and the barbaric nature of the Somoza regime.12.	The Somoza dictatorship has no equal in Latin America. A criminal capable of bombing schools  hospitals  entire cities  of assassinating women  children and old people  or setting fire to and looting the country  can only be a foreigner or  more accurately  a mercenary. Somoza faithfully followed in the footsteps of William Walker  that freebooter from the southern United States who  in 1857  after setting fire to the city of Granada in our country  left a sign which read1 'Here was Granada"".13.	We have said and say again that among other things  the Somoza dictatorship left our country in a state of economic bankruptcy. At this time we shall not draw attention to figures on the losses caused by the bombing of the dictatorship's air force  nor to the inability of our country to meet its payments  nor on its foreign debt  and so forth. But we do believe that it is our obligation energetically to appeal for unconditional support for the reconstruction of Nicaragua.14.	Peoples who in Africa  Asia and Latin America have been subjected to slavery and servitude to the big  so-called ""civilized"" countries have been overcoming domination at the cost of immense sacrifices. 15.	Men have been declared free in the world  and independence and sovereignty have been decreed in most countries on earth. But other  subtler forms of domination have replaced the shackles of slavery. The world market  international financial organizations and banks are instruments of political persuasion and of economic subjection. We know that the Somoza regime was the most faithful representative of those alien interests in our country.16.	Somoza and his henchmen brought the economy of our country into bondage; they eased the way for the looting of our natural resources; they incurred debts with international banks on behalf of Nicaragua. But are we to blame the Somoza regime alone? Would it not be fitting to ask who bears the greater responsibilityâ whether it was Somoza who managed investments  loans  mortgages and so on  for personal gain  or those who provided those investments  loans and mortgages?17.	In 1972  an earthquake shook our country. The losses were enormous and international assistance came swiftly. But it was no secret to anyone that the dictator and his clique of civilians and military officers shared everything among themselves  from food-stuffs to financial grants and loans.18.	That fact was more than enough to justify condemning the dictatorship and refraining from giving it one cent more. But other interests prevailed  and considerations of economic and political bondage were more powerful than those of justice and morality.19.	In the last two years of the dictatorship  world repugnance became more and more manifest. In those last two years the dictatorship's criminal activities increased blatantly; in those last two years thefts by the dictator and his accomplices were revealed.20.	But  in that time  short-term loans and credits from the international banking system at high interest rates increased to such a degree that in the months to come the people of Nicaragua are due to pay back approximately $600 million. Nicaragua cannot pay that debt; nor will it incur new indebtedness to do so.21.	Somoza and his accomplices have opened bank accounts and made investments outside our country with the money they obtained from international banks  money they stole from the people. It is Somoza and his accomplices who must be sued by Nicaragua's international creditors.22.	It is our opinion that the external debt that the Somoza regime left in Nicaragua must be taken over internationally  and above all by the developed countries  the economically powerful countries  starting with those that routinely fed the Somoza regime with financing. So the people of Nicaragua proposes to this Assembly of the United Nations the adoption of that idea.23.	As we have said  our struggle is one of national liberation  and at present we are at the stage of national reconstruction. That fact makes our country a target for imperialist policy.24.	The most aggressive circles of the United States and of Central America dream of restoring the Somoza regime to our country. A macabre alliance is endeavouring to take over our revolution. It is trying to develop the idea that the Sandinist philosophy is a threat to the Government of El Salvador. It now appears to be alleged that the problems of El Salvador  such as the assassination of peasants  workers and clergy  are provoked by Nicaragua.25.	Some North American representatives maintain that they have been informed by the Government of El Salvador and by industrialists and businessmen of El Salvador that we Sandinists have started various operations in that country to bring about the downfall of its Government. A member of the United States Senate  Richard Stone of Florida  for example  affirms this and rushes to the defence of the Salvadorian ""democracy""  saying that he will ask the Government of the United States to be more vigilant with regard to Nicaragua.26.	We see all this as a provocation meant to justify economic  political and even military pressure on Nicaragua.27.	We in Nicaragua could not prevent the people of El Salvador from rejoicing over our victory. We Nicaraguans could not prevent ourselves from becoming an example that would be of concern to the most notorious criminals in Latin America. But  at the same time  we have formulated a policy designed to normalize our relations with all Governments in the world  in a context of equality and mutual respect.28.	With a view to our total economic and political emancipation  we decided to join the non-aligned countries  and at their Sixth Conference in Havana we defined our international position.29.	We agree with the idea of the unity of the weak  and just as we have shared the triumph of our revolution with free peoples and those that are not yet free but are struggling to break the chains  so today we also consider the implementation of the treaties returning to Panama its sovereignty over the Canal Zone to be a victory for our peoples  but above all for the people of Panama  which had sworn to seize the Canal on 1 October of this year at whatever cost.30.	At this time we recall the victory of the peoples of Latin America when  at the historic 17th Meeting of Consultation of Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Organization of American States  imperialist attempts to intervene in Nicaragua were defeated.31.	Today  the news speaks of the people captured in Puerto Rico. Members of the religious community  lawyers and politicians are being arrested. The human rights of the citizens of Puerto Rico are being violated by the maintenance of United States military bases on the island of Vieques and the non-recognition of Puerto Rico's inalienable right to independence.32.	Let us see how many of those senators who are now concerned about the fate of the Somoza guards and about the security of the Salvadorian Government are going to protest because of this inconceivable violation of the human rights of the Puerto Ricans. 33.	We place on record our protest against the escalation of repression unleashed against Puerto Rican patriots.34.	In our struggle for peace  for independence and for genuine change  we support Bolivia in its struggle to obtain an outlet to the sea; we support the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the Frente POLISARIO and the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  Nicaragua emphasizes its historical solidarity with the long- suffering  heroic and fighting people of Palestine. As we have said  we support the Palestine Liberation Organization  which is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  as well as the organizations I have mentioned as the legitimate representatives of peoples who are fighting for their freedom and independence.35.	We also feel that we have a moral obligation to support the people of Belize in their striving for independence and the people of Korea with their goal of reunification and the withdrawal of North American troops from the south of that country.36.	At the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries  we stated our repugnance with regard to the genocidal Pol Pot clique  which  like Somoza  was the product of foreign intervention and  as such  was in its turn made use of as a spearhead for aggression against the heroic people of Viet Nam.37.	Who does not know that the criminal regime set up by Pol Pot and his clique was the product of the expansionism of the Chinese leaders? Is it not that brutal and cowardly expansionism that has created crises in South-East Asia? Chinese troops have committed aggression against Viet Nam; Chinese troops continue to threaten Viet Nam. But the spirit of the people of Viet Nam has become stronger than the huge death-dealing Chinese divisions  and we look on with repulsion while a delegation of the so-called Democratic Kampuchea â in other words the representative of genocideâusurps a place in this Assembly. Those who voted in favour of that representation have done nothing other than to support the expansionist policy of the Chinese leaders  which form a bloc in international forums with the most reactionary and murderous sectors of the world.38.	Nicaragua  a small  independent country that wishes to honour its position of non-alignment  associates itself with the heroic people of Viet Nam.39.	We are waging and shall continue to wage a battle alongside and on behalf of the oppressed peoples of the world. We are waging a battle and shall continue to do so without compromise of any kind. We are striving and shall continue to strive for the advancement of our people  for the defence of our revolution  for a just peace that is that of sovereign peoples and for a genuine peace that is the peace of free peoples."
"98",5180,"NLD",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  it is for me a particular honour to congratulate you upon your election to the Presidency of this Assembly. Close and warm indeed  Sir  are the bonds of friendship and co-operation between our two countries. I personally recall in particular the visit of Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands to the United Republic of Tanzania. I salute through you  Mr. President  one of the great leading countries of Africa.â66.	Forty years after the beginning of the Second World War  it is fitting to reflect on the past and to draw lessons for the future. When last week I visited Poland  the first victim of that war  I was deeply struck by the memories of the past but also by the opportunities for the future. It is fitting to remember war and aggression  the massive violation of fundamental human rights  the destruction of democratic institutions  the immense human suffering and the economic and social disruption. Let us not forget the collapse of the League of Nations  which failed because of its lack of universality and because its Members lacked the courage and political will to use it as a tool for peace.67.	In 1945  nations united ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights. Do the nations of today remember the lessons of the past? Much has been achieved. A new world conflagration has  so far  been avoided. Colonialism is virtually abolished. The world possesses the universal system of the United Nations with its invaluable network of organizations for economic and technical co-operation. Universal standards and obligations have made the protection and promotion of human rights  anywhere in the world  a matter of public debate and of direct national and international concern. Technological revolution and worldwide communication have made the world physically one.68.	These are indeed no mean achievements; and yet  that same technological revolution has failed to break the vicious circle of economic backwardness and mass poverty. Bitter regional conflicts persist and threaten world peace. Universally accepted codes of human rights are apparently unable to prevent massive and widespread violations of those rights. Although in some areas progress has been made  the Secretary-General is right in presenting  in his report on the work of the Organization  a picture of ""uncertainty  tension and conflict"".69.	My friend and colleague  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland  yesterday expounded the views of the nine members of the European Communities on the main problems and issues with which the General Assembly will be confronted  The tone and the contents of his statement have shown that political co-operation among the nine continues to gain in scope and in depth. This is a matter of satisfaction for the Netherlands Government. I am convinced that the Europe of the nine membersâand soon  it is to be hoped  of twelveâinspired by its democratic principles and institutions  can and must play an increasingly active and constructive role in the United Nations  in political and economic  as well as humanitarian matters.70.	Now  as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands  I wish to address myself  in a realistic approach  to some key issues  keeping in mind the following premises: first  the ideals of democracy based on the political  economic and social rights of the individual human being; and secondly  the relationship between political  economic and humanitarian issues. And from these two premises I wish to speak about human rights  about refugees and the situation in Southeast Asia  about southern Africa  about the Middle East  and about development and disarmament. And in each of these issues the human  political and economic factors are intimately linked; each will require new  realistic approaches.71.	I shall speak first about human rights. The spiritual and material well-being and happiness of man must be the first and principal objective of our individual and collective efforts. Every violation of human rights affects  and sometimes destroys  the happiness and well-being of individual human beings. Massive and persistent violations of human rights can seriously affect peace and security and  conversely  conflict and war lead to the suppression of basic rights. There is a relationship between the denial of human rights and economic and social backwardness. Development cooperation can be a tool to promote human rights. The realization of this relationship has led to a process of rethinking and self-examination in our Organization with regard to its work for human rights and fundamental freedoms  and the over-all analysis undertaken by the Commission on Human Rights has resulted in a number of significant recommendations being adopted by the Economic and Social Council. These recommendations will strengthen the capacity of the Commission on Human Rights and of its Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities more effectively to perform their functions  with the continued and active support of the nongovernmental organizations.72.	I feel grateful for the confidence the Council has shown towards my country in electing it a member of the Commission on Human Rights. We shall measure up to that confidence.73.	My Government regards the promotion of human rights as an essential part of its foreign policy  Four months ago  I submitted to the Netherlands Parliament a memorandum entitled ""Foreign Policy and Human Rights"". I did so  together with my colleague the Minister for Development Co-operation  because we recognize the link between human rights policy and development policy. Parliament will shortly hold public hearings on the memorandum  thereby demonstrating the concern in the Netherlands with human rights.74.	The United Nations plays a crucial role in the struggle for world-wide respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Its achievements in establishing objectives  guidelines and norms in this field have ushered in a new era of international relations. Situations and events in the sphere of human rights  wherever or in what country  have become matters of legitimate international concern and action. More work in standard-setting is to be done  and I refer  for example  to the need for further action in promoting the equality of men and women in society. The conference on this subject  to be held in Copenhagen next year  will be of great significance. This Assembly should finalize the draft Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and should encourage further work on the issues of religious intolerance and capital punishment 75.	But while the United Nations has made progress in setting standards regarding human rights  we have been less successful in translating those standards into actual practice. The Secretary-General is right.âMember States must face up to their responsibilities. Reports about grave and massive violations of human rights continue to reach us from a number of countriesâreports about large-scale detention  torture  and the disappearance and physical liquidation of political opponents  as well as reports about religious intolerance  forced expulsions and atrocities committed against entire sectors of the population. It is true that some repressive regimes have disappeared  but we are still witness to cruelty and intolerance in various parts of the world.76.	We  the United Nations  cannot be indifferent to this. We must do our utmost to achieve and to maintain minimum standards of human decency.77.	One of the consequences of the disregard for human rights is the continuing flow of refugees. This year we saw an explosive increase in the number of refugees in South-East Asia. I welcomed the initiative of the Secretary-General in inviting representatives of a great number of Member States to meet with him in Geneva in July at the Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia  to discuss ways and means of alleviating that problem. I agree  by the way  with the Secretary-General and my colleague from Norway  Mr. Frydenlund  that that Meeting was a good example of how the United Nations system could effectively deal with limited international issues. On behalf of my Government  I reaffirm our resolve to co-operate in the efforts  under the guidance of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  to provide help to those who have fled their country.78.	I wish to underline the principles that demand respect for the rights of individual human beings and provide a firm basis for the orderly conduct of relations between States.79.	The recognition and observance of these principles constitute a prerequisite for any permanent solution. Any breach of the principles of asylum and non- refoulement would constitute a setback for internationally accepted humanitarian standards. However  the present difficult situation in the South-East Asian region cannot be solved by the countries of first asylum alone. The Geneva Meeting rightly stressed the common responsibility of the whole international community to seek durable solutions both to the immediate and to the underlying problems. The readiness to strive for adequate transitional resettlement facilities  for resettlement in third countries and for long-term development assistance in creating better living conditions for all the people in the area should help to overcome the present intolerable situation. I want to make a special appeal to the authorities of the countries of origin of refugees and  in particular  to Viet Nam and Kampuchea  to live up to their basic responsibilities. Nobody should be forced to leave his country because of fear or because conditions have been made so unbearable that he can no longer stay.80.	The situation in South-East Asia is only part of the world-wide refugee problem. Other regions equally demand our attention. I have deep respect for the valuable efforts made by many countries to overcome the refugee problem in their regions  as demonstrated  in particular  at the Conference on the Situation of Refugees in Africa  held at Arusha  United Republic of Tanzania  from 7 to 17 May.81.	I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  Mr. Paul Hartling  and to the members of his staff. If the present situation would require strengthening the Office of the High Commissioner  I should invite the Secretary-General to present proposals to that effect for the present session of the Assembly to act upon.82.	Of immediate concern is the appalling situation in Kampuchea. Hundreds of thousands of children  women and men are threatened with starvation and death. A whole people is on the verge of disintegration. I do not wish to make a judgement on the political situation. Regardless of who is in power or authority  aid must be given without delay. The Netherlands is ready to join in. This Assembly should forthwith and unanimously urge all concerned to adopt all measures to make immediate relief possible.83.	While immediate relief of human suffering must have priority  the world should be aware of the underlying and interrelated economic and political problems in South-East Asia. In his report  the Secretary- General states that the situation could become a threat to world peace. The primary responsibility for averting such a threat and for the economic and social reconstruction of the area rests with the countries of IndoChina themselves. But the great Powers also carry a heavy responsibility for peace in the area. The surrounding countries belonging to the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] are rightly concerned with the situation. I wish to pay a tribute to their joint efforts for unity and regional stability in Southeast Asia.84.	However  the international community should not stand aside. The countries of the region should be given a new perspective for peace and development through international co-operation. We have available the instruments for economic and social reconstruction and development. Let us use the possibilities of the Mekong Committee  of ESCAP  and of the Asian Development Bank. The Netherlands is prepared  with others  and provided that the political conditions are favourable  to assist in the long-term development of the region.85.	Systematic negation of fundamental human rights is also the crucial issue in southern Africa.86.	The position of principle of the Netherlands remains unchanged. We condemn and reject apartheid. If South Africa fails to change its fundamental policies  further pressure by the international community  including sanctions  will be inevitable. South African control over Namibia must come to an end. The democratic process towards independence under international control must forthwith be pursued and completed. Zimbabwe must achieve independence under democratic majority control. So long as majority rule does not exist  the sanctions against the illegal regime must be strictly applied.87 The Netherlands welcomes the Lusaka agreement on the future of Zimbabwe and urges all the parties concerned to grasp what may be the last opportunity to avoid further bloodshed and chaos in Southern Rhodesia and  unavoidably  in the surrounding States. I therefore fervently hope that the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference convened by the United Kingdom Government in London will be successful.88.	The abhorrent policy of apartheid remains the crucial problem in South Africa. I recognize that fundamental change is difficult and painful  but apartheid must be brought to an end. Of late  new voices of reason and change have been heard in South Africa. I want to make it very clear that the Netherlands remains convinced of the need for continued political  moral and  where effective  economic pressure. Yet I believe that those new voices ought to be listened to and encouraged. While there is still time and hope  we must not close the door  as long as by not doing so we can contribute to the radical changes which alone can save South Africa from chaos and ultimate disaster.89.	My colleague from Ireland has stated the position of the nine States members of the European Community on the Middle East and has fully reflected the position of the Netherlands.90.	In the political and military complexities of the situation in the Middle East  none of us should forget the fate  the anxieties and the suffering of the people. Thirty years of conflict and war have brought untold suffering to the peoples of the Middle East. None of us should forget the sufferings and anxieties of the men and women of Israel  or the sufferings and the yearnings of the Palestinian people and the bloodshed caused by all acts of violence.91.	Developments during the past year have led us to believe that there is new hope of finding a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict that is so tragically dividing the peoples  the men and women of the Middle East  and which continues to constitute a threat to world peace. In this International Year of the Child what deeper yearning can there be than for new hope and a new future for the children of the Middle East?92.	As one of the countries participating in UNIFIL  the Netherlands finds itself directly involved in the peace-keeping efforts in the Middle East. I strongly endorse what the Secretary-General states in his report on the work of the Organization on the essential task of conflict control which UNIFIL has performed and is performing in one of the most sensitive and explosive parts of the world. Indeed  to withdraw the Force would be an almost certainly disastrous experiment which nobody would seriously advocate. I emphatically repeat the appeal made by the representative of the Netherlands in the Security Council and made through bilateral and other channels to all parties concerned fully to respect the vital peacekeeping tasks of UNIFIL and to avoid any joint action which might prevent the Force from carrying out its mandate. I join in the urgent appeals to maintain the present truce in southern Lebanon.93.	I have always been deeply convinced of the need for effective peace-keeping machinery. Some of the problems encountered by UNIFIL and other peace-keeping forces of the United Nations are due to the persisting lack of agreement on rules and effective machinery for peace-keeping operations. The United Nations is in serious difficulty on account of the financing of current operations. Last year  the nine members of the Community submitted constructive proposals on peace-keeping operations.  .which unfortunately did not meet with unanimous support. The UNIFIL experience confirms the necessity of pursuing our efforts to agree on practical ground rules  procedures and machinery for United Nations peace-keeping operations.94.	Development co-operation is an essential element of a foreign policy directed towards peace  security and an equitable distribution of wealth and prosperity in the world. This requires special attention and persistent policies for the strengthening of the structural position of developing countries in the world economy as well as continued efforts to fight mass poverty. Peace and security can eventually not be maintained in a world in which the majority of countries and people are politically independent but continue to remain in a position of economic dependence and poverty. Sustained prosperity in the North will  in the long run  not be possible without promoting the prosperity and the demand in the South through large-scale transfers of resources  open world trade and equitable distribution of raw materials  sources of energy and wealth. That is the purpose of development co-operation. But there is more involved than economics; and that is the relevance of human rights and development. There is growing recognition  and I quote from the Secretary- General's report"".. .that there is a human right to development  that respect for human rights can create a climate in which people are inspired to greater efforts for development  and that human rights considerations must feature as essential components in the integrated approach to development..."".It was in that spirit that the Netherlands granted aid to Nicaragua and Uganda immediately after the disappearance of their oppressive regimes.95.	The Netherlands will continue its active development co-operation policy  both through the promotion of structural change in world economic relations and through specific national and international policies directed to combat mass poverty. Notwithstanding serious budgetary difficulties we shall maintain for next year a level of official development expenditure of more than 0.8 per cent of our gross national product.96.	My Government has received with great interest the proposal of the Group of 77 to launch a new round of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development as a new and important initiative designed to give further impetus to the North-South dialogue. It is significant that the developing countries have proposed to include energy as one of the major issues to be dealt with in this new round of negotiations because it is obvious that questions of supply and demand of energy  including its price  of energy conservation and of new and renewable sources of energy are issues of vital importance for the future of world economy. The proposals of the Group of 77 raise difficult and important questions of substance  institutions and procedure. It is particularly important that such a new round of negotiations should not hamper or interrupt ongoing negotiations in various forums. The Netherlands stands ready to discuss and negotiate these questions and all the implications of the proposal in the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174. Simultaneously  work on the strategy must be pursued.97.	Disarmament is perhaps the most vital question of human rights because in this nuclear age the survival of mankind itself is at stake.98.	The possible proliferation of nuclear explosive capability should for all of us be a matter of utmost concern. Proliferation will destabilize regional and international security and will make nuclear disarmament between existing nuclear-weapon States even more difficult to achieve. The most important barrier against the spread of nuclear weapons is the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. More than 100 States have become parties to this international instrument  some of them recently. Other countries and in particular those most advanced in developing a nuclear capability must overcome their reluctance to join the non-proliferation Treaty.99.	The non-proliferation regime must be strengthened. Our goal must be to achieve consensus on a new set of rules in the field of international co-operation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy  including assured supply  while avoiding the risks of proliferation. Both the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation and the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are vital in achieving such a new consensus.100.	Cessation of the nuclear arms race between existing nuclear-weapon Powers is a prerequisite for effective non-proliferation. The second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] is a vital stepping-stone towards that goal. The early ratification of the agreement reached is of great importance. Negotiations for the third SALT agreement should then start as soon as possible. The conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty has become a matter of the greatest urgency in view of the first Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. A renewed failure of the Powers concerned at long last to conclude that treaty would badly affect the outcome of that Conference. Negative nuclear security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States which have forsworn the nuclear option as well as the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in appropriate regions are other matters of vital importance for securing a new consensus on non- proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy  I must express particular and serious concern with the situation and recent developments in this respect in south Asia. We have received repeated assurances from both India and Pakistan on the peaceful nature of their nuclear programmes. While understanding their economic need for energy  I would urge and invite the two countries to confirm these assurances by becoming parties to the non-proliferation Treaty or by agreeing on all the necessary safeguard and guarantee measures which would eventually turn south Asia into a zone free of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.101.	Next to non-proliferation  the issue of the conventional arms race requires high priority in the United Nations. The process of disarmament would be jeopardized  peace could be endangered  if we fail to agree on international measures to control the increasing export of conventional arms to many countries and regions in the world. Here  third-world countries bear the same responsibilities as the industrialized world.102.	All the issues I have dealt with have in common the interrelationship of political  economic and humanitarian factors. They also have in common the need for effective  world-wide institutions. I was impressed by what I may call the passionate plea of the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  in his report  for strengthening the United Nations and for safeguarding the integrity of the international civil service. He raises the question whether the United Nations  in its present stage of development  would be able to deal with a dramatic threat to international peace and security. I come back to my starting pointâ 40 years after the Second World War. The year 1979 is not 1939 but let us never forget the fatal consequences for the world of the collapse of the League of Nations when it failed precisely to meet that threat to peace and security. The only answer to Mr. Waldheim speaks the resolve of this Assembly never to forget the horrors and the lessons of the past and to use and strengthen the United Nations  the only worldwide organization we have  to save our children and succeeding generations from the scourge of war."
"99",5226,"NOR",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. During the many years you have spent at the United Nations as the Permanent Representative of your country  you have built for yourself the reputation of a most dynamic and respected diplomat  and it gives us special pleasure to see you presiding over this session of the General Assembly.177.	I should also like to express to the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the great appreciation of my Government for his tireless efforts on behalf of the cause of peace all around the world.178.	During the past year the international situation has been marked by uncertainty  tension and conflict. The problems facing us have never been more difficult or complex. This is in essence the serious message that the Secretary-General has conveyed to us in his report on the work of the Organization. And he has raised the question of whether we are capable of managing the course of world events. We have to admit that the answer to this question is uncertain  not least when we observe how a series of international negotiating processes are at an impasse. For instance  the North- South dialogue has so far not yielded any decisive break-through in the endeavours towards a New International Economic Order; we have not succeeded in making any substantial progress in the work for international disarmament; the international protection of human rights is still not sufficiently developed; the Middle East and southern Africa are still dangerous areas of conflict; and a critical situation has arisen in South-East Asia.179.	A period of sustained growth in the economy of the industrialized countries has come to an end. These countries are now going through a period of uncertainty and recession. This has  in turn  led to a worsening of the already very difficult situation of the developing countries. We have yet to develop methods of international co-operation capable of solving problems in the fields of energy  inflation and unemployment.180.	The world economic crisis is a serious obstacle to progress towards the solution of international economic and social problems. In the prevailing situation  it is more difficult to gain acceptance for the demands for increased transfer of resources to the developing countries and for the access of their products to the markets of the industrialized countries. The complexity and urgency of these demands are  however  too important to be brushed aside with a reference to existing economic difficulties.181.	The current economic crisis cannot be solved through protectionism or unilateral measures by individual countries or groups of countries. The response should be a strengthening of global economic cooperation. We have therefore noted with positive interest the proposal referred to the General Assembly by the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  We support the idea of a new global round of negotiations on energy and monetary  financial development and trade questions.182.	We also support the principle that such global negotiations should be conducted within the framework of the United Nations and should be open to all countries. We must make use of already existing organs of co-operation and avoid disrupting ongoing negotiations. It is important that these negotiations should be thoroughly prepared and should be given an appropriate institutional framework. We share the view of the Group of 77 that the Committee of the Whole has a major role to play in this regard.183.	The negotiations during the eighth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea resulted in encouraging progress  inter alia  by setting a definite deadline for the adoption of a new convention on the law of the sea. The presentation of a new revised negotiating text11 has raised hopes that the efforts to reach agreement on a fair and broadly acceptable compromise treaty will prove successful.184.	Norway will continue its active endeavours to contribute to the solution of outstanding issues  including the establishment of an international regime for the utilization of the mineral resources on the deep-ocean floor. These problems are closely linked to important negotiations going on in various other United Nations forums for the establishment of a New International Economic Order.185.	If the concept of the ""common heritage of mankind"" is to have any real meaning  the international sea-bed authority must be rendered capable of functioning effectively. To a considerable degree  this depends upon the will of the industrialized countries to transfer technology and capital to the sea-bed authority and the developing countries.186.	The coming year's discussions will show whether the necessary political will really exists. A new convention on the law of the sea is the best assurance that there will be stability and order in the use and management of ocean resources.187.	The Norwegian Government has supported the Camp David agreements and the Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel as representing an important first step towards an over-all solution in the Middle East. One positive result in the peace process now under way is the withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied areas in Sinai.188.	In order to further the peace process  it is necessary to clarify the question of the rights of the Palestinians and their participation in the negotiations. We have lately observed some encouraging indications of contact and dialogue between the parties concerned. It is only through such contacts that it will be possible to come closer to a solution that will safeguard the right of all States in the area to exist in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and ensure for the Palestinians their legitimate rights. A peace settlement must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It is therefore important that all parties accept these resolutions.189.	As a member of the Security Council and a troop- contributing country to UNIFIL  Norway follows with great concern the developments in southern Lebanon. We denounce all acts of violence and we have repeatedly appealed to the parties concerned not to obstruct UNIFIL in carrying out its mandate. A continued deterioration of the situation in southern Lebanon could compel the United Nations and the troop- contributing countries to question whether they can justify maintaining the United Nations Force in the area. On behalf of my Government  I would therefore repeat our appeal to all parties concerned to refrain from further violence and to co-operate with UNIFIL. We endorse the view of the Secretary-General that the United Nations Force is performing a vital peacekeeping task in southern Lebanon and that it represents a stabilizing factor in the entire area.190.	My Government welcomes and supports the decision of the Commonwealth Meeting in Lusaka on Zimbabwe  as well as the ongoing negotiations in London. It is important that all parties have now been brought into the negotiating process. We would strongly urge the parties concerned to make full use of the opportunity which now exists to reach a negotiated settlement. The alternative is a continuation of the armed struggle and an increased risk of the internationalization of the conflict.191.	Despite the attitude of South Africa  we believe it is essential to continue the efforts to implement the United Nations plan for Namibia. We therefore support the efforts being made to that end by the five Western countries and the front-line States. However  one cannot expect that the momentum of the negotiations can be maintained indefinitely. If South Africa continues to refuse to co-operate with the United Nations on an internationally acceptable solution in Namibia  that would inevitably lead to new international measures against that country.192.	As a consequence of South Africa's apartheid policy  Norway has  in co-operation with the other Nordic countries  introduced a number of measures against South Africa. We intend to proceed with this policy. We are also prepared to contribute to increased international pressure being brought to bear on South Africa.193.	The Geneva Meeting in July on the question of the ""boat"" refugees from Viet Nam was characterized by a marked will to co-operate and made an important contribution to the solution of the problem. I would like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for their initiative and the way in which the Conference was prepared and carried out. We hope that the results achieved in Geneva will be followed up by all parties.194.	The fate of the ""boat"" refugees must not  however  make us forget the humanitarian problems in Kampuchea. It is important that all parties to this conflict do not make the emergency relief operation dependent on political conditions.195.	At the same time we must not overlook the serious refugee problems in other parts of the world. We  for our part  are prepared to consider new proposals which may contribute to the solution of these problems.196.	In the field of human rights the greatest challenge now consists in securing greater harmony between norms and behaviour. At this General Assembly we must therefore focus attention on the question of improving the machinery and the procedures for the protection of human rights all over the world. An immediate and realistic step would be to strengthen regional co-operation arrangements in this field.197.	Better co-ordination and a more rational division of labour between the many bodies is called for in the field of human rights. The establishment of a post of High Commissioner for Human Rights continues to be a question of importance in that connexion.198.	In our opinion  increased attention should also be given to particularly vulnerable groups such as the indigenous peoples of the world.199.	The World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women will take place in 1980. The situation of women in the family  in society and in employment must be given more attention  both in our efforts to strengthen the protection of human rights  and in bringing about economic and social development. In our view it is therefore important that ""Employment  Health and Education"" have been chosen as the sub- theme of the Conference.200.	Progress in the field of disarmament depends primarily on the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. It has been a matter of encouragement to us  that in spite of existing problems between them  they have been able to conclude the SALT negotiations through the agreement signed in Vienna. 201.	This negotiating process should be continued. It is vital not only because of its impact on arms control  but also because of its contribution to detente between East and West and to improved relations between the two Super-Powers.202.	Another major task consists of preventing the proliferation of nuclear arms to more States. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is to be reviewed by an international conference in August 1980. We will work at that conference towards a strengthening of that Treaty.203.	A comprehensive treaty on banning nuclear test explosions would also be of the greatest importance in ensuring a successful outcome of the forthcoming conference on the non-proliferation Treaty.204.	Norway will continue its efforts to obtain international support for an idea we launched at the special session of the General Assembly on disarmament.  I am referring to the idea of an arms-control impact analysis in connexion with the decision-making process on procurements of larger arms. The impact analysis will provide a basis for identifying areas where restraint should be shown in the perspective of arms control and disarmament. They will thus contribute to increased consciousness of the scope and implications of the individual country's decisions in regard to arms procurements 205.	I share the view of the Secretary-General that the United Nations can play a more active role in solving international problems and conflicts. The prerequisite  however  is that the Member States themselves make better use of the opportunities offered by the United Nations. This will strengthen confidence in the Organization.206.	Norway's membership in the Security Council this year has left us with the impression that more countries are prepared  to a greater extent than before  to use the United Nations as an instrument for peace-making and peace-keeping. This is a positive development which will enable the Security Council better to discharge its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations. This will be particularly important for the smaller countries like my own. Norway considers it an important task to contribute to such a development through our work on the Council.207.	This brings me  however  to a broader question  Is the United Nations system today in a position to contribute effectively to the solution of the problems confronting the international community?208.	The response of the 1970s to that question was characterized primarily by the large special conferences held under the auspices of the United Nations. These conferences have been important  because they have focused attention on major problems of our times. They have helped to form public opinion and have created a sense of awareness in the various individual countries. Moreover  the conferences have adopted declarations of principle and programmes of action which have formed the basis for further work on these questions. The task of the 1980s must be to transform these programmes and declarations into practical measures. This task demands different working methods: it demands the necessary political will and adequate institutional machinery.209.	I think that the Geneva Meeting this summer on the refugee situation in Indo-China is a good example of what can be achieved at ad hoc conferences which take up concrete and limited issues  where participation can be restricted to the countries most interested  and the meetings  as at Geneva  can be completed in the course of a few days. Thus we should consider whether the time is not ripe for more conferences of this kind  more subject-oriented negotiations  limited in time and scope.210.	In this process  both regional and global organizations have a significant role to play. If such conferences are to be successful  a high degree of coordination is needed and we must avoid a duplication of effort in the different organs involved.211.	The present situation may also call for another look at some of the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Restructuring of the Economic and Social Sectors of the United Nations System. We have in mind  in particular  strengthening the role of UNDP in the development activities of the United Nations system  and the necessity of improving communications between the United Nations proper and the specialized agencies.212.	The Secretary-General pointed out in his report on organizational questions that the working methods of these organizations have not been adapted to meet the increased level of activity. The machinery is overburdened  efficiency is reduced and the ability to act has been weakened. I would like to associate myself with the Secretary-General's assessment  and also to support his request that we give priority during this session of the General Assembly to rationalizing the work of the United Nations and to making it more effective.213.	Most of the problems of the United Nations of course can be traced back to political disagreement between Member States. It is not a simple matter  therefore  to make proposals which can strengthen the organization in the short term. However  in his report  the Secretary General suggests solutions to some of the most urgent practical problems. I should in particular like to mention the proposals to strengthen the role of the General Committee  to streamline the Assembly's agenda  to reduce documentation and to increase the efficiency of the Main Committees.214. It is in our interestâthe interest of the Member Statesâthat the United Nations should become a vigorous and effective organization. We should all make our contribution to this end."
"100",5271,"NPL",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is my privilege to convey to you and  through you  to the representatives assembled here the cordial greetings and the best wishes of my Sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev  for the success of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Please allow me  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  to extend to you our warm felicitations on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your wise guidance  which is already evident in your organizational skill  the work of this session will be successfully concluded. Let me assure you of our fullest co-operation in all your endeavours to this end during the present session.2.	Our appreciation is also due to Ambassador Lievano of Colombia for his able  firm and impartial conduct of the work of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.3.	I take this opportunity to compliment our Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  for his devotion to the work of the United Nations and for his untiring efforts in discharging the onerous responsibilities en-trusted to him by this Assembly.4.	Mr. President  my delegation wishes to associate itself with your statement to this Assembly on the passing away of the great Indian leader  Shri Jayaprakash Narayan.5.	We welcome Saint Lucia as the newest Member of the United Nations; in our view the admission of Saint Lucia is a further step towards the universality of membership of this Organization.6.	It is a great pleasure for me to address this Assembly on our perception of international relations and events during the current year. The past year  as the Secretary-General has rightly observed in his report on the work of the Organization  has been a year full of ""uncertainty  tension and conflict"". This does not sound heartening as we are on the threshold of a new decade. As we are meeting in the wake of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which constitute two thirds of the nations of the world  it may be appropriate for me to refer to that Conference and its conclusions. No oneâever many non-aligned countriesâwould expect us to agree fully with all those conclusions and recommendations  but it goes without saying that the Havana Conference  as the largest gathering ever of the world's Heads of State or Government  and its final documents represent a great moral and political force in international affairs and a consensus of mankind in general on the state of the world situation.7.	The areas of conflict continue to pose a challenge to international peace and security. The progress  if any  in the process of detente is having very little effect on the course of international events in many corners of the world  events which have proved to be of a dubious  negative character. There may be no traditional bipolar division of the world  but there is no escaping the fact that sharp divisions  reinforced by armed conflicts  continue to characterize the relationships between and among nations of the world. Nowhere are these realities more evident than in southern Africa  the Middle East and South-East Asia.8.	Southern Africa continues to be one of the focal points of tension in international relations. The illegal minority regimes of southern Africa have persistently refused to recognize the right of oppressed peoples  led by their national liberation movements  to self- determination  national independence and majority rule. We have always condemned the hateful system of apartheid in South Africa as inhuman and an insult to the civilized world and joined the international community in urging the Security Council to impose on the racist regime all the sanctions provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter.9.	South Africa's refusal to co-operate with the United Nations in implementing the plan for free and fair elections in Namibia under the supervision of the United Nations has delayed an early attainment of independence in that international Territory and thus frustrated the aspirations of the Namibian people to true national liberation. The so-called internal settlement resulting from the fraudulent election of April this year in Zimbabwe has been denounced by the international community as a mockery of the legitimate aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe.10.	We reaffirm our position that  pending a genuine transfer of power under a negotiated settlement acceptable to all the parties concerned  which it is hoped may emerge from the ongoing constitutional conference in Londonâno recognition should be given to the so- called majority Government of Bishop Muzorewa  nor should the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against Rhodesia be lifted.11.	Consistently opposed as we are to colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism  apartheid and all other forms of domination and exploitation  we reiterate our firmest support for the struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa  under the leadership of national liberation movements recognized by this world body  by the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and by the non-aligned movement  to achieve full independence and the total elimination of racism and apartheid. We believe that the process of decolonization in southern Africa has reached a decisive stage.12.	The situation in the Middle East continues to be disquieting. In keeping with our well-known stand on the Middle East problem  we do not support occupation by Israel of Arab territories  and we view the increasing number of Israeli settlements in occupied territories as illegal and believe that they will hamper the peace process. We call upon Israel to withdraw completely from the territories occupied since 1967. We maintain the view that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) form the basis for a lasting  just and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem. While we support the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to live within secure and recognized boundaries  for peace to be durable in the Middle East we consider it essential to recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and their right to a separate State. Failure to recognize this reality will not create conditions essential to peace initiatives. In this context  we view the Camp David agreements and the Egypt- Israeli Treaty as a partial step which we hope  will not impede a just and comprehensive solution of the Middle East problem. It is  therefore  only logical that the Palestinian people should be fully involved in the negotiations aimed at bringing about peace in the Middle East.13.	The Middle East problem is further complicated by repeated attempts to impair the integrity of Lebanon and weaken the unity of its people. We reaffirm our support for the territorial integrity of Lebanon. As a troop-contributor to UNIFIL  Nepal is concerned to see that UNIFIL carries out its mandate effectively and without obstruction from any quarter. We are equally concerned to see the fullest restoration of Lebanese authority in the troubled area as early as possible. A strong supporter of the United Nations peace-keeping operations  we urge all Member States to contribute in every possible way to the strengthening of this useful machinery of the United Nations.14.	Recent developments in South-East Asia have caused us concern. These developments  that have un-fortunately taken place at a time when countries of the region were engaged in reconstruction following a protracted fight  have not only disrupted the socio-economic conditions of the neighbouring countries of the region  but are also contrary to the established norms of international behaviour. The political implications of interference in the internal affairs of a State Member of the United Nations by the use of force or aggression can by no means be overlooked. Foreign aggression and external interference in the internal affairs of others  wherever they take place  be it Southeast Asia  Africa or elsewhere  are simply unacceptable to my country. It is our considered view that the more powerful countries should not encroach on the sovereign jurisdiction of the less powerful ones. My country' would passionately call for the withdrawal of foreign forces from all occupied territories and the recognition of the right of all countries  without exception  to chart their own destiny without pressure or interference from any quarter.15.	We fully share the concern that humanitarian problems should receive immediate attention  and we are pleased to note that the Geneva meeting convened by the Secretary-General to discuss the Indo-Chinese refugees  had some positive results. We hope that the international community  and in particular the industrialized countries of the world  will provide generous assistance in alleviating the plight of refugees  who are victims of injustice and oppression. We sincerely wish to see the peoples of Indo-China happily engaged once again in national reconstruction and all-round development.16.	It is a pity that  despite the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  it has not been possible to make progress on the Cyprus issue. We favour the resumption of intercommunal talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General and support a political settlement based on strict respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus. In our view there is no justification for continued foreign occupation of Cyprus.17.	On the Korean question  we continue to hold the view that the aspirations of the Korean people to national reunification should be fulfilled peacefully by their own efforts and without any outside interference whatsoever.18.	The escalating arms race in the world brings home to us the bitter fact that  despite the lessons we have all learned from destructive wars throughout the centuries  we still continue to seek security in armaments. Security does not depend on our arsenals of war  but rather on an atmosphere of peace  justice  mutual respect and confidence. The escalating race in armaments does not contribute to the building of that atmosphere. Peace cannot be maintained by a balance of terror and nuclear warheadsâa balance which can be upset by any number of factors  including accidents. Additionally  the arms race represents the most glaring example of wasteful economy. Even a minuscule fraction of the resources wasted on armaments  if diverted for peaceful purposes and for the building of the economy of developing countries  will contribute to the establishment of a New International Economic Order  an objective which has so far remained only on paper. It is ironic that the greatest achievements of science and technology are being increasingly used in the development of anti-values  even by those of us who can least afford it.19.	My delegation last year had welcomed the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  adopted by consensus at the first special session ever devoted to disarmament  as having formed a sound basis for substantive negotiations in the field of disarmament. The reorganization of the Committee on Disarmament as a negotiating body was another positive outcome of the special session. More than a year has elapsed since then and we have already begun discussing the next special session to be held in 1982. But little progress has been made in the negotiations on key issues relating to disarmament. It is widely accepted that general and complete disarmament under effective international control is the ultimate goal to which we are all committed.20.	Like most delegations  we attach the highest importance to nuclear disarmament. We call upon all nuclear-weapon States  and in particular the two major nuclear Powers  to bear a special responsibility for achieving nuclear disarmament. We have noted with satisfaction the conclusion of a Treaty at the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] between the United States and the Soviet Union.6 It is our hope that this Treaty  when ratified  will pave the way for another at the outcome of the third round of SALT. However  we regret that agreement has not yet been reached on a comprehensive test-ban treaty.21.	As a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  Nepal has consistently opposed vertical and horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons. We look forward to the 1980 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which  we hope  will contribute further to the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime. We are also aware of the importance of the limitation of international transfers of conventional weapons  for such transfers would create unstable conditions at the regional level.22.	An important as well as effective disarmament measure  in our opinion  is the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace. We have supported the denuclearization of Africa and the establishment of such zones in the Middle East and South Asia. The 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace and the proposal made by the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] for a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality have received our continued support.23.	As our own national contribution to peace and as a true expression of our ultimate desire for peace  my august sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra  has proposed that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. This proposal is eminently consistent not only with my country's age-old search for peace  but also with the principles of non-alignment and the purposes of the United Nations. Nepal will never seek to create trouble in our region nor can we afford to be embroiled in any situation of tension which is not of our making. Our greatest task is that of the development of our peopleâ economic  social and spiritual. This is the rationale of our proposal for a zone of peace for Nepal  which is calculated  as His Majesty King Birendra noted in his address to the Havana Conference  to consolidate the excellent state of relations which we maintain with all our friends. We take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to all our friends who have supported our proposal for a zone of peace.24.	It is gratifying to note that  as a result of our conscious policy of friendship and peace and the open policy of good-neighbourliness pursued by other countries of the region  the general situation of South Asia is good  particularly when it is compared to the situation prevailing in other parts of Asia. With the formal admission of both Pakistan and Iran into the fold of the non-aligned movement  the whole South Asian region is fully non-aligned. This has added several new dimensions to the possibility of peaceful development of the entire region. Nepal will do its best to maintain and promote this atmosphere of peace  friendship and co-operation in the region by pursuing a good-neighbour policy based on non-interference and understanding and accommodation of the legitimate aspirations of others.25.	Turning now to prospects for economic growth and stability  we are faced with a grim scenario. More than half of the people of the world languish in absolute poverty  while the rest of them indulge in luxury and overconsumption. It is generally admitted that the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade has failed to narrow the income gap between developed and developing countries. The gap  on the contrary  has further widened during the 1970s. Despite the repeated calls of developing countries for the implementation of various resolutions  decisions and recommendations relating to the establishment of the New International Economic Order  insignificant progress has been made towards this end owing to the lack of political will on the part of those who have resources  technology and skill  and their reluctance to share their burden of responsibility for the establishment of a new order based on peace  justice and equality for ail.26.	High rates of inflation  growing unemployment  a sharp decline in the terms of trade caused by fluctuations in the prices of primary products exported by developing countries  the constant instability of the international monetary system  sharp increases in the price of oil and the drop to a mere 0.3 per cent in the net flow of real resources to the developing countries are matters of deep concern to all developing countries. With a few exceptions  the international commitment by developed countries to transfer 0.7 per cent of their gross national product as official development assistance to developing countries remains unimplemented.27.	It is increasingly realized that the existing international economic system is unjust and incompatible with the development of developing countries. Developing countries are fully convinced that a lasting solution to their problems can be achieved by a fundamental restructuring of the New International Economic Order.â28.	The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77  in a declaration issued at their third meeting  held in New York from 27 to 29 September 1979  have strongly reaffirmed that the United Nations system is the only framework within which all negotiations of a global nature relating to the establishment of the new International Economic Order should take place. We hope that the proposal adopted at that meeting for the launching  within the United Nations  of a round of global and sustained negotiations on international economic co-operation for development with the full participation of all States and within a specified time-frame will be positively received by all developed countries. Such negotiations  to be effective  should no doubt be action-oriented and be predicated upon an integrated approach to the main issues involved  such as raw materials  energy  trade  development  money and finance.29.	The international community is sufficiently aware of the difficult situation facing the least developed  land-locked and island developing as well as the most seriously affected countries. While the need to support vigorously the legitimate demands and aspirations of these countries in the organs  organizations and programmes of the United Nations system has been recognized  the crisis facing the world economy has further aggravated the problems of these countries. Since most of the land-locked developing countries are also among the least developed  their problems are of a structural nature  and we have repeatedly called for special attention to be given to the pressing problems of these countries and  as a matter of priority  special but urgent additional measures to be taken to overcome structural constraints impeding their rapid social and economic development. We have noted with satisfaction the comprehensive new programme of action for the least developed countries adopted at the fifth session of UNCTAD and urge its immediate implementation. It is  however  regrettable that the United Nations Special Fund for Land-Locked Developing Countries  with woefully meagre resources at its disposal  has not been able to meet the resource requirements of land-locked developing countries. We appeal once again to all rich donor countries to contribute generously to this Fund.30.	In view of the ever more acute energy problem  we attach considerable importance to the United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy to be held in 1981. Similarly  the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly to be held to assess the progress made in the various forums of the United Nations system in the establishment of the New International Economic Order and  in the light of that assessment  to take appropriate action further to promote the development of developing countries and international economic co-operation  and the adoption at that session of the international development strategy for the third United Nations development decade  will be of exceptional significance. We also recognize the importance of the Third General Conference of UNIDO to be held in New Delhi in 1980.31.	In the light of what has been stated above  co-operation among developing countries is of paramount importance. We are convinced of the need for taking suitable measures to ensure that the great potential possessed by developing countries is substantially mobilized for effective mutual co-operation. In this context  the adoption by the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 of the Arusha Programme for Collective Self-Reliance and Framework for Negotiations was a useful contribution to the promotion of economic co-operation among developing countries. It is our hope that that programme will be implemented without delay. It is pertinent to draw the attention of this Assembly to the fact that my country  endowed as it is with vast water resources  has called for the prudent exploitation of those resources which can bring benefit not only to us but to the countries of the region as well. But that requires capital investment  the training of manpower  a proper political climate in the region and good understanding among  and genuine cooperation from  our neighbours.32.	The recently concluded eighth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was not able to break the deadlock in the negotiations on issues affecting the rights of all developing countries. We hope that the next session  to be held in 1980  will be able to resolve satisfactorily the issues which remain outstanding and obstruct the adoption of a comprehensive convention on the law of the sea. It has been our consistent position that a future convention on the~ law of the sea  if it is to be just  fair and equitable  should fully embody the ""common heritage"" principle for the benefit of mankind as a whole. At the last session of that Conference my delegation had the honour of introducing a proposal relating to the establishment of a common heritage fund. That proposal  sponsored by nine countries  is designed to ensure that some of the immense revenues accruing from the exploitation of non-living resources in the exclusive economic zone are regarded as the common heritage of mankind and are used to finance the development of developing countries. The fund could also be used to help in fighting ocean .pollution  to assist in the transfer of marine technology and to help the work of the United Nations. It is our conviction that acceptance of the idea of generous sharing in the vast ocean resources as envisaged in our proposal could make a most constructive contribution to the realization of the objectives of the New International Economic Order. We earnestly hope that each delegation will give serious consideration at the next session of the Conference to the great potential of the common heritage fund. Finally  we stress the need for the Conference to give due recognition to the legitimate interests of land-locked countries  including their rights of free access to and from the sea and freedom of transit.33.	The United Nations is a unique instrument de-signed to maintain international peace and security  promote harmony  amity and goodwill  co-operation and understanding between and among nations. While we seek further to strengthen this Organization  its effectiveness depends on the positive will and assertiveness of Member States in approaching international issues and solving global problems through the medium of this Organization.34.	We have no doubt that most Member countries want the United Nations to become the truly world Organization originally envisaged in the Charter  one capable of maintaining international peace and security  of resolving conflicts peacefully and of harmonizing the differing interests of the countries of the world. My country belongs to this category of States Members of the United Nations. As a non-aligned country  Nepal believes in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter the quintessence of which  we feel  is represented in the ideals of peaceful coexistence and co-operation among countries which adopt different political  economic and social systems  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the harmonization of interests among various countries. Nepal has full faith in those principles and tries assiduously to put them into practice because in our view they have both moral and practical value if our ultimate aim is for absolute peace to prevail in the world. In putting those principles into practice  we have succeeded in establishing friendly and co-operative relations with our neighbours which  we earnestly hope  will be conducive to peace in the region in which we live and in the world at large."
"101",5335,"NZL",34,1979,"ï»¿As a member of the Commonwealth  New Zealand is pleased to welcome Saint Lucia to the United Nations and to offer its warmest congratulations to the representatives of Saint Lucia at this session of the General Assembly. We look forward to working with the delegation of Saint Lucia in furthering the purposes of this Organization.248.	It is a pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  and other officers of the Assembly on your election. I should be grateful if you would convey my special greetings to Ambassador Salim  the President of this session. New Zealand values its special link with the United Republic of Tanzania. We work together in partnership  within the Commonwealth. We admire Tanzania's example of self-reliance in the struggle for social and economic progress. We admire the leadership Tanzania has given to the movement for self-determination not only in Africa but for all people. We New Zealanders value  in particular  the help Ambassador Salim  as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  has given us as we have worked  loyally and consistently  to promote the principle of self-determination in the small island Territories of the South Pacific which have been associated with us.249.	Ambassador Salim has had the opportunity of seeing how remote and isolated are the islands of the Pacific. New Zealand  too  is remote from the trouble- centres of the world. This geographical isolation  how-ever  has never cut us off from the impact of world events. This year we have followed with attention  and with concern  events in three areas of instability: the Middle East  southern Africa and South-East Asia. We have welcomed the political progress made in the Middle East  limited though that may have been. On the other hand  we have deplored the continued escalation of oil prices  for this has jeopardized efforts to establish a stable world economic order and damaged the economies of many countries. We have taken part  through the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka  in the efforts of the Commonwealth to break the impasse on Rhodesia. But our most direct concern  naturally enough  has been with the conflict that has taken place nearest to us. The calamitous events in Indo-China have caused us the gravest concern. There we have seen continued armed conflict. Vast numbers of people have been forced to move. Starvation and suffering are daily facts of life. Fighting goes on and may well spread. The already desperate food shortage threatens to get worse. The situation is little short of disastrous.250.	My Government is deeply concerned by these developments. The conflict in Indo-China has polarized South-East Asia: a gulf of mistrust now divides the States of Indo-China and the members of ASEAN.251.	New Zealand has close and friendly ties with the five countries that belong to ASEAN. We have welcomed the rapid progress they have made in developing their economies and improving the living standards of their peoples. It has been a remarkable achievement. ASEAN has emerged as a significant force in international affairs. It has been able to make a major contribution towards the stability of the But the longer the conflict continues  the greater the danger that the great Powers will once more involved and establish themselves in the area  the longer the fighting goes on in Kampuchea the more risk there is that it will spill over into Thailand. The conflict in Indo-China threatens to jeopardize not only the prosperity of the ASEAN countries but also their effectiveness as an influence for peace and stability in Southeast Asia.252.	Two attempts have been made this year to resolve the conflict by force. Neither has succeeded  the conflict arises from deep-seated issuesâancient animosities  revived and stimulated by recent actions that have been aided and inflamed from outside IndoChina. Nationalism runs too high for any one party to impose its will on another by force. Peace will be restored only when the countries of the areaâthose in Indo-China and their neighbours  tooâlearn to respect one another's independence and territorial integrity  as they pledged to do when they joined the United Nations.253.	There can be no justification for any government to send armed forces into another country against the will of its people. There is no justification for a government to drive out vast numbers of its own people to hazard their lives on the high seas. It has been abundantly demonstrated that government policies can stimulate  and can retard  the flow of refugees. If that desperate flow of people begins again  the world will know where the responsibility lies. If  however  it ends once and for all  the process of political negotiation can begin. If the withdrawal of forces can be brought about  the normalization of relations can be contemplated. The massive task of relief and rehabilitation for the suffering people of Indo-China can proceed without hindrance.254.	New Zealand has always said that the most pressing need was to begin working towards a political settlement. That need is even more urgent today. Any settlement must be based on the fact that there are three separate countries in Indo-China  each with its own national tradition. These three countries must live closely together. In practice this means that there can be no peace until the independence of Kampuchea is assured and Kampuchea is prepared to co-operate with its neighbours.255.	My Government accepts as logical the decision taken by the General Assembly on the question of Kampuchean credentials. That does not mean that we condone in any way the policies of the Pol Pot Government. That regime was tyrannical in the extreme. It was notorious for its cruelty and its utter disregard for the most basic human rights of its people. Nevertheless  it was the established Government of Kampuchea  and it was recognized by the international community. The same cannot be said of the regime headed by Heng Samrin. That regime was installed by foreign forces. It has failed to demonstrate its independence. The main aim of any political settlement must be to let the people of Kampuchea express themselves freely without the dominating presence of foreign troops. They must be able to decide their own future until those conditions exist my Government sees no justification for expelling the present representatives of Kampuchea or for accepting another delegation 256.	Meanwhile  we face the practical problem of dealing with the human consequences of the continuing conflict. On one aspect of it the United Nations has already taken some effective action. The Meeting convened by the Secretary-General in Geneva in July succeeded in mobilizing greatly increased resources for the relief of refugees from Indo-China. My Government welcomed the Secretary-General's initiative. We are playing our part in the programme he has launched. We have also noted with satisfaction the decline in the flow of refugees since the Meeting. That showed that the Government of Viet Nam was accepting its responsibilities. We can hope  therefore  that there will be no resurgence of the tragedies we saw earlier this year.257.	The most desperate human problem at this moment is in Kampuchea. Continual fighting  following the internal troubles of recent years  has uprooted a large part of the population. Food supplies have been severely disrupted. Before long  10 per cent of the country's population may be starving. Famine would bring a new wave of desperate refugees who would flee to Thailand. The world must stop this disaster happening. Another great effort by the international community is essential. Food and medical supplies must be providedâand right away. New Zealand is ready to join in this new effort.258.	We do not forget that in other regions there are also massive displacements of people. Some of these situations are of tragically long standing. Here  too  the search for negotiated solutions to the conflicts that have caused this human suffering must be a prime concern of this Assembly.259.	In southern Africa there have been some promising developments. The most significant was the agreement reached by the Commonwealth Heads of Government at Lusaka last month. From this came the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference on Zimbabwe Rhodesia. My Prime Minister  to underline his support for the agreement reached at Lusaka  sent a message to all 24 delegates assembled in London for the conference. He said:""The road to a peaceful settlement is now open to you. It is for youâeach and allâto make your contribution to the final stage and to lead your country into independence  peace and stability. I do not minimise the difficulties that lie ahead of you. But I hope that you will keep in mind at all times that the fate of millions of your men  women and children  now and in the future  lies in your handsâand in your hands alone.""260.	New Zealand hopes that  through this Lusaka initiative  which underlines once more the value of the Commonwealth association  one area of southern Africa will at last reach peaceful and legal independence.261.	My Government is also encouraged that the consultations which five Western Powers initiated  over two years ago  on Namibia have been resumed. A possibility now exists for the final  legal independence of the Namibian people.262.	But if there are prospects for a peaceful solution to two of the problems of southern Africa  the third the intolerable system of apartheid  still exists unchecked in the Republic of South Africa. New Zealand joins with the rest of mankind in urging the Government of that unhappy country to move now to break down the barriers of apartheidâ those barricades that deny the very essence of human rights and human dignity to the vast majority of its people. Apartheid nurtures the seeds of bitter and vicious conflict. If only for that reasonâ though it is only one of manyâthe Members of the United Nations cannot rest until the risk of this conflict has been eliminated.263.	In his inaugural remarks the President called on this Assembly to pursue practical means  rather than to promote ever-increasing resolutions  in the search for solutions to the many problems which afflict the world today. Nowhere could his advice be better heeded than with respect to the situation in the Middle East. My Government sees as a significant advance the dramatic events of the past two years  which culminated in the Camp David agreements and the subsequent negotiations between Egypt and Israel. The current efforts of the leaders of these States must be given a chance to succeed. A critical dialogue has begun. The objective of the world community now should be to broaden that dialogue.264.	My Government continues to believe that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) contains the essential element for a negotiated settlement. That resolution remains a central foundation  and it can be built on. It is now widely recognized that the search for a political solution in the Middle East must involve the participation of the Palestinian people. The rights of the Palestinians  including their right to self-determination and to establish an independent Palestinian State if they so desire  can no longer be ignored.265.	The road to a negotiated  just and lasting solution in the Middle East will not be easy. It is critical therefore  that everyone concerned should eschew insensitive or provocative acts. We believe that the continued establishment of Israeli settlements in land occupied during the 1967 war is one such act. The recent outbreak of hostilities in southern Lebanon is another. My Government rejects the policy of pre-emptive strikes by Israel as strongly as it rejects any act which violates the territorial integrity of Israel. The road to peace is fragile. It should not be put at risk.266.	The year 1979 could have been a watershed year for the international community in its continuing debate on global economic reform. The fifth session of UNC- TAD and the Tokyo round of the multilateral trade negotiations were major events which held great promise for a new break-through in North-South relations  but then ended inconclusively. The urgent task of this session of the Assembly will be to find a way of restoring momentum to the debate on the establishment of a New International Economic Order  for the international community faces pressing and dangerous economic problems. The economic ""ripple-effects"" of this year's sharp price rises in oil have become painfully obviousâto developed and developing countries alike. The outlook is for severe disruption to the process of global economic growth. Sluggish rates of economic growth will inhibit the continued development of enlarged ""northern"" markets for ""southern"" goodsâand vice versa. Heavier foreign debt burdens for many countries seem inevitable. Inflation  unemployment  balance of payments disequilibrium and protectionism will feed upon global economic uncertainty. The pressing need to develop new energy sources will be set back financiallyâand therefore technically.267.	No Government need imagine that it will be able to insulate its economy entirely from the effects of a spreading economic malaise. Developing countriesâ and all small economies  that rely on trade  including my ownâwill be especially vulnerable.268.	In the face of these probabilities we can no longer afford the luxury of debating the possibility of new forms of global economic co-operation  structural adjustment and institutional reform. The time has come to put an end to the polemics and arid definitional disputes which have so far characterized the dialogue between North and South. Let us do so in the sure knowledge that if we do not master the forces of economic and social change  they will surely master us.269.	New Zealand looks to this session of the General Assembly  and to the special session to be held in 1980  to bring a new sense of purpose to the unfinished task of formulating strategies for global economic management. We believe that the effectiveness of these strategies and the future well-being of the interdependent global economy will rest  to a very considerable degree  on the success of renewed efforts to find constructive solutions in two critical sectorsâtrade and energy.270.	The explosion in world trade in the last quarter of a century has brought greater prosperity to many countries. We must ensure that this growth is maintained  based upon acknowledgement of the doctrine of comparative efficiency and a positive assault on the forces of protectionism. New Zealand cannot accept that there should be two sets of rules  one for the old industrial producers and another for the rest  that is  for the new industrial producers and for the agricultural producers. Agricultural protectionism is practised by almost all industrialized countriesâto the disadvantage of their consumers and to the frustration of internationally efficient producers  such as New Zealand. That  we believe  is a denial of the responsibility of this generation to establish an efficient production base for feeding the next. This responsibility demands new approaches and positive adjustment policies based on the principles of free multilateral trade.271.	We also have to learn to see energy issues in a new perspective. Experts predict that within the next 10 years the production capacity for our present oil- based energy system will have reached a ceiling. There will be further rises in the real price of oil and an absolute and increasing shortage in relation to total global import requirements. Therefore  there can be no argument: we must move to new energy systems. The challenge lies in how we manage the transitional period. The General Assembly has already risen to this challenge by deciding to convene in 1981 a United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy. New Zealand attaches the highest importance to this Conference. It intends to play its full part to ensure its success. While many important energy questions lie outside its purview  the Conference has the potential to make a significant contribution to identifying new energy systems that will benefit us all.272.	In its short history this Organization has often taken the lead in promoting new goals for social justice  international peace and racial equality. Now it must define new standards for global economic co-operation. New Zealand sees this as an evolutionary process. Not all countries share this view. Yet  regardless of our individual prescriptions for the world's economic ills  I am sure we can all agree that this is the place  and now is the time  to give force to the concept of global economic interdependence which we have talked about for so long. What is needed now in the North-South dialogue is not resolutions  but resolution.273.	We in New Zealand are conscious of the sense of disenchantment in the United Nations and in other international economic bodies with the use to which these existing mechanisms are put. We are ready to look with an open mind at proposals that may come forward for new mechanisms  or new methods of working  to help us find a way around the obstacles which at present inhibit our efforts to achieve a new order in international co-operation. The recent meeting of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 took an important initiative to this end. Such a proposal is an expression of faith in our collective capacity to control our economic destiny. We may from time to time lose faith in the machinery. We cannot afford to lose faith in the goals.274.	Another major topic on the agenda of this Assembly is the problem of disarmament. There are some areas in the vast network of negotiations currently in progress where there is a clear and urgent need to bring the negotiations to a head and to reach new agreement.275.	Foremost among these is the need to conclude a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty. The Pacific was for many years an arena for the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Underground tests are still being conducted in the South Pacific  and elsewhere  despite repeated calls for a halt by the overwhelming majority or the United Nations membership. Last year the General Assembly set a time-table for the conclusion of a treaty. To the regret of us all  that time-table has not been met. It was a reasonable time-table  given the very substantial agreement already apparent on the main provisions of such a treaty. The problems that still stand in the way of a treaty are described as technical. But as a contributor to the work of the ad hoc seismic group  formed to study some of the requirements of a system to monitor compliance with the treaty  we must frankly say that the problems in this area do not seem to us to justify further delay. The conclusion of a treaty is widely recognized as a key to preventing horizontal as well as vertical proliferation.276.	We shall also support endeavours to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. We continue to attach primacy to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to universal adherence to it. Some States continue to stand aside. The balance of advantage under the Treaty appears to them to favour the nuclear-weapons States. They believe also that the nuclear-weapons States have not honoured the obligation they incurred under the Treaty to advance the control and limitation of their nuclear arsenals  and to facilitate the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Be that as it may  the pursuit of a nuclear option by any State not currently possessed of nuclear weapons must inevitably have the gravest implications for regional stability and global security. No nation will enhance its security by these means.277.	How can the international community allay the fears that may lead a country to keep this nuclear option open? It can encourage and support efforts to accommodate differences within regions. At the global level more can be done. The nuclear-weapons States have been prepared to make unilateral declarations undertaking not to use or to threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapons States. Each has  however  qualified the statement in a different way. Without minimizing the difficulties in the way of reconciling these statements  New Zealand would support further exploration of the ground for bringing these assurances together so as to give them a collective and ultimately binding force.278.	New Zealand has welcomed  as a major step in the limitation of nuclear arsenals  the signature of the second SALT Treaty by the United States and the USSR. Like others  we hope it will soon be ratified. We look forward  also  to further rounds of negotiations that will lead not only to reductions in nuclear armament but to corresponding limitations in the conventional field. It is on the success of these efforts  and on the growing confidence that should come from such successes  that progress in other areas will rest. It would be a tragic irony if the acceptance of restrictions in one area led to pressures for enhanced capacity in others. Peoples everywhere legitimately expect that the process of reducing armaments will be made irreversible and that resources currently spent on defence will be redirected to reduce suffering and to advance human welfare.279.	Finally  my Government wishes to pay a tribute to this Organization for its leadership in the field of human rights. In the International Covenants we have a mechanism for the genuine advancement of human rights. Last year in the general debate the Prime Minister of New Zealand expressed our intention to ratify both Covenants. We have done this  and the New Zealand Human Rights Commission has among its tasks that of overseeing their implementation. As a consequence  there have been distinct advances in positive action programmes to enhance the position of minorities  where this is necessary and to introduce new procedures and practices that will help women take their place in the full range of national life. The International Year of the Child has been the occasion of spontaneous action throughout the community to take heed of the needs of children.280.	We have taken pride in our domestic record in the field of human rights  but we are not complacent. As our multiracial society develops  new perceptions gleaned in part from the international oversight which we have accepted as a party to the Covenants  impel us to further efforts to improve our performance.281.	New Zealand wishes this Assembly well in its indispensable endeavours."
"102",5380,"OMN",34,1979,"ï»¿I am very glad to be able to address you  Mr. President from this international rostrum and to express to you on behalf of the Sultanate of Oman and of its delegation  now taking part in the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session. Your election to this high office does confirm the very positive and active role which is played by your country in resolving the important problems facing it. This event  together with other similar events  shows not only the position your country occupies  but also reaffirms the increasing importance of the role being played by the developing countries in the international arena. The well-known ties between our two countries are a further reason for us to express our satisfaction at your election to the presidency of this session. We have confidence in your capacity to guide our work in a way that will ensure maximum success in the achievement of our objectives.352.	I am also very happy to pay a tribute to your predecessor the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  who presided so ably over the work of the thirty-third session.353.	I should also like to express appreciation for the tireless efforts exerted by the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in serving the principles and objectives of the United Nations and for his constant endeavour to enhance the effectiveness of its activity  so that it may discharge the great tasks entrusted to it for the maintenance of world peace and security  thus leading all the people of the world to prosperity and stability.354.	My delegation is equally happy to welcome Saint Lucia as a Member of this Organization and to assure its delegation of our co-operation. I hail the efforts of the United Nations to affirm its universal character  in fulfilment of one of the objectives of the Charter.355.	The thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly is taking place in very complex international conditions which require from all of us a serious examination of the remedies for their causes  if we are to succeed in elaborating adequate solutions for all the problems facing the international community and threatening its peace and stability.356.	The problem of the Middle East  with all the threats it holds for international peace and security  is regarded as one of the most urgent problems facing the world today. That is why finding a just  lasting and comprehensive solution to it has become more important than ever before. This issue  as everybody agrees  is highly important  because it is tied in with the interests of many international parties. What we are witnessing today in Lebanon and in other parts of the Middle East is not isolated from the whole situation arising out of this problem. It is the best evidence of the urgency and importance of finding an early solution to the problem. The Middle East issue has polarized the majority of those in this Organization and world public opinion  because of its direct impact on international peace and security  and on the course of many events in the world  particularly in economic affairs. Despite the good offices of this Organization and other international parties  and their efforts to find a peaceful  comprehensive and just solution that would satisfy all the parties involved in the Middle East issue  the continued intransigence of Israel  its persistent refusal to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories  and to recognize the inalienable national rights of the brotherly Palestinian people constitute a stumbling-block  to the attainment of the just peace we desire.357.	My country has persistently and clearly stated its position on this problem in all international forums  because it is of paramount importance to the world in general and to the Arab and Moslem world in particular. Like all Arab countries  we continue to advocate a solution of international problems by peaceful means. However  peaceful solutions  in our opinion  have to be based on a solid foundation consisting of the principles of international law  equity and the resolutions of the United Nations. Unfortunately  we see that Israel is maintaining its illegitimate occupation of the occupied Arab territories  thus violating all the relevant principles and resolutions. It is pursuing its policy of establishing settlements in the occupied Arab territories  and this is contrary to the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949. It thus challenges the whole international community  which has condemned this policy.358.	The Arab countries have been extremely flexible in their constant efforts and endeavours to find a peaceful solution to this problem  either within the context of the United Nations or outside it. However  Israel has responded to these endeavours by intransigence and by raising more obstacles and hindrances. This has been obvious in the negotiations on autonomy  and in Israel's dubious interpretation of the bases of the Camp David agreements in a manner that does not ensure its complete withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories as provided for by the United Nations resolutions.359.	My country feels that the United Nations should take more effective measures consistent with its earlier resolutions and with the endeavours made by other international parties with a view to finding a just and urgent solution to this important problem within the framework of the following principles: first  the necessity of a complete withdrawal by Israel from the Arab territories occupied since 1967; secondly  recognition of the legitimacy of the inalienable right of the brother Palestinian people to exercise all their national rights  including the right to return to their homes and fully to express their will as concerns self-determination in their own land; thirdly  the restoration of Arab sovereignty over Arab Jerusalem.360.	The close links between my country and the African continent and its peoples are ties of culture  civilization and history that reach far back in time. The interest that we take in African problems derives from those ties and from our geographical proximity to Africa. Our objectives are to pursue the quest for the establishment of peace and stability  to ensure the independence and sovereignty of the African people and the elimination of all racist regimes in Africa and all foreign forces alien to Africa. We are confident that African States can resolve their own problems without any external interference that impedes their progress and shapes their regimes with systems alien to Africa and the African way of thinking.361.	The OAU has in the past dealt with extremely difficult issues; and it remains able to lay the foundation for resolving the present problems which constitute an obstacle to the enjoyment by Africans of the conditions of a free  dignified and happy life.362.	In this understanding  my country welcomes the agreement reached by the Commonwealth countries at their recent Meeting at Lusaka  Zambia  concerning Rhodesia. We also welcome the London Conference  convened by the United Kingdom Government following the Lusaka Meeting  and we hope that the process of reaching a comprehensive settlement through negotiations that is now under way will prove the ideal method for reaching acceptable global solutions.363.	My delegation regrets to have to recall that  despite the three years that have elapsed since the events in the Horn of Africa  that region is still suffering from instability  because it has not yet been possible to find an acceptable and equitable solution to the conflict between Ethiopia and Somalia because of continual foreign interference in that region. Some have taken advantage of regional conflicts to intervene in that region. Some have taken advantage of regional conflicts to intervene in that region of Africa so as to alter the turn of events  and they have done that in the interests of one party and to the detriment of the interests of another. This is a matter of great concern to us.364.	The Sultanate of Oman shares the concern of many States Members of the United Nations  particularly the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean regarding the necessity of taking urgent measures to give effect to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  because we are convinced that the implementation of that Declaration would certainly alleviate tension in the world and remove that region from the field of competition and the attempts at imposing hegemony which we are witnessing today.365.	My country attaches great importance to the early implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  since the Sultanate of Oman is a country in that area and has an extensive coast-line on that ocean. Our support for the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  free from foreign military bases and from nuclear weapons  and removed from the antagonisms of the fleets of the great Powers  stems from our conviction that maintaining the region under constant tension will not provide security and stability nor will it help us to devote our efforts to the progress and well-being of our peoples.366.	The implementation of the Declaration would require first of all the sincere contribution of the coastal and hinterland States to translating its content into fact  It would necessitate the commitment of the States of the area to mutual respect  as well as to respect for regional sovereignty and the principles of non-intervention in internal affairs  non-resort to the use or the threat of force in international relations and compliance with the principle of the peaceful settlement of any disputes  in keeping with international law and the relevant international covenants.367.	Furthermore  all countries directly concerned should respond to the appeals made by the General Assembly to translate that Declaration into practical and effective measures without any feeling of hatred or selfishness. Likewise there should be no attempts at hegemony of the kind so current in the behaviour of some States with expansionist ambitions  which try to realize them and their illegitimate objectives in contravention of international laws and customs.368.	Our object of concern today is what we witness regarding the increasing escalation of the presence of the major maritime Powers in the Indian Ocean. We associate ourselves with the international community in appealing to those Powers to reduce their naval forces and to refrain from expanding their zones of influence in that region  because this contributes to increasing tension and instability in the area.369.	My country has participated in all the activities of the United Nations aimed at making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. It has also participated in the Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean held last July in New York. Despite the fact that that Meeting failed to attain the objectives that we all aspired to  it did succeed in bringing closer together the various views of the participating countries and provided opportunities for all those countries to express their opinion. We hope that this will create an atmosphere of harmony among those views  leading at the outcome to the implementation of the Declaration making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace. I am convinced that  if there is sincere political will among the countries interested in the area  the world community will be able to draw up a legal framework making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.370.	The delegation of the Sultanate of Oman stressed at the thirty-second session from this rostrum the importance of the question of the Straits of Hormuz and the necessity of navigation through it.  The importance of these Straits is now increasing because about 30 per cent of the oil of the world passes through it. The recent rumours about the possibility of operations that might result in impeding navigation through the Straits and interrupting the flow of oil from the producing to the consuming countries are certainly a subject of concern. It is my duty to affirm here once again that my country is always ready to co-operate with all other countries in the region and outside it  with a view to guaranteeing the security of navigation through these vital and important Straits. We invite all countries of the world to co-operate and work together to remove from this important waterway the threat of sabotage that would result in impeding navigation through it. In our opinion  threats to impede navigation constitute a real danger only if they are supported by other countries. So it is essential to launch an appeal for a review of attitudes to ensure that there is a triumph of wisdom  common sense and international interest over limited and passing selfish interests. Faced with all these problems  the Sultanate of Oman  because of its geographical location and the responsibilities incumbent on it  will take all legal steps to prevent navigation in the Straits of Hormuz from being exposed to sabotage  with a view to guaranteeing the security  stability  sovereignty  safety and regularity of international navigation.371.	The Sultanate of Oman participated in the recent Sixth Conference of Heads of State and Government of Non-Aligned Countries. As in the past  my country will continue to support the policy and the activities of the Non-Aligned Movement  so as to protect the movement from any possible attempt to draw it away from its fundamental principles. We trust that the non-aligned movement will maintain its fundamental characteristics and resist all attempts to have it incline to the benefit of one bloc as opposed to another.372.	What is happening in Indo-China is a matter of serious concern. We hope that stability will prevail there so that an end can be put to armed struggle and to interference in the affairs of certain countries of the region. There is need to respect the autonomy and sovereignty of all the countries of the region  without any interference in their internal affairs. That is why my delegation welcomes the results of the Geneva conference  which was convened by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and took place on 20 and 21 July 1979. The conference dealt with the question of refugees from Indo-China  and we of course participated in it. My delegation feels that the international community should endeavour to find a radical and just solution to this problem of Indo-Chinese refugees  so as to ensure peace and stability in that part of the world 373.	I should like now to take up another issue to which my country attaches the greatest importance  the continuing negotiations on the law of the sea. In view of its geographical position alongside straits that are important to international navigation  the Straits of Hormuz  the Sultanate of Oman has adopted firm positions which were already expressed and clarified at sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.374.	My delegation has made a sincere and serious contribution to the current attempts to find an acceptable convention that would be endorsed by all parties. We feel that the progress made so far and during the negotiations at the eighth session  which was resumed at New York  is encouraging. It shows that there is a determination among the negotiators to reach compromise solutions. Here I should like to mention the two compromise formulas we reached on the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed beyond territorial jurisdiction.  We reached those formulas after very protracted  exhausting difficult negotiations  and we must all accept them although we do admit that there are certain practical and delicate details which are still pending. A common management of the resources of the sea-bed must aim at ensuring equal opportunities to enjoy the wealth of the sea. If proper functioning of the sea-bed authority is desired  we must facilitate the transfer of technology and the flow of capital that project and to the developing countries. It goes without saying that the industrialized countries nave a very important role to play in this area  and their political will is of particular importance. The Conference has already set next year as a deadline for the ratification of the awaited convention  which will be the best guarantee of the stability and good management of ocean and sea-bed resources. Such stability would have a most beneficial impact on the consolidation of security  justice and the principle of equity in the world at large.375.	All nations are calling for the elaboration of a clear policy of disarmament. Though negotiations between the two super-Powers are still under way  not too much has been achieved in disarmament. During the tenth special session  which was devoted to disarmament  the General Assembly emphasized important principles. We must all respect those principles  so as to achieve general and complete disarmament.376.	The Sultanate of Oman welcomes the results of the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States of America which led to the signing of the second SALT treaty  and we trust that final ratification will take place very soon  so that the next stage of the negotiations between the two countries can begin soon in order that even greater progress may be made in this field.377.	My country  like other countries in the world  is aware of the increasing importance of establishing a new international economic order based on a just balance between the prices of raw materials and those of manufactured products and taking into account the needs of the developing countries so as to accelerate their development. The view of the Sultanate of Oman on this subject is similar to that of the other developing countries. We support the resolutions of the Group of 77 and their efforts in this connexion. We are convinced that no State can stand isolated from the new international economic co-operation  whatever its economic and technological potential may be  if the majority of the countries of the world should agree on the formula of the principles on which the world economy must rest  so that it may be more equitable and just  particularly as far as the developing countries are concerned.378.	The starting-point in our endeavours and the pillar of our actions should be the resolutions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly  and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  Success in the negotiations between North and South depends on the extent of the co-operation and solidarity of the developing countries  the parts most affected by monetary inflation and increasing price fluctuations. Here we would appeal to the industrialized and advanced countries to increase their aid to the developing countries  so as to raise development rates therein and alleviate the burden of the debts that weighs so heavily on them. We would also ask the developed countries to be more flexible and more serious in the negotiations concerning this subject. In this context my country participated actively  in the fifth session of UNCTAD held at Manila last May. My delegation supported all the positive recommendations that emanated from the Conference.  The pattern of regional co-operation in this field provides an opportunity to broaden international co-operation in general  based as it is on economic and social harmony and integration and on co-ordination and other considerations compatible with the potential of each country of the regional groupings. This promotes friendship co-ordination and good neighbourhood. Accordingly  my country sincerely tried to work out such co-operation in our area and is still seeking to enhance it.379.	My delegation notes with satisfaction that the General Assembly has decided  on the basis of a proposal made by the Group of 77  to hold a special session in 1980. We have to recall here that  despite the fact that the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 achieved only limited results we consider that it should assume the tasks of a preparatory committee for the special session. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly will take the necessary measures to promote the development of the developing countries  to enhance international economic co-operation  and to establish a just international economic order.380.	As far as the energy crisis is concerned  we feel that its causes are not the export prices nor the reduction in the production of oil and its derivatives but mainly and in the first instance  the increase in consumption  which made demand exceed supply. The result was a high increase of price on world markets. Unless we manage to rationalize consumption and find  as soon as possible  oil substitutes for some uses of energy  the problem may worsen. Oil is an indispensable precious commodity. Consequently  the conservation of resources is necessary. My country's policy in this concern is in line with the resolutions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.381.	In conclusion  we trust that at this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly we shall find ways and means of improving our methods of work to bring them more into line with the evolution of this Organization  the increase of the number of its Members  and the importance of the items submitted to us. We should try to limit the number of resolutions adopted by this Organization  so that Member States will be better able to follow up and implement them  and hope thus to reduce the number of condemnations and come to the phase of submitting solutions and alternatives  particularly in those cases where it is unanimously recognized that change is necessary. We trust that this session  under the President's guidance  will be the first phase in building up a better world which will benefit from the experience and results of past years."
"103",5426,"PAK",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  we are fortunate to have a person of your wide experience  wisdom and dynamism to preside over this important session of the General Assembly. Your contribution to the work of the world Organization has been outstanding. Your country  the United Republic of Tanzania  and President Nyerere are the very embodiment of the struggle for the decolonization of third-world nations.54.	Let me also express the deep appreciation of the Pakistan delegation to your distinguished predecessor  Ambassador Indalecio Lievano  for the most able manner in which he guided the work of the last session of the General Assembly.55.	We warmly welcome Saint Lucia to membership in the United Nations  and we look forward to mutual co-operation with the Government and people of that new Member State.56.	The past year has witnessed a most disturbing increase in the use of force as an instrument of policy. Armed attacks and military interventions in the internal affairs of States have become recurrent. Hundreds of thousands of men  women and children have been uprooted from their homes and driven out of their countries.57.	These tragic events underscore the fragility of international peace and the pervasive sense of insecurity that haunts the small and weaker nations of the world. The United Nations is the sole universal organization that can respond to such threats to peace and human tragedies.58.	Pakistan's policies are firmly rooted in the principles of the United Nations Charter and of peaceful coexistence. Our unanimous admission to the non- aligned movement at Havana constitutes recognition of our fidelity to those principles. We condemn the use of force in international relations. We are committed to the peaceful settlement of international disputes. We remain dedicated to the right of self-determination of peoples. We have withdrawn from membership of military alliances. We are opposed to policies of intervention  domination  hegemony and spheres of influence. We have sought to build relations of friendship and co-operation with all States  great and small.59.	With our neighbour  India  the process of normalization of relations continues. We are engaged in the enlargement of areas of co-operation on a basis of equality and mutual benefit. We are determined to seek a resolution of the dispute regarding the future of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the spirit of the Simla Agreement.  A just and peaceful solution of this dispute will usher in a new era of co-operation and amity and stability in our region.60.	Pakistan will continue its endeavours to promote good-neighbourly relations with Afghanistan on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence  which enjoin respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  non-aggression  equality and mutual benefit  and non-interference in one another's internal affairs. Pakistan has no political differences with Afghanistan  but  if Afghanistan considers there is a difference  we are prepared to open a dialogue on the subject. Regrettably  the development of mutual trust such as we desire has been inhibited by the influx into Pakistan of more than 190 000 Afghan refugees. This massive influx has also imposed a heavy burden on our limited resources  but this is a burden that for humanitarian reasons we cannot shirk. The granting of refuge to this uprooted humanity is not an act of ill will towards Afghanistan. As the Secretary-General has noted in his report on the work of the Organization for this year ""The Arusha Conference [on refugees] reaffirmed the principle that the granting of asylum is a peaceful and humanitarian act which should not be regarded as unfriendly by any State.""61.	The strengthening of the solidarity of the Islamic world is a corner-stone of our foreign policy.62.	The victory of the Iranian revolution  leading to the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran  has added a new dimension to our relations with that country. The cultural and historical affinity and the community of interest existing between both countries are now reinforced by their resolve to reorder their national life in accordance with the eternal precepts of Islam.63.	We are confident that the friendly and fraternal relations between Pakistan and Turkey will be further strengthened.64.	We deeply cherish our abiding relationship and brotherly co-operation with Saudi Arabia in all fields. We greatly value our close ties with the Arab countries.65.	Our relations with Bangladesh continue to develop in a spirit of cordiality and mutual goodwill.66.	Our friendship with the People's Republic of China is based on principles and has withstood the test of time. We greatly value the generous assistance to our economic development extended by China over the years and China's resolute support for Pakistan in its determination to uphold its independence  state sovereignty and territorial integrity.67.	We continue to attach great importance to our bilateral relations with the United States  and express the hope that our present differences will be overcome in a spirit of goodwill  understanding and equity. We acknowledge the extensive assistance provided for many years by the United States to Pakistan.68.	The scope of our friendly relations with the Soviet Union is being expanded continuously on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence and good- neighbourliness. Economic co-operation with the Soviet Union plays an important role in the development of our economy.69.	Both China and the Soviet Union are Pakistan's neighbours. They are two of the greatest and most powerful States in the world. Tension between them exerts an adverse effect on the political climate of Asia and the world. We therefore welcome the dialogue between the two Governments on the normalization of their relations 70.	The situation in the Middle East continues to pose the most serious threat to world peace and stability. A just and lasting solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict has become more imperative and urgent than ever. The Egyptian-Israeli treaty and the Camp David agreements that led to it hold no hope for the Palestinian people of deliverance from captivity  exile and oppression. They do not articulate the principle of self- determination  nor do they recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign State in their homeland.71.	The fulfilment of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people is the central issue in the Middle East conflict. There can be no lasting and just settlement which ignores those rights  or excludes their sole legitimate representative  the PLO  from participation in any peace negotiations on an equal basis. No other party has the right to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinian people.72.	The agreements do not give full expression to the cardinal principle that territory cannot be acquired by the use of force. Peace will be illusory if Israel is permitted to expand its borders beyond the lines of 5 June 1967. The expansion and consolidation of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and the authorization given to Israelis to acquire Arab land compound the injustices inflicted on the Palestinian people.73.	Nor does the Egyptian-Israeli settlement address itself to the question of Jerusalem. The Holy City cannot be regarded as spoils of war. The relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council made this quite explicit. The Holy City of Jerusalem is an integral part of the occupied Arab territories. Israel must be required to withdraw from all those territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem  which must be returned unconditionally to Arab sovereignty. Israeli attempts to Judaize Jerusalem  to obliterate and desecrate its Islamic and Christian character  and to transform it into its capital call for universal condemnation and unrelenting opposition by the international community. The Tenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held at Fez in May  and the non-aligned Conference in Havana have condemned the Camp David agreements and the Egyptian-Israeli treaty.74.	Having secured its southern flank  the Israeli regime has been emboldened to intensify its campaign of aggression and terror against the Palestinian and Lebanese people  including women and children  in furtherance of its designs on the unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon. We cannot but condemn such flagrant violations of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.75.	An agreement on the fundamental basis for a just settlement in the Middle Eastânamely  total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and the fulfilment of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian peopleâalready exists in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. That consensus has now won universal support. It is time that the Security Council acted in accordance with the will of the international community. Should the Council fail to act  Pakistan will support a call for an emergency special session of the General Assembly to consider the Palestine question and the situation in the Middle East.76.	We welcome the Secretary-General's proposal for an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to negotiate a comprehensive and just settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.11. The situation in southern Africa is another serious threat to peace. We have noted the efforts of the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka to promote a peaceful transfer of power to the people of Zimbabwe on the basis of genuine majority rule. Reports about progress in the negotiations currently being held in London have raised hopes of a peaceful settlement. If agreement is reached with the leaders of the Patriotic Front on an independence constitution which provides for genuine majority rule and  no less important  on transitional arrangements for the entry into force of the new constitutions  the settlement will be universally welcomed. Should this last opportunity for a peaceful settlement end in failure  the Patriotic Front will have no other option but to intensify its armed struggle for the overthrow of the puppet regime in Salisbury. The overwhelming majority of the world community must continue to lend its fullest support to the Patriotic Front until the people of Zimbabwe are totally liberated. Equally it must condemn the repeated acts of aggression by the racist minority regime against neighbouring States.78. The expectations of an early and peaceful independence for Namibia have not been realized. The implementation of Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) has been blocked by the racist regime of South Africa. A puppet administration has been imposed on Namibia and repression unleashed against SWAPO  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  leaving it no alternative but to continue the armed struggle for liberation. The international community must continue to extend moral and material assistance to SWAPO. We welcome the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General to implement the plan of action approved by the Security Council for free and fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations to bring about the early independence of Namibia.79.	The racist regime in Pretoria is the foundation of the structure of colonialism and racism in southern Africa. Pakistan has consistently advocated the imposition of comprehensive sanctions against South Africa to compel that country to dismantle its inhuman system of apartheid. It is deplorable that repeated votes in the Security Council should have frustrated the will of the overwhelming majority of the international community. South Africa has been further emboldened to maintain its racist policies by its trade with  and the investment  arms transfers and assistance in the development of nuclear weapons capability it receives from  its friends. But the policy of repression and the creation of bantustans will not deter the patriots of South Africa in their struggle for freedom and equality. Their just cause must and will prevail.80.	The international community must also contribute constructively to a just and peaceful settlement of the dispute in Cyprus. We deeply appreciate the personal role of the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  in promoting the 10-point agreement calling for the resumption of intercommunal talks and setting forth the basis and priorities for them. We note with regret that the talks between the leaders of the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities have not yet led to any concrete results  despite the flexibility demonstrated by the Turkish Cypriot leaders. Pakistan continues to believe that a solution can be achieved only through negotiations between the two Cypriot communities on the basis of equality and within the framework of an independent  sovereign  non-aligned  bicommunal and bizonal federation of Cyprus.81.	Pakistan consistently supported the heroic struggle of the peoples of Indo-China for national liberation  and rejoiced in their victory. It was our hope that the region would be blessed with a period of peace that would enable the countries of Indo-China to turn their energies to national reconstruction. Instead  IndoChina has been tormented by massive violations of human rights  by armed intervention to overthrow an established Government and install another regime  and by a flood of refugees seeking haven from terror and persecution. We should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for convening the Geneva Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia to seek international assistance for the refugees  and for the success which attended this great humanitarian effort.82.	Peace and tranquillity in Indo-China  as elsewhere  cannot be based on the domination and hegemony of one regional State over its neighbours. Pakistan urges the States of Indo-China scrupulously to respect the principles of State sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference in one another's internal affairs. We support the call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces to their national frontiers.83.	The prospect of a man-made large-scale famine confronting the tortured and crucified peoples of Kampuchea fills us with horror and anguish. We strongly support the appeals made for immediate humanitarian assistance to Kampuchea  and hope that the authorities concerned will afford unhindered access and freedom of movement to international relief agencies to save as many Kampuchean lives as possible.84.	International security will remain precarious so long as it is predicated on a balance of terror and the escalation of the arms race. As stated in paragraphs 47 and 48 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly  this was devoted to disarmament:""Nuclear weapons pose the greatest danger to mankind and to the survival of civilization....""In the task of achieving the goals of nuclear dis-armament  all the nuclear-weapon States  in particular those among them which possess the most important nuclear arsenals  bear a special responsibility.""85.	We welcome the second SALT Treaty as a major effort at limitation and control of strategic nuclear- weapon systems  although the Treaty falls short of effecting any reductions in the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. We recognize its importance as a step which should lead to significant reductions of  and qualitative limitations on strategic arms as a result of the third round of SALT. It would be a serious disappointment to the world if the third round of SALT negotiations did not commence without delay. We believe that other agreements on specific and high- priority measures to halt the nuclear arms race can and should be pursued concurrently with the SALT negotiations without waiting for an entire SALT package.86.	It is a matter of profound concern that the past year has witnessed over 250 nuclear tests  almost all conducted by the two major nuclear-weapon Powers  which have the least justification for continuing to improve their nuclear weaponry. A comprehensive test- Dan treaty among the three nuclear-weapon Powers parties to the ongoing negotiations is long overdue. It is regrettable that the Committee on Disarmament could make no progress on this priority item. Furthermore  this question of a cut-off in the production of fissionable materials for weapons purposes by the two superpowers in order to halt the growth of stockpiles of nuclear weapons needs to be accorded high priority in their disarmament negotiations  if their pledge in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to achieve a cessation of the arms race is to be even partly fulfilled.87.	Until nuclear weapons are eliminated  the nuclear-weapon Powers are under the obligation to assure the security of non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. In this connexion  Pakistan has submitted a draft international convention in the Committee on Disarmament. There is no objection in principle in the Committee to the adoption of such a convention. The non-aligned Conference in Havana has called for the conclusion of a convention during the next year. The Pakistan delegation hopes that the General Assembly will endorse this call and urge the major nuclear- weapon Powers to extend  under an international convention  unconditional guarantees against the use or threat of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear-weapon States which are not parties to the nuclear security arrangements of some nuclear-weapon Powers.88.	Urgent measures are required to avert the ever- present danger of nuclear war. Pending the permanent prohibition of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons  an agreement prohibiting the first use of these weapons of mass annihilation merits the urgent consideration of the nuclear-weapon States. An early agreement in the Vienna talks on the mutual reduction of forces and armaments in Central Europe on an acceptable balance of forces and conventional armaments in Central Europe should open the way for the prohibition of the first use of nuclear weapons.89.	Without prejudice to the Vienna talks the convening of a European conference on disarmament  we believe  would also contribute to peace and security in the European region.90.	In other areas as well  a regional approach to disarmament could be more efficacious in assuring the security of regional States  depriving none of a level of forces essential for its security. Pakistan  for its part  stands ready to explore the possibility of mutual reduction of forces in the regional context.91.	Regional security against the nuclear threat can be ensured by the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones. The concept of such a zone has been successfully translated into reality in Latin America. We are convinced that it is applicable also to other regions of the world  especially Africa  the Middle East and South Asia  for which concrete proposals have been adopted by the General Assembly. The efforts to denuclearize those three regions are closely related to the broader initiative to create a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. This strategic area has become an arena for the rivalry and competition of the two major Powers  whose talks on the Indian Ocean are limited in scope and have faltered more than once. We hope that these talks will be resumed before long.92.	Pakistan is concerned over the escalation of tensions and conflicts among States in the Indian Ocean region. In this context  we welcome the conclusions of the recent Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean calling for: the total elimination of great-Power presence and rivalry; measures to ensure conditions of peace and security in the area; and the denuclearization of the Indian Ocean and the littoral States.93.	The growing need for energy in all countries is an acknowledged fact  as is the increasing cost and uncertainty of the supply of fossil fuels. In the foreseeable future  nuclear power presents an inescapable choice for many developed and developing countries if they are to close the energy gap.94.	A study was conducted by the IAEA in 1972 to estimate the power needs of Pakistan and how best those needs could be met by an optimal combination of various sources of energy. The survey concluded that Pakistan would require 27 000 megawatts of installed capacity by the year 2000 if it were to achieve the modest target of 700 kilowatt hours per capita consumption by that time. At present Pakistan's per capita consumption is only 160 kilowatt hours. For the poor countries of Africa  the figure is 300 kilowatt hours; the world average is 1 500 kilowatt hours. For the United States it is 10 000 and for the States of Western Europe it is in the range of 6 000 to 9 000 kilowatt hours. The IAEA study estimated that of the 27 000 megawatts needed by the year 2000  not more than 11 000 could be generated from the water  coal and gas resources of Pakistan; 16 000 megawatts would have to come from nuclear power.95.	Pakistan's oil import bill has risen from $60 million in 1973 to $950 million this year  amounting to 43 per cent of our hard-currency earnings. The industrialized countries of the world spend little more than 10 percent of their foreign exchange on the importation of oil  Nuclear energy  therefore  offers the only economical and practical answer to Pakistan's energy requirements.96.	Neither this consideration nor our assertion that our nuclear programme is devoted entirely to peaceful purposes is a new factor. We have maintained this position from the very commencement of our long quest for the acquisition of nuclear technology  and I avail myself of this opportunity to affirm once again  from this rostrum  that Pakistan's nuclear programme is designed only for peaceful purposes.97.	Pakistan's record in the pursuit of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation is impeccable. As far back as 1968  Pakistan was instrumental in convening the Conference of Non-Nuclear-Weapon States in Geneva to complement the non-proliferation Treaty by measures to strengthen the security of the non-nuclear- weapon States against the contingency of nuclear threat or blackmail.98.	For over a decade  Pakistan has advocated proposals for that purpose and  as I mentioned earlier  has now submitted an international convention on ""negative"" security assurances to non-nuclear States in the Committee on Disarmament. We have always supported the IAEA safeguard system and its application to the nuclear facilities of all non-nuclear-weapon States on a non-discriminatory basis. We have consistently pursued the establishment of a nuclear-weapon- free zone in South Asia. We have advanced the suggestion for a joint declaration by the countries of our region that would commit them to the renunciation of nuclear weapons. We have proposed reciprocal inspection of our respective nuclear facilities. We are prepared to explore with India other ways to ensure non- proliferation in our region.99.	Notwithstanding all these positive and purposeful steps which Pakistan has either taken or initiated  it continues to be the victim of a campaign of propaganda and vilification carried out by a section of the international news media. This is a campaign which  in its inflammatory reference to an ""Islamic bomb"" and preparations for pre-emptive strikes against Pakistan's nuclear research and development facilities  invests the power and organization of the twentieth-century media with the crude and dangerous emotional irrationality of the Middle Ages.100.	Regrettably  Pakistan has to cope with matters which are even more serious and substantive than that international press campaign. These are the pressures exerted upon us to impose on our peaceful but independent nuclear programme restrictions so discriminatory as to compromise our sovereignty. In this context  let me recall what President Zia-ul-Haq declared at the Havana Conference:""Pakistan will not succumb to such pressures and propaganda. Our nuclear programme is peaceful. Pakistan's dependence on nuclear energy  in the absence of adequate fossil fuels  is inescapable. A developing country should not be required to forgo the attainment of a modicum of self-reliance in this vital field.""101.	The last three decades have witnessed a revolutionary upsurge for political independence and national liberation among the peoples of the third world. Yet the bonds of economic dependence and exploitation built through centuries of colonialism remain to be broken and replaced by an equitable set of relations between the developed and the developing countries.102.	The contradictions between the extremes of affluence and poverty  between the imperatives of interdependence and the reality of dependence  have produced a series of economic crises which today threaten the world economy with disorder and disintegration. Despite the consensus reached in the United Nations for the establishment of the New International Economic Order  most of the developed countries have yet to accept the practical implications of equity in international economic relations. Their policies towards the third world have been characterized by the pursuit of protectionism  parsimony in the extension of financial assistance  reluctance to resolve the problems of external debt  unwillingness to effect industrial redeployment  and restraints on the transfer of technology. In almost all international forums  the North-South dialogue is in a state of impasse.103.	The proposal of the non-aligned countries at the Havana Conference for the resumption of global negotiations  within the United Nations  on the key issues of raw materials  development  finance and energy  is a timely initiative for genuine progress towards a new and equitable world economic order. We hope that the developed countries will respond positively to that proposal.104.	It is our expectation that such global negotiations will be initiated by the Assembly at its special session next year and will lead  within a specific period of time  to significant progress  including the conclusion of agreements for a substantially increased and automatic flow of resources to developing countries; the progressive and full liberalization of market access for the exports of developing countries; the adoption of comprehensive adjustment policies by the industrialized countries to eliminate support for their non-competitive industries; monetary reform to ensure international control of world liquidity; the establishment of a link between the creation of special drawing rights and development assistance; and the democratization of international economic decision-making.105.	Pakistan hopes that the development strategy for the next decade will achieve the aims of the New International Economic Order. Such new concepts as a ""basic needs strategy""  differentiation  graduation and ""organized trade"" should not divert the international community from this central goal. The developing countries accept the need for a more self-reliant pattern of development with the aim of expanding domestic markets through improved distribution in order to ameliorate mass poverty and provide for the essential needs of their peoples. But this does not absolve the developed countries of their responsibility to make their full contribution to international development cooperation  nor does it render the need to restructure international economic relations any less urgent and imperative.106.	Even as we debate the problem of poverty  a large number of developing countries are confronted with an economic predicament that can only be described as desperate. Their economies are stagnant; their trade deficits are almost as large as their entire export earnings; they are burdened with massive and mounting external debt; their development programmes are in disarray; they are hard-pressed to provide even basic necessities to their peoples. This situation is the consequence of the persistent deterioration in their terms of trade  which has been further exacerbated by the paucity of financial assistance  the unequal distribution of international liquidity  imported inflation and the revaluation in the price of energy. Indeed  these countries are the primary victims of the current economic crisis.107.	Their plight cannot be redressed by isolated responses; it cannot await consensus on the international development strategy or a break-through in global negotiations. Their situation demands immediate and urgent actionâa response of solidarity from the developed countries as well as from developing countries that are in a position to provide assistance; it demands an international response commensurate with the magnitude and gravity of these immediate problems.108.	Pakistan would propose that this Assembly reach agreement on an immediate action plan designed specifically to redress the economic situation of the developing countries most seriously affected by the world economic crisis. To this end  we call upon the developed countries to double the levels of their official development assistance to the poorer countries in the next two years and provide them general debt relief. We call on the industrialized nations to lift immediately the discriminatory barriers against the exports of those developing countries which face the largest trade deficits. We call upon the IMF to agree to increased allocations of special drawing rights to enable the poorest nations to meet part of their payments. We ask multilateral institutions to provide sufficient resources on favourable terms to enable those countries to purchase vital capital goods and to implement their ongoing development projects. We urge all countries in a position to do so to be more forthcoming in their assistance to these developing countries.109.	A co-operative endeavour to relieve the grave economic problems in the poorer developing countries  to revive economic activity in the third world and to introduce equity in international economic relations is not only desirable but imperative for the prosperity and well-being of all nations. This simple truth with all-its implications will  I am sure  come to be accepted by the developed nations and will provide a new impetus to the North-South dialogue.110.	Our efforts within the United Nations to build a world order based on peace  justice and progress must be pursued with renewed vigour and urgency. The present world situation  where the security of nations is so tenuously maintained and so constantly threatened  where poverty and the deprivation of the majority of mankind stand in stark contrast to the affluence and the conspicuous consumption of the minority  where technology has penetrated the depths of the seas and the immensity of space but has failed to eradicate hunger and sickness  where $1 billion are daily spent on the engines of destruction while a fraction of this sum cannot be found for human welfareâsuch a situation cannot be allowed to continue. We must bridge the chasm between our espousal of the ideal of justice and equality  and the pursuit of power and greed. We must translate our commitment to a new and equitable structure of international relations into concrete acts of solidarity with and support for those peoples striving for a life of human dignity.111.	The people of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan  inspired by the precepts and spirit of Islam  which teaches that all mankind is one  are deeply committed to a human solidarity transcending differences of caste  colour  creed or political opinion. Our solidarity and co-operation on a universal basis  are indispensable conditions for the realization of a world order based on peace  justice and progress for all States and all peoples."
"104",5470,"PAN",34,1979,"ï»¿Three days after the entry into force of the new treaties on the Panama Canal   a milestone in the history of Latin America  the President of Panama  Mr. Aristides Royo  honoured me with the responsibility of addressing a very special message to the Assembly of the international community to express the serene satisfaction of the people of Panama in these moments and to say to the peoples of the world  represented by delegations here  that peace is necessary  that agreement is possible and that success is within the reach of all countries  even of the least powerful  when faith and the struggle of a people meet with response in international solidarity.2.	We Panamanians wish to express our gratitude to all the people and countries that supported us because they believed in the justness of our claims and in the strength of their convictions  placing the ideal of justice uppermost among their values.3.	This is the reason for my presence in the General Assembly of the United Nations which is  by a happy coincidence  presided over by a statesman of your stature  Mr. President  your well-known leadership at the head of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  reflected in your actions since the historic meetings of the Security Council in 1973 in the city of Panama   has earned the lasting appreciation of the Government and people of Panama.4.	We are happy that it is you  Sir  a friend of our region  who is the successor to the eminent Latin American statesman  Mr. Indalecio Lie'vano Aguirre  to whom we pay a well-deserved tribute for the excellent discharge of his responsibility as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.5.	This is a fitting time to offer to the world testimony of the achievements of Panama. That is why I wish to tell you of the significance which the Torrijos-Carter Treaties on the Panama Canal have for us  of how we managed to reach an agreement with the foremost Power in the world on this act of national liberation which the new treaties represent  and of the contribution my country made to the cause of peace in Latin America and in the world because of the recent entry into force of the Panama Canal Treaties.6.	When  three days ago  the unjust Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903 was abrogated  the colonial en-clave known as the Panama Canal Zone disappeared and the Republic reassumed all its jurisdictional rights over it. This represents a milestone in the history of decolonization in the world.7.	The new Panama Canal Treaties also signal in Latin America the end of an era characterized by the imposition of the North American doctrine of territorial proximity  whereby an attempt was made to justify the right to appropriate or control the natural resources and certain geographical features in the States in the region that could affect the domination of the major world maritime routes. That imperialist doctrine  today rejected by the international community  received its death blow with the entry into force of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.8.	From now on  we Panamanians will live in a country where there will be no laws  courts or police that are other than Panamanian  where only a single flag  the flag of Panama  will wave in its tropical skies and where a new sense of dignity will give us strength to undertake the vast task of building the prosperous and free future we deserve.9.	These new Treaties  by granting us more intensive participation in decisions on our own main natural resource  the geographical feature of the isthmus of Panama  also represent a valuable instrument of national development. On the one hand  my country has new  extensive areas close to the inter-oceanic waterway which can be used for commercial  industrial and urban development and  likewise  the Ports of Balboa and Cristobal  the chief installations of their kind in Central America  and the Panama railway.10.	Furthermore  Panama's share in the benefits of that Canal comes in the form of greater income from the transit of ships and  what is also very important  a closer association with the United States of America in the administration of the inter-oceanic waterway up to 31 December 1999  After that date my country will acquire full control over the Panama Canal.11. We Panamanians are aware that the Panama Canal represents a landmark achievement in international communications and we consider that the new Treaties offer all users sufficient guarantees of permanency and efficiency in the inter-oceanic service.12.	For my Government it is a matter of great satisfaction to announce before this Assembly that  with the entry into force of the new Treaties on the Canal  as of 1 October 1979  the Protocol regarding the permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal has been open for accession by all States of the world.13.	On this occasion I must reiterate that one of the prime objectives of the international policy of Panama is the universalization of the regime of permanent neutrality of the inter-oceanic waterway through our territory. Panama wishes the Canal to remain safe and open for peaceful transit by the ships of all nations on terms of complete equality  so that there will be no discrimination against any State or its nationals and so that the Canal and  consequently  the isthmus of Panama  will not become the object of reprisals in any hostilities between other nations of the world.14.	It would be unrealistic for my country to try to make the regime of permanent neutrality of the Panama Canal universal without taking into account the essential co-operation of the great Powers  in the East and in the West  and particularly of those that have mastered nuclear technology.15.	In the opinion of the Panamanian Government  the regime of the Panama Canal  by reason of its universal character  will be subject to rules similar to those which international practice has established for the Suez and Kiel Canals and which will respect the jurisdiction of the Panamanian State over the inter-oceanic waterway  in accordance with the new agreements.16.	We who come from a modern country with a long tradition of transit through the isthmus feel extremely responsible for the services which the Canal offers to promote economic development in the user countries and to facilitate closer relations between the peoples of the world. We were also very conscious of the need to find a peaceful method of solving the delicate international dispute which seriously threatened the movement of traffic through the Isthmus of Panama. The method chosen was that of negotiation  that of the dignified settlement of a long conflict thanks  first to the unswerving faith of our valiant people and  secondly  to the lucid and firm guidance of General Omar Torrijos Herrera  who initiated original and very effective diplomatic actions. We also owe it to the warm solidarity of the peoples of the world who believed in the justness of our cause.17.	The victory of the nation of Panama was made possible by the firm will of our people  aware of the value of freedom  independence  sovereignty and national honour. Our people waited with patience and offered its martyrs. We are a people with profound faith in the anti-colonialist concepts as stated in the United Nations Charter  a noble people capable of creating the necessary conditions for eliminating the colonial enclave at the very heart of our country  which has been a permanent cause of conflict in relations between Panama and the United States and between the latter and Latin America.18.	The careful cultivation of our national values  the strengthening of our own identity in our country  which is cosmopolitan  with an ancient tradition and a young population  were all essential in order to create the necessary unity among Panamanians  that communion between the men and women of Panama which  like the hardest rock  successfully resisted a formidable challenge: that of destroying  by the force of our ideas  the basis of an unjust and unbalanced relationship with the foremost Power of the world and  later  of building with it a modern relationship based on recognition of our sovereign rights  mutual respect and obedience to the idea of justice.19.	All the energies of the Panamanian people were channelled by one leader  a man totally devoted to interpreting and defending the national cause  a soldier whose only weapons were the unflagging nationalism of our people  and a new and brilliant manner of promoting the cause of Panama in the international community. General Omar Torrijos Herrera  the leader of the Panamanians  had a blind faith in human nature  in its capacity for goodness and justice and for the lofty and grave responsibilities of leadership. As a simple man of Panama and as the representative of the aspirations of that dignified and long-suffering people  he addressed himself to other men  to the leaders of America and of the world  and  without ceremony  he offered an exact and true testimony of the situation of our country and of its aspirations.20.	The reaction of the leaders and peoples of the world was unanimous. Omar Torrijos's pilgrimage throughout the world rapidly brought about the results hoped for. The leaders of Europe  Asia and Africa  as well as those of Latin America  supported us unreservedly. To them  the list of whose names fills whole pages in the annals of friendship and of our nation's dignity; we wish to express the deep and never-ending gratitude of Panama.21.	In this present decade  and as a result of the work of the Government led by Omar Torrijos  the Security Council met on Latin American soil for the first time in its history to consider matters likely to endanger peace and security in Latin America. It was our privilege  Mr. President  to have your enlightened participation in your official capacity as Chairman of the Special Committee on decolonization. The demonstration of world support for the meeting of the Security Council in Panama  and the significant statements made there by Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  led to an understanding in the light of which the United States Government made an attempt to revise its Latin American policies and reconsidered the one-sided attitude it had until then maintained with regard to the legitimate claims of Panama.22.	General Torrijos' work had immense results in Latin America  not only for the cause of Panama  but also for that of the continent. The new Panamanian diplomacy  inspired and directed by him  brought about among the leaders of our region a necessary rapprochement  a strengthening of our Latin American consciousness  and offered to our continent a great  worthy and just cause  the cause of Panama  which perfectly symbolized the efforts and sufferings of Latin America and its rejection of an anachronistic and intolerable imperialism.23.	The effects of the Panama Canal Treaties are the result of the will of two countries with great responsibilities to the international community. These agreements will serve to resolve a delicate situation which endangered world communications and the peace of the region.24.	This contribution by my country to the strengthening of international solidarity is complemented by our position on the major political problems which are under review in the General Assembly  that is to say by our policy of non-alignment  which is based on Panama's firm support for the premises of the Declaration on decolonization   the declaration on the permanent sovereignty of peoples  over their natural resources contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. Accordingly  nothing could please Panama more  now that the presidency of the General Assembly is in the hands of an eminent citizen of Africa  than to reiterate unreservedly our support for the aspirations of the peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe and Azania and to reaffirm our solidarity with the front-line States and with the national liberation movements  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the Patriotic Front and the African National Congress of South Africa.25.	Next year's commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on decolonization  of which we were one of the sponsors  commits the United Nations to an intensification of its struggle against colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism  apartheid and all forms of hegemony or foreign domination.26.	We have offered much to other continents  and we are pleased and proud of this. But Panama's contribution to Latin America is exceptional. My country  because of its desire for universal brotherhood and because of the lessons learned through a hard history of struggle for national identity  has always had a special responsibility to promote the ideal of the unity and the integration of Latin America. It is not by chance that Bolivar  in his wisdom  decided that Panama was the most suitable place in which to gather the American nations in the Amphictyonic Congress of Panama in 1826 to lay the foundations for continental unity. Nor is it coincidence that the cause of Panama became the ideal which synthesized the Latin American peoples' aspirations for national liberation.27.	On the threshold of the 1980s  we believe that another meeting  at all levels  of Latin American nations is fully justified. In the economic sphere  this would be fundamental to the attempt to establish a common Latin American front which  together with the efforts made in the Group of 77  would strengthen the position of our region in its participation in next year's special session of the General Assembly. At that meeting we shall evaluate the progress made in the various United Nations bodies towards the establishment of a new international economic order and a new international development strategy for the 1980s will be adopted.28.	Many are the barriers which block the path of Latin American integration and the union to which all its peoples aspire so intensely. Yet we believe that the lesson of history is that all anachronisms will eventually disappear  as recently happened in heroic Nicaragua  that local conflicts will be resolved and that in the end the dream of the Great Liberator will come true and that  from the Rio Bravo to the Tierra del Fuego our countries will constitute a true  modern and effective community of nations.29.	Our most decisive contribution is the example we have given to the world of the ability to solve  by peaceful means but with dignity  the most difficult problems in the hardest circumstances and conditions. In a world tormented by violence in all its forms  this is a precious example which should be appreciated and cultivated earnestly by all countries of the world.30.	With the entry into force of the new Panama Canal Treaties  Panama and the United States will be able to enjoy a harmonious relationship after 76 years of misunderstandings and profound injustices. This new relationship must develop  grow in strength  and become  for the good of all the countries which use the inter- oceanic waterway  a notable example of friendship  international co-operation and mutual respect 31.	I believe that I am conscience bound to recognize publicly that successive generations of Panamanians have been able to rely in their struggle on the election of Mr. Jimmy Carter to the presidency of the United States  a fact which made possible the signing  approval and ratification of the new Panama Canal Treaties and their recent implementation. It is only just to recognize his exceptional gifts as a statesman  his lofty conception of justice and his profound sense of history. He fought strenuously and with great courage against certain reactionary circles in his country to achieve a peaceful solution to the question of the Panama Canal. In this way President Carter has won a place of honour among history's great leaders of North America in his relations with Latin America.32.	We are determined to fulfil all the commitments entered into in the Panama Canal Treaties. We are not easily deceived nor are we irresponsible towards our people or the world. We shall be vigilant to ensure that the United States of America also faithfully complies with the serious and solemn commitments into which it has entered with no distortion of the deep meaning of decolonization  justice and dignity.33.	We have become stronger morally in our struggle and we face the future with confidence  always bearing in mind the famous saying that ""he who cannot daily win freedom and life does not deserve them. Thus  we point out to all countries of the world that it is our will to protect and strengthen today's conquests to ensure for future generations of Panamanians and for all peoples on earth that the Panama Canal will be an instrument for union and a symbol of hope in the never-ending quest for peace and justice."
"105",5516,"PER",34,1979,"ï»¿My delegation is pleased to convey to the representative of the United Republic of Tanzania its congratulations on his election to the presidency of this General Assembly and to congratulate his country  recalling that Peru attended its first non- aligned conference in Darussalam. In connexion with this election we also recall President Nyerere  a distinguished statesman and a living symbol of the highest African and universal virtues.121.  We also wish to express our thanks to Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the noted jurist from the sister Republic of Colombia  for the way in which he conducted the business of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.122.	We also welcome a new Latin American State  Saint Lucia  to this Organization. Its admission brings us one step nearer our ideal of universality.123.	The presence in this Assembly of the official delegation of the people of Nicaragua  represented by the Government of the Junta of National Reconstruction  fills Latin Americans with pride. Forty years of a regime shameful to Nicaragua and the conscience of Latin America have been left behind. Thanks to the struggle of the Sandinista Front and the whole people of Nicaragua  the way to freedom has been opened and today the hard task of building a future of dignity is beginning. It is up to the international community to provide effective and decided support. The Nicaraguan people have paid a high price for their freedom: human lives were lost  the economy was shattered  and the countryside was razed. Today a new era is beginning  an era of solidarity among all our countries  which have awaited and hailed the triumph of the Nicaraguan people  and this must urgently be translated into the financial and technical assistance needed by Nicaragua  without restrictions or provisos.124.	The fall of the Somoza dictatorship means not only victory for the Nicaraguan people but it also means that Latin America has come face to face with its destiny of freedom. While it is true that the revolution in Nicaragua was an heroic undertaking on the part of its people  it is also true that the firmness of purpose shown by several countries in the region also contributed to some extent to that victory. Some saw to it that the inter-American system took the right decision at the right time.125.	The countries of the Andean Group can say with legitimate pride that they helped to save an ethical tradition of the region. The initiative which they took  at a particularly difficult time  was tantamount to a commitment to justice.126.	As a non-aligned country  Peru was pleased to take part in the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  recently held in Havana. There  together with many other small and medium-sized countries from all regions  we reaffirmed our basic commitment to the policy of non-alignment  with its fundamental principles and common aims.127.	Our participation in such a conference and in the non-aligned movement as a whole is seen by us as the clear political option of a country which has fought and will fight to strengthen its independence and consolidate its sovereignty and to ensure respect for other principles which our non-aligned movement recognizes as being of universal validity  many of which are also contained in this Organization's Charter. It is the option of a country which supports the completion of the process of decolonization and which is opposed to the division of the world into spheres of influence and military blocs and which is opposed to any policy of colonialism  imperialism  neo-colonialism  racism  expansionism or hegemonism 128.	Consequently  my country feels that at Havana the substance of our common cause was reaffirmed  when it was reiterated that regardless of political  economic or social systems  which constitute the non- aligned movement's essential plurality  the countries in the movement recognize that non-alignment is an independent  world-wide and creative factor in international relations and one which has as its aim and essential focus to make international relations more democratic  to set its members apart from military blocs and to get rid of these blocs in order to bring peace and security to all States.129 Non-alignment has made a substantial contribution to the establishment at the international level of a new law of the sea. We are therefore convinced  and would like to believe that all other parties in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea are also  of the importance of what is at stake. We have to be aware that never before has such a large joint effort been made by so many complex interests  that must nevertheless be essentially common ones. Just as there is one sea  so must there be one body to govern and regulate its peaceful use  the exploitation of its resources and its conservation. We are therefore worried about the fact that at this stage of the debate some Powers are still suggesting unilateral action which we would regard as threatening. However  we will not even entertain the idea of failure but will invoke the highest political vision of all States so that one single coherent system may regulate the essential undertakings. My country  which has been in the vanguard of this struggle  has the authority to call for respect for the sovereignty of the coastal States and a just agreement for the administration of what we have called the common heritage of mankind.we are once again facing the challenge to the Organization that resides in the persistence of situations in various parts of the world which to a greater or lesser extent jeopardize international peace and security and have been critical for far too long. There are also various manifestations of policies of power which seem to be possible because of the ineffectiveness of the security systems and obvious short-comings in the capacity of the United Nations to preserve the universal application of its principles.131.	Racist minority regimes in southern Africa persist in their defiance of the imperatives of nature and history. The international community  openly or covertly challenged  must not ease up its pressure or slacken its application of sanctions which  after so many violations  seem to be the only means of forcing changes  which we should like to be peaceful.132.	The international community has clearly established guidelines for the changes required to resolve the critical situation in the Middle East. We are aware that the process of the interrelationship of States in that very important area has invariably and tragically led to confrontation and war. The effective exercise of the rights of the Palestinian people  which we firmly support  and respect for the sovereignty of all the States of the region are central elements of one form of peaceful coexistence and co-operation which we recognize as pressing.133.	In Cyprus  in South-East Asia  in regions of Africa and in other parts of the world conflict and war are presenting us with the daily disasters of invasion  occupation  the displacement of people as refugees  suffering and death. What peace are we talking about when these circumstances prevail?134.	When the principles and provisions of our Charter are being violated or distorted and the will  if any  to deal with situations calling urgently for action seems not to exist  we must agree that there is real danger in our times.135.	It is almost routine to deplore the growth of military expenditures and the continued acceleration of the arms race  which  while to some extent it may give a transitory sense of security  has created a situation which is not satisfactory to anyone but rather increases the risk for all. For our part  at this stage  again we have to say that we do not all have the same responsibilities  for not all of us subject mankind as a whole to the same threats. We should like to think that some effective steps are being taken or at least that negotiations are under way to check or at least slow down the arms race  which so often originates in and is promoted from central countries expanding outward and thus involving every part of the world in a dynamic process which our countries have not created but the effects of which we cannot fail to perceive.136.	Latin America  while not being an area of the developing world that devotes most resources to military acquisitions  has made some responsible efforts to find common criteria to control and limit military expenditures. The Declaration of Ayacucho  tripartite meetings and meetings of Andean countries  among others  have been accepted in Peru as a far-sighted driving force. Unfortunately  progress has been limited. Despite this we believe that Latin America can also in this complex problem take the lead  advocating regional agreement which  in view of the urgency and realism of the case  should lay the basis for a joint policy.137.	In inverse proportion to the growth of arms  the international effort for development shows signs of slowing down and indeed stagnating. After very many conferences and meetings dealing with political and technical aspects  with small or universal participation  ranging from the sectorial to the world-wide  we have time and again seen the distressing frustration of the developing countries as a constant factor. It is all the more distressing when it is clear that very seldom before has mankind as a whole longed as deeply as now for peace  stability  social justice and development. We believe that this should be a cause for thorough consideration which would make it possible to throw light on new paths and possibilities and generate a new dynamic to resolve these conflicts and contradictions  and in this last part of the second millennium of our era give all the peoples of the earth the hope that the harsh lessons of history have not been in vain.138.	In a few days we shall have the opportunity of listening to His Holiness John Paul II. While we shall hear in it the noble and authoritative words of the representative of the Catholic world  we also must remember that with him comes the memory of one whose name he took  who gave the name of peace to the development of peoples and who showed in its dramatic starkness the paradoxical contradiction between poverty and justice.139.	The problem of development comes up periodically and in varying degrees of intensity for consideration by States Members of the United Nations. Nevertheless  the Organization has shown itself to be incapable of dealing with the problem and finding a solution in terms that would provide a reasonable expectation of success.140.	Over a period of many years we have been building a broad complex of ideas  items and proposals  believing that through those we could find a solution. The facts have shown that we were wrong. It seems clearer every day that the problem lies not only in the will of States to do this but in the approach taken to development and the way it is to be discussed in international bodies.141.	The continuing failure of the economic negotiations carried out since the General Assembly in 1974 adopted the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order shows the lack of political will of the developed nations to adopt measures in the right direction  and also it seems that we as developing countries have been following a mistaken strategy in trying to bring about a fundamental change in the existing structure of international economic relations.142.	We therefore have to give consideration to the question of devising new ways  on the one hand  of strengthening co-operation among developing countries  with a view to changing the present trend  which reinforces the dependence of the periphery on the centre  and  on the other hand  of strengthening the negotiating power of our countries vis-a-vis the developed nations. This is not the time to engage in repeated  futile complaints against the prevailing if unjust international order; rather it is the time to take decisions to change the terms of these relationships. We must offset the traditional attitude of obtaining minor concessions from the industrialized nations by our firm proposals to try to break new ground  to escape the trap of our present relationships with the industrialized countries and the characteristics of the negotiating process in which we have become involved.143.	What is called for is a qualitative change in our policies in order to effect a radical modification of the ties of dependency that have kept our economic development and social life subordinate to the interests and policies of the industrialized nations. This change must of necessity entail a stage during which we must reject the development models of the ""transnationalized States""  whose styles of life and of consumption are based on a certain level of income and on distribution mechanisms that are the product of an historic process we cannot emulate.144.	Therefore  that development strategy not only must be designed to create a new international economic order  but must be oriented  in turn  towards a search for new models appropriate to our own societies. These new models must enable us to deal with the fundamental aspirations of the population as a whole  ensuring democratic participation by all sectors of society in setting common objectives and selecting the appropriate means of achieving them. We must seek change on the basis  not of the models the large  industrialized countries offer us in an attempt to extend their systems to our nations  but of models designed to form new ties that will enable us to preserve our own true identity and to provide for our own protection as distinct and free societies in the future.145.	It is a question of discovering whether the multiplicity of statements and regulations agreed to over the last few years contain any option suited to our own development  or whether we must repetitively imitate experiments that emerge from a history that differs from our own because the role we have had to play in the world's economic system was different.146.	This does not mean that we need seek Utopian autarkies in our development models or a total break with the industrialized world. Today  in any case  there is an obvious interrelationship that has altered the traditional form of dependency. Instead  we must undertake our own development on the basis of an internal effort to define objectives and basically national priorities  and avoid attempts to force us into roles that would simply accentuate the inequalities and contradictions within our societies.147.	This is important  for if present trends are not corrected  we will continue to mortgage our economic and social development projects through international finance and trade mechanisms that are controlled by the industrialized nations. The inevitable result will be that by the year 2000  the trade deficit of the developing countries will amount to more than $200 billion to the industrialized countries  whereas our own trade will have increased by 1 per cent. In other words  we shall continue to increase our debt to the industrialized Powers in order to cover the deficit we already have with them.148. In light of this prospect  we may well be fostering development by means of machinery that will not ensure a proper distribution of real income; with an inflated gross national product that will conceal immense social inequities; with a process of industrialization either deficient or based on industries exported by the developed nations because they are not competitive enough or because they are a serious threat to the environment; with outdated technical processes or pro-cesses artificially incorporated into our system of production; with a system of popular education that is filled with short-comings and is highly wasteful; and  lastly  with an agricultural production based on exports that in turn perpetuate chronic food shortages. In short  it will be a development that is more apparent than real  and one that is in conflict with the needs of the peoples and with the social dimension of human rights.149. For these reasons and many others which I do not feel I should dwell on now  we must question the very bases on which current international development planning is founded. It is our firm belief that  instead of meeting in august and debilitating bodies to consider the problems of development and co-operation with the same worn-out view that has prevailed in recent years  we should rather come together in a serious frame of mind  issuing at the outset a firm ""No "" to debate the current concept of development and its international treatment. We should attempt to ensure that through this joint exercise we shall arrive at an integral redefinition of the problem and hence a possible way of contributing to the true establishment of an economic and political order aimed at creating a balance and symmetry in international relations  based on a new perspective seeking to reconcile legitimate interests and the demands of justice. This attempt to conceptualize and articulate a new mode of conduct for the developing countries must go hand in hand with an internal effort made by those countries to regroup their forces; it must emphasize to the full the opportunities that exist for co-operation among them  thereby increasing their negotiating capacity. We must clearly set forth the true dimension of the development problem and the possibilities of its being successfully dealt with on the international level by employing a new viewpoint that will be essentially political in nature and will re-evaluate the contribution of the developing world to world peace and security at its proper weight and significance.150. For that enormous task  as we approach a new decade  we feel thatâonce shorn of the myths woven round it by the European imaginationâLatin America has something valuable to offer in the present international debate. The experience of Latin America  enriched by years of political vicissitudes and various attempts at integration  is a meaningful one  and should facilitate its participation in dealing with the problems of our time. It is not mere chance that our region offers such a panorama of cultural diversity  of permanent struggle to affirm its own identity  of a development marked by the imbalances deriving from the international division of labour imposed upon the world by the great Powers. Our extremely rich variety of situations and experiences contains the elements that the region must employ in setting up a new and dynamic relationship with other areas of the world.151.	Peru is convinced that  once shorn of some of its illusions  Latin America is finding itself through a precise definition of its own interests and its own institutional machinery. The clear perception of the distinct reality that is our continent will guarantee a more creative participation with the rest of the third world in efforts to bring about a new international order embodying a structure of justice.152.	Hence  in the light of the experience of recent years and in view of the perspectives open to the Latin American region  and particularly the stimulating presence of the Andean Group  we feel that it is necessary to have the militant participation of Latin American social democracy joined in common cause with the various areas of the third world in the international life of our time. Although third-world countries act on the assumption that democracy is the political organizing pro-cess that best suits their interests  it is clear that they should not adopt exclusively formalist and liberal concepts of this. These have recently turned into unstable appendages of the large Western Powers. Without losing its essential qualities  the democratic concept must be effectively adapted to the particular characteristics of the developing countries  and it must at the same time be given the revolutionary impetus needed to enable it to carry out militant and creative activity at the international level. Therefore Latin America must without doubt make the demands of the third world its own. At times  this attitude has led to inevitable confrontations with other States which  while equally democratic  have a level of development that places them in the industrialized world and consequently puts them in a position to defend interests which are not those of the developing world. The representative  democracies of the third world must therefore accept the challenge of opposing to those interests their own  and of giving the internal social substance of their own democratic fife the international projection that will  of necessity  involve them in differences with the industrialized democratic Powers to which they are linked by a thin umbilical cord of political concepts  common in origin but divergent in their present objectives.153.	We feel that the Latin American democraciesâ those already in existence and solidly established  those emerging and being established  and those that we expect to be set up in the near futureâall have to embark on a new course of shared international responsibility that is at once a challenge and a stimulus that can give Latin America and other democracies in the developing world a new and vigorous role in building the international society of the future.154.	With the foregoing  we are trying to provide the framework for the possible organic establishment in the developing world of an alternative that will at one and the same time be in competition with others of a different ideological stamp and open to a convergence of views and co-operation. We are talking about social representative democracies of the third world  revolutionary democracies under the banner of change and participation aiming at radical transformation of sclerotic structures at the national level and at radical change in the unjust international order  which is not moral and which has  tragically  been shown to cause pain and war and not to bring progress and peace.155.	In the last 10 years Peru has tried to bring all its efforts and concern to bear on this problem. In order to do so we have established a foreign policy that we feel is in keeping with our capabilities and furthers our claims. This policy is based on the clear idea that a country that is not a great Power but rather a small one can and rightly must boldly grapple with the problems of its time. We believe that we can only make history by taking part in it. The major legitimate and traditional foreign problems of a State must in no way distance or isolate a country at the international level from the vast and complex scheme of things which in the final analysis  for better or worse  it shares with the rest of the world.156.	In keeping with this feeling  in due time my country took the heady risk of taking part as far as possible in endeavours to build a better world  although that might involve inevitable confrontations in some instances and blind incomprehension in others. But we persevered  and we believe that Peru's foreign policy as made positive and useful contributions both to the political strengthening of the third-world nations and to the reworking of ideological frameworks available to the under-developed countries.157.	It is in this spirit that we have made this statement. We all have an obligation and a commitment in this world Organization. In this instance  we have sought to contribute to the debate by touching on some of the problems considered in this body.158.	We are drawing close to the decade of the 1980s. We must not be shackled by previous decades and strategies. We must shake off labels and approaches which claim to save by their very wording. We all know that the problem is greater and more difficult than that  and that we shall not resolve it by decking it out in clothing borrowed from the international paraphernalia of the past. Let us modestly but without concessions seek a new language to express old aspirations that were not satisfied. For this arduous creative labour  Peru offers its unreserved will to work on the basis of a long tradition of effort shared in solidarity  which has enabled the former inhabitants of its territory to eliminate hunger and plunder and to create a just community structure."
"106",5563,"PHL",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is with a deep sense of satisfaction that I add my voice to the swelling chorus of congratulations to you on your election as President. With your election the world affirms the validity of the United Nations as the parliament of man  where every nation  weak or strong  rich or poor  stands equal before all the rest. With your election the world honours Africa  which has long been and still is  a symbol of the continuing struggle against racism. You have long stood on the ramparts of that struggle. The Philippines  I am proud to say  has stood and will continue to stand side by side with you in fighting for this noble cause. We wish you every success.64.	More than 2 000 years ago  the greatest of Greek historians  Thucydides  provided mankind with some of the deepest insights ever given into the nature of the human condition and of relations among men. In this effort he has not been surpassed; the lessons of the Peloponnesian wars are as relevant to our times as they were to his troubled era. The causes of human conflict  he said  are rooted in the motives of fallible man. But the management of conflict depends on the faint spark of wisdom which  as a gift of the gods  inheres in the very frailty of mankind.65.	It is not inappropriate to recall this thought at this time  for while the correspondence between the world of ancient Greece and ours is not exact  Thucydides provides us with an ancient guideline to the management of modern conflicts in our complex era.66.	Last year in this Assembly  there was general agreement on the complex nature of the present world. Three things stood out. The first was a scrupulous avoidance of direct confrontation among the great Powers. The second was the diminution of ideology and a renewal of emphasis on national interests. The third was a shift from military competition to economic competition.67.	All these were  as we saw them  hopeful signs of a better and more peaceful world to come. Some began to think it possible for mankind someday to be free from the ever present threat of war. We chose to read in these signs the beginning of an age when all mankind would be guaranteed its basic needs.68.	But gifts are not always all good. The bitter comes with the sweet; thorns hide among the most fragrant flowers. The encouraging trends which we noted last year are still there  but along with them are the unwelcome. If we were to portray the world today  the following would stand out: first  the revival of wars by proxy as an alternative to direct confrontation; secondly  and as a corollary to the first  the exploitation of the instabilities in many third-world countries; thirdly  the pursuit of national interests at the expense of weaker States; fourthly  the growing alarm at the possible fragmentation of the world into political and economic spheres of influence.69.	As our discussions in this Assembly proceed  we cannot ignore these trends which  unless arrested  will certainly pose new threats to world peace and stability. The great Powers in particular bear a heavy share of the responsibility for their solution. We invite the superpowers to assist in this search.70.	In connexion with the items in this year's agenda  we note with necessary caution the progress achieved in the corollary disarmament studies that are at present under way as a result of the mandate of the tenth special session  held on disarmament. On the question of disarmament itself  we view with continuing regret the profound inability of the human community to come to grips with what is at the heart of the problem. Even on the question of arms control  there has been no progress and  indeed  very little constructive discussion. While recognizing the difficulties of a practical and technical character in arms control agreements  we should always keep in view the unassailable fact that the larger interests of mankind  particularly its survival  outweigh all other considerations. The life of a single human being has a value far above the mightiest arsenal in the world. But we think so little of humanity that we persist in the mindless pursuit of our destruction.71.	We welcome the signing of the agreement reached at the conclusion of the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in full expectation that it will lead to a reduction of current world tensions. We hope further that this measure will be followed by a succession of other agreements  including a complete ban on the testing of nuclear weapons.72.	In the Middle East  much has been accomplished to pave the way to a solution of this generations-old problem. Yet the fabric of peace in that troubled land continues to be fragile. We maintain the view that  unless the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people is upheld  the chances for durable and comprehensive answers to one of the most puzzling riddles of our time will be diminished.73.	A great statesman once said that compromise does not necessarily mean a concession. If a memorable dictum was ever out of place  that surely is the case in relation to the Middle East. In our view  the needed compromise has been set by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council  and they remain the guidelines for solving once and for all a problem which  unless solved  will continue to bear grave implications for the peace of the entire world.74.	Africa south of the Sahara is still to be a storm- centre of unrest. It will continue to be so until the universally accepted principle of rule by the consent of the majority is accepted in precept and in practice and until the evil of rampant racism is removed from its midst. The problem of South Africa appears obdurately resistant to solution  and a parallel situation is found in Namibia. South Africa remains beyond the pale  a moral outcast from the community of nations and from peoples everywhere  who hold fast to the norms of human decency and respect for the dignity of the human person.75.	We are at a crucial juncture in our march to economic and social progress. Since the founding of the United Nations  never has there been such disparity in the living standards of peoples and in the wealth of nations. The data of 1978 tell us that nearly 2.5 billion people â the population of 74 countries  or 60 per cent of the world's population â are classified as poor. Only 32 countries with a total population of only 645 million-âor 16 per cent of the world's total â are considered rich and have per capita incomes ranging from $US 5 000 to $US 15 000. For the peoples of the poorest 20 countries with about 6 percent of the world's population  or 260 million people it is a question of bare survival  as they are subsisting on per capita incomes averaging 5 per cent or less of those of the rich countries. Yet there is so much wealth in the world  wealth so heavily concentrated in a minority of rich countries  that grinding poverty and hunger need not stalk so many lands. Indeed  this is the ironyâand tragedyâof our times 76.	During the year  the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization continued its work towards fulfilment of its mandate to list proposals for the improvement of the United Nations  identifying those which awaken special interest for later action by the General Assembly or other appropriate bodies. The potential usefulness of that Committee is high  and its value can be very great  depending upon the interest of the Members and their seriousness in implementing steps to improve our world Organization.77.	I now wish to invite your attention to our own corner of the world. For the last several years  the greatest single concern of my country and our partners in the Association of South-East Asian Nations has been to encourage a balance among the Powers in the region  as well as among external Powers with interests in the area. There are two fundamental reasons behind this effort. First  we wished to avoid a situation in which rivalry among the Powers with ambitions for undue predominance in the region would involve our countries in such an ambition or embroil us in other people's wars. And  secondly  we wished to improve the climate within which our countriesâ generously described as the area with the greatest potential for developmentâcould attain our ambitions of economic development and political and social cohesiveness.78.	I can say with pardonable pride for my own country and without undue presumption also for our ASEAN partnersâIndonesia  Malaysia  Singapore and Thailandâthat we have advanced far towards our goals. Equally important  our individual progress has benefited from the collective effort; the past year particularly has seen the growth of a tangible unity among us and an increasingly common stand in our relations with the rest of the world.79.	The context of our common efforts in the region has  unfortunately  taken a turn for the worse. We never did entertain any illusions that the onset of a balance of power in Asia  as well as in South-East Asia  would be tranquil or swift. It was bound to take time  because readjustments in relationships in the wake of the second Indo-Chinese war were likely to be a long and complex process. Indeed  the realignments have been more painful and more fateful than anyone expected.80.	The stark underlying fact of life in South-East Asia today  with dire implications for us and most assuredly the rest of the world  is the build-up of the rivalry among the great Powers  but particularly the Sino-Soviet rivalry. It has of late reintroduced tensions fully as dangerous in their consequences as any that have ever existed in the region. We simply seek to state a fact and trace its consequences  not to impute any motives. The Philippines is and will remain a friend to all parties involved. Neither do we say that the events that we speak of are wholly to be ascribed to this rivalry. The tracing of cause and effect is never a complete process in human affairs  but that such a rivalry did play an important part in or behind these events seems to be an inescapable conclusion.81.	Two equally disturbing developments began this year. The first was the armed intervention in Kampuchea. Profoundly disturbed by this break-down of peace in South-East Asia  ASEAN immediately issued a joint statement in Bangkok expressing its serious concern at the armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country and affirming the right of the people of Kampuchea to determine for themselves the form of government which they desired. This statement became the substance of a draft resolution introduced in the Security Council by friends in the non-aligned group of nations  though defeated by veto  the draft resolution was supported by all but two members of the Council. The statement was reaffirmed by the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN at their subsequent meeting in Bali.82.	The second development is the unceasing flow of refugees from the Indo-Chinese countries. By land and sea  men  women and children fled Indo-China in countless droves: many to their death  most to a life of uncertainty and deprivation  to a temporary though safe haven in makeshift camps in countries barely able to support them.83.	No event in recent memory has so stirredâas it still doesâthe conscience of the world as the plight of these refugees. Among them are the boat people. Believing in a better life elsewhere they risk life itself by setting out in unseaworthy boats for destinations they know hardly anything about. The estimates of the numbers of those who did not make it run into the hundreds of thousands and this must horrify all of us. Just as in the case of mass involuntary movements elsewhere in the world  how long can mankind live with such instances of man's inhumanity to man?84.	But the suffering of the refugees is only half of the story. There is the other side of the pictureâthe misery and the serious social  economic and political repercussions on the countries of first asylum  the majority of which belong to ASEAN.85.	This was why all the ASEAN countries responded speedily and gratefully to the Secretary-General's call for an international conference in Geneva earlier this year.  At that Meeting President Marcos of the Philippines offered to house 50 000 of those refugees who had already been accepted for resettlement. In addition to a similar offer also made by him and subject to similar conditionsânamely  that they will be funded by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other interested parties  and that we shall not be saddled with residualsâthe Philippines will be in a position to provide temporary shelter to a total of 60 000 Indo- Chinese refugees.86.	In the East we say that what affects my brother affects me equally  that indeed we are our brothers keeper. Although we cannot be more than a country of first asylum  although we cannot risk our development at the present stage by assuming the burden of refugees  President Marcos made these two offers in the ASEAN spirit of assisting another at a time of great need. We made the offers because we feel strongly that the spirit of humanitarianism should prevail  and because we wished specially to recognize the fact that the right of survival is the most basic of human rights.87.	We await the Secretary-General's report on the refugee question this session with particular anxiety because a second generation of problems may soon be upon us. The rampant country-wide famine in Kampuchea; the possibility of the revival of conflict in that country with the end of the monsoon season; the threat of another massive tide of refugees as a result of both war and famineâthese are problems which we cannot dismiss lightly and whose consequences  unless we act in time  can be far more terrible than we dare to imagine.88.	I cannot close this statement without paying a tribute to the unceasing and unfaltering efforts of the Secretary-General to uphold the validity of the United Nations ideal in the face of growing odds  to increase its potency and improve its efficiency in solving the world's problems  and in bringing these efforts to bear on the flashpoints that threaten everywhere the flowering of what he calls ""a global civilization and order unprecedentedly wide in its scope and diversity"".89.	In the name of my country we salute the Secretary-General for his report on the work of the Organization  a report which clearly demonstrates the breadth and scope of his insights into what ails the human community today andâdespite the commanding heights from which he views the human conditionâ for his grasp of the problems on the ground  among them the multifarious concerns of running an Organization that now includes 152 nations  a host of special instruments and even armies in the field. I must commend the Secretary-General for his report  a report which must be read by all members of this Assembly if they are to be loyal to their trust  a masterful document which I feel deserves to be read by all the peoples of the world  so that every man  woman and child whose lives are affected by public events can share the spirit that animates our United Nations.90.	All of us are indebted to the Secretary-General for presenting an excellent summary of what should concern all of us. He has outlined specific problems of instability  poverty and economic weakness in various regions and we are gratified by the prominent place he gives to the New International Economic Order  UNCTAD  the North-South dialogue  the Indo-China situation  the refugees  the law of the sea and the energy problem and their impact on and relevance to the developing countries of the world. We applaud his unflagging concern for human rights. Above all we are impressed with his determination to make the United Nations a better and more effective instrument to achieve the collective goals of mankind and to arouse worldwide the proper attitudes and responses to it that are so essential to its continued usefulness to all of us  for we believe that the United Nations stands alone as an institution available to mankind to reconcile national and global interests  and without such an institution  we are all in peril.91.	Because we are facing perilous times  the Secretary-General holds an office unique in the annals of mankind  for never has one office had the influence and the responsibility to mould human affairs on such a global scale and to convert the potential contained in the coming together of mankind into a force that solves rather than palliates human problems. The world wishes him well."
"107",5623,"PNG",34,1979,"ï»¿I should like to join previous speakers in congratulating the President  on his unanimous election to the high office he now occupies. The accomplishments of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples under his chairmanship to date  as well as his wide-ranging experience in the activities of this body  confirm without any doubt my delegation's confidence that under his leadership  guidance and direction  this thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly will be a success.348.	I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Salim's predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  for the most efficient manner in which he presided over our proceedings during the last session. My delegation extend its compliments on a duty well performed.349.	My delegation wishes to convey my country's condolences to the people of Angola on the untimely death of their leader  the late Agostinho Neto.350.	My delegation is particularly pleased to welcome Saint Lucia to membership in this world body of nations  and we look forward to developing a close and co-operative relationship with it. Papua New Guinea and Saint Lucia are both members of the common-wealth of nations  as well as being developing island States. My country shares with Saint Lucia the feelings of being free from colonial domination  and we take this opportunity to wish it a prosperous future.351.	As on previous occasions  the delegation of Papua New Guinea will participate with interest and hope in the deliberations of the General Assembly on major international issues. We shall attempt to do what we can within our capacities to work towards constructive solutions to these issues. For the first time  we plan to bring to the attention of the assembled delegations the issue of decolonization  which is of particular concern to the people in our region  the South Pacific.352.	As is customary in the general debate  my Government would like to take this opportunity to draw the Assembly's attention to a number of issues concerning Papua New Guinea as a member of the international community. Some of these issues directly affect countries a long way from my own  while others affect countries closer at hand. But those to which I shall refer all have such a bearing on the prospects for peace  stability and development in the world that they cannot be ignored.353.	My Government is concerned about the Middle East situation. While we are heartened by signs of progress towards peace  we are also perturbed by the possibility that the momentum might be lost  at enormous cost not only to the people of the immediate region  but  ultimately  to us all.354.	My Government welcomed the initiatives taken by the Egyptian and Israeli leaders  and it commends the role played by the President of the United States in trying to promote an atmosphere conducive to negotiations leading to the signing of a Treaty of Peace between Israel and Egypt. But my Government also remains troubled by the continuing failure to find a solution to the Palestinian problem.355.	My Government recognizes that Papua New Guinea cannot hope to exert much influence on the situation in the Middle East. But we would be derelict in our duty if we did not add our voice to those that are calling for greater efforts to be made in order to achieve lasting peace. Middle Eastern and other world leaders have perhaps the greatest opportunity in a generation to lay the groundwork for lasting peace. My Government urges them  in the interest of us all  to make full use of that opportunity.356.	My delegation is encouraged to note that the prospects for a negotiated settlement in Namibia have become more promising. However  we still wish to emphasize our firm belief that a successful outcome will depend on the holding of elections under United Nations supervision.357.	Papua New Guinea takes particular pleasure in complimenting the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and the United Nations Council for Namibia on the role they have played in seeking a solution to the Namibian problem. Pleased as we are with the progress made  however  we cannot be content until we see the emergence of an independent Namibia. We hope that independence will soon be achieved through the democratic process of free elections. We also hope that such a process will guarantee citizens' rights of freedom and equality in the new nation.358.	My Government remains concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe. We believe that the present constitutional arrangements hold out little prospect for a lasting solution. My Government believes that they must be changed. We think it deplorable that the long- awaited constitution based on ""majority rule"" turned out  when published  to be but a further device designed to entrench the white minority's interest.359.	My Government notes with appreciation that all parties are involved in renewed negotiations for a durable internal settlement guaranteeing genuine majority rule in Zimbabwe through a free democratic electoral process. Papua New Guinea welcomes the initiatives arising out of the recent Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries and the considerable advance which is being made in the current constitutional talks in London which  we hope  will lead to genuine majority rule in Zimbabwe.360.	With regard to southern Africa  my Government wishes to express its concern and abhorrence at institutionalized racial discrimination and segregation for the purposes of the suppression and exploitation of the black people in southern Africa. It is a subject on which the people of my country have very strong feelings.361.	My Government has  in previous sessions  stated in the strongest terms  that apartheid is a disgusting  degrading and inhuman practice. We regret to note that  despite many calls  the racist regime in southern Africa remains reluctant to abolish its apartheid policies. I should like to reiterate the fears my delegation expressed last year on the question of apartheid. Persistent failure to deal effectively with such a continuing offence to mankind is likely to have a most terrible outcome for both the white and black populations of South Africa.362.	I turn now to events in Indo-China and the question of the Indo-Chinese refugees. As a country which lies at the cross-roads between South-East Asia and the South Pacific  we are concerned about the security implications that have arisen as a result of the overthrow of the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea and the confrontation between Viet Nam and Kampuchea. We would like to see peace and stability prevail in the region  and urge those who  in one way or another  are involved in the confrontation to settle their differences by discussion in conference rooms and not by using guns on battlefields.363.	My Government believes that the mass exodus of refugees could be arrested if the Governments concerned would stop deliberately creating unfavourable circumstances that compel citizens to leave their homelands and seek refuge elsewhere. Viet Nam and Kampuchea should co-operate closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure that those who leave their countries are not inflicted upon their neighbours. These neighbours have so far been compassionate  but they are becoming increasingly disturbed at the burdens thrust upon them.364.	My country had the honour to be invited by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to a Meeting in Geneva in July this year which attempted to alleviate the crisis caused by Indo-Chinese refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries in South East Asia and to Australia. We were represented at the meeting by a cabinet minister.365.	My Government fully recognizes the humanitarian nature of the refugee problem  which has become a common concern of the entire world community. The Papua New Guinea Government appreciates the role played by the ASEAN countries in meeting the problem. The establishment of refugee processing centres in the ASEAN region is a positive move to alleviate the burdens that have been inflicted upon the countries in the region. May I stress  however  that the success of these centres will depend on a wider response to the need for developed nations to accept more refugees.366.	I should like to inform this gathering that my Government shares the views of those countries which called upon aid donors to Viet Nam to consider diverting their assistance to resettlement and rehabilitation programmes for Indo-Chinese refugees. In addition  Papua New Guinea would like to renew the call for a withdrawal of those external pressures which have in-creased regional tensions and aggravated the refugee problem. My Government also endorses the call for an end to the flow of Indo-Chinese refugees made at the Tokyo Economic Summit by the developed nations  by the twelfth meeting of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers at Bali in June  and by the Meeting on Refugees and Dis-placed Persons in South-East Asia in Geneva in July.367.	In addition to the regional problems to which 1 have referred  there are some more general subjects of world-wide significance on which I should like to say something. They include the subject of human rights  which Papua New Guinea considers most important.368.	My Government takes pleasure in noting the measures taken by countries Members of this body to safeguard human rights. But there are still too many instances of governments which continue to deny the basic rights of their citizens. The denial of basic human rights on any groundsâracial  political  economic or any other arbitrary groundsâgives rise to injustices which my Government finds intolerable.369.	We cannot understand how conscientious human beings can continue to suppress the basic rights of their fellow-citizens. The suppression of basic human rights in such circumstances cannot be accidental. My Government appeals to the international community to condemn those Governments which persist in violating basic human rights. We urge Governments which violate such rights to take prompt and effective action to respect the dignity of their citizens.370.	My Government views the question of disarmament as a matter of utmost importance to international peace and security. It is our strong belief that lasting international peace and security cannot be built on the accumulation of weapons. I believe genuine and lasting peace can be created only through the effective implementation of the security system as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations. General and complete disarmament under effective international control must be the principal objective of ensuring the survival of mankind and eliminating the danger of war  particularly nuclear war  as well as ensuring that war is no longer an instrument for settling international disputes.371.	It is the desire and wish of small nations  such as mine  for the peoples of this world to have peace and security. The fulfilment of this desire will then enable us to concentrate on our efforts to develop and improve the lives of our people in the social and economic sectors of our over-all development objectives.372.	My delegation is opposed to all forms of nuclear testingâatmospheric or otherwiseâbecause we firmly believe that the cessation of nuclear testing is a step towards disarmament and the prevention of nuclear pollution of the environment. We equally oppose the dumping of nuclear wastes for the same reasons. I refer in particular to the South Pacific region  where nuclear testing takes place every year. I wish to state once again that my Government strongly opposes nuclear testing in the region. We therefore call on those who are responsible to cease all forms of nuclear testing in the Pacific because they are endangering the lives of the inhabitants of the region.373.	As the Disarmament Decade introduced by the General Assembly draws to a conclusion  my Government is disappointed to note that there has not been any real progress towards the reduction of arms nor have there been any negotiations leading to a treaty on general and complete disarmament. We note with some satisfaction the signing of the second SALT Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. However  we are still hopeful that some international agreement or arrangements  such as the comprehensive test-ban Treaty  will be negotiated and agreed to as soon as practicable.374.	The international community today recognizes the need to move quickly towards a New International Economic Order  even though there exist differing views on major proposals that have been put forward. The Government of Papua New Guinea is deeply concerned at the slow progress being made.375.	The attempts to regulate world trade in primary commodities  the reform of the external framework for the industrialization of developing countries  the reform of the international monetary system  the strengthening of economic co-operation among developing countries are all still outstanding issues. There are many reasons why they have not been resolved and I do not propose to go into them. But I should like to say that one of the main reasons has been opposition from developed countries  with the result that conferences similar to the fifth session of UNCTAD have repeatedly failed to achieve agreement on any one of the issues that I have mentioned.376.	If the international community has learned anything in recent years  it has surely been that the economic welfare of each sovereign nation depends on a network of interdependence. My Government is deeply concerned at the failure of the long-awaited world recovery to come about. We believe that current economic problems cannot be blamed on the management of individual national economies. The management of each economy is becoming dependent on the external environment. Recovery and development require an enlightened attitude of mutual appreciation of each other's needs  interests and problems on the part of all countries. Without such an appreciation  the prospect that any dialogue between developed and developing countries will lead to constructive changes in the international economic order must be regarded as gloomy indeed.377.	A concrete example of international cooperation for development is the Lome Convention on trade and aid between the European Community and the African  Caribbean and Pacific countries. The Lome Convention expires in a few months and the long negotiations on a successor agreement have been finalized. It appears that the successor agreement will  in general  be similar to the current one. However  the second Lome' agreement will contain a new mechanism which purports to assist mineral exporting countries. The Government of Papua New Guinea welcomes the conclusion of the Lome negotiations. But we have reservations about the new mechanism in that it offers assistance only to countries which have suffered reductions in their capacity to produce certain minerals and export them to the European market. The assistance itself is restricted to project or programme aid confined to the mineral sector and designed to restore production or export capacity. There is no help for those countries  including my own  which have suffered severe economic damage through low prices for our vital mineral exports.378.	It is our strong conviction that a mineral assistance scheme  if it is to be of real value  must include the provision of concessional finance for countries that have suffered a loss of export earnings or  alternatively  a loss of Government revenue as a result of low export prices.379.	All developing countries are concerned that in a harsh world the poor countries are supposed to be grateful for what they are offered and should not expect to have a say in what the offer contains. Such a situation gives rise to extreme difficulties in the formulation of plans for development. As long as developing countries  to which category my country clearly belongs  are not given a greater say in deciding how they are helped  we shall continue to face great difficulties in providing the basic needs of our people.380.	Finally  the 1970s in the South Pacific will be remembered as the decade in which many of the island Territories gained self-determination and independence. It is in this decade that the following South Pacific Territories have gained their self-determination and independence: Fiji  the Republic of Nauru  Niue  the Cook Islands  Tuvalu  the Republic of Kiribati  the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.381.	I should like to bring to the General Assembly's attention a question of particular concern to the people of the South Pacific. I refer here to the continued French presence in the region.382.	The right of self-determination and independence is inscribed in the Charter of the United Nations. It was reaffirmed in resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960. It is a right to which newly independent countries such as my own feel a strong commitment. We feel that we have a duty to our Pacific neighbours to raise the question here and pursue it elsewhere. In fact  we have already done so in the Special Committee on decolonization.383.	Four years ago  Papua New Guinea became in-dependent. Since then  the number of independent Pacific island nations has grown to eight  four of which are Members of the United Nations. The end of the colonial era in the Pacific islands is  we hope  in sight.384.	The people of the Pacific islands have been fortunate in that the decolonization of the region has generally been brought about as peacefully as its name suggests. We have appreciated the interest taken in the process by Members of the United Nations. We have been fortunate that the Australian  United Kingdom and New Zealand Governments recognized our rights to self-determination and continue to play a constructive and helpful part in our development. But we would be wise to remember that  even in the Pacific islands  the process of decolonization was not as smooth  nor the outcome as certain  as may sometimes appear when we look back.385.	Mr. President  you  yourself as well as many of the representatives in the General Assembly will recall the difficulties and doubts you and your fellow countrymen faced before your countries became independent. You will recall  too  the encouragement and support you received from leaders of countries which had previously become independent. You know that  at independence  new relationships become possible with former rulers.386.	My Government feels that it has a duty to see that other Pacific island peoples are offered the encouragement and support once offered to us. In the case of the New Hebrides  that duty is not hard to perform. The United Kingdom and French Governments have recognized the right to self-determination of the people of the New Hebrides. We applaud this attitude and look forward hopefully to its independence in 1980. In other parts of the Pacific  however  we feel compelled to respond to calls for assistance from leaders of people whose rights to self-determination have not been secured. I refer here specifically to the people of other French dependenciesâNew Caledonia  French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna Islands.387.	Elsewhere in the Pacific islands  the former colonial Powers have generally recognized the islands peoples' rights to self-determination without much outside prompting. The French Government has seen elsewhere how the denial of such rights cannot be sustained. My Government appeals to France to recognize the rights of the indigenous inhabitants. We urge other Members of the United Nations to support our appeal.388.	My Government would like to pay a sincere tribute to France for the constructive role it has played in the creation of important new trade and aid relationships between the independent Pacific island nations and Western Europe. We look forward to the day when France's relationships with its remaining Pacific island dependencies have been transformed and it can play an equally constructive role in their development; but I must emphasize my Government's conviction that the commitment to peace  human rights and development of which I spoke earlier requires us to speak out on our neighbours' behalf."
"108",5669,"POL",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I wish at the outset to address to you our warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to the high and responsible office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I do so with special pleasure because you are a representative of a country whose successful socio-economic progress has been well known to and admired by us  a country with which Poland is developing mutually beneficial and fruitful co-operation. We are convinced that your remarkable diplomatic talents and your rich international experience will significantly add to the constructive work of this session.150.	May I also be allowed to express our gratitude and respect to Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the outgoing President of the General Assembly  who conducted the work of the last session with great dedication and efficiency.151.	Allow me also to assure Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  of our traditionally high regard of and support for his active efforts aimed at the implementation of the purposes of the United Nations.152.	The important and at times tragic developments of the last year have not halted the trends towards ensuring lasting world peace and social progress and providing man with dignified living conditions. This gives reason for satisfaction to Poland and to all States that dearly cherish the cause of peace  and it justifies hope for progress in resolving the key problems of the day  to which this session of the General Assembly can and should make a significant contribution.153.	Last year's record is  however  not totally positive. Tensions in various regions have been maintained  wars have continued  and new armed conflicts have emerged throughout the world. The tension  the wars and the conflicts stem from the obstinate denial of the legitimate rights of nations; they result from a policy of aggression  as has been the case in the Middle East and in southern Africa  or from the hegemonistic aspirations of a great Power in South-East Asia. Nor has success been achieved in effectively curbing the arms race. Disruptions in the global economic situation  notably in the field of energy and raw materials  as well as protectionist practices and other barriers to the development of international trade  have given rise to the justified concern of many of the nations of the world.154.	All this poses difficult and responsible tasks for the United Nations and most importantly the duty of effectively settling controversial problems and developing international co-operation  the fundamental conditions for the maintenance and consolidation of world peace. I am stressing this latter point as representative of a people that 40 years ago was the first to stand up  weapons in hands  against the aggression by Hitler's Third Reich. In an unequal struggle the people of Poland gave proof of supreme heroism and a spirit of sacrifice. Under an onslaught of enemy forces  towns fell  divisions succumbed and entire armies perished. But  in spite of heavy odds  the Polish people never surrenderedâquite the contrary; our people  through its movement of national resistance  in its struggle on all fronts in the Second World War  made a major contribution to the victory of the anti-Nazi coalition. In this fight it suffered enormous losses: 6 million killed and massacred and more than 40 per cent of the national wealth destroyed or plundered. The memory of the victims and the tragic experiences of the Second World War  which took a toll of more than 50 million human lives throughout the world  still remains vivid.155.	Drawing as it does the right conclusions from these tragic experiences  in the 35 years of its existence the Polish People's Republic has consistently spared no effort to bring about a peaceful development of Europe and the world  enhancing understanding  mutual trust and friendship among nations  in keeping with the lofty purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nationsâthat very Organization of which Poland was one of the founding Members. Its noble ideals have also been included in the Message of the Polish people to the peoples and parliaments of the world  adopted on 1 September of this year. They were referred to on the same day by the leader of the Polish people  Edward Gierek  who stated:""Peace is the supreme and most sacred right of every man and of all nations. Peace is the right to life. That is the most important conclusion mankind should draw from the experiences of the last war  and from its entire history.""156.	Acting in that spirit  at the thirty-third session of the General Assembly  Poland proposed a draft Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace""  a document which earned widespread support. I wish to note with satisfaction that during the past nine months since the adoption of the Declaration by the General Assembly  it has elicited a lively response from broad segments of the international community  including the young people to whom it is particularly addressed. The ideas of the Declaration have been endorsed by numerous international organizations  including UNESCO  governmental and nongovernmental organizations. I am taking this opportunity to thank most warmly all delegations which lent our initiative their valuable support. I am also glad to inform the Assembly that the Government of the Polish People's Republic is preparing a concrete programme for the implementation of the Declaration in Poland  to be presented to the United Nations in due course.157.	Inspired by those ideas  the people of Poland are solemnly observing the year of Dr. Janusz Korczak  which has been recognized by UNESCO as one of the anniversaries of great personalities and events  in commemoration of an eminent thinker  moralist  educator and writer  who has devoted and given his life to the cause of children and youth.158.	On Edward Gierek's initiative  a Janusz Korczak Memorial Institute will be built in Warsaw  to promote the ideals confirmed by the sacrifice of his life  the welfare of the child and the cause of peace. It is our earnest hope that both the Institute and the recently established International Korczak Society will be given recognition and support by the international community  commensurate with the humanistic values they represent.159.	During his memorable pilgrimage to Poland  at the site of the former Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp  Pope John Paul II spoke of the atrocities and the senseless futility of war  which should be sternly condemned. He defended the right of man to live in peace and pointed out that the responsibility for wars does not only fall upon those who start them  but also on those who fail to do all they can to prevent them.160.	Just as the co-operative effort of the great Powers  which made their decisive contribution to the defeat of fascism  was indispensable for the victory of the anti-Nazi coalition in the Second World War  today  too  progress in detente and disarmament invariably calls for co-operation of the great Powers  bound by the Charter to ensure peace and international security. Equally indispensable is the need for active participation in such efforts and co-operation on the part of other States.161.	The very same principles and ideals which gave birth to the Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace have determined the Polish People's Republic's active stance in favour of disarmament. We believe that curbing the arms race represents a task the implementation of which is of paramount importance to world peace. The danger of the arms race is that it engulfs more and more States  that it is turning into a technological race that it involves more and more people and absorbs growing material resources and  consequently  that instead of strengthening international security  it undermines it.162.	Preventing a further qualitative and quantitative arms race is becoming an ever-pressing imperative of the day. Special responsibility in that regard rests upon the great Powers and other States with significant military and economic potential.163.	Guided by our sense of joint responsibility for international peace Poland  as in the past  so also today  is trying to make a contribution to disarmament negotiations by advancing constructive initiatives of its own or in concert with its allies. An important platform of tangible disarmament measures has been offered in the Declaration of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty adopted at the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee  held at Moscow on 23 November 1978. 164.	We are glad to note that numerous forums of disarmament negotiations are already functioning  that a considerable number of States are involved in them and that significant progress has been achieved on some of the issues. This justifies our hope that curbing the arms race is a realistic proposition and  once it has been achieved  it will serve as a point of departure for specific reductions of armed forces and armaments. What is badly needed is the goodwill  trust and co-operation of all the participants in the negotiations  combined with strict adherence to the principle of equal security of all States.165.	This latter principle  today more than ever before  is becoming one of the basic foundations  not of disarmament negotiations alone  but also of progress in relations among States. It should therefore be adequately reflected in those United Nations documents which outline our Organization's basic activities in consolidating peace and strengthening international security and disarmament.166.	Respect for the principle of equal security of States has made possible the signing by the USSR and the United States of a historic Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. We regard the signing as a political event of importance for world peace and the policy of detente  as an auspicious starting-point for the continuation of negotiations aimed at a further limitation  reduction and  eventually  elimination of nuclear weapons. The second round of SALT has been an encouraging example of how to seek realistic compromise solutions to other problems of disarmament and controversial political issues. Poland welcomed with appreciation both the Treaty in question and the meeting in Vienna between Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter  confident that the Treaty will soon enter into force  thereby enabling the third round of the SALT discussions to start and  we hope  providing favourable stimuli to other disarmament negotiations.167.	At a time when nations are awaiting further progress in limiting armaments  on which they are pinning their hopes for more effective solutions to problems of economic and social development  it is particularly important that States refrain from taking any steps likely to increase military tensions and intensify the arms race  thus adversely affecting chances for disarmament agreements. This calls  first of all  for the prohibition of the development and the introduction of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction  particularly neutron weapons 168.	In the context of disquieting reports that certain States intend to acquire nuclear weapons and are developing the technological facilities for their production  the strengthening of the regime of non- proliferation of nuclear weapons also takes on special significance. We believe that the time available before the second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons should be utilized further to strengthen the non- proliferation regime and  at the same time  to develop broad international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.169.	The drafting of an international agreement on the strengthening of guarantees of the security of non- nuclear States  in accordance with the proposals submitted by the Soviet Union  would be of great importance for the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime itself and  in a more general context  the consolidating of world peace. Hence we firmly support the creation of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace in various parts of the world  a subject to which we have devoted and will continue to devote much attention.170.	It is only natural that Poland  situated as it is in a sensitive central part of Europe  should manifest special interest in measures of a regional character. Together with its allies Poland last May submitted a number of new specific proposals  including in particular  an initiative to convene  at a political level  a conference of all European States  the United States and Canada aimed at easing military confrontation in Europe.  We note with satisfaction that these proposals have given rise to a broad positive response in a number of countries of Western Europe. A certain convergence of intent with other Statesâfor instance  the well-known proposal on disarmament presented by France âseems to be a favourable element in the realization of the idea of such a conference.171.	It is obviousâand nobody doubts thisâthat the process of political detente  if it is to be lasting and steadily growing and lead to increasing trust among States  must be complemented by progress in the sphere of military detente. An important role in that process should be played by broadly conceived confidence-building measures going beyond the traditional military notion of the term.172.	The basic confidence-building measure which goes beyond the military aspects of the term is the full implementation in letter and spirit of the binding inter-national agreementsâboth bilateral and multilateralâ that enrich international law. Indeed  that law should be adequately reflected in the respective domestic legislation of the signatory States  so as to give practical administrative effect to obligations under international agreements.173.	We are also of the view that the provisions contained in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe should be included in the domestic legislation of States which have solemnly signed it in Helsinki. This unique ""act of peace"" constitutes an important European confidence-building platform which should have an increasing impact upon the limitation of armaments and accelerate the conclusion of disarmament agreements.174.	We continue to attach great importance to the Vienna talks on the mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. Together with the Soviet Union  Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic  we have submitted a number of compromise proposals  the adoption of which would help to break the deadlock in the negotiations. We hope that our Western partners will reciprocate by responding to them in an equally constructive spirit.175.	I should like to emphasize the special significance of the draft declaration on international cooperation for disarmament which has been submitted by our neighbour and friend the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. We are convinced that the adoption of such a declaration would serve to stimulate disarmament efforts and accelerate progress at various levels of disarmament negotiations. We 'give it our full support.176.	The need for world peace  the concern to ensure coming generations a peaceful future  the necessity for more effective handling of global problems of economic and social development  including assistance to developing countriesâall this speaks in favour of intensifying disarmament negotiations through the existing channels and opening up new forums for the creation of a political climate that would facilitate agreement. That is why Poland believes that conditions are ripe for holding a World Disarmament Conference and supports the convening of such a conference as soon as possible.177.	We are particularly happy that  in spite of various actions on the part of cold-war and reactionary forces  the process of detente has made further progress  particularly in Europe. Poland is making its own contribution to this positive development of the situation  and the recent visits and meetings at the highest level between Poland and Western European States  including France  the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands  attest to that. We genuinely hope that the meeting to be held in 1980 in Madrid will be fully in keeping with the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and  in particular  its Declaration of Principles Guiding Relations Between Participating States  and will give fresh impetus to the policy of detente. A particularly important task is to avert the threat of a new round in the arms race implied by the plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to expand and modernize its nuclear and rocket weaponry. It is equally important to begin new efforts towards intensifying economic  scientific and cultural co-operation in Europe  particularly in the fields of energy  the protection of the environment and transportation.178.	While particularly concerned with ensuring the peaceful development of Europe  we also remain mindful of the significance of those positive developments for the whole world. It is well known that peace and detente are indivisible; hence these positive changes should include all regions of the world by assuming a lasting and irreversible character.179.	We are convinced that Europe at peace can make a constructive and worthy contribution to the strengthening of security and the development of international co-operation. The more we strengthen security in Europe and deepen confidence between East and West  the more significant that contribution will be. The most urgent task of the moment must therefore be to strive to establish an effective security system in Europe based not upon the balance of fear and the existence of opposing blocs having developed military and political structures but on respect for political and territorial realities  mutual trust and respect in good faith for mutual interests and intentions. Such a vision of Europe focused on unity rather than division should  in our view and that of our allies  form the basis of the programme of action of the European States.180.	Turning to the problems of Asia  I should like from this rostrum to express our heartfelt sympathy with the Vietnamese people  who have in the long years of struggle for their national and social liberation made an outstanding contribution to the global process of decolonization and national affirmation.181.	We support the efforts of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  which  resisting aggression and opposing constant external pressure  has undertaken the tremendous and arduous task of rebuilding the country destroyed by long and cruel wars. Like the peoples of Laos and Kampuchea  the Vietnamese people have  by their heroism and suffering  earned our understanding  support and assistance.182.	The Polish people was particularly shocked by the immensity of the misery and crimes inflicted by the Pol Pot regime upon the people of Kampuchea. The tragedy of that nation brings to mind our own experience in the not-too-distant past: the mass extermination of our people by the Nazi invaders. We therefore view the overthrow of the genocidal Pol Pot regime and the proclamation of the People's Republic of Kampuchea as political events of momentous consequence. We believe that the universal recognition of these facts is an indispensable premise for promoting the cause of peace and stability in South-East Asia.183.	We regret that there is still no progress in the peaceful and just settlement of the Middle East conflict. The separatist agreement has failed to bring such a settlement any closer; rather  it has generated new tensions and difficulties. In our opinion  any steps taken in that regard must genuinely aim at a comprehensive solution to the problem  in accordance with the security requirements of all the parties concerned. They should above all take due account of the rights of the people of Palestine  including their right to form an independent State. That right  as well as the recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole authentic representative of the Palestinian people  is gaining ever wider international support and recognition.184.	We likewise fully support the efforts of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia to gain genuine independence and we share in their rejection of any attempts at artificial solutions which in reality are meant to extend the rule of neo-colonialism and racism. We condemn apartheid in South Africa and that country's policy which threatens the independence of African States. We support the activities of the Organization of African Unity designed to eliminate the vestiges of imperialist and colonial domination and to liquidate apartheid and all forms of racism.185.	We welcomed with satisfaction the news of the overthrow of the brutal dictatorship in Nicaragua. We salute the people of Nicaragua and wish them success in the reconstruction and progressive development of their country.186.	Poland fully shares the concern at the international level over manifestations of the policy of domination and hegemonism. We therefore support the proposal submitted the day before yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Andrei Gromyko  to include on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly an item entitled ""Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"". The Polish delegation believes that a debate on this pressing issue and the adoption of an appropriate resolution will represent an important contribution to the struggle for the elimination of obstacles to the process of detente and the strengthening of peace on the basis of the equal sovereignty of all States.187.	Poland  as a socialist State  proud of its traditions of struggle  as we say ' 'for your freedom and for ours""  has always stood and will continue to stand on the side of those States and peoples who must still fight for their freedom and independence  for their right to a sovereign national existence  for their economic independence  for a just place in the family of nations of the world with equal rights  for social justice  for human rights and for the true respect and promotion thereof. Faithful to these objectives and ideals  in the past 26 years Poland has frequently sent its political and military representatives to participate in missions of peace in various parts of the world. It is gratifying to see that an increasing number of States and political forces include these noble ideals in their programmes of action. The Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries recently held in Havana bears witness to that  inter alia. Poland welcomed the results of that Conference as a demonstration of the growing  constructive role of the movement of non- aligned States.188.	The question of restructuring economic relations is awakening the lively interest of all States of the world  without exception. The current general debate at this session  as well as those in numerous other international organizations  is a pertinent reflection of this interest.189.	The problem is important and indeed pressing  particularly because all countries of the world must confront  even though to varying degrees  multifaceted difficulties which hamper their economic growth.190.	It is  at the same time  an extremely complex problem  which calls for the abolition of the old  unjust principles of international economic relations which make it difficult for a number of States to effect indispensable changes in their economic structure. Hence  under the circumstances  the road towards restructuring economic relations and overcoming the present difficulties leads first and foremost through development of international economic co-operation in all fields on the basis of the principles of equality  sovereignty  non-discrimination and mutual advantage. In our opinion  efforts towards that end could be greatly assisted by the examination of long-term trends in economic development. This research could reconcile the interests of all regions of the world  developed and developing alike  in harmonious co-operation. The Polish delegation to the current session of the General Assembly will submit an appropriate draft resolution on that question. 191.	Poland understands fully and views with sympathy the expectations of the developing countries in connexion with the new international economic order. We ourselves  for decades deprived of independence  inherited conditions of severe underdevelopment. Only quite recently  we  too  had to rebuild our country after the monstrous destruction brought about by the Second World War. We  too  attach great importance to the implementation of the progressive principles of the new international economic order and to the improvement in the over-all economic situation  which in the long term would serve the just interests of all States. Such an attitude should be reflected in the international development strategy for the 1980s  in the preparation of which Poland is actively participating.192.	Today  more than ever before  there is need for a good deal of imagination and political goodwill in the concerted effort of all States to normalize the world economic situation. Such an effort should include all States. For the order to be effective  it must be based upon a realistic assessment of the contribution which each State  according to its industrial  scientific  technological or raw-material potential  can and should make for the benefit of all. It is only natural that the contribution of those who have for centuries amassed excessive profits from exploitation and discriminatory economic relations with other countries will have to be different from the contribution of those who not only have no such record but who in the past were themselves victims of foreign economic exploitation  or whose possessions were ravaged by wars  the biological and economic consequences of which have often endured to this day.193.	Such an approach might well strengthen the principle of justice in international economic relations.194. As part of the world economic system  Poland can hardly remain immune to its defects  particularly its protectionism and other forms of discrimination  the inflationary rise of prices on the world markets of the essential raw materials  fuels and finished products that we need.195.	Consequently  we are actively seeking possible means of reducing the negative effects on the world market  in both our bilateral and our multilateral relations. We attach vital importance in that respect to our co-operation within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Our approach in this field goes hand in hand with our participation in world-wide efforts on the basis of the principles which I have just mentioned.196.	In implementing the idea of partnership for development  Poland has recently adopted governmental programmes aimed at expanding co-operation with the countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America. In particular  we declare our readiness to pursue and to develop co-operation through the use of our experts in the developing countries  as well as through the training of students and specialists in Poland. We fully support the recommendations and objectives of General Assembly resolution 33/135 on increasing the role of the specialized agencies in training qualified personnel for the developing countries  and we declare our readiness to co-operate in their implementation.197.	We are constantly promoting and expanding our economic relations with developing countries. We are linked with a number of them by active trade exchanges and industrial co-operation that bring mutual advantages. Different and new forms are now emerging that includes joint enterprises  multiform scientific and technological co-operation and the expansion of activities in the field of personnel training at different levels for their national economies. Lack of qualified personnel is at present one of the principal difficulties being encountered by many developing countries  and it is one that must be overcome.198.	We fully understand that  in addition to mobilization of their own forces  which are the determining factor of development  most developing countries are in need of outside assistance. This is especially true of States with the lowest national income. Within its own capabilities and in keeping with its system of economic co-operation with foreign countries  Poland is making specific efforts in this direction  paying particular attention to scientific and technological co-operation. We therefore view favourably the objectives set forth by the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development held in Vienna. In order to seek new and effective technological solutions  conserve energy  engage in a more rational utilization of existing coal resources and find new  alternative sources of energy we need an unobstructed flow of scientific information and the pooling of the creative efforts of all States.199.	We reject pessimistic or catastrophic visions of the future of the world. The harmonious economic development of the world is a feasible goal  and this implies increased expansion of international economic co-operation. In that respect  Europe offers opportunities for intensifying economic co-operation through a broader utilization of that important instrumentâthe ECE.200.	The experience of many countries and of developing countries in particular  demonstrates that appropriate economic growth is dependent on social factors. For this reason  in the opinion of the Polish delegation and in conformity with our draft resolution  more attention should be given to the social aspect of this problem in the preparations under way for the third development decade. Included in this are essential matters affecting man's living conditions and dignity  such as a just division of national income  guaranteed access for all to education and medical care  the granting of equal rights to women and expanded child care.201.	The observance of the International Year of the Child  which has been marked in Poland by the inauguration of the Child Health Centre in Warsaw  a symbolic memorial erected in memory of the children who died during the Second World War  should in our opinion contribute to accelerating work on the drafting of an international convention on the rights of the child  as Poland has proposed.202.	We attach great weight to providing the best possible conditions of life and development for that basic unit of society  the family. Our concern has been embodied in a special governmental organ  the Council for Family Affairs  which has been established and is functioning under the auspices of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic.203.	From what I have said here and from what we have heard in other statements given from this rostrum  a rather simple conclusion flows: we are living in a world that is full of difficult problems  but one that is at the same time full of hope and prospects. As we do each year  we have come here not only to draw up a balance- sheet of those difficult problems  but primarily in order to attempt to solve them through the joint efforts of all of usâto solve them in a just and constructive manner  mindful of a better future for all mankind.204.	I took the liberty of beginning my statement with a reference to the fateful outbreak of the Second World War 40 years ago. In conclusion  let me say that since that event  the world has become a better and a more secure place in which to live. Let us do all we can further to promote and broaden this positive trend  in the name of peace  progress and prosperity for all nations. It is in this spirit that the delegation of the Polish People's Republic also intends to work at this current session of the General Assembly."
"109",5740,"PRT",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  allow me first of all to congratulate you on your election as President of this General Assembly. We are well aware of your remarkable career  your experience and your wisdom  because several times in the past few years my country has had the honour and the pleasure of working and co-operating with you. We are therefore particularly happy that we shall be able to count on your wise counsel and your great knowledge in the exercise of your new duties. Your election also expresses the respect and consideration of the international community for your country  with which Portugal is linked by relations of friendship and solidarity which I am happy to reaffirm today.3.	I should also like to express our gratitude and pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  who  in discharging his functions  once again displayed his qualities as a diplomat and statesman.4.	I should like to mention now the memory of the President of the People's Republic of Angola  Agostinho Neto  whose recent and unexpected demise has impoverished Africa and the family of nations who use Portuguese as their main language. By paying a sincere tribute to him  I associate myself with the Angolan people in their loss. I am convinced that that people will continue the work of national consolidation which President Neto was carrying out with lucidity arid determination 5.	In addressing this Assembly I am acutely aware that this session is taking place on the threshold of the 1980s and that this is a very significant fact.6.	Chronology may be viewed as a simple convention with dates and continuity  but there may also be a break in continuity. There may be landmarks which warn us of the new nature of things  of an irruption of unwritten history  of a future created by the action of men and of peoples.7.	These stimulate us to think of new borders and of new methods to free us from the accumulated sediment of the ages.8.	They are also an invitation to conceive of new  viable alternatives and courageously to choose those that serve all men and the human being in all his aspects.9.	They are a challenge to non-conformity and imagination  since we have exhausted the policies deriving from the projection of a past already undergone in which questions and bewilderments in the face of the unknown take shape.10.	With the 1980s  the future is all around us. The present  in which we are comfortably installed  is shaken. Questions are asked about past history and we are asked in our turn what we are going to do and what we are preparing for.11.	The meeting with the 1980s is thus a decisive meeting  affording the opportunity of building a future for the whole of mankind.12.	We must look at the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly in this context. It is true that the agenda deals with matters which have been discussed over many years. If we were not confronted with the grave situations with which the agenda deals  we could almost say that the General Assembly is somewhat complacent and is only concerned with ceremony and repetitive intentions and preoccupations year after year. But we know that this is not the case. On the one hand  the apparently dispassionate character of the items on the agenda reflects the modesty of our community in the face of the tragedy of our human condition and the enormous difficulties that face us in seeking to resolve them in a creative way. Behind every item on the agenda there are human realitiesâinvolving human beings  groups  and nations of the worldâwhich go beyond the scope of the bureaucratic apparatus  which in all systems tends to neutralize that which is vibrant and alive. On the other hand  the General Assembly is now able in a radically new way to tackle old questions and problems which have been left behind by time.13.	In the last few years facts and events have ac-cumulated and the General Assembly has constantly analysed them in the shape of resolutions which have been adopted. The question that we inevitably ask today is the following. Is the impact of the Organization as a free association of sovereign States which is the ultimate international political forum really felt only in the exponential increase of declarations  resolutions  conventions and institutional machinery for their implementation?14.	We are deeply convinced that the cumulative efforts of the various past activities of the United Nations are translated today in a qualitative jump forward in the functioning of this system and  what is more important  in the awareness the world community has of its solidarity.15.	The General Assembly  we believe  is able to function as a point of distillation of what has been done and a groping but already perceptible manifestation of world solidarity. For this to appear with utmost clarity  it is essential that the General Assembly be the point of convergence for the aspirations of the masses of the people throughout the world  the total awareness of the solidarity uniting men and the peoples  and the decisions which should inspire the political leaders in their activities in the service of peoples and peace among nations.16.	As we are about to enter into the 1980s  I have tried in a few words to explain what seem to me to have been the lessons of the 1970s as they relate to the United Nations system. I deliberately leave out of account the many items on the agenda which would alone warrant a statement in a plenary meeting. My delegation will not fail to deal with these matters in the appropriate committees.17.	I wish to pin-point  among others  the situation in Cyprus and in South-East Asia  the proposals to create nuclear-free zones in Africa  the Middle East and South Asia  the first steps towards the establishment of a new international order in the field of information  the convening of a world disarmament conference  and all questions dealing with the status of women  especially preparations for a world conference in 1980 within the framework of the United Nations Decade for Women  as well as the preparation of a convention on the elimination of discrimination against women.18.	On this last point may I say that the obvious progress achieved in the world regarding the access of some women to key political positions should not make us lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of women are far from able to contribute  with full equality in rights and opportunities  to the creation of those new modes of life and society which the world so greatly needs.19.	At the end of this decade we must view our adherence to the United Nations Charter not as a rigid and immutableâand therefore abstract and unrealisticâ affirmation of principles but rather as a code of conduct enriched  in its interpretation  by the elements of the experience acquired in the 1970s.20.	We consider that at each stage of the history of international relations  new types of rights and their corresponding duties as well as increasingly definite standards of behaviour take shape and give renewed vigour and a wider interpretation to the principles laid down in the Charter.21.	In the 1970s the profound changes that have occurred in the social and economic order existing among nations as well as the unexpected nature of many conflicts have shown that the code of conduct laid down in the Charter indissolubly links all nations  large or small  powerful or weak  leading some to reconsider the weakness of their strength and others to measure the strength of their weakness.22.	In this context the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  as well as the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  are clear examples of the broadening of the code of conduct outlined in the Charter.23.	The growing concern throughout the present system and the experience of the last few years  aimed at changing opposing positions into areas of common agreement conducive to negotiation through dialogue and mutual clarification  have gradually led to the re-placement of the tyranny of the vote by the wise practice of consensus. What is involved is a gradual movement from legal theory to the practice of solidarity.24.	Through efforts at agreement the 1970s have  within the framework of the United Nations  left us with a clearer picture of what might be called political questions. Indeed  two fundamental components of this system are closely linked to the General Assembly  and both are concerned with political issues: the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council.25.	The Security Council is the constitutional forum for assessing relations of force among the nations of the world  and for constantly renewed efforts to find peaceful solutions to important conflicts. It is easy to verify that the major issues raised in the Security Councilâto which my country has the honour of belonging- concern not only the essentially political dimension of events but also the great world-wide problems of social injustice and the subhuman living conditions of a large part of mankind.26.	At the same time  although the matters dealt with by the Economic and Social Council relate specifically to the economy  science  culture and informationâin short  the social element  in its widest senseâthey cannot be considered as non-political.27.	General Assembly resolution 32/197 unequivocally requests the specialized agencies of the United Nations system immediately to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly.28.	Economic  social and cultural problems have a political aspect which only the General Assembly has the competence to judge.29.	The foregoing statements are not the result of a political interpretation of the United Nations system; or of an inadequate politicization of the entire system. Actually; the past decade has clearly confirmed that economic and political independence are very intimately and deeply linked.30.	From the time that the raw-materials-producing countries became dramatically aware that their economic independence was the sole guarantee of their political independence to the time of the affirmation of the economic independence of countries which industrialization had seemed to make politically invulnerable  a profound change has taken place.31.	The link between these two elements is so far- reaching that we can legitimately wonder about the basis of genuine independence today. Are we already at a stage of economic exchange which goes beyond the nation-State  perhaps reducing its political power? And if so  what safeguards can the nation-State find to ensure its own autonomy  freedom of choice and its options?32.	Confronted with increasingly difficult situations  we are inundated with unfamiliar criteria and with aspirations from other climes. The great challenge before us is to free ourselves from the tangle of increasingly complex and even contradictory relations that the very term ""world market"" implies and that link States to one another politically  while affirming the autonomy of each people.33.	What I have just stated is directly linked to another important legacy of the 1970s: it is the obvious political vacuum of science and technology when they do not serve development and do not contribute to good relations among people and to happiness.34.	The real potential of these changes lies in the relationship between man and his natural and cultural environment  on the one hand  and the time and place in which he lives out his history  on the other. It is at that level that one may object to the imposition of a single model and instead create modes of cultural expressionâthat is to say  ways of living and of being  with the necessary strength to serve as incentives for more adequate technologiesâas well as more flexible economic systems  and affirm a sovereignty that is both more rigorous and more tolerant.35.	Such a development process is not  however  always compatible with the economic limitations often imposed from outside which sometimes even set the rate of inflation and unemployment  and even the rate of growth of a country's national wealth.36.	Constraints of this type bring about  over large areas of the world or in peoples' lives  the irreversible adoption over a shorter or longer period of well-defined patterns of scientific  technical or commercial activities  and can prevent these activities from serving a particular people or a culture. They are  therefore  counter-productive to development. That is why one can say today that science and technology are often the Trojan horse of disguised domination.37.	Science and technology can indeed serve as a vehicle for a certain way of thinking and a common language; but they can also give rise to a disintegration of the social fabric. For them to become the tools of true development  it is necessary to make scientific and technical activities less alienating  because  through an unrealistic concept of ""pure science""  they often develop outside the social movements and trends of the world of which they are a part.38.	A strengthening of cultural values is today the necessary concomitant of any true national independence strategy not only to safeguard the legitimate sovereignty of every people but  above all  to defend a world community richer in its diversity and more able to contribute to the solution of problems through the contributions of all cultures and peoples.39.	It is at that level that within the United Nations system one must envisage the systematic activity of its specialized agencies  especially UNESCOâwith which I am personally associated as a member of its Executive Board.40.	The development we are seeking for ail peoples is an endogenous one. This does not mean development in closed conditions  in search of some mythical roots which might suddenly give rise to a new science and a new technologyânot at all. There must be respect for the rate of growth of each region; there must be optimum production of raw materials and a better understanding of the relationship between mar and nature  between the present and past and future history. A society must also be able  in dynamic fashion  to come to grips with its own historical evolution through its own culture  technology and materials. In other words  each historical development must take its own original path 41.	A clearer relationship has emerged at the end of this decade between the rights of individuals and of peoples: the rights of individuals are the foundation of the internal order of States; they relate to human freedom and to fundamental guarantees of human rights  to objective information and to the ability to enjoy cultural ties and participate in their creation. They relate  above all  to the opportunity given to every individual to forge his own destiny  to write his own history  express his thoughts and make his personal contribution to the world. This is the essence of a dynamic cultureâin other words  the right to be different and to express that difference; the right to life as a fundamental right  and to the satisfaction of one's basic needs.42.	These rights are not always or everywhere satisfied. They are linked to the rights of peoples.43.	The inalienable right to sovereigntyâas it has always been understoodâis the right of a people to a territory  but also  and above all  to the natural resources and to the cultural legacy characterizing that people. It is the right of all peoples to devise a strategy for development and to define their political options and the dimensions thereof. It is the right of everyone not to be simply a subsidiary element which circumstances may link to more powerful forces but to be considered a full international partner.44.	Otherwise  the efforts of those who in any society work and struggle for a better future  which for them is a cherished dream  but who see themselves only as pawns in a game of chessâof which they do not know the rules and which can have no effect on them  can only be futile.â45.	It is in this context that we see the complete illogicality of the arms race. In a world in disarray  disarmament raises questions of mere survival rather than questions of a moral order.46.	Let us be clear. There is no development strategy for the 1980s that could be compatible with the present policy of continuation of the arms race. In these circumstances  either the greater part of the financial  scientific and technical resources are ""diverted"" to the solution of problems of development or the balance of the new world order will be only mythical. Disarmament also cannot be viewed as a pious wish which by itself would prevent the unleashing of a world war.47.	In our days the arms race itself gives rise to war. Since the Second World War more than 125 wars have broken out in the world  directly affecting more than 60 countries and indirectly  more than 80. We must state that these localized wars have only perpetuated a system wherein recourse to violence has become a permanent element.48.	That is why Portugal  while scrupulously respecting its alliances  is in favour of and will always defend all efforts towards global and controlled disarmament.49.	Of course  we recognize the complexity and the difficulty of disarmament negotiations; nor do we forget the legitimate right of States to ensure their security. However  we proclaim again the moral imperative  which is at the same time pragmatic  that there must be created a spirit and a machinery which could replace the latent hostility which today is rampant in many parts of the world by a climate of confidence and mutual respect. Only thus shall we be able to place at the service of human progress the large portion of technical and financial resources now devoted to the arms industry.50.	In this context  my country is happy to welcome the negotiations held within the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] between the United States and the Soviet Union  the continuation and broadening of which could be an important step towards true international dÃ©tente. In the same way  Portugal attaches particular importance to initiatives aimed at the establishment of regional security systems  such as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which have been encouraged by the United Nations.51.	The growing awareness of the increased complexity of the struggle for human rightsâthe rights of all peoplesâcompels us to say a few words at this time about our particular concern over the situation in the Middle East.52.	Linked by history and culture with the peoples of that area  my country has on many occasions stressed the need to find a comprehensive  just and lasting solution which would guarantee to all the States of that area the right to live in peace within recognized and respected boundaries  which would lead to the withdrawal of Israel from the territories occupied since 1967  as well as to the dismantling of the settlements which Israel has created  and which would finally give concrete expression to the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people  unjustly broken up by a Diaspora so often accompanied by bloodshed  persecution and despair.53.	Portugal  which presides over the Security Council Committee dealing with the Israeli settlements in occupied Arab territories  would like to stress here the growing concern and the determination with which the Palestinian people are fighting for the recognition of their inalienable right to create a homeland in which they can live freely so that an end may be put to their present condition  a condition that is intolerable to the conscience of the international community.54.	Among the various tasks of the United Nations to ensure the effective exercise of the fundamental rights of peoples  decolonization and the defence of the right of self-determination have occupied an increasingly important place and have revealed the potential of the United Nations for moral intervention. Yet some colonial situations continue to exist threatening international stability and challenging the conscience of nations.55.	Such is the situation in southern Africa  where in Namibia and Zimbabwe there are still illegal political systems which not only prevent the respective peoples from freely exercising the right to self-determination but also are the root-causes of attacks  which must be condemned  against neighbouring countries with which we are linked by close ties of solidarity.56.	The Portuguese Government hopes that the diplomatic efforts undertaken within the United Nations to put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia will soon lead the Territory to independence  with complete respect for its unity and territorial integrity and the freely expressed will of all its political forces.57.	We have known  through our own painful experience in comparable circumstances  the dramatic negative cycle of political intransigence  and we entertain the hope that the present London Constitutional Conference will find a formula capable of restoring legality  equitably defending the various legitimate interests involved and restoring to the people of Zimbabwe the right freely to express their will without unjust domination on the part of internal minorities.58.	Another negative aspect of the existing situation in the area has been made evident in the system of apartheid  whose continued existence has again been proved to us by the establishment of a new Bantustan which  significantly  has been recognized only by its creators.59.	Portugal  whose people have always rejected any form of racial discrimination  firmly reiterates its condemnation of this political and social practice which is an insult to the universal conscience and an obstacle to the progress of mankind.60.	Another people that of East Timor  which is directly linked by historical ties to my country  continues to see its legitimate right to self-determination rejected. Despite several condemnations in the United Nations  despite resolutions adopted by this General Assembly and by the Security Council  the people of East Timor have not so far been able effectively to exercise this right  and Portugal  as the administering Power  has not been able alone to change the unjust situation created in that Territory. Therefore we direct an appeal to the international conscience so that conditions may be rapidly created allowing for a progressive normalization of the life of the peoples of East Timor.61.	Together with the recognition of the fundamental rights of peoples  in their various forms  there is an imperative that becomes clearer every day: that of creating and strengthening the right to express  equitably and legally  the actual independence of nations concerning the use and defence of their ecological factors and the physical resources of mankind.62.	The inclusion in a future convention on the law of the sea of principles such as the common heritage of mankind"" and of a system of exploitation of an important maritime zone on the basis of that principle  and the search for legal solutions aimed at a more equitable redistribution on a global or regional scale of natural biological or other resources are significant and important precedents for the future of standards which will have to govern international relations as well as a positive step forward towards the installation of a new world order. It was in that spirit that the Portuguese Government proposed that Lisbon become head- quarters of one of the institutions provided for by the future convention  since my Government wishes to do all in its power to contribute by all means available to it to the establishment of a more just maritime order.63.	What we have said about the 1970s enables us to view with hope the next decade of the 1980s. As far as we are concerned  we believe that the great task for these coming years is the establishment of anew international order which would transcend the purely economic and political dimension and also encompass the social  cultural and information fields. This would not be simply a more or less technocratic reorganization of the system of trade and economic exchanges among nations. At that level  it would be an urgent matter to discover bold and imaginative approaches and to transform structures in such a way as to integrate the factors which have been left aside while the ideology of industrialism was dominant.64.	On two counts  such attitudes and transformations seem necessary.65.	First  we must discover new models for post- industrialized societies. Contrary to some ideas  which may seem generous in the short run but are rather Malthusian in long-range terms  we believe that the specific contribution of wealthy and highly industrialized countries is indispensable today to the evolution of humanity. Just as the steam engine led to a new understanding of the phenomena of energy and work  by the same token we should today  not necessarily discover something new  but conceive of a new model of social and cultural relations  and preserve the most important discoveries of the industrial era.66.	Such a model presupposes the abandonment of institutionalized selfishness  and a deliberate search for social and cultural objectives which might be on a different level from that of mere economic growth 67.	We are deeply convinced that this is a vital contribution that the rich countries can make to the world at the present stage of civilization. Some movements  even though they may seem marginal today  whether in the field of technologyâin particular in that of energyâ or in the field of human relations  and especially in the feminist movement  already point in that direction. We must lay stress on human and social discoveries  over and above those of science and technology.68.	The change of attitude which the new international economic order assumes on the part of poor countries is just as radical and as demanding. We shall have to look for a greater capacity to engage in dialogue  not without firmness in the defence of just positions. We must choose a sound pragmatism  which would not be limited at the outset by verbal radicalism behind which  very often  we conceal our impotence. We must  above all  rediscover the fact that a more just order does not depend solely upon toleration  understanding  and ""concessions"" which the rich make to the poor  and which every poor country wishes in its own way to obtain for itself. On the contrary  this order must be predicated upon the clarity of our intentions and upon the conquests and achievements we have made in our own lands.69.	We shall have lost any capacity for dialogue within the international community if  when speaking of a new and more just international order  we are at the same time building a more unjust internal order.70.	We can state here and now that the expression ""world solidarity"" which is used so often translates as the expression of a new sensitivity towards international co-operation  and implies a new type of relations between peoples and nations.71.	It is high time to put an end to the injustice involved in not making good use of the enormous creative capacities of so many peoples who  having lived for so long at a bare subsistence level  are still far from being able to take advantage of the legacy of intellectual  scientific and technological knowledge of mankind.72.	To move towards human development  peace  security  and economic justice  we cannot forget the difficult objective reality which  in its various guises  forms part of the concrete and divided world of today. Nor can we fail to note that the community of nations is still very far in spirit  in practice and even in intent from the goal of genuine goodwill. But while excessive idealism is out of place here  we think none the less that there is a wide field for a convergence of interests and profits which might  in a climate of flexibility and free exchange  make it possible to begin to translate into reality legitimate aspirations for a more just and better structured international life. And it is precisely this decisive task which the present era seems to impose upon the United Nations. Avoiding isolation and radicalism  it will have to set up a machinery for meeting and for discussion; it will have to perfect the systems and the principles which can give it structure and tangible force; it will have to concert political wills and make them more dynamic  which would make progress possible; and it will have to proceed to the critical examination of present or future models of development.73.	Thus the United Nations must take up the challenge of this new era; otherwise it will play out its role on the sidelines and will find itself incapable of carrying out its historic task  which today demands of nations their utmost lucidity and wisdom.74.	Although it is difficult to find a consensus it is not impossible becauseâas we all knowâthe alternative is neither morally clear nor reassuring. This is why the awareness of the need for a new international order- political  economic  social and culturalâalthough it is only beginning  is gaining ground. Although its aim is still far away  almost Utopian  we must not abandon it or give it up. Other battles have been started by this Organizationâlike decolonizationâwhich at the beginning seemed impossible or senseless  and hardly more than a wager for the future.75.	What is at stake is not just a change in our way of life  nor just a new pragmatism in the relations between peoples and countries  nor even a simple strategy for international survival. What is at stake is above all the imperative need for all of us together  with patience and brotherliness and in the light of our condition as human beings  to shape the moral image which is so lacking in relations between nations.76.	It is in that image that we shall then find the profile of the man of the new era  who will be able to justify the hope that human civilization will enter into a new era.77.	It is therefore impossible to speak in world terms without explicitly speaking of man in the singular. It is he who is the alpha and omega of all development  of any cultural act and of any political concept. The guarantee of the freedom of each man is no longer a limited problem  but a world one.78.	I come from a poor and small country which  since 25 April 1974  has indissolubly linked the freedom of each Portuguese citizen to active solidarity with all the peoples of the world.79.	The centuries when Portugal experienced this solidarity beyond the seas and the continents are lost in time. Today the ambiguities of history are left behind and my country lives its daily life in its own place and time  and it is there that it tries out and builds its part of the new world solidarity which is still being formed. It is therefore not surprising that one of its contemporary poets should thus express metaphorically the links which bind the Portuguese people to the rest of man-kind. Allow me  in conclusion  to read the following poem as a testimony of our feelings:""The sun illuminates my village from several different angles. A new angle brings a new idea  other degrees bring other reasons. For the men of my village are numbered in hundreds of millions. My village is the whole world. The whole world belongs to me. That is where I meet and mingle with people from everywhere for I belong to the whole world."""
"110",5786,"PRY",34,1979,"ï»¿This thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly will have the singular privilege tomorrow of receiving His Holiness John Paul II and hearing his solemn statement in this forum dedicated to achieving peace and to maintaining and strengthening it among all peoples of the earth  whatever the political  ethnic or religious characteristics of the nations which constitute the Organization.173.	Therefore  on the eve of such a solemn and exceptional event  the delegation of Paraguay associates itself with the expectations and hopes aroused among us all by the presence of the Supreme Pontiff. On behalf of the people and Government of my country  we offer to the Pope the respectful tribute of Paraguay  which remains faithful to the traditions of Christianity and its doctrines as an expression of a way of life which is in accordance with the innermost requirements of our national entity.174.	It is true that the panorama offered by today's world is not encouraging  for it is engaged as never before in confrontations of every kind and on different scales both within and outside national boundaries. In spite of that  our inescapable mission is to preserve peace  going beyond its purely intangible moral values to the dialogue that is necessary to ensure at least a minimum of civilized coexistence. We wish for a peace built on the dignity of man  and we therefore categorically reject any system which constitutes a barrier to freedom.175.	Thus  Paraguay does not admit the Communist philosophy of life  nor does it allow it to be preached within our territory. We are combating the Marxist doctrine  exercising the right of our own national self- preservation  and we repudiate its atheistic and materialistic concept of human life.176.	In this respect  my country maintains a single and unswerving line of conduct. After many decades of political anarchy  of destruction of the public and private economy and of the downgrading of our civil and democratic values  Paraguay  under the serene and patriotic guidance of President Alfredo Stroessner  and with the support of the powerful political force of the Colorado Party  has succeeded in channelling the march of the nation of Paraguay along the paths of stability and prosperity.177.	We practise a form of government which is in accordance with the temperament  the vocation and the very nature of the people of Paraguay and we believe that every political community has not only the right but the duty to provide itself with the institutions suited to its particular characteristics.178.	In accordance with this line of thinking  we view with concern the attitude of certain Governments which practise interference in internal affairs which are exclusively within the competence and responsibility of other States. The affirmation  management and solution of its own national problems are matters exclusively within the sovereignty of the nation itself. However  it so happens that  invoking the principle of the defence of human rights  some would from abroad dictate to other Governments rules of conduct in specific cases  even going so far as to invade the area of order and internal security. Some even make so bold as to pass judgements and express opinions regarding measures or solutions which should be adopted only by those who are vested with the authority of the will of the people  by those who have acquired the necessary experience to confront local situations and by those who have taken on the unavoidable responsibility of preserving the principles and the substantive assets of each nation.179.	Paraguay does not accept  nor will it accept  such interference  which at the level of bilateral relations is at variance with the mutual respect which members of the great international family owe one another.180.	The pluralistic political regime of Paraguay is a living and permanent reality. Both in the national Parliament  consisting of the Chamber of Senators and the Chamber of Deputies  and in the municipal councils of all the main municipalities of the country  the opposition is represented by political parties.181.	We are absolutely true to the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States  and we strictly respect the self-determination of peoples. This attitude is not new  nor is it due to circumstances of the moment. It derives from our distant past  and has its unshakeable roots in the very history of Paraguay  which in the last century fought heroically in an exhausting five-year war to maintain intact the principle of what was then called the ""policy of balance""  and which in modern terminology is exactly what we now call the self-determination of peoples.182.	The Government of Paraguay does not judge  either publicly or through diplomatic channels  the internal policies of other States. Nor does it by either of those means allow itself to give its views on matters or events which are related to the sovereignty of or political leadership displayed by other Governments.183.	Nor do we acknowledge didactic leadership ac-cording to which other Governments  or those who arrogate their representation to themselves  dictate rules to us for exercising public authority. It must be known that for us the only sovereign in this matter is the people of Paraguay. By the only valid means  namely the ballot box  and by an overwhelming majority  that people has placed its destiny in the hands of those who now legitimately represent them. I am proud to say that Paraguay can boast of its people  who are dignified and noble  and who from the very first hours of their existence have given exceptional proof of their qualities as well as of their courage in defending the values for which the fearless struggle goes on in what we call ""Western civilization"".184.	Since it is impossible  because of the time available  to dwell on other items which also offer much food for thought  and which are on the agenda of this session  I should like to report on the situation of my country with regard to a subject which is of general interest and concern.185.	There is no doubt that shadows will loom over the future of the world because of a growing difficulty in obtaining two essentials for the well-being and progress of mankind: energy and food. With almost absolute certainty  this difficulty will bring about a substantial change in the economy of many countries by reversing relations which today seem to be logical and even unchangeable. I am pleased to point out  in view of this prospect  which in one way or another will affect the vast majority of the community of nations  that my country  Paraguay  will certainly be an exception.186.	At this time  Paraguay lacks known sources of hydrocarbons or mineral carbon  but  on the other hand  we have an abundant source of water power with special characteristics  such as its considerable magnitude  and the fact that the ownership of this source is shared by two of our neighbours  Argentina and Brazil. This singular circumstance  far from having placed us at a disadvantage  has  on the contrary  become a factor in our favour  since the difference in the volume of the economies of my country and those of the neighbours I have mentioned  will for some time be converted into profits from the export of energy  until Paraguay  which is in a process of accelerated development  can  in turn  make capital investments to use its share of the potential energy.187.	I believe it would be of interest to this Assembly to know of the guiding ideas which inspired the building of the hydroelectric stations which my country has undertaken with the Federative Republic of Brazil  and with the Republic of Argentina on the River Parana  on a mixed or binational enterprise basis  with full parity in their co-ownership. With Brazil  we are building the hydroelectric station at Itaipu  which will produce 70 billion kilowatt-hours  thus placing it at the head of the largest enterprises in the world in this field. And  likewise with Argentina  we are already in the initial phase of complete execution of another hydroelectric station  Yacyreta. That station will produce 18 billion kilowatt-hours per year  which  likewise  places it in the forefront among the major world utilities. Furthermore  an understanding between my country  Argentina and Brazil  which has just been concluded  will make it possible on that selfsame Parana river to build another hydroelectric station with a yearly production of the same order as the one at Yacyreta to which I have referred.188.	The political and economic philosophy underlying these undertakings is based on the assumption that the energy produced will be distributed equally between the two partnersâParaguay and Brazil  or Paraguay and Argentina as the case may be. In exchange for the difference between our energy consumption and half the total energy producedâto which initially each of the partners is entitledâmy country will receive an adequate compensation until we ourselves find it necessary to review this difference.189.	I wish to emphasize  as a tribute to the spirit of understanding and perfect equality which prevails over the technical and diplomatic negotiations between my country and Argentina and Brazil  that the Paraguayan firms participating in the realization of these monumental construction tasks have demonstrated a high degree of efficiency which made it possible for countries at different economic levels to associate for enterprises of mutual benefit in conditions of reasonable equity. There has also been a sense of balance which fully reflects the atmosphere of peace and friendship which prevails in the region in which we live: the vast area of the basin of the River Plate  one of the prime areas of the world because of its social and political configuration as an inexhaustible source of economic possibilities.190.	I would like to stress that  in addition to the vast volume of energy from renewable resources  such as hydroelectric energy  which does not have the problems connected with mineral or atomic production and its technology  and which very shortly will be available to Paraguay  we have the privileged condition of a fertile territory  which in my country can produce food over almost its entire area.191.	In turn  the possibility of using electric power to produce fertilizers will raise the capacity of Paraguay to produce food-stuffs to a high level  thus transforming my country into a major centre of world interest in view of the acute and anxious problem of world food.192.	Aware of its historic responsibility and its commitment to the present generation  the Government of President Stroessner is devoting all its efforts to place my country in the privileged situation it occupied in its early history and which it earned through the dignity of its people and because of its brilliant history.193.	We have suffered much misfortune  due mainly to- international wars and attacks against our sovereignty and independence. The hard lesson of the past has strengthened us in our resolve to be steadfast in the face of any attempt at foreign interference  under whatever emblem by whatever method  from whatever origin or whatever arguments may be made use of to try to justify it.194.	My country is open to all men of goodwill who wish to see with their own eyes and with an open mind the atmosphere of peace  democracy and freedom in which we are developing our republican institutions  which are the basis of our confidence in a brilliant future which we wish to share with the sister nations of America and with the other nations which  with us  profess their faith in better days for mankind.195.	I wish to end this statement by reiterating the pleasure with which Paraguay  its people and Government  note today  1 October  the celebration of an auspicious event: the coming into force of the Panama Canal Treaty. I congratulate you  Mr. President  your noble country of Panama and its Government  for defending the rights of your country so tenaciously and with such dignity.196.	This is an obvious and happy sign of a better understanding among the Americas  the one in the north and the one in the south  called upon to agree on the level of absolute unqualified respect and without blameworthy ignorance.197.	Paraguay would not wish America to succumb to a suicidal confusion of concepts  but would rather that  with God's help  ""government of the people  by the people  and for the people  shall not perish from the earth""."
"111",5851,"QAT",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  my delegation is pleased to extend its warm congratulations to you on your election to preside over the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are confident thatâthanks to your rich experience derived from long years of diplomatic activity in the United Nations and manifested particularly in your chairmanship of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoplesâyour election to this high post will help this session achieve the success hoped for by the international community.2.	It is also a pleasure for my delegation to express its full appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for the wisdom and dedication he demonstrated in directing the debates of the last session.3.	I should like to take this opportunity to commend the ceaseless  effective and faithful efforts being made by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in the interests of world security and peace  and in order to achieve the purposes of the United Nations Charter.4.	We are pleased also to extend our warm congratulations to the Government and people of Saint Lucia on the admission of that State to membership in the United Nations.5.	It is extremely painful to noteâwithout effort and at a glanceâas we start this thirty-fourth session that its agenda constitutes  in large part if not in its entirety  a heavy inheritance which is being handed down from one session to another. But  however marked this phenomenon may be  it cannot gainsay the fact that an effort is being madeâsometimes modest and sometimes outstandingâin the arena of international action and under the auspices of the United Nations. It proves  if it proves anything  the existence of a deep chasm between words and actions. Tangible evidence  this history of deferring issues and questions from one session to the next  and the evidence of General Assembly resolutions have shown that the will of the peoples of the developing countries cannot express itself unless it is compatible with the will of one of the super-Powers. And even if this will of peoples  which is represented by the majority of the Members of the United Nations  could meet this prerequisite  the traditional rivalry between the two major Powers usually leads to attempts by them to embarrass one another  even if this is at the expense of the third-world peoples and countries. This situation has pushed the battlefields of the cold war to the arena of the developing and newly independent countries or those countries still under colonization. Unfortunately  this has resulted in the stalemate which usually faces international problems even when they are tractable. Because we do not want the United Nations to resign itself to the futility which some people are trying to impose on it  and because we are eager to bolster the United Nations Charter and to achieve its noble objectives  we will not allow despair to infiltrate our hearts but will continue to raise and discuss the chronic and old issues and questions with the same enthusiasm  diligence and vigilance with which we address the heated new questions  so that no deluded person  no arrogant aggressor  might think that issues affecting people and nations can be dropped with the passing of time.6. We face today what may be the oldest and most complicated international problem in modern history: the Palestine question. This problem  unlike other problems menacing international peace and security  is  after more than 30 years  more urgent and a greater threat to international security  than ever. Moreover  also unlike other problems of concern to the world conscience  it is characterized by its tragic human dimension. History has witnessed many examples of one country committing an act of aggression against another in order to colonize it. It has also witnessed the more tragic example of the European colonialists attempting to settle in African countries as self-appointed masters over the indigenous people of those countries. But never until now has it witnessed a single incident in which a foreign colonialist emptied a whole country of its indigenous population in order to build its own detestable racist society on their land  as has been done by the world Zionist movement in Palestine. But over the past three decades  since the partition resolution of 1947  the world has seen how the Zionist enemy's greed has devoured the Palestinian lands piece by piece. And when it realized that that enemy's appetite was insatiable  it turned to Arab countries bordering on Palestine and launched its treacherous aggression of 5 June 1967 to occupy territory of Egypt  Syria and both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In this way a new dimension was added to the Palestine question  which has become known as the Middle East problem. From then on  the international community has unanimously agreed that the Palestinian question is the core of the Middle East problem  because the usurpation of Palestine and of the rights of the Palestinian Arab people was the original crime commit-ted by the Zionist aggressor  followed by a series of other crimes.7.	The Secretary-General of the United Nations  in his report on the work of the Organization  emphasized that the Middle East situation:"" . . .is central to the political  economic and military stability of the world. As long as uncertainty  discord  frustration and violence prevail in the Middle East  the world will continue to live with a profoundly destabilizing element in its affairs and with a grave and continuing risk of future disaster."" 8.	The determination of the people of Palestine under the leadership of its sole authentic representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  to decide their own future and to pursue their struggles  and the support given to the just struggle of the Palestinians by all peoples and countries that love peace and justice  have led to diplomatic and political victories. The Arab Summit Conferences and the Islamic Conference and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and conferences of the non-aligned movement reaffirmed that the PLO is the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. This brought to an end all attempts made within and outside the region to impose partial solutions upon the Middle East region and to all that those attempts implied  namely the division of Arab ranks and the dealing of a blow to the Palestinian revolution. The conferences also emphasized the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State.9.	The decision taken by the Israeli Cabinet on 16 September 1979  allowing Israelis to buy land and property in the West Bank area  including Arab Jerusalem  is the latest round in the Zionist challenge to world public opinion  to the resolutions of the United Nations and to the principles of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949.10.	The State of Qatar  in fulfilment of what was unanimously agreed upon by the Arabs and in the resolutions of Arab Summit Conferences  particularly those of Algiers in 1974  Rabat in 1974 and Baghdad in 1978  and in accordance with the international community's stand  as reflected in the resolutions of the United Nations and the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  reaffirms that any peaceful  just and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict should be based on the following main principles: first  the total withdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied by force in 1967  including Arab Jerusalem; secondly  the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the exercise of their legitimate rights to self-determination  independence and sovereignty in Palestine  their homeland; thirdly  the right of the PLO  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  to participate as an independent and equal partner in all international conferences  activities and international forums concerned with the Palestinian question and the Middle East dispute  which means that no other party may have the right to speak on behalf of the Palestinian people; and fourthly  the invalidity of all agreements pertaining to the Palestinian question unless the PLO  as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  is a principal partner to them  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 33/28 A. Hence  the implications of the Camp David agreements  which are considered by the Government of Qatar as a violation of the Charter of the League of Arab States  international legitimacy and the resolutions of the United Nations in relation to the Palestine question and the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories  should be declared null and void. Furthermore  these agreements ignored the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish their independent State in Palestine  and also completely ignored the question of occupied Arab Jerusalem.11.	The State of Qatar condemns the continuing Israeli aggression against Lebanese territory. The State of Qatar condemns Israel's continuing violation of the sovereignty and integrity of this Arab country. As we have emphasized  the Israeli involvement in Lebanese internal affairs increases the potentialities of an explosion of the Middle East situation. World public opinion is not unaware of the fact that the victims of the recur-rent atrocious Israeli hostilities in southern Lebanon are always unarmed civilians  including innocent old people  women and children.12.	While the thirty-third session of the General Assembly declared the year 1979 as the International Year of Solidarity with the People of Namibia in their just struggle under the leadership of their sole representative  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  Pretoria's racist regime stepped up its war of annihilation against the indigenous people of that country  who are striving for self- determination. While the United Nations seeks to achieve a just settlement according to Security Council resolutions 385 (1976)  431 (1978) and 432 (1978)  the Pretoria regime has attempted to thwart the transfer of power along the lines of Ian Smith's experience in Rhodesia by unilaterally declaring independence. This colonialist plot was recently manifested in the attempt by South Africa  which was denounced by the Security Council on 21 September last  to give sham independence to the tribal homeland ""Venda""  following ""Transkei"" and ""Bophuthatswana""  which were not recognized by the international community.13.	Thus the Government of Qatar affirms its full sup-port of the struggle of the African people who are still suffering under the yoke of colonial occupation and from racial discrimination and apartheid  as well as its support of the legitimate struggle of these people for the liberation of their countries  the attainment of their national rights and the restoration of their freedom  independence and sovereignty in their territory. It also emphasizes its solidarity with SWAPO  the sole legitimate representative of the Namibian people  and requests the United Nations  especially the Security Council  to impose the strictest sanctions against the racist regime of South Africa  including implementation of the measures stipulated in Chapter VII of the Charter.â14.	My delegation also affirms its full support of the struggle of the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe and declares that it upholds the United Nations resolutions concerning Zimbabwe  particularly General Assembly resolution 33/38  which condemns the continuing support extended to the minority regime of Salisbury by South Africa  some Western Governments and Israel.15.	We also support all the efforts and good offices of the Secretary-General aimed at achieving the unity of the Cypriot people and at safeguarding the territorial integrity of Cyprus and promoting its non-alignment.16.	The consolidation of the pillars of peace on earth is  undoubtedly  the noble goal which we all seek to achieve  both on the individual level within each State Member of the United Nations and on the level of collective action within this Organization. However  there are material realities and international political variablesâsuch as the so-called nuclear balance of terror and the super-Power rivalry for the development  possession and stockpiling of both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction which sow death in successive generationsâthat make this goal one of the most important tasks of the United Nations. Despite all the attempts to achieve international detente  and the signing of the agreements reached following the first and second rounds of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] by the two super-Powers  mankind is still threatened by nuclear war because we have failed so far within the United Nations to solve the major international problems which involve a potential military confrontation between the two poles of nuclear terror. In addition  regional conflicts  which are often either vestiges of colonialism or covert concoctions of foreign elements  force the developing countries to waste their material resources on armaments instead of using them in the fields of economic and social development  in order to raise the standard of living of their people. For all these reasons  my delegation supports the call for convening a world conference on disarmament and joins those who call for the adoption of all effective measures to protect the non-nuclear States from the threat of the use of nuclear weapons  especially nuclear blackmail  which is practised by both the Zionist entity and Pretoria's racist regime.17.	My delegation also stresses the importance of dis-cussing the item ""Israeli nuclear armament""  as was proposed by Iraq and supported by the Arab group of States  because of its possible implications for the security and peace of the Middle East.18.	The State of Qatar supports the proposal to declare the Middle East a nuclear-free zone and appeals to all parties concerned to implement such a declaration and to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It also emphasizes the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  and the ending of the escalation and expansion of super-Power military presence in the Indian Ocean in the context of their rivalry  with a view to its eventual elimination. It is regrettable that  as a result of the developments which threaten to extend the arms race to the Indian Ocean  and the rivalry of the superpowers to establish their military presence  which increases tension in the area and endangers international peace and security  this Declaration has not been implemented.19.	Since the sixth special session of the General Assembly adopted its Declaration in which the international community proclaimed its determination to work for the establishment of a new international economic order based on equality  interdependence  common interest and co-operation among all States  the world has witnessed intensive activity aimed at the achievement of this urgent goal  to which the third-world countries  in particular  aspire within the framework of the so-called North-South dialogue and various other international conferences on international economic problems  the most recent of which was the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held recently in Havana.20.	It is regrettable that  because of the lack of political will on the part of the developed countries to respond to the just aspirations of the developing countriesâespecially the most affected and least developed among themâthe negotiations being held between developed and developing countries"" concerning the infrastructure of the new international economic order have yet to yield any positive or concrete results. Therefore  the Government of Qatar expresses its disappointment and deep concern over the failure to achieve any substantial progress at the fifth session of UNCTAD  which was held in Manila last May â a failure which was due to the negative attitude of the developed countries  their unwillingness to discharge their responsibilities  and their lack of political will regarding the transfer of technology to the developing countries.21.	The State of Qatar appeals to the international community  especially the industrialized countries  to provide other sources of energy to replace oil after its depletion  and urges the major industrialized countries to economize on its use as a source of energy and to conserve it for purposes more beneficial to mankind and its future than burning it as a fuel. In this context  the State of Qatar urges the international community to regard the petrochemical industries objectively as a substitute for certain agricultural and livestock products which have begun to be in short supply as a result of the massive population increase in some parts of the world  and appeals to it to find the means to transfer technology in this and other fields and to strive to distribute these industries among various parts of the world in a way that will ensure the equity of the distribution of wealth among the people of the world  rather than its concentration in a certain country where it is controlled by abominable monopolies.22.	The State of Qatar again emphasizes the right of all nations to enjoy full and constant sovereignty over their natural resources and all their economic activities  and its rejection of any threats to use force or to intervene in the internal affairs of any country in any way. It also emphasizes respect for the territorial integrity and the political independence of all nations.23.	The tasks entrusted to the international community are great and significant ones. The peoples of the world are looking forward with great interest and concern to the practical results of our deliberations aimed at fulfilling the broad aspirations of our peoples. Therefore I hope that the resolutions and recommendations of this session will mark a new turning-point in the achievement of our goals."
"112",5897,"ROU",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  on the occasion of your election as President of this important forum of States of the world  I have the pleasure to extend my congratulations to you  the representative of the United Republic of Tanzania  a country with which Romania maintains relations of close friendship and co-operation.2.	Romania is taking part in this session in the determination to contribute  along with other States  to the debate and to the adoption of just and lasting solutions to the problems which beset mankind in the interests of strengthening peace  detente  understanding and international co-operation.3.	We bring to this forum a message of peace and co-operation from the Romanian people  who are celebrating this year the thirty-fifth anniversary of their revolution of anti-Fascist and anti-imperialist social and national liberation  which was an event of epoch-making importance for our people's destiny and which has opened the way to the democratic and socialist development of Romania. The progress achieved over this period in the many-sided development of our country and in the raising of the material and the intellectual standards of all our people is eloquent proof of the creative capacity of a nation liberated from exploitation and foreign domination  a nation which has committed all its resources to the achievement of profound revolutionary changes  the supreme purpose of which is the full assertion of the human personality.4.	Romania's foreign policy  which is an integral part of this vast work of construction  is consequently dedicated to the goals of peace  security  co-operation and progress and to the establishment of new international relations based on equality and mutual respect  and is aimed at ensuring favourable conditions for the development and prosperity of all peoples.5.	Romania constantly places in the forefront of its international activities the development of friendship  solidarity and co-operation with all socialist countries  At the same time Romania is developing its many-sided co-operation with the developing and non-aligned countries and is expanding its relations with all States of the world regardless of their social system and is taking an active part in the international division of labour and world exchange of goods and assets.6.	The decisive role in the elaboration and promotion  of the foreign policy of my country and in the broad and dynamic development of its international relations falls to the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania  Nicolae Ceaugescu  who is persevering in his activities in the service of the cause of freedom and independence  and of security and co-operation among peoples.7.	The international relations of socialist Romania form part of the universal process of the free and independent affirmation of the nations on the world scene  and constitute a contribution of the promotion of the policy of detente  understanding and equal cooperation among all the States of the world. All the international activities of the country are based on a new concept of the foundations of peace  on the strict observance  in the relations among States  of the principles of national independence and sovereignty  equality of rights and non-interference in internal affairs  mutual advantage and the non-use of force or the threat of force. These principles are the corner-stone of the establishment of a climate favourable to mutual confidence and respect and to peaceful co-operation among peoples.8.	In its approach to the complex problems of international life  Romania is basing itself on current realities  on the fact that vast new transformations of ail economic  social and political nature are taking place in the world  as are profound changes in the global balance of forces. The will of peoples to put an end once and for all to imperialist  colonialist and neo-colonialist policies and to all forms of domination and oppression is becoming more and more manifest  as is the determination of peoples to be the master of their own national resources  to choose the path of their social and economic development without any outside interference  and to live in peace  security  friendship  understanding and co-operation. At the same time  international life is being adversely affected by a generalized sharpening of economic  national  social and political contradictions  by an intensification of the struggle for a hew division of the world into spheres and zones of influence. These disquieting developments are aggravated by crisis conditions in the fields of raw materials and energy  the acceleration of the arms race  the maintenance and widening of economic gaps  by the revival of old policies of force and diktat and of interference in the affairs of other peoples. All this serves only to increase tension in international life  to create a climate of concern and insecurity  to create grave dangers to peace and to threaten the national independence and sovereignty of States  in particular of small and medium-size States  while impeding the economic and social progress of all peoples.9.	In the circumstances  a guarantee of the independence and sovereignty of every country and of the sacred right of each people to decide freely and independently its destiny  without any interference  coercion or aggression  is an essential requirement of contemporary life. The facts of international life have shown that every violation of the sovereignty and national independence of peoples causes serious harm not only to the peoples concerned but also to the interests and to the yearning of all nations for peace  confidence and security. Strict observance of international law  of the sovereign rights of each people to be the sole masters in their own country  is today a. sine qua non for the establishment of an atmosphere of genuine international detente and of a relationship of trust and fruitful and peaceful co-operation among all States. Romania believes that it is necessary for all socialist countries and all the developing and non-aligned countries and all States of the world to strive for the elimination from international life of all forms of interference in the affairs of others and of all forms of domination or claim to domination. They should do so by giving pride of place to the principle of freedom and independence for all nations and of the sacred right of every people to determine for itself the course of its social  economic and political development. We firmly believe that it is in the power of States and Governments  on the basis of the aspirations of the peoples and the pressing need to strengthen peace  detente and security  to create the conditions necessary for a constructive settlement of the problems confronting mankind. In so doing they would bring about a drastic shift towards a new pattern of international relations consistent with the requirements of historical progress.10.	Of decisive importance in this respect is the total abolition of the policy of the use or threat of use of force  the elimination of any interference or pressure and the final renunciation of the use of military instruments in relations between States. The particular urgency of this goal is of vital importance for the peaceful future of mankind  and this was recently stressed with the utmost clarity by the President of Romania  when he said:""In view of the fact that there are many complex problems in the world  that the long imperialist and colonialist domination generated many disputes and conflicts and left them unresolved  we declare ourselves firmly in favour of the solution of all problems between States solely by means of negotiations between the interested parties and for the complete renunciation of the use of military force or the threat of force. This is in keeping both with the interests of the peoples concerned and with those of all peoples and the cause of international peace and cooperation1'.11.	More recent developments have confirmed that when the path of negotiation  of direct contacts  has been chosen  it has been possible to find mutually acceptable solutions of the thorniest problems  or at least to achieve an easing of tension. In actual fact  recourse to force has never led to the settlement of a conflict between States  but has always caused serious loss of human life and material damage  has poisoned the international climate and has created grave dangers to peace in the regions in question and throughout the world.12.	The use of force is in fact the most brutal violation of the elementary principles of international law and constitutes a defiance of the Charter of the United Nations and of the conscience of mankind  and hence it must be eradicated finally and completely from the practice of relations between States. We believe that nothing can justify recourse to force or the threat of force  in any form whatsoever  still less armed intervention in the internal affairs of other States.13.	The attempt to settle disputes by means of military intervention or by the use of force is typical of the old imperialist policy  which was based on the right of the strong against the weak  on the violation of the principles of international legality  on the defiance of the principles of justice and of the sacred rights of peoples to freedom and national independence. The path of force and armed aggression constitutes a grave anachronism in our day that must be totally eradicated from international life if we really want to establish a world of justice and equity on this planet.14.	In the light of the close interdependence of the world today and the most complex circumstances of the present international situation  recourse to force in any area of the globe and the outbreak of military clashes and conflicts are likely to jeopardize not only the tranquillity  security and life of the peoples concerned  but also the peace and security of the whole world. The facts are such that the slightest spark can lead to a tremendous conflagration capable of engulfing mankind in a new world cataclysm. That is why all peoples  all mankind  have a vital interest in the final abolition of military action as a means of settling disputes and in the solving of all disputes and outstanding problems that may exist between States exclusively by peaceful  political negotiations. Experience has shown that there are no problems  no matter how complex  which cannot be solved if reason prevails and if there is forthcoming a sense of responsibility for the tranquillity and security of peoples and for the general cause of human progress  of international peace and detente.15.	In proposing the inclusion in the agenda of this session of an item entitled ""Settlement by peaceful means of disputes between Statesââ  Romania has based itself precisely on the need to focus attention and mobilize the efforts of Governments  public opinion and all peoples on these problems vital for the peace of the world. We are convinced that a thorough debate of this proposed item will lead to a clearer identification and utilization of the possibilities provided by the United Nations and its Charter to act more vigorously and more effectively in the prevention and settlement of disputes and conflicts between States  on a just and lasting basis. In this regard  it is our belief that it would be of the utmost importance to agree on the drafting of a General Assembly declaration on the peaceful settlement of disputes  as a first step towards the conclusion of a treaty on the subject.16.	Romania  as it has already pointed out on other occasions in this world forum  also considers that the idea of setting up a permanent commission of the General Assembly for good offices and conciliation is as topical as ever. The establishment of such a commission  which would not act independently but  rather in close connexion with the Security Council  would provide our Organization with an effective instrument for the better implementation of its role with regard to the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security.17.	Romania stands ready for consultations and active co-operation with all other States in order to ensure that the consideration of this item results in the adoption of measures which would lead to an increased capacity of the United Nations to fulfil its important prerogatives of contributing to the just and equitable settlement of disputes  on the basis of respect for the legitimate interests of each people  of peace  good understanding and international co-operation. We trust that the delegations participating in this session will take account of the importance of the intensification of efforts to settle all international problems by negotiations and will bring their valuable and indispensable contributions to bear in ensuring a thorough examination of the proposed item  and to finalizing it with results which would respond to the common interests of all States and the expectations of peoples.18.	Romania  as a European country  naturally places among its main preoccupations the strengthening of security  peace and co-operation among the European States. Although certain positive steps have been taken in the right direction in the relations among the States which signed the Final Act of Helsinki  nevertheless we note with concern that the feverish arms race continues  that huge quantities of ever-more destructive weapons are being accumulated on our continent  that foreign troops and military bases are still present on the territories of many European States  and that it is in Europe that the two opposed military blocs  heavily armed  face each other.19.	Therefore  we consider that it is of utmost importance to start without delay a sustained effort for the thorough preparation of the Conference's second review session  to be held at Madrid in 1980  which is aimed at accelerating the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act and at giving further impetus to the process begun by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. To this end  Romania is determined to continue broad and detailed consultations with all States participating in the Conference. Furthermore  we are of the view that the organization of a multilateral consultative meeting  with the participation of all States signatories of the Final Act  for a broad exchange of information and opinions concerning the substantive problems of the Madrid meeting  would contribute effectively to the adequate preparation of that meeting and to a better understanding of the positions and preoccupations of the participating States. It would help also in the definition and selection in advance of the main problems and in their constructive consideration.20.	It would be of particular importance for the success of the Madrid meetingâas has been pointed out in a series of consultations which have taken place so farâfor it to be held at the Foreign Ministers level.21.	Such an approach to the preparation and ordering of the coming Madrid meeting will create propitious conditions for the adoption of concrete measures concerning the wide and unrestricted development of economic  scientific and cultural co-operation  and  in particular  concerning military disengagement and disarmament  without which the strengthening of peace and detente and the establishment of genuine security cannot be conceived.22.	Since the military budgets of the States participating in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe represent a large part of world military expenditure  agreement on practical measures of disarmament on the continent not only would have great importance for the European States  but also would constitute a substantive contribution to the promotion of the cause of disarmament  security and peace throughout the planet.23.	To bring about disarmament  and primarily nuclear disarmament  has become a vital need of all mankind. The ceaseless accumulations of armaments and the race in the development of new types of weapons of ever-growing destructive power have reached levels which cannot be justified. They far exceed the defence needs of the respective States and have increasingly become a factor of insecurity for all nations and a direct threat to the independence and free development of peoples and to the destiny of peace and civilization.24.	The size of military expenditures  the huge wastage of fuel and raw materials and the squandering of an immense scientific potential for destructive purposes all contribute directly to the aggravation of the phenomena of economic crises  to the widening of gaps and to the perpetuation of underdevelopment  and all these factors are felt as a growing burden by all the peoples of the world.25.	At present it is necessary as an objective of the utmost urgency and importance to concert the efforts of all States in order to ensure the cessation of the armaments race and the transition  without further delay  to the adoption and implementation of effective measures for disarmament  primarily nuclear disarmament.26.	Romania considers that the conclusion of the Treaty resulting from the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] between the USSR and the United States  together with its ratification  constitutes an event of political importance in international life  a positive step that could open the way for disarmament measures with the participation of all States.27.	Romania stands also for the cessation of the production and further improvement of nuclear weapons; for the destruction of existing stockpiles and for the outlawing of these weapons. Measures to be taken in this area should in no way diminish the access of all States to the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The balance  the guarantee of equal security for all States  should be brought about not by an increase in armaments  but by a reduction.28.	Being firmly in favour of the cessation of the arms race and of the organized transition to a reduction in military budgets  arms and armed forces  Romania considers that a priority measure  for which the United Nations should work more determinedly  is the freezing and reduction of military expenditures by 10 per cent to 15 per cent in the initial stage. The funds so released could be used both for the progress of each country and to assist developing countries. In this respect Romania will submit appropriate proposals to the General Assembly at this current session.29.	My country supports the adoption of measures to strengthen coexistence among States and to reduce tension and conflicts. We have in mind the withdrawal of foreign troops  the dismantling of military bases installed on the territories of other States and the reduction of the military activities of blocs and the liquidation of such blocs. We attach particular importance to the promotion by all States of mutual relations of good neighbourliness  understanding and co-operation at regional levels and we will submit to the General Assembly a draft resolution on the development of relations of good neighbourliness among States.30.	Romania is working for the development of cooperation among Balkan States  for the intensification of their bilateral and multilateral collaboration  for the peaceful settlement of existing disputes and for the transformation of that region into a zone of peace and good neighbourliness  free from nuclear weapons  as an element of security and co-operation in Europe.31.	In its concept of the establishment of lasting peace and real security Romania includes  along with the cardinal problem of disarmament  the increasingly acute problem of erasing under-development and the anachronistic division of the world into rich and poor countriesâthe bringing about of the new international economic order.32.	Mankind can no longer ignore a situation in which almost two thirds of the world's population lives in conditions of under-development as a consequence of a long period of colonial exploitation and the perpetuation of unequal relations which enables the few rich to accumulate even more wealth while the poor become poorer. It is unacceptable that there should be hundreds of millions of human beings suffering from hunger  malnutrition  disease and poverty  prey to ignorance and isolated from all the achievements of civilization  while the great explosion of the scientific and technical revolution is placing at the disposal of mankind new means of mastering nature and improving the environment and life on our planet. Such a state of affairs defies the most elementary ideals of justice  equality and humanity  and this cannot but constitute a grave factor for tension and serve to generate profound contradictions in international life  as well as impeding the progress of all mankind. It is obvious that we cannot speak of political and economic stability  of peace or progress unless this situation is adequately solved within a short period of time  and unless means are found to assist energetically the eradication of under-development through the strenuous efforts of each country  as well as through a more active assistance by developed countries and by establishing new economic relations based upon equality and equity.33.	In spite of the resolutions and recommendations adopted by the United Nations  and in spite of the persevering efforts of the developing countries  the negotiations that have taken place so far  including those at the fifth session of UNCTAD  have not been marked by any significant progress  primarily as a result of the position of the developed countries. At the same time  the economic inequalities among States have become more acute  and the economic and financial difficulties of the developing countries have increased  primarily as a consequence of the economic  raw material and energy crises.34.	In view of the great importance we attach to the international framework which should ensure the support of the developing countries and to the crystallizing of political measures for the establishment of a new international economic order based on equality and equity  Romania considers that the special session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1980 has a special role to play. Romania attaches great importance also to thorough preparation for that session so that it may mark a turning-point in the adoption of practical measures towards the eradication of underdevelopment  ensuring the more rapid progress of the developing countries and promoting the establishment of a new international economic order.35.	It goes without saying that  in the eradication of under-development  the intensification by the developing countries of their own efforts  and the mobilization and full deployment of their human and material resources  is essential. At the same time  the strengthening of solidarity and co-operation among the developing countries  both for their economic and social development and in their negotiations with developed countries to enable them to reach solutions which will ensure the more rapid progress of the developing countries and contribute to the achievement of general economic development and stability  is of great importance.36.	International action aimed at the development of agriculture  industry  communications  free access to modern technology  the regulation of the activities of multinational corporations in developing countries  and increasing the flow of financial resources and technical assistance to those countriesâall these have a very important role to play.37.	In order to facilitate broad access by all countries to the achievements of advanced science and technology  the Assembly should at this session adopt appropriate measures for implementing the decisions of the recent United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development.38.	Within the context of the settlement of international economic problems  priority attention should be given to the conclusion of an agreement  with the participation of the developing countries  the oil-producing countries and the industrialized nations  to establish balanced relations in the pricing of oil and other sources of energy  raw materials  manufactured goods and food products. Such agreements should ensure stability and price control in order to avoid chaos and disorganization  which is damaging to all States  particularly the non-oil-producing developing countries. It is only through such means of negotiation and agreementsâ and not through recourse to forceâthat one can bring about a solution that will promote the stability of the world economy in the interest of all peoples in the light of the grave economic problems confronting mankind.39.	In the circumstances of the increasingly close interdependence which characterizes contemporary developments  support for the developing countries  the achievement of substantial progress in building a new international economic order  and the establishment of new international co-operation based on equality and mutual advantage are in the interests of all States  including the developed nations  and of peace and world economic stability.40.	As a developing socialist State  Romania is determined to spare no effort to these ends  working together with the other States members of the Group of 77  and with all States of the world.41.	There is profound concern over the continued existence  in various parts of the world  of tension and conflict and of armed confrontation between States  which endangers general peace and security. Romania is firmly convinced that in the present international situation there is a real possibility of replacing force by reason and by respect and concern for the rights and interests of each nation.42.	It is in this spirit that Romania supports solution of the Cyprus problem by political means on the basis of respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus  while ensuring the peaceful coexistence of the two Cypriot communities.43.	The present situation in the Middle East requires an intensification of efforts at a comprehensive solution of the conflict by political means for the attainment of a just and lasting peace  which should lead to Israel's withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied in 1967  the implementation of the Palestinian people's right to self-determinationâwhich includes the establishment of their own independent Stateâand the ensuring of the independence and sovereignty of all States of the region.44.	The recognition of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination  including the creation of their own independent State  constitutes the core of the problem  Upon which a just and lasting solution of this conflict depends. The interests of peace require the convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices  with the participation of all concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization [FLO]  as well as the two Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle Eastâthe Soviet Union and the United States. We must also put an end to the military actions against Lebanon to ensure that country's integrity and independence  as well as the achievement of national reconciliation which would make possible its independent  democratic development.45.	Romania supports the constructive initiatives and proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful  independent and democratic reunification of Korea and for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the peninsula  such action being in the interests of the Korean nation and of peace and stability in Asia and the whole world.46.	Romania wishes to declare its active solidarity with and to lend its full supportâpolitical  diplomatic  moral and materialâto  the just struggles of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe for their national independence. We stand firmly and militantly in favour of the total elimination of the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid in South Africa and condemn the attacks committed by the racist regimes against the front-line States. The meetings and fruitful discussions held by President Nicolae Ceausescu with the leaders of the front-line States  the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAFO]  the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe and the African National Congress of South Africa  both in Romania and in Africa  all evoked a reaffirmation of our constant position.47.	In the present circumstances  the United Nations should take more energetic action in support of the earliest possible liberation of the peoples of southern Africa to put an end  once and for all  to all violations of their freedom and lawful national rights.48.	The abolition of colonialism and of all forms of domination by one nation over another  and of the imperialist policies of force and diktat are a sine qua non for the social and economic development of every people and for the effective realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms.49.	We believe that international concern in the social and humanitarian fields should be precisely in keeping with these requirements  so essential for ensuring the political  economic and social rights of peoples  which in turn are indispensable for the full assertion of the human personality.50.	It is in this spirit  we believe  that the human right to peace  security  work  education  health care  participation in the solution of the problems of society  as well as the right to have the opportunity to develop and fully use one's creative potential  is of the highest priority.51.	In particular  we consider that the General Assembly can make an effective contribution to the universal implementation of the right to education through the development of an educational system and the training of national personnel in all spheres of activity  particularly for the developing countries  in keeping with the requirements of their multifaceted progress.52.	Along the same lines  we advocate the proclamation of an International Youth Year  The activities connected with such a year would significantly contribute to the intensification of national and international efforts to create better educational  working and living conditions for the younger generation and broaden its participation in the over-ad development of society and in the creation of a world of peace and understanding.53.	The solution of the complex problems facing mankind today requires the democratization of international relations and the creation of conditions conducive to the full and equal participation in international life of all States  regardless of their size or social system. In particular  the greatest significance must be placed on the more active participation in international life of the small and medium-sized countries  the developing States  and of the non-aligned countries  which can and should have their say on all international issues.54.	Romania places great value on the role played by the United Nations  in keeping with the purposes and principles of the Charter  in the democratic solution of all international problems in the interests of all peoples. The United Nations offers the most appropriate framework and the only forum for in-depth debate and the finding of lasting solutions to all problems facing mankind  with the participation of all States  regardless of their size or social system  on terms of equality.55.	Experience has shown that it is not possible to solve major international problems within a limited circle of States  however great and powerful they may be. The strengthening of the role of the United Nations  its improvement and the democratization of its activities in conformity with the demands of today's international life are therefore major factors in the strengthening of international peace and security and in the development of co-operation among all nations.56.	It is here in the General Assembly  where all the States and nations of the world are represented  that we should democratically and equitably debate and solve all grave  difficult and thorny problems facing mankind today  and through our concerted efforts find judicious solutions  which could ensure that world politics will develop in keeping with the aspirations of every people  the general interests of peace and with the easing of tension. It is only through the active and responsible contribution of all nations that the serious difficulties and grave tensions and conflicts which still persist in international life can be overcome  that further steps and concrete measures towards disarmament  towards the establishment of a new economic and political order  towards detente  and towards security and peace  can be ensured. It is to this goal precisely that the work of Romania is aimed in the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. My country's contribution is aimed at identifying ways and means of raising the level of the United Nations to that of the tasks with which it has been entrusted in this world.57.	This summer  we had the opportunity to welcome to Romania the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who at that time held fruitful talks with the President of Romania  Mr. Nicolae Ceaugescu. I should also like to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Romanian Government for the Secretary-General1 s contribution to the promotion of the goals and principles of the United Nations and for his endeavours to find negotiated solutions for the major problems of the day.58.	The Romanian delegation is ready to contribute together with all other delegations to the search for just and equitable solutions to the problems which the United Nations General Assembly Is to consider. Let us hope that this session may bring us closer to the objective of ensuring the advent of a new international life marked by detente  national independence  progress and peace."
"113",5943,"RUS",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  allow me to congratulate you on the occasion of your election to this most responsible position and to express the conviction that your activities will contribute to a fruitful session of the United Nations General Assembly.93.	In the Soviet Union  as elsewhere  we learned with great sadness the news of the demise of the President of the People's Republic of Angola  Agostinho Neto. Our memories of that great political leader of Africa  that tireless fighter for peace and friendship among peoples  will for ever remain in the hearts of the Soviet people.94.	The current session of the United Nations General Assembly is the last one to be held in the 1970s. This gives us certain grounds not only for considering the topical issues of today but also for summing up some of the political results of the decade which is about to close and for casting a glance at the past. For the problems of today  as indeed the future itself  are more clearly seen against the background of what the past has to tell us about what action was successful and what was not.95.	It is worthwhile to recall the circumstances which brought about the founding of the United Nations. The war was still raging and the sword of just retribution had not yet fallen on those who instigated it when the leaders of the major nations of the anti-Fascist coalition undertook a task which today still retains its vital importance: the setting up of a reliable barrier against another world tragedy. That task was indeed enshrined in the United Nations Charter as the main goal of this Organization. The effectiveness of the United Nations in maintaining international peace has been and remains the main yardstick in judging all its activities.96.	Has the United Nations lived up to its mandate? There can be no simple answer to that question. Yet it should be recognized that it has done a lot of good for consolidating peace and promoting international cooperation. It is also evident that the United Nations could have done more than it has.97.	We are all aware that the manner in which the States Members of the United Nations act in international affairs cannot be reduced to one common denominator. Here the amplitude between different policy trends is great: some have not yet abandoned their claims to dominate the rest and even to hegemony in the world arena; others  naturally  cannot and will not reconcile themselves to this.98.	Some countries make every effort to put an end to the arms race and demonstrate a serious and responsible approach to this task; others  on the contrary  hurl ever more funds into that race and inflate their military budgets 99.	In short  the United Nations  as the broadest international organization  shows up in the boldest relief the characteristic features of the world with all its contradictions and collisions and  at the same time  the growing hopes of the peoples for a peaceful future.100.	The Soviet Union has never abandoned the belief in the possibility of building a solid edifice of peace. Our people and their Government take this as their basic premise and that there is weighty reason for this has been confirmed by the decade of the 1970s.101.	At the beginning of the current decade there was a new lease on life  so to speak  through a series of treaties which have brought international relations in Europe in line with the realities of its post-war development. The first Soviet-American agreements on the limitation of strategic arms and the basic principles of relations between the USSR and the United States of America were also concluded at that time.102.	Special mention should also be made of the historic Conference of the top leaders of 35 nations at Helsinki  which sealed in a document the evolution of Europe towards stronger security and co-operation. In that period  long and serious negotiations at the second round of SALT resulted in the Soviet-American Treaty  whose entry into force  one can say  the whole world is looking forward to.103.	Indeed  all of us can say that the 1970s will hold an important place in history. These years have seen the positive trend in international affairs which was named ""detente"" becoming a broad process. Detenteâand the Soviet Union stood at its cradleâ express the aspirations of our entire nation and  we are sure  those of all peoples of the world.104.	The attitude towards detente is the best indicator of any country's political intentions. In recent years many a good word has been said about detente. But even very good words in favour of detente are not enough; they must be buttressed by deeds  by the policies of States.105.	There are still people in the world today who frown when they hear the word ""detente""; their faces wrinkle like that of a hungry cat tasting a cucumber in a kitchen-garden.106.	Take  for instance  the questions of renouncing the spread of enmity and hatred among nations and the prohibition of war propaganda. This is  we may say  a minimum for any State adhering to the policy of detente and desirous of promoting a healthy political climate in the world.107.	As far back as 1947 the General Assembly adopted a resolution against the propaganda for another war. Over 30 years have elapsed since then  but who would undertake to assert today that such propaganda has been stopped? In many States it has not even been outlawed.108.	The Soviet Union did that long ago. The provision stating that ""war propaganda is banned in the USSR"" is a formal part of our Constitution  the fundamental law of our State.109.	On more than one occasion we have emphasized the urgency of this matter. Indeed  before the guns of the aggressors who unleashed the Second World War began to thunder  war propaganda had been in full swing for many years. Incessant calls had been made for the map of Europe and of the world to be carved up to suit the aggressors' designs. The Soviet Union mentions this fact because the forces that seek to condition people to think in terms of war and the arms build-up are still active.110.	It is becoming a tradition in some countries to play out scenarios of military conflicts. ""Look "" they say  ""that is how things are going to develop."" And estimates are made of the casualties and the number of cities to be swept away. Tens or even hundreds of millions of lives are written off in those callous calculations.111.	The ancient Greeks  and not they alone  left us wise myths whose beauty lies in glorifying what is human in man. It is not to the credit of our contemporaries that other myths are invented today which are designed to stupefy man with pessimism and to make him despair of the triumph of reason. They depict war as totally unavoidable.112.	There is no doubt as to the purposes for which these and other myths are invented and the policies which they are designed to serve.113.	What a huge number of films  books  articles and speeches of politicians and ""quasi-politicians""  all shot through with falsity and deception  are produced to make people believe the fictitious stories about the source of a threat to peace.114.	One example is the campaign launched with regard to Cuba  in the course of which all sorts of falsehoods are being piled up concerning the policies of Cuba and the Soviet Union. But the truth is that this propaganda is totally without foundation in reality  and is indeed based on falsehoods. The Soviet Union and Cuba have already stated as much. Our advice on this score is simple: the artificiality of this entire question must be honestly admitted and the matter closed.115.	The Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community have never threatened anybody  nor are they doing so now. A society which is confident of its creative forces and abilities needs no war. It needs peace. These words have been inscribed on the banner of our foreign policy ever since the days of Lenin.116.	The policy of peace and friendship among peoples  the policy of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems  has invariably been expressed in the decisions of the congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This policy course will be followed unswervingly in the future- as well. 117.	Naturally  the USSR and its Warsaw Treaty allies cannot fail to take into account the fact that some States are continuing their military preparations and stepping them up. In these circumstances the USSR and its allies are compelled to look after their security. At the same time our approach in this matter can be described as follows: ""The defence potential of the Soviet Union""  as L.I. Brezhnev has pointed out  ' 'must be at a level that would deter anyone from attempting to disrupt our peaceful life. A course aimed not at achieving superiority in weapons  but at reducing armaments and easing military confrontationâsuch is our policy.""118.	He who trusts this policy will never be deceived. The USSR and the socialist countries can always be relied upon in the struggle for peace  disarmament and detente and for the freedom and independence of peoples. Those countries have common ideals and are guided by common goals. Shoulder to shoulder  their peoples are working hard in the grandiose effort of construction.119.	Indeed the whole world knows how many proposals  and what kind of proposals  have been submitted by the socialist States to other countries  first of all in the United Nations  with the aim of deepening the process of easing tensions in the world  of broadening peaceful co-operation among States  and of strengthening international security.120.	The countries making up the socialist community co-ordinate their policies for the sake of universal peace  the security of their own peoples and the peoples of other countries. This was again confirmed with new vigour by the fruitful results of the latest series of meetings held by L.I. Brezhnev with top Party and State leaders of socialist countries which took place in the Crimea last summer.121.	I feel that our opinion will not differ from that of most participants in this session if I say that a comparison of the United Nations Charter provisions with what is going on in the sphere of military activities in some countries reveals a glaring contradiction. Although those States affixed their signatures to the United Nations Charter and its peaceful purposes and principles  they are nevertheless doing everything to see that stockpiled mountains of weapons grow.122.	In the meantime  the world has long since crossed the line beyond which the arms race has become sheer madness. We urge all States Members of the United Nations to counter this madness with common sense and the will to strengthen mutual trust. For its part  the USSR  together with other countries  will continue to work consistently to stop the arms race  to start dismantling the war machine part by part and to reduce the military arsenals of States down to general and complete disarmament.123.	Here at the United Nations and at various forums where the disarmament problem is under discussion  there is certainly no dearth of proposals that are well considered and based on the principle of equality and equal security. There are proposals relating both to weapons of mass destruction and to conventional weapons. We are still seized with the question of the reduction of military budgets.124.	There has been no small number of major initiatives directed towards a general improvement of the political climate in the world  including the proposal for a world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations. In our view  not a single State that sincerely strives for peace and good relations with other countries could possibly object to such a treaty.125.	There are also initiatives concerning various regions of the world. I should like to point  in particular  to the idea of the States bordering on the Indian Ocean that this ocean be turned into a zone of peace  an idea which is supported by the majority of the countries Members of the United Nations. The Soviet Union is certainly in favour of implementing this idea. It is actively working for an early resumption of the Soviet- American talks on the limitation and subsequent reduction of military activities in the Indian Ocean  talks which were interrupted through no fault of ours. An appropriate agreement on that subject would undoubtedly give this idea a more tangible shape  and this would have a favourable impact on the entire international situation.126.	Yet  on the whole  one has to note with concern that all or almost all proposals for ending the arms race and for disarmament as a rule encounter opposition on the part of a number of States. They frequently get bogged down in the quagmire of debate. And it takes tremendous efforts to bring them up to the stage of decision-making  though such decisions do not yet ensure real disarmament even in limited areas.127.	A considerable period of time has already elapsed since the question was raised about reaching an agreement on ending the production of all types of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of their stockpiles until they have been completely liquidated. In our days there is no more burning problem than that of removing the threat of nuclear war. Every reasonable person understands this. And it cannot be effectively solved without stopping the assembly line producing an incessant flow of weapons of monstrous destructive powerânuclear warheads  bombs and shells.128.	As we have repeatedly stated  the Soviet Union is prepared to discuss this fundamental problem together with other countries  and it is proposing that specific negotiations be initiated. All the nuclear Powers without exception are in duty bound to take part in them.129.	It is sometimes said that ending the production of nuclear weapons and their liquidation are too difficult a task. But can this be a reason for not starting the search for ways and means to resolve the problem? We are sure that reaching an appropriate agreement is not beyond the realm of possibility if States  and first of all the nuclear States  adopt a responsible approach.130.	The complex of questions relating to nuclear weapons includes the ensuring of guarantees of the security of non-nuclear States and the non-stationing of nuclear weapons on the territories of States where there are no such weapons at present.131.	The General Assembly has already adopted resolutions of principle on these matters. It is now necessary to embody them in binding international agreements. 132 In our view  further efforts should be made to strengthen the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The responsibility for this lies upon all States. We hope that the forthcoming Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be crowned with positive results. This Conference will be held soon.133.	Negotiations on a number of essential aspects of disarmament are already in progress  and on some they have been going on for a long time. I should like to single out a couple of questions whose solution could  in our view  be found in the not-too-distant future.134.	Progress has been achieved in the negotiations between the Soviet Union  the United States and the United Kingdom on the complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon tests. We would expect that no complicating elements will be introduced in the negotiations by our partners. But  unfortunately  these complications are being introduced even today.135.	In the course of Soviet-American consultations  basic elements of an agreement banning radiological weapons have been worked out. If work on the agreement is not impeded artificially  it can be speedily prepared for signature. This means that  following the can on bacteriological weapons  one more type of weapon of mass destruction will be prohibited.136.	The file of constructive proposals on various aspects of the disarmament problem is impressive and proper use should be made of it. This offers broad opportunities for action by the United Nations  which  at its tenth special session  devoted to disarmament  adopted a programme which on the whole is a good one. A United Nations resolution should not merely remain on paper. For the time being  however  it is but a paper  though a well-written one.137.	The signing of the Soviet-American Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms is convincing proof that  given goodwill and readiness to take into account each other's legitimate interests  it is possible to achieve agreements on the most difficult questions. The Treaty builds a bridge to the further limitation and reduction of strategic weapons. It also contains great potential for exerting a positive influence on other negotiations on the limitations of the arms race and on disarmament.138.	It can be stated without exaggeration that a major step has been taken for the USSR  the United States of America and the entire world. It is quite understandable  therefore  that  one after another  the representatives of States speaking from this rostrum speak out in favour of that Treaty.139.	The strengthening of universal peace is inseparable from ensuring security in Europe. The situation on the European continent is not merely a part of the general picture of the world situation: today  as in the past  it has a profound impact on the course of international developments.140.	Since the historic moment when it raised the banner of a new social system  our country has been pursuing a consistent course towards creating conditions of reliable peace in Europe. Everything we have accomplished in the name of that goal is an open book  and we are proud of its every page.141.	Of course  we are far from underestimating the contributions made by other States. We give their due to the countries that took part in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which was crowned by the adoption of the Final Act. That document provides guidelines for further efforts to deepen the process of detente in Europe.142.	Today the basis for the peaceful co-operation of States on the European continent is more solid than it was yesterday. Favourable changes have taken place in relations between socialist and capitalist countries in Europe.143.	Soviet-French co-operation is on the rise. There is a considerable degree of mutual understanding and agreement on major issues of European and world politics  and accordingly there is a possibility for the further development of fruitful co-operation.144.	The development of our relations with the Federal Republic of Germany has been following a positive trend. Both sides appreciate the mutual advantages of what has been achieved  recognizing that a good deal could yet be accomplished in the future. I should like to express the hope that there will be no move on the part of the Federal Republic of Germany that would reduce such possibilities for the future or that would run counter to the peaceful line in Europe and to the easing of international tensions.145.	We are interested in the consistent development of Soviet-British relations. We are hopeful that there is a desire for this in the United Kingdom  too.146.	We have good relations with Italy. The assets accumulated in these relations must be multiplied.147.	I should like to note the genuine and traditional good-neighbourly relations between the USSR and Finland. We appreciate all the good achievements that have been made in our relations with other Scandinavian countries.148.	A positive shift is taking place in our relations with Spain.149.	The development of our ties with the rest of Western Europe is also a source of satisfaction.150.	On the whole  both in the field of bilateral relations with States having a different social system and in other fields  the Soviet Union is following the course charted by the Helsinki Conference.151.	The roots that political detente has taken on European soil cannot  however  be viable unless practical measures are taken in the field of military detente. In this regard  great prospects have been opened up by the proposals contained in the Declaration of the Political Advisory Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Organization adopted last November  and in the May communique of the Committee of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of that Organization.152.	First of all  I wish to refer to the initiative concerning the conclusion between the European States participants in the Helsinki Conference of a treaty on the non-first use of either nuclear or conventional weapons against each other  the intent of which is self- evident.153.	Unfortunately  our Western partners have not yet shown themselves ready to engage in talks on this problem. Nevertheless  we expect that a sober approach and a sense of responsibility will prompt them to react positively to our proposal.154.	The socialist countries are still waiting for a response to yet another important initiative of theirsâ concerning the convening  at a political level and with the participation of all European countries as well as the United States and Canada  of a conference on strengthening confidence among States  easing military confrontation and the subsequent thinning out of armed forces and armaments in Europe  and their reduction. Each of those countries could make its own contribution to the work of that conference.155.	In the opinion of the Soviet Union  substantial work is needed on a bilateral as well as a multilateral basis to ensure the success of both the conference on military detente on the European continent and the Madrid meeting to be held next year of representatives of the States participants in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Far from competing with each other  those two forums are complementary.156.	As for the Madrid meeting  it should focus its attention on truly urgent issues of detente in Europe. No narrow selfish interests should be allowed to prevent this.157.	Now a few words about the Vienna talks  the subject of which  as will be recalled  is the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe. This is not a problem of significance to Europe alone. Our country invariably adopts constructive positions at those talks and puts forward initiatives which also take into account the legitimate interests of the Western partners. Only strict observance of the principle of undiminished security of either party would bring the Vienna talks to the road leading to agreement  and the sooner that happens the better.158.	The review of problems relating to Europe would be incomplete if no reference were made to attempts undertaken from time to time by some countries to test the durability of the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin.  This is contrary to the long-term interests which provided the basis for that agreement and which must serve as guidance for all States  particularly the parties to it.159.	The root-cause of the complexities and contradictions of the international situation at the present day lies to no small extent in the fact that the existing sources of tensions and conflicts between States do not disappear and that now and then new ones keep springing up.160.	There is more than one such source in Asia. It was only six months ago that aggression was committed against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Practically the whole world branded the aggressors as such  but have appropriate conclusions been drawn from that event by all those who should have drawn them?161.	This issue cannot be drowned in the artificially whipped up propaganda campaign concerning Indo- Chinese refugees  a campaign whose sharp edge is directed against Viet Nam. No  that edge should be turned in another direction  which is well known.162.	It is also no secret who imposed and nurtured the bloodthirsty murderous regime of Pol Pot. Today that regime in Kampuchea has been done away with and there will be no return to the past. The legitimate representatives of the Kampuchean people must be given the opportunity to take the seat belonging to Kampuchea in the United Nations.163.	The policy of some States that are intensifying their interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan is short-sightedâthere is no other term for it. That country  which has chosen the road of progressive democratic transformation  comes out in favour of good relations with its neighbours and pursues an independent foreign policy  a policy of non-alignment. The Soviet Union  which has long-standing ties of friendship and good neighbourliness with Afghanistan  con-siders that this inadmissible interference must be stopped.164.	With respect to such Middle East States as Turkey and Iran  not only have we common borders but we also maintain relations of traditional co-operation with them. We take a positive attitude to the steps which those and other Asian countries take to protect and strengthen their sovereignty  and we are willing to develop relations with them.165.	We in the Soviet Union are satisfied with the friendly nature of relations between the USSR and India  that great Asian country with its consistently peaceful policy. The Soviet-Indian relationship is a major factor for stability and peace on the Asian continent.166.	We wish to maintain  naturally on the basis of reciprocity  normal good relations with all States  whether in south or south-east Asia or in the Far East. This applies to Japan  Indonesia  the Philippines  Malaysia  Thailand  Pakistan  Bangladesh  Sri Lanka and other countries of those regions.167.	Like all peace-loving peoples  the Soviet people are gravely concerned over the state of affairs in the Middle Eastâone of the ""hottest"" spots on earth  where now there emanates a serious threat to peace.168.	The Middle East problem  if divested of what is immaterial  boils down to the following: either the con-sequences of the aggression against the Arab States and peoples are eliminated or the invaders will be rewarded by being allowed to appropriate lands that belong to others. A just settlement and the establishment of lasting peace in the Middle East require that Israel should end its occupation of all the Arab lands it seized in 1967; that the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine  including the right to establish their own State  be safeguarded; and that the right of all States in the Middle East  including Israel  to independent existence under conditions of peace be effectively guaranteed.169.	The separate deal between Egypt and Israel resolves nothing. It is nothing but a means designed to lull the vigilance of peoples. It is a way of piling up on a still greater scale explosive material capable of producing a new conflagration in the Middle East. Moreover  added to the tense political atmosphere in this and the adjacent areas  is the heavy smell of oil.170.	It is high time that all States represented in the United Nations realized how vast is the tragedy of the Arab people of Palestine. What is the worth of declarations in defence of humanism and human rightsâ whether for refugees or notâif before the eyes of the entire world the inalienable rights of an entire people  driven from its land and deprived of a livelihood  are grossly trampled upon?171.	The Soviet policy with respect to the Middle East problem is one of principle. We are in favour of a comprehensive and just settlement  of the establishment of durable peace in the Middle East  a region not far from our borders. The Soviet Union sides firmly with Arab peoples  who resolutely reject deals at the expense of their legitimate interests.172.	By adopting in 1960 the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoplesâone of the most significant acts of the United Nationsâthe world community acknowledged the indisputable fact that the hour of colonialism had struck. Since then an overwhelming majority of peoples have cast off the yoke of colonialism. But humanity's conscience continues to revolt against the fact that the shackles of colonialism and racism have not yet been completely broken. And it is above all of southern Africa that we should be talking here.173.	For many years now the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia have been waging a selfless struggle for their freedom and independence. The Soviet Union is entirely on the side of their noble cause. We have raised and shall continue to raise our voice in their support  and we shall co-operate with those States  especially African States  which adhere to the positions of justice  of upholding the inalienable rights of those peoples. All kinds of combinations  no matter how superficially clever  which are aimed at preserving the domination of racists and colonialists with the help of hastily formed puppet regimes should be resolutely rejected.174.	Is it possible to achieve a political settlement in southern Africa? Yes  it is possible and there are ways leading to it. But so far the racists and their stooges have replied with bullets to proposals that a choice be made in favour of a just and peaceful solution.175.	The session of the General Assembly of the United Nations will be right if it clearly states its resolute support for the liberation struggle of the peoples of southern Africa and condemns attempts to drown this struggle in blood as a crime against humanity. It is a direct duty of the United Nations to make those who ignore the decisions of the United Nations on southern Africa respect them.176.	The Soviet people are well aware of the contribution of the peoples of Latin America to the struggle for peace and national liberation. This contribution will be all the greater the more the stand of Latin American States in defending their independence is resolute and the less their policies are influenced from the outside. In this connexion  we note with satisfaction the growing authority of Latin America in international relations.177.	In its approach to all continents  to all countries of the world  the Soviet Union does not apply different yardsticks when it comes to the sovereignty of States  the freedom of peoples and genuine human rights. One cannot hold aloft the Charter of the United Nations in one situation and hide it under the table in another. The provisions and principles of the Charter must be applied equally to any State and any people.178.	The Soviet Union has repeatedly stressed  notably in the United Nations  the significance of the non-aligned movement and its peaceful orientation. We are confident that the non-aligned States will continue to make use of their entire political weight in the interests of peace  disarmament and detente. This confidence of ours is supported by the successful results of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which recently ended in Havana. This was an important forum and a major international event.179.	What is needed in the first place to resolve any important international problem of a political  economic or other nature is an atmosphere of peace. And whether peace will be more durable or less stable depends to an important extent on the state of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. That conclusion is objective and indisputable.180.	The leadership of the Soviet Union makes no secret of its desire to have normal and  what is more  friendly relations with the United States. This only requires the observance of principles which have become well-established in international relations; and they are recorded  in particular  in the well-known Soviet-American documentsâthat is  the principles of peaceful coexistence between States and of non-interference in the affairs of others. We shall not allow anybody to meddle in our internal affairs. Concern for Soviet-American relations is a matter for both sides. It is only on this basis that the relations between the USSR and the United States can develop successfully.181.	Our position was stated with exhaustive clarity and precision by L. I. Brezhnev in Vienna  in particular  in the course of his meeting with the President of the United States  Mr. Jimmy Carter. The meeting showed that  given the wish on both sides  the USSR and the United States are able to find mutually acceptable solutions and to co-operate in the interests of international detente and peace 182.	L. I. Brezhnev has stated:""There is no country or people in the world  in fact  with which the Soviet Union would not like to have good relations; there is no topical international problem to the solution of which the Soviet Union would not be willing to contribute; there is no source of danger of war in the removal of which by peaceful means the Soviet Union would not be interested."" 183.	In the succession of post-war developments  along with positive events there were also dangerous ones which gravely threatened the foundations of peace. A closer look at these developments would easily reveal that the evolution of the international situation largely depends upon the States which have the most powerful levers to influence it.184.	When those levers are activated to attain objectives contrary to  or even openly defying  the United Nations Charter  conflict situations and international crises arise. The instigators of such events usually seek to whitewash themselves and  in that  they do not hesitate to pin all kinds of labels on others. That is a procedure that is  unfortunately  sometimes followed.185.	One such tactic consists in juggling with the term ""hegemonism""  which in recent years has been increasingly used in international political practice. Although of recent origin  the term ""hegemonism"" denotes a phenomenon that is far from new. On the contrary  it has been known  so to speak  from time immemorial. It means striving for world domination  for domination over other countries and peoples.186.	The Soviet attitude towards hegemonism and domination is clear. Since its very first days  the Soviet State has resolutely objected to anyone's being a hegemonist with others submitting to his will  and to any States' holding a position of domination over others.187.	Twenty million human lives were sacrificed by our people to defeat Hitler's designs for world domination and to bury hegemonism in its Fascist attire. This figure alone is indicative of our score with hegemonism.188.	Hegemonism is a direct antipode to the equality of States and peoples  an antipode to the ideal which the October Revolution proclaimed for the whole world and which the United Nations  as prescribed by its Charter  should promote in every possible way in international relations. Its manifestation in our day constitutes a serious obstacle to the process of detente to which there is not and cannot be any reasonable alternative.189.	The time has come for all States Members of the United Nations to take an unambiguous position with regard to hegemonismâto condemn it and to block any claims to hegemony in world affairs. Its inadmissibility should be raised to the level of a principle that must be rigorously observed.190.	Guided by all this  the Soviet Union is proposing the inclusion in the agenda of the current session of an important item entitled ""Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"" and is submitting an appropriate draft resolution to be considered at the session.191.	The purport of this draft resolution is that no States or groups of States should claim  under any circumstances or for any motives whatsoever  hegemony in regard to other States or groups of States.192.	We are convinced that all those who approach the conduct of international affairs on the basis of equality and in the interests of detente and peace cannot oppose the adoption of such a draft resolution. It is to be hoped that the General Assembly will consider the draft with a high sense of responsibility.193.	Following the General Assembly  the United Nations Security Council  with the five nuclear Powers as its   permanent members  could also express itself against hegemonism. It would be a good idea subsequently to couch the renunciation by States of a policy of hegemonism in all its manifestations in terms of a broad international agreement and to conclude such an agreement or treaty.194.	In conducting its policy  our country scrupulously complies with the principles of the United Nations Charter and invariably pursues its purposes. We never lose sight of the fundamental basis of the activities of the world Organization  that is  concentration of its efforts in ensuring that the peoples can live in conditions of peace. The Soviet Union has consistently come out in favour of strengthening the United Nations  of no one's being allowed to erode it.195.	The peoples will assess the results of the current session  like those of previous sessions  of the General Assembly primarily in terms of what it will have achieved to make people feel more secure. Hence  great responsibility rests with all States Members of the United Nations and with their representatives assembled in this hall.196.	Everything positive that we can achieve today will help us in the 1980s to consolidate and to develop the successes of the 1970s. That in turn will largely determine the thoughts and feelings  the memories of the past and the faith in the future that mankind will take with it into the next millennium.197.	We wish  and we shall do all in our power to ensure  that the work of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly may culminate in the adoption of resolutions that will be commended by the peoples of the world."
"114",5990,"RWA",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President your unanimous election to the presidency of this august Assembly is for the delegation of Rwanda a cause for great pleasure and legitimate pride  as we see the representative of an African country  Rwanda's friend  to which we are united by so many common traditions and so many warm and fraternal ties  assume such lofty and great responsibilities at a time when the fate of the world depends on the worth and the generosity of the people of our generation.156.	The great responsibility entrusted to you means that delegations do appreciate your outstanding qualities and your valuable contributions to this Assembly. It is also a well-deserved tribute to your country  the United Republic of Tanzania  which  under the leadership of its prestigious leader  Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  continues to carry high the torch of freedom  justice and solidarity among peoples.157.	My delegation is happy to emphasize in what high esteem the Head of State in Rwanda  Major- General Juvenal Habyarimana  and the people of Rwanda  hold the President of the United Republic of Tanzania  in view of the tireless efforts which he continues to make for the cause of Africa.158.	The Rwandan delegation would also at this time like to express its appreciation of the dynamic cooperation between the Tanzanian and Rwandan peoples and also of the great understanding and fraternal solidarity which we have always experienced from the Tanzanian Government particularly at those times when our country has been arbitrarily subjected to economic strangulation  partly because of our landlocked situation.159.	The Rwanda delegation would also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Ambassador Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  who wisely  competently and with devotion presided over the work of the preceding session.160.	I should also like to take this opportunity of expressing Rwanda's great appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his devotion to the work of strengthening the role of the United Nations  in the maintenance of international peace and security and also for his constant concern over the problems facing the developing countries.161.	My delegation takes great pleasure in welcoming to the United Nations Saint Lucia  the new Member of our Organization. I warmly congratulate the people of that country on their heroism in their struggle against foreign domination. I am convinced that their accession to independence will accelerate the process of decolonization and at the same time strengthen the principle of universality which is increasingly within the reach of our Organization.162.	My delegation would also like to pay a tribute to the memory of that outstanding leader  Agostinho Neto  the great freedom fighter whom fate has snatched from us  from the admiration of Africa and the affection of the Angolan people. The fight which he led at the head of the MPLA   and which led Angola to national sovereignty  is a model of courage and tenacity for those peoples which are still struggling for their freedom. May the work that he began be consolidated and flourish in peace and national concord. That is the wish which my delegation would like to address to the gallant Angolan people.163.	A look back at events which have occurred since the last session shows that in general the dangers and risks which the international situation presented to us a year ago  have evolved in a manner that can hardly be described as satisfactory and can even be described as disturbing.164.	In the period that has elapsed  the world has encountered new problems which are a serious threat to international peace and co-operation. A glance at some of the events that have occurred emphasizes these dangers.165.	Here and there throughout the world  the pressing of claims have led to people having recourse to violence  new hotbeds of armed conflict have erupted in various regions and social disruption within States has sometimes led to internecine struggle.166.	The colonialist and reactionary forces have in-creased their means of pressure and their diversionary tactics  under cover of invidious legalism. In this manner they intend to continue their policy of domination and exploitation  without changing any aspect of it.167.	The multilateral negotiations which have been carried on so far with a view to the establishment of the new international economic order have ended in half successes  if I am not to call them failures  and in this way they have disappointed the long-held hopes of most of the Members of this Organization.168.	The many issues submitted to us for consideration show that there are very many difficult problems facing us. I should like to focus mainly on those issues which are of major concern to man.169.	The complete liberation of the continent of Africa is for us still the paramount concern  and we quite rightly consider it a sacred duty resolutely to support the peoples of southern Africa who are struggling for their independence and who for centuries have met with a stubborn refusal to grant their most elementary rights.170.	The international community is witnessing a network of machinations which  although doomed to failure in advance  nevertheless do reveal how bitterly a minority of Rhodesian settlers and their backers are trying to satisfy their greed and their instinct for domination and exploitation  which have already been condemned by history.171.	Hesitation and indecision in resorting to firm action have led the minority racist regime to be bold enough to set up a Government under its thumb  made up of traitors who emerged from the pseudo-elections which were just as illegal as the unilateral declaration of independence of November 1965.172.	After all  is it hardly possible in Zimbabwe to achieve independence based on government by majority and under conditions of peace and stability  unless the true representatives of the people of Zimbabwe  who have been carrying on an armed struggle for decades  are able to regain their national rights.173.	In our opinion  the participation of the Patriotic Front in the settlement of the Rhodesian crisis is an absolutely imperative requirement.174.	My delegation sincerely hopes that the Conference now taking place in London  in which all the parties concerned are participating  will conclude with practical and satisfactory conclusions which will provide an effective and rational solution to the tragedy of Zimbabwe and thus put an end to the long war which has had such tragic consequences not only for the people of that country but also for the neighbouring175.	In Namibia  while the illegal South African occupation regime has feigned understanding and wisdom when faced with the proposals made by the five Western members of the Security Council  the iron curtain has not yet been raised. Oppression  the elevation of puppet chiefs to posts of honour  massacres and declarations of good intentions all alternate at a frightening rate  confusing us all  or trying to do so.176.	In the face of these Machiavellian manoeuvres our concern remains  and peaceful independence becomes increasingly unsure. In any event no form of Independence is acceptable for that Territory unless it is endorsed by our Organization which is the only legitimate trusteeship authority in Namibia and which has the imperative obligation to lead that Territory to sovereignty with full respect for the unity and integrity of that country and with the participation of SWAPO  which is the sole recognized and authentic representative of the Namibian people.177.	Accordingly my delegation categorically rejects the illegal elections staged in December 1978  the decisions of the Constituent Assembly  which is in the pay of Pretoria  and the wicked Turnhalle constitution. We also reject all those tricks involving the customary puppet chiefs who are venal and malleable because they are corrupt.178.	In South Africa even the most optimistic among us cannot avoid noting with great concern the situation which in theory and in practice has institutionalized racial discrimination and all other forms of oppression which are in fact  the flagrant denial of the most fundamental human rights.179.	The supreme form of iniquity and injustice has established its headquarters in Pretoria so as to be able to unleash an anachronistic war against the African peoples who are struggling with determination for independence and for a definition of their national identity.180.	Since the barbaric massacres of Sharpeville and the savage repression of Soweto  the odious and unacceptable system of apartheid  that form of enslavement which is shameful to our age  has drawn so much revulsion and so many denunciations and condemnations that-it is now high time the United Nations took action and meted out a punishment befitting the gravity of these crimes against humanity.181.	This question is far too important for the United Nations to continue settling for half measures. Thus  in connexion with southern Africa  my delegation expresses the hope that  at last  at this session we may find adequate solutions to this problem which humanity finds increasingly intolerable  not only for the Namibians  Zimbabweans and Azanians but also for the neighbouring countries which are suffering from armed aggression by the racist forces because of their unwavering support for the cause of the ideals of our Charter.182.	In Western Sahara the democratic  emancipating and liberating aspirations of the people are being stifled by a protracted and illegal war to annex the Territory and divert it from the current of the decolonization process which the world community has endorsed in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 16 December 1960.183.	There is no longer any need to stress the fact that the rights of the Saharan people cannot be challenged. For my delegation  the struggle being waged by the Saharan people is no longer separable from that being waged by the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa  because the problem in Western Sahara indeed is one of decolonization. The International Court of Justice  at the request of this Assembly  stated that neither Morocco nor Mauritania had exercised territorial sovereignty over Spanish Sahara before it was colonized by Spain.  Since then  the sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  held in Monrovia has endorsed the principle of the right of the Saharan people to self- determination  Thus  the justice of the Saharan cause has now been recognized throughout the world.184.	The Rwanda delegation sincerely hopes that all the parties directly involved in this problem will demonstrate moderation and wisdom in order to avoid any further bloodshed like that which has been occurring for too long in this part of Africa.185.	However  I should like to hail the courageous decision that the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  inspired by the conclusions of the Monrovia Assembly of the OAU  has freely made in refraining from violence and withdrawing from an internecine war which has had such tragic consequences  as well as in expressing its willingness to have a dialogue and open the way to honest and cordial co-operation with its neighbouring States.186.	In the Middle East the advent of the peace which we all long for whole-heartedly is still uncertain. It will continue to be so as long as the Palestinian people are subjected to the deprivation and suffering  both moral and physical  which they have endured for more than 30 years. If we examine the background and origin of this conflict we see that it is unanimously recognized that any solution to the problem must take due account of the legitimate interests of the Palestinian people represented by the PLO. Indeed  it could not be otherwise because the Middle East crisis or  more specifically  the Arab-Israeli conflict  has as its background  as its first cause  the failure to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.187.	Accordingly  any effective  just  honourable and lasting solution to this crisis must necessarily include a recognition by all of the national and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to an independent and sovereign State  and Israeli withdrawal from all the Arab territories that it has occupied since 1967. This is necessary before there can be cooperation and an atmosphere of trust among the States in the region. Accordingly  peace in the Middle East must be the result of a global agreement among all the parties concerned  in particular the Palestinian people as represented by the PLO  their only legitimate representative.188.	The Rwanda delegation is following with concern the situation in Cyprus in which  despite the enormous efforts made by the Secretary-General to resolve the conflict  the gap between the two communities of the island remains.189.	It is the duty of the international community to do all it can to arrive at a favourable solution  encouraging a dialogue between the two communities without any foreign interference  because this problem involves principles  the violation of which causes a direct threat to the sovereignty  territorial integrity and the remarkable role played by this country in consolidating the non-aligned movement  which today includes three quarters of the world family.190.	The Rwanda Government is concerned about the situation which still prevails in Lebanon and which is a dangerous threat to the territorial integrity of that country. To put an end to that most regrettable situation  it is necessary to start a fruitful dialogue among all the Lebanese communities and to clear up the disputes which have been whipped up through circumstances which are beyond the control of the Lebanese people  who for many years have been suffering from the madness of destruction unleashed by uncontrolled foreign legions.191.	However  we do not give up hope that peace in Lebanon can be re-established with the valuable co-operation of all the parties involved in that crisis and the United Nations  whose presence in the country is most definitely a factor for moderation.192.	It is unthinkable that at a time when the freedom which we all hold dear is endangered  at a time when States are dreaming of great regional groups or continental groups  certain countries  certain nations should still have to suffer from the artificial divisions that have been imposed on them.193.	The position of the Republic of Rwanda on the question of divided nations has been frequently stated at this rostrum. Peoples who form indivisible nations do have an absolute inalienable right to seek ways and means of achieving peaceful reunification.194.	The Government of Rwanda welcomes the efforts that have been made for some years by the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to normalize their relations. We trust that this dialogue will one day result in the peaceful reunification of the German nation.195.	The Korean question  although it has not been the subject of distressing debates recently  nevertheless is a matter of deep concern and a latent source of confrontation which could engulf the whole region. My delegation has always advocated the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korean territory in order to facilitate a free and peaceful reunification  because in the final analysis it is up to the Korean people to take a democratic decision about their future.196.	I should now like to return to a problem which is as essential to the human race as is the right to peace and well-being: I refer to disarmament.197.	The impassioned desire for destruction and domination has led people today to design and manufacture increasingly sophisticated weapons to act as a deterrent to others whom they mistrust because they do not understand their intentions or because they suspect them. The arms race and the balance of terror have held sway since the free nations  after the Second World War  resolving to try to save future generations from such scourges and to ensure mutual respect in a world of peace in which each nation would be able to build its future in total security  came together to sign the Charter of our Organization.198.	In Rwanda  we believe that there can be no inter-national detente until an end has been put to the arms race. That is why we whole-heartedly call for the time when the enormous financial and scientific resources now being devoted to the manufacture of the means of destroying mankind can be used to encourage respect for the freedom and dignity of the human race.199.	We believe that all efforts to curb the arms race  for example  the signing of the SALT Treaty recently concluded at Vienna  must be encouraged in order to ensure that the tremendous resources thus freed can be made available for the economic and social development of all the peoples of the world.200.	A reaffirmation of the denuclearization of Africa  which was decided on by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU in May 1963 "" is necessary in view of the nuclear threat to the African continent posed by the racist South African Government.201.	The same holds true for the Indian Ocean  which was proclaimed a zone of peace by our Assembly in 1971  but which is nevertheless still the scene of a mass concentration of warships and nuclear and conventional weapons.202.	Since the beginning of this decade man has been living through one of the most tragic periods of the economic and social crisis. It is one of the most tragic because of its gravity and also because of its duration. This crisis is particularly difficult for the poorest countries  the land-locked countries and those with only a few natural resources.203.	The new international economic order  which was so carefully elaborated by experts with a view to establishing a minimum balance among the 20 richest countries  which account for more than 80 per cent of the goods of the world  and the countless other States Members of the United Nations  which are left with only 20 per cent of the resources of the world to meet the needs of three quarters of the human race  has become merely a fine subject for academic dissertations  because those countries that are able to change the unjust and egoistic economic order seem today not to have the political will necessary to carry out the necessary changes.204.	As the Second United Nations Development Decade draws to an end  the concerns of our Organization in this area are still just as acute as ever.205.	The Paris Conference on so-called North-South co-operation did meet with limited success in 1977  but there has been a continual increase in the price of oil and that has made the economies of the poorer countries even more precarious  while the deterioration in the terms of trade has assumed alarming proportions.206.	We were extremely disappointed at the failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD last June  in that  apart from some isolated decisions that had to be taken  the group of countries that has the advantage in the current system refused to recognize the interdependence that exists in the world today between all groups of countries from the point of view of economics  trade and finance.207.	The setting up of the Common Fund for stabilizing the market prices of commodities and the decision by some countries to cancel some of the debts of the developing countries must be welcomed as a healthy approach to encouraging the process of setting up the new international economic order.208.	Here I should like to pay a tribute in particular to those countries which had responded to the appeal launched by the international community in the area of the rescheduling of debts. In this respect  we wish to mention  inter alia  the Federal Republic of Germany  Canada  the Netherlands  France  Sweden and Switzerland.209.	The ties which have been set up between the European Economic Community and more than 50 countries of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific are  we believe  an outstanding model for co-operation.210.	The recently concluded negotiations on a new convention soon to be signed at Lome  were understandably arduous  and sometimes caused frustration among the negotiating parties. Nevertheless  the outcome is a further step in the co-operation between rich and developing countries as they seek to establish a new international economic order.211.	However  alongside these positive reactions  which are generous and praiseworthy  the gap between rich and poor continues to grow because of the refusal of the rich countries to take specific action and solve the problems which trouble the conscience of us all.212.	For example  one could mention a few issues that are particularly urgent. I refer to an improvement of the terms of trade  the rescheduling of debts  the complementary financing measures for poor countries  and the transfer of technology  as well as others which I shall not detail.213.	As we consider all these issuesâand there are many others which are just as important as the increase of aid to developmentâa special place must be reserved for the least developed and land-locked countries  which suffer from the cumulative effect of all these problems: inflation  a collapse in the prices of the few raw materials which they possess and other natural disasters.214.	My delegation would like to draw the attention of this Assembly to its resolution 33/85 of 15 December 1978 on the United Nations Special Fund for Landlocked Developing Countries. That resolution expresses our concern at the ""very low level of contributions . . . announced"" and urges Member States ""to make immediate and generous contributions"" so as to make the Fund operational as soon as possible.215.	During this year  as I said earlier in my statement  my country found itself on the brink of paralysis because of our land-locked situation in the middle of the continent of Africa  more than 1 800 kilometres from the ocean. This was at a time when difficulties in our region prevented us from transporting our supplies and our exports.216.	We avoided the worst thanks only to the solidarity of friendly countries and international agencies which gave us the additional resources to ensure that supplies could reach our country   and also through the solidarity of neighbouring countries  which helped us to transport our goods through their territories.217.	I would be remiss if I did not in this Assembly express once again the sincere thanks of the Government of Rwanda and of our people to all those friendly countries and regional and international organizations which  at the crucial hours when we were faced with economic paralysis earlier this year  responded most generously to our anguished appeal for assistance.218.	It is clear that there is no lack of sympathy for the land-locked countries  and there is indeed an increased effort and international solidarity being shown in respect of these countries. However  there are constraints as to the ways and means of solving the problems of such countries and these are delaying the solutions to the problems of being land-locked. This bottleneck in our efforts can be cleared up only through a greater political will to increase in a special way  individually and collectively  aid to the land-locked countries and regional co-operation among the countries concerned.219.	Rwanda  a land-locked country  has considered it to be its duty to cultivate good relations of cooperation in the areas in which we are located. We are convinced that mutual benefit can result from well- thought-out horizontal co-operation which is also well organized. It is against this background that my country  Rwanda  is happy to have set up with our sister Republics of Burundi and Zaire the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries. We were convinced that the setting up of economic regional units was an objective approach and a realistic basis which could help to create an atmosphere conducive to economic co-operation among the countries concerned.220.	Still at a level of regional co-operation  I can say that Rwanda  the United Republic of Tanzania and Burundi have set up the Organization for the Development of the Akagera Basin with a view to the common exploitation of the natural resources of the Caseu for the benefit of our respective populations.221.	We hope that the Transport and Communications Decade in Africa  which ECA and the OAU are now planning  will enable us to strengthen regional and interregional co-operation in Africa.222.	Well-planned and well-organized co-operation between Africa and the Arab countries can make a real contribution to reducing the most regrettable imbalance between the economies of the industrialized countries and of the developing countries. In this spirit Rwanda welcomes the relations of friendship and co-operation which we already have with a number of Arab countries and Arab development funds.223.	My delegation has also had an opportunity to stress that  in the context of the draft of an international convention on the law of the sea  the right of access to the sea by land-locked countries and freedom of transit through third countries must be reaffirmed.224.	At the same time we cannot fail to condemn those national legislatures which unilaterally have appropriated to themselves the resources of the sea which have already been declared the common heritage of mankind in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV).225.	There is no doubt that the United Nations is an excellent setting for negotiations. While we recognize the benefits of dialogue at the bilateral and regional level  we appreciate all the more the benefits of such dialogue within our Organization through this most valuable instrument  the Charter of the United Nations.226.	Despite some regrettable events  some disappointments and some tragedies  we recognize the un-equalled value of our Organization because it encourages the tireless struggle of Member States to establish an order of justice and peace for the whole of the family of man. My delegation is convinced that in this Organization and under its auspices we can help to reconcile extreme points of view  resolve conflicts and create a feeling of human solidarity  despite ideological and other differences.227.	In this context I wish to express my conviction that  with perseverance and determination  we shall be able to bring our positions closer  to overcome those obstacles which separate us and take concerted action. In this way  by taking into account the interdependence of our futures  we can lead all peoples to a better world."
"115",6035,"SAU",34,1979,"ï»¿121.	Allow me  Mr. President  to preface my address by extending to you  on behalf of my delegation  my sincere felicitations upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its current session. Your election reflects your great competence and the esteem in which you are held and underlines 4he importance of the post that you occupy in the fulfilment of the hopes and aspirations of mankind.122.	I would also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  for having proficiently presided over the preceding session.123.	It also gives me great pleasure to express  on behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  our deep gratitude and appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his sincere endeavours in promoting the effectiveness of the United Nations and in furthering its lofty objectives and principles.124.	I wish to seize this opportunity to associate myself with other heads of delegations who preceded me in welcoming Saint Lucia to the United Nations as a new Member that will take part with all other Member States in attaining the noble aims of the Organization.125.	While it would be exceedingly optimistic and idealistic to maintain that the United Nations has fulfilled all the hopes and aspirations of the world  it is only realistic to acknowledge and recognize the accomplishments that have been made  and those that are being made  by this Organization. It has provided a world rostrum for the peoples from which they could express their aspirations and expectations. It has been able to attain for those peoples many of the rights which they had always striven for. It has succeeded in admitting a number of new Members to the family of sovereign nations. It has allocated considerable financial and human resources for economic and social development in various corners of the globe. It has endeavoured to ease world tensions and to prevent  to the best of its ability  regional crises from developing into multilateral conflicts.126.	Probably the biggest problem that confronts this Organization and in many instances renders it unable to discharge its great responsibilities is the fact that it is functioning in a world that still fails to subscribe to its objectives and is dominated by the great Powers. None the less  this Organization and other specialized and affiliated agencies  including regional organizations such as the Islamic Conference  the League of Arab States and the OAU  endeavour to achieve common objectives and are considered indispensable bodies whose activities should be encouraged and developed in order to maintain the security  integrity and prosperity of mankind.127.	By taking the initiative and playing a constructive role in consolidating and promoting co-operation among its member States  the Islamic Conference is endeavouring to promote prosperity and progress  for Islamic States and consequently for all mankind. In discharging their responsibilities they contribute to the fulfilment of the objectives of the United Nations and the affirmation of the principles embodied in its Charter.128.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia takes great pride in its membership in this Organization. Islam is the Kingdom's religion  and the Holy Koran is tantamount to its constitution and law. The well-established principles and genuine precepts of lslam have displayed their adaptability to the changing conditions of modern life  with all its complex economic aspects and its scientific and technological variables in a human and social framework that preserves the dignity of the human being and establishes justice and equality for society.129.	In the sphere of international relations  we  as Moslems  entertain no enmity or hatred for other peoples  whether in the East  West  North or South. In tact  our religion importunes us to build bridges of friendship and cordiality among various peoples. God the Almighty says:""Say: Unto Allah belong the East and the West. He guideth whom He will unto a straight path.' 'Thus we have appointed you a middle nation  that ye may be witnesses against mankind  and that the messenger may be a witness against you.""130.	In calling us ""a middle nation""  the Koran urges upon us to be moderate and to shun prejudice and hatred; to surmount the myths of racial and cultural superiority and to advocate the sphere of social and international relations  the concepts of mercy  charity  justice and equality  which constitute the essence of faith. Islam is a religion that addresses the mind  fights backwardness in all its forms  promotes freedom of thought  and allows for the assimilation of modern accomplishments. The Islamic civilization has been a source of inspiration  in the dissemination of its knowledge in various branches  for the nations of the world.131.	Similarly  and in conformity with the aims and principles of the United Nations  the League of Arab States has played an effective and constructive role in promoting political  economic  social  and cultural cooperation among its member States with a view to providing stability security and prosperity for the nations of the region. Yet  these endeavours by the League and its member States have always been confronted by a formidable obstacle which not only has impeded the establishment of peace  stability  and prosperity in the Middle East region  but also has threatened world peace and security. By this  I mean the unrelenting aggressive role played by Israel and its pernicious racist policy of settler colonialism. Israel's continued aggression is the core of the Palestinian cause and in fact runs counter to all those who subscribe to the right of self- determination for all peoples.132.	When we talk about Israeli aggression we do not describe it merely as aggression committed against a peaceful people settled in its natural homeland and the usurpation of its lands and properties  or even as the flagrant violation of the resolutions of this international Organization. Rather we refer to it as aggression against the moral values and lofty ideals of mankind.133.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is convinced that  notwithstanding the inadequate attempts and initiatives taking place in the Arab and international arenas and allegedly aimed at resolving the Palestinian problem  Israeli aggression continues unabated  in one form or another  notwithstanding the notion entertained by the optimistic advocates of Camp David that Israel will respond to legitimate demands if it feels that its security is guaranteed. On the contrary  realities demonstrate the opposite  for the practices of Israel still show that it is bent on territorial aggrandizement and is not interested in peace. The Israeli aggression has not ended  and it will not come to an end until Israel recognizes and accepts all the basic elements which constitute a solid foundation for a just peace that will ensure complete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  beginning with the Holy City of Jerusalem  and that will recognize the legitimate right of self- determination for the Palestinian people in their homeland. One of the most important of these ingredients is the necessity of the participation of the original and legitimate party to the conflictâto wit  the Palestinian people  represented by the PLO as their sole legitimate representative.134.	If we review the various resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly that condemn Israeli aggressive practices and support the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland in Palestine as well as affirm the Arab character of Jerusalem  we will find that none of these resolutions condone the untenable Israeli allegationsâincluding that of the ""secure borders"" myth propagated by Israelâand that they fail to advance any logical justification for Israel's continued occupation of the Arab territories. Israel is accordingly utilizing the idea of ""secure borders"" as a pretext for the continuation of its occupation of Arab lands  even though actual facts demonstrate that it is the Arabs and not Israel who require security. Israel has consistently been the aggressor. It is Israel which possesses more arms than the Arabs  and it is Israel whose security and integrity is guaranteed by both the East and West.135.	We are all aware that this Organization in its various organs has been seized of this problem for well over 30 years  during which it adopted many resolutions that were consistently ignored by an intransigent Israel.136.	For these reasons  it is our judgement that there is at this juncture not so much a need for new resolutions as an imperative requirement for serious action and measures to promote the implementation of the resolutions that have been adopted. We hope that increasing international awareness of the justice of this cause will encourage the adoption of such measures and help expose the colonial expansionist intentions of the Zionist entity that threaten security and stability in the Middle East and in the world at large. At this point I should like to commend the significant development with regard to the position of the members of the European Economic Community vis-a-vis the Palestinian problem  a position that reflects an understanding of the core of this problem and the necessity to resolve it on the basis of the Palestinian people's right to self- determination in conformity with the principles of right  justice and fairness.137.	We also believe that the time has come for the Security Council to change its concept of the Palestinian problem as one concerning homeless refugees. The Council should reconsider this attitude as the General Assembly did  from the standpoint that this is a case of a people whose rights  homeland  and properties have been usurped.138.	I am not informing you of anything new when I say that the Arabs are not the cause of the Middle East conflict; rather  this conflict has been thrust upon them. The Palestinian people have never been the aggressors or usurpers of other people's land; rather  history shows that they have been victims whose rights have been violated and whose land and property has been usurped.139.	The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reiterates its firm conviction that peace  security and stability will not be attained in the Middle East region or in the whole world unless there is a just and comprehensive resolution of the Palestinian problem that ensures the recognition of all the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish their own State in their own land; and unless there is a complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  including the Holy City of Jerusalem.140.	It also reiterates that any settlement of the Palestinian problem that does not lead to the return of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty and the guarantee of freedom of worship for Arab and non-Arab Moslems  Christians and Jews  is totally unacceptable. Jerusalem  with its religious significance and its geographic and demographic importance  is the main test of Israel's designs insofar as the implementation of the United Nations' resolutions is concerned.141.	Israel's expansionist and aggressive intentions require no proof. Its practices are clear evidence of these intentions; otherwise  how can we interpret the establishment of new settlements in the West Bank  Gaza  Jerusalem and the Golan Heights? How can we interpret the latest Israeli decision to allow its citizens to occupy privately owned land in the West Bank and Gaza? And how can we interpret the Israeli Prime Minister's statements that autonomy only applies to the inhabitants and not to the territories  meaning that the Palestinians have no rights to their lands  or to self- determination?142.	I should like to recall the historic speech delivered by His Holiness Pope John Paul II at the General Assembly on 2 October  and particularly to his emphasis on the spiritual ideals and values that should be espoused by the world in facing the various facets of materialism  in order to attain peace  justice and freedom. What the Pontiff advocated in his address is in keeping with what Islam and the Moslems call for. From this perspective  the followers of the three monotheistic religions must enjoy their rights of freedom of worship in the Holy City of Jerusalem. In order to meet this objective  we believe that Jerusalem must revert to Arab sovereignty so that all the faithful will enjoy complete freedom of worship on an equal footing.143.	All Arab States strive for peace and work for peace. But they have been patient long enough in the race of Israeli intransigence  and the time might come when they will find themselves compelled to adopt certain positions and experience specific and inescapable reactions in defence of their dignity and legitimate rights. The Arab States may differ in their attitudes with regard to international endeavours and initiatives  but they never differ in their desire for a just and comprehensive peace.144.	On the other hand  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia denounces and condemns in no uncertain terms the continued barbaric Israeli aggression on southern Lebanon. In an attempt to mislead public opinion  Israel claims  that the aim of its aggression in southern Lebanon is to protect itself from the Palestinian presence there. Needless to say  this is a distortion of facts  for the presence of Palestinians in southern Lebanon was  in the first place  a result of the Israeli aggression that displaced the Palestinian people from their original homeland. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls upon the international community in general  and the United Nations in particular  to take decisive measures to put an end to these acts of aggression in view of the dangers and threats they entail and their violation of the principles of international law as well as of lofty human values and ideals. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also urges those countries which provide Israel with manpower and military and economic support to cease such support  and to help put an end to the Israeli aggression and achieve peace and security.145.	The role played by the OAU in enhancing and strengthening co-operation among the African peoples  and in eliminating the causes of differences among those peoples  is also in conformity with the aims and principles of the United Nations.146.	The similarity between the economic and social problems faced by the Arab and the African peoples  who are both peoples of developing countries  helps bring them closer together in their objectives and approaches. It also reflects a firm desire on both sides for consolidation and understanding that has its roots in the mists of history. In addition  their political approaches in most cases have the same bases and similar sources emanating from their lofty ideals and common heritage. It is not surprising  therefore  that their policies are congruous and their positions similar in enhancing the precepts of justice  equality  and the right of self- determination and independence  as well as being in opposition to injustice  aggression  racism and imperialism.147.	In this respect  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reiterates its support of the just causes of liberation in Africa and the need to assist the African territories and peoples that are still under the yoke of colonialism and racism and in their legitimate struggle for gaining their independence and their inalienable rights. Saudi Arabia reaffirms its support of all international action aimed at meeting the legitimate aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe and in seeking recognition of the right of the national majority to govern their country.148.	In the meantime  Saudi Arabia condemns foreign interference in the affairs of the African continent which clearly poses a threat to the stability  security and peace in this continent and impedes its growth and development.149.	As the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia establishes its economic system on rational Islamic bases  it works diligently to incorporate these concepts in its international economic policies. It therefore endorses the system of free and just enterprise and rejects intimidation  exploitation and blackmail in all their forms.150.	In its diligent endeavour to contribute to any international effort towards achieving stability  Saudi Arabia reiterates its hope and desire for the establishment of a new international economic order more conducive to bringing about equity and respect for the rights of both the developed and developing countries  and to provide the necessary means of establishing a dynamic and balanced relationship between economic growth and political stability in all nations  particularly in the developing countries. Accordingly  my country has spared no effort in order to achieve this objective. In all international forums  it has pursued and is still pursuing this objective  hoping that the dialogue would be in the same constructive spirit that prevailed in the previous special sessions of the General Assembly  and the Conference on International Economic Cooperation   as well as at the fifth session of UNCTAD held recently at Manila. At this point  I would like to emphasize that my country is prepared to take part in any international effort to resume the dialogue in these areas in accordance with the aspirations of the Members of this Organization.151.	In adopting those objectives we fully believe in some established facts which indicate that the peoples of the world no longer live in isolation  but rather have come a long way towards increased and intensified mutual interdependence  and are no longer satisfied with subsistence living but aspire to a better life and higher standards of living. The realization of those two objectives has become the constant preoccupation of mankind.152.	These considerations are also manifested in some given factors that call for objectivity on our part and commit us to honesty and truth when we look at these issues. To conceal these facts from international public opinion does not serve the interests of humanity. In a similar vein  it is in the interest of no one if each imputes his failures to another. On the contrary  our interests demand that we should evolve a formula that aims at co-operation and succeeds in breaking the vicious circle. They call upon us to acknowledge that the achievement of the desired economic goal of progress and prosperity for the international community  and justice and equity for the developing countries in particular  is a joint responsibility involving everyone.153.	In this light it should be admitted that the voices which are raised from time to time accusing the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries of responsibility for fluctuations and disarray in the international economy are far removed from the truth. As a matter of fact  energy constitutes only a part of the world economic system  and even so the countries members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have assumed  and still are assuming  their full responsibility in this respect. The industrially advanced countries  both Western and Eastern  should also shoulder their full responsibility towards the world economy in general and the developing countries in particular.154.	Notwithstanding the fact that the issues we are considering this session are not new and have been discussed before  we still hope that our Organization will diligently press forward with the implementation of the resolutions we have previously adopted. We trust that this may be achieved  granted the existence of goodwill and determination."
"116",6072,"SDN",34,1979,"ï»¿I wish first to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to your distinguished position as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. You genuinely represent the aspirations of the African youth that led and still lead the liberation struggle. Your personal contribution to the struggle against colonialism and neo-colonialism and the persistent efforts you made in collaboration with your colleagues until the liberation and political independence of so many nations was achieved make us confident that under your leadership this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations will take more strides along the road of the peaceful resolution of conflicts  along the road of liberation of dependent people everywhere  and along the road leading to the achievement of a new international economic order.35.	May we also avail ourselves of this opportunity to express our gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Lievano of Colombia  for the skill and wisdom with which he guided the work of the previous session of the General Assembly.36.	We should not fail at this juncture also to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his persistent and consistent readiness to augment the effectiveness of the United Nations machinery in dealing with momentous issues so that causes of instability may be resolved  so that enduring and just peace may be established in areas of conflict  so that peace may be maintained everywhere in the world  and so that fair international economic co-operation is developed and maintained among the young nations and the old.37.	Allow me to offer Sudan's congratulations to Saint Lucia on its admission to the forum of the family of nations. Saint Lucia is another evidence of the winds of change now blowing in the direction of southern Africa.38.	This session has been convened at a time of a very complex international  political and economic situation. During this Assembly's session  hotbeds of tension and instability that threaten world peace and security have increased in number and complexity  developing side-effects that themselves could be potential causes of further conflict and instability in the world.39.	My country firmly believes that the non-aligned movement plays a major role in the course of international relations  and we are keen to have that movement remain a framework that unites its members  a forum where they can develop and crystallize their views and positions  and an umbrella under which they can find protection from unstable international conditions. We were indeed gratified that the Sixth Conference of the non-aligned countries  which was recently convened in Havana  reflected our expectations of that movement  our belief in its future and the fact that  despite the difficulties it experiences these days  it still has enough flexibility and vitality to protect itself from the dangers of division and decline  to preserve its unity and strength and to develop its capacity for overcoming all the differences prevailing in its ranks and for reaching agreements on broad programmes which incorporate the political  economic and social issues of concern to its members and to the world at large.40.	A quick glance at the present international situation will indicate beyond any doubt that we still have a long way to go in our effort to lay down the fundamental basis for international peace and security. Nevertheless some encouraging signs of rapprochement recently appeared on the international scene  especially between the two super-Powers. It was with great satisfaction and appreciation that the world received the news of the successful conclusion of the second round of negotiations in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT). We urge the two signatories of the Treaty to persuade their respective legislative and other internal organs to ratify it for the sake of humanity. It will undoubtedly pave the way for the achievement of more understanding and co-operation in other areas of vital international interest. The interests of humanity everywhere are better served when the members of the international com-munity abandon the path of detrimental cut-throat confrontation in pursuance of conflicting strategies and adopt instead the path of direct dialogue and negotiations.41.	We live in a very unhappy world: a world which has witnessed more than 150 wars  both civil and international  since 1945; a world which has suffered and is still suffering from hunger  even starvation  and shortage of resources  and a lack of health equipment and educational facilities. Yet this same world allocates over $400 billion to stockpiling  producing and developing weapons of mass destructionâthe mass destruction of civilizations  of mankind and of the very planet on which we live and have our being.42.	The arms race and armaments production can in no way be separated from the problems of development. We urge that appropriate measures be taken immediately to divert some of the resources allocated for armaments production and procurement to socioeconomic development  for that is the only guarantee that we may live in a world which is rational  fair and secure.43.	In this respect we welcomed with high expectations the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament. In spite of the fact that that session's achievements were limited in scope  we nevertheless regard it as a positive step on the long road leading to disarmament. It was a positive step  because it was the first time in the history of the United Nations that a special session had been convened to deal with disarmament on a global scale. The most significant outcome of that special session in my Government's view  was the convening of the Committee on Disarmament. We hope and pray that that Committee  under the mandate assigned to it by the General Assembly and with the active participation of all armaments- producing countries  including the nuclear Powers  will be able in due course to negotiate a number of significant agreements in that field. We look forward to the implementation of the recommendations of that special sessionâno matter how limited they are in scope and magnitude.44.	The Sudan  a non-aligned country  associates itself with all those who call for a safe and secure world  free from the evils of war and the looming threat of a nuclear holocaust. This can be achieved only through general and complete disarmament and by adopting effective measures that would outlaw nuclear war  reverse the pace of the nuclear arms race and progressively reduce the nuclear stockpiles until they are totally eliminated. A safe and secure world would also call for the creation of nuclear-free zones  particularly in Africa  the Middle East and the Indian Ocean. In this respect  we should like to take this opportunity to commend the Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean in July 1979; we consider it a positive step in the direction of a global conference on the Indian Ocean.45.	We have always attached great importance to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  because the implementation of that Declaration would affect all maritime routes involving the Gulf and the Red Sea. The security of the Red Sea ranks high among our priorities in the Sudan.46.	It is our deepest hope that all countries of the region that share our concern will join hands and cooperate to ensure that the Red Sea becomes a haven of peace  so that all forms of foreign hegemony and superpower rivalry are eliminated and all regional problems are settled through constructive dialogue and in a spirit of co-operation  fraternity and good neighbourliness. We want the Red Sea to be an international commercial route and a fishing areaâand no more.47.	My country  which had the honour to be Chairman of the OAU in 1978-1979  was offered a unique opportunity to study in depth the complexity of problems facing the African continent. Africa  which for ages has fallen prey to exploitation  enslavement  poverty  suppression and all forms of segregation and foreign intervention  is still suffering from all these evils. Some of its rich economic resources are still exploited for the benefit of the dominant outsiders. Its children are still victims of hunger  malnutrition  environmental diseases and lack of essential health care. Millions of its sons and daughters are still considered slaves in their own motherland  and millions are treated as second- or third- or fourth-class citizens without the rights to which their natural citizenship entitles them.48.	It is to be noted with dismay and regret that  despite the acuteness of all these problems  attempts at appropriate and fair solutions are still lagging far behind. The problems of the African continent have proved to be more serious and chronic  to the extent that the current attempts to deal with them can hardly produce any significant progress. It should  however  be realized that any solution that gives priority to foreign and alien interests over the interests and the aspirations of the African people is certainly doomed to failure.49.	Because I am aware of the heavy programme of this General Assembly  it is not my intention to delve into all African problems. Rather  I would confine my remarks to the main urgent issues that confront the continent today.50.	It is observed with much regret that the Government of South Africa  by its intransigence  has brought back the situation in Namibia to the initial position of stalemate. As a result of this  all the international efforts which were exerted in the last few years to bring about a fair and just settlement in Namibia have failed. By its conduct  the Government of South Africa has made it clear that any settlement that does not put Namibia under its direct control will not be acceptable. The African countries and SWAPO demonstrated flexibility and goodwill when the African Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  at its fifteenth ordinary session  held at Khartoum in 1978  endorsed the Luanda agreement of 1978s as an acceptable framework for a peaceful solution of the problems of that area.51.	The African countries welcomed the initiative of the five Western Powers and assured them of their unlimited co-operation. Regardless of all that  the South African Government had decided to go along with the scenario which it has drawn up for Namibia and which aims at the perpetuation of its illegal occupation and annexation of that country. The internal elections unilaterally conducted by the Government of South Africa in Namibia  which were categorically rejected by the whole international community as a fraud and a fabrication  were but an indication of what South Africa was trying to achieve. The relentless and brutal harassment of the leaders and supporters of SWAPO and the campaigns to liquidate them physically and politically is yet another indication of South Africa's attempts to consolidate its control over Namibia and to silence the voice of resistance forever. But can the voice of truth and reason be silenced? It cannot be silenced for long. Time and the history of similar episodes elsewhere are not on the side of the Government of South Africa. Apartheid and racism will have to disappear sooner than South Africa expects.52.	Zimbabwe is another problem area where people are struggling against racism and white minority rule. But we all know that the United Kingdom has historical  legal and international responsibilities towards Zimbabwe. And now we have received with satisfaction and optimism the recent United Kingdom initiative to convene an all-party conference in London following the decisions adopted by the Meeting of Heads of Government of the Commonwealth Countries  held in Lusaka last August. We have been following with interest and concern the course of the negotiations. We were pleased that some measure of break-through could now be achieved. We believe that the United Kingdom will continue to use its full statesmanship  diplomacy and common sense to bring about a successful conclusion to these talks  for their failure is bound to render a fatal blow to the prospects of peace in that region.53.	The international community represented in this General Assembly is well aware of the dangerous nature of the policies and practices of the apartheid regime in South Africa; that is why this item was included in the General Assembly's agenda in 1946  and has continued to appear before this distinguished body ever since. We regret to observe the absence of any meaningful progress towards the eventual eradication of this evil and inhuman practice in South Africa.54.	Many African States have followed with patience and restraint the deteriorating situation in South Africa and carried on negotiations within the OAU and in consultations with friendly countries in the United Nations. We should like to sound the alarm that Africa might find itself with no alternative but to be drawn into unavoidable confrontation with the racist regime in South Africa  if the latter should persist in its violation of the United Nations resolutions. We call upon the international community  and all Member States  to observe the immediate and strict application of Security Council resolution 418 (1977)  concerning the arms embargo  and to ensure the termination of all forms of political and economic co-operation with the Government of South Africa.55.	Africa salutes the heroic role of the African frontline States in support of the African liberation struggle. Sudan calls upon all peace-loving nations and forces to extend all possible assistance to the front-line States to enable them to participate effectively in the struggle to liberate southern Africa. We further urge all Member States to offer all necessary facilities to strengthen and consolidate the liberation movements recognized by the OAU in their struggle against racist regimes in southern Africa.56.	The deteriorating situation in the Middle East  described in the report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization  continues to pose a serious threat to world peace and security  besides causing tragedy  suffering and the denial of basic human rights to the people of that region. In that respect  we observe with great concern and dismay the intransigence of Israel in perpetuating its occupation of the Arab territories; its expansionist policy  as demonstrated by the consolidation of Israeli settlements in Arab lands and the pursuit of unwarranted measures for changing the historical nature and the demography of Al Quds; its refusal to recognize the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people; and its pursuit of hostile policies in defiance of world public opinion.57.	The daily Israeli raids against Lebanon from the sea and air and across the frontier  which have resulted in thousands of civilian casualties  not only constitute aggression against the sovereignty  territorial integrity and safety of the people of Lebanon  but stand as a flagrant violation of the principles and objectives of our Organization and a clear demonstration of the deep crisis that afflicts the world conscience today.58.	My country advocates peace in the Middle East. We genuinely believe that the resolution of the persistent strife in the area should be attained by peaceful means  that is  by dialogue and negotiations. However  for that to be achieved  a high degree of determination and political will must prevail among all those concerned. It is with this understanding that we have kept calling in different forums for a peaceful  comprehensive and equitable approach to the exploding situation in the Middle East. Yet  while approaching the question with such an understanding  we must hold steadfastly to what our Organization has continuously confirmed in respect of the essential prerequisites for the establishment of a just and durable peace in the Middle East. In the forefront of these conditions is the recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  foremost among which is their right to establish their own State on their own territory and the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab lands  including the restoration of Arab sovereignty in Al Quds.59.	Let us recall once again that a great number of resolutions of this Assembly have already affirmed that the Palestinian problem is the core of the Middle Eastern question. Consequently  this problem should be resolved in a manner such as to restore the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in the context of the quest for a peaceful approach and a comprehensive solution to the whole issue of the crisis in the Middle East.60.	It is also important to point out here that Arab solidarity is a crucial necessity for the achievement of these objectives and that this solidarity should be secured. This  too  is in keeping with our call for a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East question. My country has been moving in that direction for quite a long time  despite all difficulties and complications.61.	It is also pertinent in that respect to note that the present situation in the international arena reveals that considerable success has been realized by the PLO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  in terms of a wide range of political and moral support. This world support should be noted carefully by all concerned. No one anywhere does service to his people  his Government  or his cause by ignoring this strong international public opinion.62.	My Government's position with regard to the Korean question has always been based on our commitment to the principle of the resolution of disputes through dialogue and negotiation and the rejection of the use of force and foreign intervention. We believe that all efforts for the reunification of Korea should be encouraged and consolidated.63.	In Cyprus  favourable conditions should be created to enable the two communities to resolve their differences in a spirit of peace and fraternity  under the auspices of the United Nations.64.	Human rights questions cannot be considered in isolation from their economic  social and political aspects. We firmly believe that it is essential to guarantee and observe human rights for individuals. Equally we believe that this should be matched by effective guarantees of human rights for entire nations and communities. It would be illogical and unfair to demand human rights for individuals alone  while whole nations and communities are denied such basic rights.65.	While on this subject  allow me to express on behalf of my Government our profound appreciation of the United Nations organs which work in the field of human rights  for the valuable efforts they are exerting for the effective realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We believe that those organs cannot continue to function effectively unless Member States respect their commitments as embodied in the United Nations Charter. We are particularly pleased to note the positive developments that emerged from the considerable debate conducted last year on alternative approaches  ways and means within the United Nations system  for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights. We also appreciate the continuing debate within the Commission on Human Rights on the study of the national  regional and international dimensions of the right to development as a human right  which takes into consideration the problems facing the developing countries in their efforts to achieve social and economic progress.66.	One of the issues to which we accord the utmost importance and considerable attention is the question of refugees. The whole world is fully aware of the acute suffering of the refugee coerced into leaving his homeland for an alien environment to face insurmountable hardshipsâlack of shelter from rain  cold and heat; lack of food; lack of medical care; the disruption of family and community social cohesion; loss of educational opportunities and prolongedâindeed  indefiniteâloss of the political  social and economic rights that go with citizenship.67.	True to our convictions and faithful to our commitments to regional and international conventions on the rights of refugees and observance of brotherly and good-neighbourly relations  the Sudan is currently acting as host to over 400 000 registered refugees who fled into the country from many neighbouring States. This number is too large for a country with severely limited resources like the Sudan. The Sudan will not  however  compel refugees to return to their country of origin against their will  despite our difficulties. We stand for and encourage voluntary repatriation conducted under the auspices of one of the great bodies of this Organization  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.68.	As the host country to 400 000 refugees  we feel that it is our responsibility to call upon the international community to respond to previous appeals by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to create financial and material assistance to host countries through the High Commissioner as well as through bilateral channels. The recent suggestion advanced by the Government of the United States of America at Geneva and here in this Assembly to create a refugee fund to which States Members of the United Nations and others might contribute should be adopted by the Assembly at its thirty-fourth session. The Secretary-General and his deputy and assistant  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  should be commended for all the efforts they have exerted up to this point to obtain relief  comfort and sympathy for refugees all over the world.69.	To talk at length about relief and the organized settlement of refugees in the country of asylum is not  certainly  to recommend their permanent settlement there and their renunciation of the privilege of returning home. They want to go home  but they cannot safely do so unless the root-causes which forced them to seek refuge have been resolved. In this connexion  the General Assembly should urge all Member States concerned to find political solutions to the internal problems that gave birth to the exodus of nationals from their homelands. This is in keeping with the United Nations call for respect for the human rights of individuals and for the dignity of the human person  for no human being can be expected to enjoy those rights while he floats aimlessly and without destination for months on end in a small boat without shelter in Southeast Asia  or while he is crouching under a tree for hours in a torrential rain in tropical Africa or in Latin America  or while he is being constantly subjected to the alternate heat and cold of deserts in the Middle East and elsewhere.70.	It is a reality in the world of today that social  cultural  humanitarian  political and economic issues are interrelated. Hence  in our endeavour to establish a new international economic order  greater attention should be paid to social  cultural and humanitarian issues. Bearing this in mind  my country  in its development efforts  gives a balanced consideration to all these issues.71.	In this context  the Sudan welcomes the United Nations efforts to improve the status of women and looks forward to the conclusion of the draft convention on the elimination of discrimination against women. We also welcome the forthcoming World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality  Development and Peace  to be held in Copenhagen next year.72.	The Sudanese people  together with the peoples of other nations of the world  are celebrating this year the International Year of the Child. The special message of President Gaafar Mohamed Nimeiri  addressed to the nation on this occasion on 15 January 1979  was an indication of the special attention the Sudan accords to the child when he said:""In joining the international community in commemorating this year  we hope that the International Year of the Child will be a year for the protection and care of the child not only now  but in the future also. We hope that the International Year of the Child will be not merely an occasion for the declaration of rights  but a year in which the international community will exert its efforts to create an appropriate climate for the upbringing of children everywhere free from fear and hunger  free from coercion and domination and free from disease  ignorance and deprivation. This sought-after dream will not be realized for every child throughout the world until peace based on justice prevails; until the disparities between the rich States and the poor States are removed . . .73.	In reviewing the international economic and social scene of the decade of the 1970s now drawing to a close  one cannot but express concern at the modest progress achieved. For the last seven years the crises besetting the world economy have multiplied. We have faced the population explosion  low rates of economic growth  a spiralling inflation and deteriorating prices of raw materials from developing countries in contrast to rising prices of finished industrial goods and the price of oil.74.	It should be of concern to us gathered here to control these crises through organized and coordinated effective international effort to alleviate the abject poverty rampant in developing countries and rising unemployment everywhere in the world. To do this will involve a hard look at and radical change in the structure of the international relations based on old colonial relations. It should involve in the 1980s a complete overhaul of that aspect of the structure of the international economy which gives one partner the power to set the rules of the game  and the other the very humble role of playing according to those rules. Five years ago this Organization passed a resolution to face and change part of this old economic arrangement and replace it with the establishment of the new international economic order. As we leave this decade behind and enter a new one  we are still no nearer to that order than we were five years ago.75.	Last May  the developing countries went to Manila with great expectations that the fifth session of UNCTAD would resolve many outstanding economic issues. They came back disappointed  as that lengthy conference did not achieve much. None the less  it is worthy of note that a break-through in the special field of commodities has been achieved through the establishment of the Common Fund for commodities as one of the components of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. This progress  modest as it is  should give hope for better co-operation in future among Member States and nations at large.76.	In its report recently on world development  the World Bank indicated that despite the promises by donor Governments and some recent decisions on debt cancellation  which we appreciate  the flows of official development assistance fell in real terms. The official development assistance from developed markets and centrally planned economies is still far below the 0.7 per cent gross national product target set for the Second United Nations Development Decade. We are now approaching the third United Nations development decade but an agreement on the strategy for it is yet to be reached. Let us work to reach this agreement at the very beginning of the 1980s.77.	The developed countries should demonstrate greater willingness in the coming decade to make an increased transfer of resources in real terms to the developing countries. This should result in an improved economic growth in these countries and the consequent emergence of a more prosperous and stable international economy. We urge that this session of the General Assembly should nave these important problems tackled and resolved.78.	It is our earnest hope that this session of the General Assembly will be able to examine meaningfully and candidly the manifold problems which confront the world today. It is our hope  too  and our expectation that this session will exert enough political will to outline some of the solutions which are urgently needed to ease the tensions  the plights and the fears which threaten to engulf mankind."
"117",6118,"SEN",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like first of all  on behalf of my Government  the people of the Republic of Senegal and His Excellency Mr. Leopold Sedar Senghor  to express to you our most heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of your brilliant election to the presidency of this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The outstanding personal qualities you have already shown as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  your thorough knowledge of the work and procedures of the United Nations and the very effective and positive way in which you have joined the constructive and progressive forces of a new world order free of injustice and discriminationâall this confirms our conviction that this session of the General Assembly will  under your wise and clear guidance  discharge its heavy responsibilities at this difficult time for mankind  which is today buffeted by crises of all kinds.85.	We should also like to convey our congratulations to our colleague Mr. Indalecio Lievano  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia  who so competently guided the work of the last session of the General Assembly. He deserves our warmest praise  and my delegation and I congratulate him on the way in which he directed the work of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.86.	We should be remiss in fulfilling our duties if we did not also express our thanks and gratitude to the person who for a number of years has so perfectly embodied the ideals of our international Organization  the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his very lucid and comprehensive report on the work of the Organization in which he has so well described the present state of international relations and through which he has demonstrated his true qualities as an intelligent diplomat in his sincere and constant efforts to promote the establishment of genuine international peace and security  which is indispensable for the well- being of mankind.87.	On behalf of my country  Senegal  I should like to extend our warmest congratulations to the delegation of Saint Lucia  whose country has just been admitted as the one hundred and fifty-second Member of our Organization.88.	Every session of our Assembly gives us an opportunity to look back at the year gone by  to review the problems which are at the forefront of our concerns and at the same time to suggest the most appropriate ways and means of achieving a just and lasting solution to those problems.89.	The latest sessions of the General Assembly have been characterized by the emergence of rather deep differences  which have sometimes made of our yearly debates a kind of confrontation  the genuine significance of which has not always been clearly perceived by all.90.	This is true as regards the evolution of the situation in Africa  and especially southern Africa  where the time for decisions finally seems to have arrived. Such a spectacular change is certainly not due only to the fact that international public opinion has suddenly awoken to events in this region of our continent  although it had been kept well informed of them. It is first and foremost the result of the work of the Africans themselves  who  with the help of their friends  have throughout the years learned better to defend their rights in order to reconquer their freedom in dignity and equality. 91.	The fact is that the peoples of Africa are becoming aware of their affinities  and constantly drawing close together. While Africans have in the past been divided by seemingly insurmountable barriers  they are today becoming more and more aware of their indivisibility  in spite of forces of tension  conflict and the social advantages or disadvantages that tend to distract them year after year from the basic concerns of their peoples. Africans are indeed becoming more and more awareâ and this is a positive factorâthat their main source of peace and security resides in mutual understanding of their respective problems and in steadfast and constant collective efforts to overcome inertia.92.	Nevertheless  our present hope is seriously threatened by pressing problems affecting both the awareness of this human quest for peace and social justice and its continuity. These problems  as they appear to us in the situation in southern Africa  have today reached crisis dimensions. Indeed  persistent colonialism  the effective domination by a racist minority and an odious policy of apartheid seem to be determined to oppose the inevitable emancipation of all of Africa. This unjust and cruel effort must not  however  prevail over the firm determination and desire of the African peoples to free themselves of the chains of oppression and injustice.93.	My country  Senegal  has always provided unfailing and constructive support to all oppressed peoples struggling for their freedom and inalienable rights. We hereby solemnly reaffirm this support  and we should like at the same time to renew our commitment unreservedly to support the legitimate efforts of all peoples throughout the world struggling to achieve self-determination and independence  to regain peace and to safeguard justice.94.	Thus  my country  Senegal  had with regard to Namibia in the past stressed and rightly valued the constructive efforts made individually or collectively by certain African or Western States to find a solution on the basis of the resolutions and decision of the United Nations. Unfortunately  we must once more acknowledge that these efforts have not yet been successful because of the obvious stubbornness of South Africa to maintain its colonial domination over the Territory of Namibia. But our efforts will eventually be crowned with victory.95.	It will be recalled that on 20 May last  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of South Africa announced his Government's decision to transform the so-called Constituent Assembly of Windhoek into a National Assembly and at the same time to confer executive powers upon some of its members.96.	By that decision  the Government of South Africa was putting an end to all hopes for the implementation of the plan adopted by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978). That defiance of the entire international community as well as of the United Nations itself shows the extent to which the South African Government has disregarded the international Organization  our Organization. It is time for our Assembly to assume its responsibilities and to put an end to the illegal presence of South Africa in Namibia.97.	Senegal believes that the United Nations Council for Namibia and its powers must be strengthened. The United Nations Council for Namibia remains the legal authority for Namibia until the Territory becomes truly independent. In this connexion it must be given the full support of all the Members of our Organization  as well as their consistent understanding.98.	Senegal also believes that our brothers from SWAPO  the sole and authentic liberation movement of the Namibian people  must be given the material  moral  diplomatic and  if need be  military assistance to enable them to achieve the aspirations of the Namibian people for genuine independence within a united Namibia.99.	In this respect  I should like to pay a resounding tribute from this rostrum  and on behalf of our President  Mr. Leopold Sedar Senghor  to the SWAPO freedom fighters who  despite arrests and arbitrary detention  crimes  and other acts of violence perpetrated by the illegal administration of South Africa against African populations  continue  under the guidance of our brother and friend Sam Nujoma  to fight courageously and firmly for the triumph of the aspirations of all the Namibian people  of whom they alone are the authentic representatives.100.	One source of comfort is the fact that today it is undeniable that an equitable and lasting solution to the question of Namibia is inconceivable without the full and direct participation of SWAPO  which undeniably has demonstrated its political maturity throughout the action which has led to the settlement plan adopted by the Security Council. In this spirit  Senegal opposes the recognition of any puppet regime which South Africa might one day wish to impose on the Namibians. We continue to believe that only concerted international action  both powerful and organized  can compel South Africa to accept the implementation of the Western settlement plan  whose fate has become more and more uncertain.101.	In the face of this situation  my country once more appeals to the international community for support and assistance so that effective sanctions may be applied against South Africa pursuant to Chapter VII of our Charter as a means of pressure to induce the South African Government to comply with Security Council resolutions 385(1976) and 435(1978). Senegal wishes to take this opportunity to invite the Security Council to take all necessary measures to implement its settlement plan.102.	As regards the problem of Zimbabwe and in keeping with the position adopted by most of the States Members of the United Nations  Senegal feels that there can be no genuine independence without the establishment of a majority Government. We feel that any settlement concerning the future of that Territory must be prepared with the full participation of the Patriotic Front  the only genuine liberation movement of the people of Zimbabwe  under the enlightened guidance of our brothers Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe.103.	It is now time to recall solemnly that an inaccurate press release had indicated that my country had recognized the Muzorewa regime a few months ago. This was never the case and never will be the case. I should like  on behalf of my Government  and most categorically  to disclaim such a piece of information.104.	During the thirty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  the delegation of Senegal  it will be recalled  actively participated in the preparation and adoption of resolutions 33/38 A and B. It is true that new developments have occurred since then  but it is just as true that at the point where improvements were expected  further flaws  lacks of understanding and inaccuracies occurred which have further complicated the Namibian situation.105.	But it is difficult to consider that  on the basis of these elections  it is impossible to see a favourable evolution towards a conference of all the parties concerned  thanks to the relevant work of certain African Statesâsuch as Nigeriaâwhich stressed at Lusaka the importance of working towards an effective solution to that problem. And it was precisely in Lusaka  at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  that the idea of a conference that would include the participation of all parties concerned was put forward. That Conference is now taking place in London.106.	The news which we have heard from London in this respect seems highly encouraging to us. It seems that  as regards the representation of the white minority  after two weeks of difficult negotiations an agreement has been reached among the parties  so that the black majority will finally hold the reins of power in Namibia.107.	We fervently hope that on the other points remaining to be discussed  everything will be done by the Government of the United Kingdom to reach a comprehensive and honest agreement in order to spare the people of Zimbabwe the atrocities of war  which they have been experiencing for some time and whose effects and hardships are being sorely felt in all the neighbouring countries.108.	My delegation feels that the United Kingdom  which has an important role to play in this situation  should not in any way consider the lifting of sanctions taken against Rhodesia until the negotiations underway lead to a solution which is satisfactory both to all the parties concerned and to the international community as a whole. We feel that an authentic peace  a lasting peace  in southern Africa requires constant progress on all the fronts involving the oppression and exploitation of peoples which now characterize that part of our continent. It is clear that the use of armed force to achieve liberation has not been the chosen method of Africa. In fact  that method has been imposed upon us because there has never been and there will never be any possible compromise on the sacred objective of total liberation and the complete elimination of the vestiges of colonialism  neo-colonialism  imperialism  the domination of the racist minority  and apartheid.109.	As regards Western Sahara  during the thirty- third session of the General Assembly  my country voted in favour of resolution 33/31 B  which invited ""the Organization of African Unity to take prompt action to find a just and equitable settlement of the question of Western Sahara"".110.	It nevertheless turned out that during its Assembly of Heads of State and Government which was held at Monrovia in July  the Organization of African Unity [OA U] adopted  by a vote to which 1 do not wish to refer directly  a resolution promoting a general cease-fire and the organization on the territory of the Western Sahara of a referendum offering the populations concerned a choice between the maintenance of the status quo and independence.111.	Since then  many events which were foreseeable in July have taken place in that area. The problem of the Sahara has become a conflict between two neighbouring Arab States  regardless of whether such a conflict was desired. This is the substantive issue  and it cannot be resolved until direct dialogue is promoted between the Heads of State of those two countries. That is why the President of the Republic of Senegal  His Excellency  Leopold Sedar Senghor  had relevantly proposed  during the last session of the OAU Assembly  a meeting of the heads of State of the parties concerned under the auspices of the special committee of the five African heads of State in order to find a just and lasting solution to this conflict which has lasted too long. But we are convinced that the wisdom and devotion of our neighbours to the sovereignty and independence of Africa will certainly prevail in this issue and will lead to a just and lasting solution of the conflict in the Western Sahara.112.	With regard to the question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte  the delegation of Senegal is pleased at the efforts made by the French and Comorian Governments to resolve this important problem through dialogue. Contacts have taken place  and they are very encouraging for the result of the current negotiations  especially as the two parties concerned have decided  by common agreement and as a sign of goodwill  to exchange diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level.113.	As is known  African problems are not the only problems of concern to my country. Indeed  Senegal is particularly concerned by the situation in the Middle East and the question of Palestine. The tension prevailing in that part of the world is  need we recall  a serious threat to international peace and security. The climate of violence as well as the attitude of Israel towards the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people are serious obstacles to peace in the region. As is known  the Government of the Republic of Senegal is and has always been in favour  both as a matter of principle and in its actions  of any dialogue between the parties to a conflict. And if  as has been mentioned here  the agreements reached between certain parties to the conflict did not cover a wide enough range of the aspects of the Middle East conflict  thus making it possible to hope for a settlement ensuring comprehensive  lasting and just peace involving all aspects of the problem  it is none the less true that these agreements do have some positive features which we cannot neglect  even though they may be inadequate to lead to a global solution. Permit me at this time to commend the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People as well as its chairman  our compatriot Mr. Medoune Fall  for the work accomplished to the benefit of the fraternal people of Palestine despite all the difficulties which must be overcome daily by that Committee in the fulfilment of its mandate.â114.	My country unreservedly condemns the occupation by Israel of Palestinian and other Arab territories  including the holy city of Jerusalem  whose Arab and Islamic nature must be preserved. My country intends to step up its efforts with the Palestinian and Arab peoples as well as with all justice-loving and peace- loving peoples to achieve that goal. Moreover  my country forcefully reaffirms that no just and lasting peace is possible in the Middle East until an acceptable and complete solution can be found to the problem of Palestine  a solution based on the exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including  of course  its right of return and the right to independence and national sovereignty of Palestine under the guidance of its sole authentic representative  the PLO.115.	In mentioning the problem and the conflict in the Middle East  my country cannot gloss over the dispute existing between Israel and my country  which  incidentally  maintain no diplomatic relations  as a result of the arrest of Regimental Sergeant-Major Papa Coly Sarr of Senegal  a member of UNIFIL.116.	As everyone knows  my country Senegal feels no hatred towards Jews in general or towards Israelis in particular  for history has demonstrated that each of the ""three suffering peoples""  the blacks  the Arabs and the Jews  has brought to the world an irreplaceable message  Need we recall that during the British Mandate two peoples were struggling for independence: the Jewish people on the one hand and the Palestinian Arab people  composed of both Moslems and Christians  on the other? Our view  held by Senegalese statesmen since as early as 1948  was that each struggling people had a right to establish a free State in Palestine. The Jewish people have achieved self-determination with the foundation of the State of Israel. The United Nations must also enable the Palestinian Arab people to achieve self-determination by founding an independent State on Palestinian lands now occupied by Israel. And that is  moreover  the idea that was met by the partition decided upon by the United Nations in 1948  which led to the creation of the State of Israel. But we will go even further: there can be no definitive peace between Jews and Arabs until all occupied territories are freed and until the just cause of the struggling Palestinian people is finally satisfied. Israel must consider itself as one Semitic State among other Semitic States.117.	In February 1979  during a supply mission. Regimental Sergeant-Major Papa Coly Sarr was arrested by the Israeli authorities  who then accused him of having supplied explosives to the Palestinians. They tried him and condemned him to 10 years imprisonment. It is an elementary principle of law that one cannot be both judge and party to a case  as the Israeli Government has been. The Secretary-General of the United Nations had the great vision to understand  quite rightly  that it was an international tribunal designated by the United Nations that should have tried Regimental Sergeant-Major Sarr. It is this that we have unceasingly requested  and we feel that it is our right. We do not intendâand let me make this very clearâto enter into any contact with the Israeli Government  or even less to negotiate with it  in order to obtain the application of international law in the case of Regimental Sergeant-Major Sarr  This is for reasons of principle and dignity. We place our confidence in the international community and particularly in the United Nations. We are in no way prejudging the decision of the future international court  but simply say that judging from the dossier of the accused  it does not seem that he could have actedâand indeed he could not have actedâfrom reasons of venality.118.	The United Nations knows that it is in duty bound to require that the Israeli Government refer the case of Regimental Sergeant-Major Sarr to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We know the qualities and the probity of Mr. Waldheim and are thus able to reaffirm here our solemn conviction that law will triumph over force and reason over injustice.119.	I would like to reaffirm the constant support of my country  Senegal  and its President  Mr. Leopold Sedar Senghor  for the just struggle of the fraternal people of Palestine and the PLO  their sole authentic representative  and for our brother and our friend President Yasser Arafat  whose untiring struggle for justice  freedom and dignity for our Palestinian brothers re-quires a particular tribute.120.	I cannot neglect to reiterate our active solidarity with our Arab brothers  so that  together  we will spare no effort for the total liberation of the Arab territories occupied by Israel in June 1967  for the restoration to Jerusalem of its Islamic and Arab character without any hindrance  as stated in resolutions adopted by the Al- Quds committee of the Tenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers at its last meeting at Fez  Morocco in May and to ensure that the three great religions may co-operate in the region as they have done since ancient times.121.	With regard to Lebanon  the object of repeated  senseless attacks by Israel  I should like to state that my country  which has always maintained excellent relations with Lebanon  forcefully condemns these acts of aggression  which violate the integrity  independence and sovereignty of that nation.122.	Senegal  which is a member of UNIFIL  cannot accept these acts which undermine the credibility of the United Nations and which place in danger the existence of a Member State.123.	On the question of Cyprus  my delegation is in favour of the resumption  in a positive and constructive way  of intercommunal negotiations conducted freely and on the basis of equality and of the detailed and specific proposals put forward by the parties concerned  in order to achieve  as soon as possible  a mutually acceptable agreement based on the legitimate rights of the two Cypriot communities  Greek and the Turkish.124.	These hotbeds of tension  which are serious threats to international peace and security  are unfortunately not the only problems which endanger the very survival of all of mankind. A phenomenon threatens us which could have as its consequences the irremediable destruction of mankind itself: the arms race. This un-bridled race  as certain of my colleagues have already said here  takes the form of the accumulation of frightful means capable of wiping out in an instant the sum total of man's efforts and progress since the dawn of time  together with the permanent risk of nuclear holocaust  the senseless waste of non-renewable natural resources  the absence of genuine progress in disarmament negotiations and the more and more frequent use of force in international relations should give rise to a heightened awareness throughout the world of this threat of self-destruction which faces all of mankind today.125.	Hence  the Government and people of Senegal attach great importance to this problem  and for this reason the President of my country  His Excellency Leopold Sedar Senghor  spoke personally in the general debate during the tenth special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament  and stressed die dangers of this ruinous arms race to the social and economic progress of all nations and in particular to that of the developing countries. That is why His Excellency President Leopold Sedar Senghor proposed from this rostrum the imposition of a 5 per cent tax on the military budgets of States and the transfer of resources thus released to aid for the developing countries.126.	Contrary to expectations  that special session did not fulfil all the hopes of international public opinion; although we must acknowledge that in certain sectors considerable progress was recorded. We hope that the next special session to be devoted to disarmament will yield practical  more tangible results.127.	My country's keen interest in this question of disarmament was once more demonstrated by the convening in Dakar on 9-10 February 1979  at the request of the international community  of an international seminar on ""The Interrelationship between Disarmament Problems and Development""  organized under the aegis of the World Council for Peace. In his opening statement on that occasion  the Prime Minister of the Republic of Senegal  Mr. Abdou Diouf  said:""In the developed countries which have the most sizable military budgets  it is undeniable that the arms race has taken place to the detriment of progress in sensitive social sectors and has contributed to the aggravation of certain harmful phenomenaâ such as inflation; trade imbalances and international payments deficits.""Mr. Diouf continued:""But in our view as third-world countries  with the threat to international peace and security and  more seriously still  to the fate of humanity  the major consequence of the arms race is that it creates a serious obstacle to the establishment of a new inter-national economic order. Once again it is the squandering of vast resources as a result of competition in weaponry that considerably reduces the efforts that should be made to help the developing countries overcome their serious economic and social difficulties.""128.	We should also like to express our deep concern over the apparent possession of nuclear weapons by South Africa and Israel. Those two countries  which have been flagrantly violating the Charter of the United Nations  as well as principles and resolutions of our Organization  would be seriously endangering international security if by their possession of nuclear weapons they were to resort to inadmissible blackmail.129.	I wish to reiterate at this session the proposals made by my delegation at the special session on disarm-ament and at the last session of the Disarmament Com-mission. They are: first  the establishment of a universal surveillance and verification system in connexion with the disarmament agreements; secondly  the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa; thirdly  the close co-ordination of activities aimed at promoting disarmament and development  especially through the reduction of military budgets and the transfer of funds thus released to the development of the least developed countries; and  fourthly  the large-scale dissemination of information and the promotion of disarmament studies so that world public opinion can be better and more accurately informed about the catastrophic dangers which the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction pose to mankind.130.	We are pleased at the progress already achieved by our Organization in this field and hope that further progress will be recorded during this session.131.	In a world of a few rich and many poor  peace cannot easily prosper. Similarly  in a world where the gap between rich and poor countries continues ceaselessly to widen  a policy of solidarity must be developed as the best guarantee of genuine independence and freedom.132.	My country has always upheld the principle that just international economic relations can be achieved only if the right of each country to the sovereign exploitation of its natural resources is protected. It is no coincidence that major international conferences held since the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly on raw materials and development have had as their major concern the recovery and use  by all countries  of their natural resources  whether land-based or maritime.133.	The particularly positive role played in this field by the developing countries should be stressed here. Indeed  inspired by an ardent desire to promote the success of the needed revolution in economic relations among nations and peoples  and motivated by the sincere desire to accord flail priority to development problems and to the stability of the world economy  they have undertaken to strengthen and co-ordinate their actions in order to create genuine horizontal cooperation in all fields  particularly that of raw materials  thus creating a united negotiating position  in order to achieve the establishment of a new international economic and cultural order through agreement rather than confrontation.134.	That is why the Government of the Republic of Senegal attaches particular importance to the establishment of viable regional and sub-regional communities  such as the Organization for the Development of the Gambia River Basin  the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River  the West African Economic Community and the Economic Community of West African States. But for the effective functioning of such regional co-operation  developing countries must be supported and encouraged in their efforts by the developed countries  as well as by the international organizations  whose precise mission this is.135.	In this respect  we can only rejoice over the decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its thirty-third session with regard to the Sudano-Sahelian region and the measures to be taken for its benefit  especially concerning the important problem of desertification and the expansion of the United Nations Sahelian Office within the framework of the achievement of a rehabilitation programme for that area.136.	The more or less alarming outlook for the world economic situation is creating a mood of anxiety. In this climate of uncertainty the developing countries emerge once more the big losers  subjected as they are to the disastrous effects of this crisis  on the one hand  and  on the other  to the measures taken by the wealthy countries to protect their own economies  which are suffering the effects of recession  inflation and unemployment. Overburdened with debts  the developing countries find their development efforts greatly obstructed by a crisis which is imposed upon them. There-fore  it becomes more and more essential for economic co-operation between developing and developed countries to be considered a basic  priority element  a privileged instrument  for the establishment of a new international economic and cultural order.137.	Yet  on the eve of the proclamation of the third United Nations development decade  we join you  Mr. President  in venturing to hope that the work of the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy will yield results to everyone's satisfaction. To that end  the international community will have to plan its strategy in order to promote the comprehensive development of the developing countries  as they are the ones which suffer the most from imbalances and short-comings in the current inter-national economic system.138.	Unfortunately  the legitimate hopes of the developing countries are dwindling  particularly because the failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD and the problems that cropped up during the Second United Nations Development Decade have revealed that there is still a long way to go before the establishment of a new international economic order. The inertia of the developed countries during earlier economic negotiations give us no cause for optimism.139.	None the less  it does remain undeniable that increased assistance to the developing countries would lead to an upsurge in the world economy and have positive effects on the economies of the developed countries  especially in the area of employment.140.	In this respect the proposal made by the Group of 77 during the last session of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/ 174  for a series of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development  with the participation of all States  should be accepted as quickly as possible during this session. A positive reaction to this proposal would make it possible for the international community as a whole to demonstrate its solid commitment  its sincere will and above all its new mentality regarding major negotiations  with a view to achieving dynamic and realistic compromises in building the new international economic order. It is in this spirit that my delegation would like to express its agreement with the proposal by the Mexican Head of State to discuss energy problems within a global framework  excluding no one  under the auspices of the United Nations and with a positive approach.141.	It is true that for some years the world has been achieving some tangible progress towards this new order of international co-operation  based on economic equity and social justice. However  it is also true that the world has been unable to respond to appeals for fundamental freedom and human dignity.142.	Therefore the United Nations should deal with the problem of human rights with full awareness of its responsibilities to men  women and children throughout the world. My country's position on this point has been constant. Senegal is a law-abiding country which oppresses no minority and its Government makes respect for human rights one of its major concerns.143.	Thus my delegation  during this session  will ex-press support for any measure which may reinforce respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms everywhere in the world; both in South Africa  where apartheid prevails  and in the Arab and Palestinian territories occupied by Israel. However  my delegation will avoid making a distinction between types of human rights violations according to situation and place in order to look with greater favour on some of them. If the protection of human rights cannot be used as an excuse to disregard the sovereignty of States and to interfere in their internal affairs  the sovereignty of States should not serve to conceal human rights violations either.144.	In this same spirit Senegal has always opposed the idea that economic  social and cultural rights should take priority over civil and political ones. Indeed  human rights are indivisible and interdependent and priority should not be given to one particular category of rights. The main problem is not one of priority  but one of establishing a flexible connexion between these two types of rights  taking into account the levels of economic and social development of the societies concerned.145.	The international community has the important responsibility of establishing the conditions needed for the full achievement of economic  social and cultural rights as essential means of guaranteeing the effective enjoyment of civil and political rights and of fundamental freedoms by all individuals.146.	In order to help our Organization fulfil its duty  my delegation will back the idea of creating a post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as soon as possible. Without being a panacea  this post should be the framework for dynamic action for ensuring increased United Nations effectiveness in this field. Indeed it is time for our Organization urgently to adopt more effective concrete measures in order to fulfil its obligations in the human rights field.147.	Perhaps if this post had already been in existence those countries which  on various pretexts  have pushed waves of refugeesâthe number and misery of which continue to move world public opinionâback across their borders or out to sea  would have shown more moderation and responsibility. Whether in Africa  Asia  the Middle East  Europe or elsewhere  these refugees suffer the most inhuman treatment. In this matter our Organization should think up lasting solutions to relieve their misery.148.	Therefore the mission of the United Nations should increasingly consist of modelling and guiding this new orderâeconomic  social and culturalâto which we all aspire  because the prompt achievement of that order will determine the very conditions for maintaining international peace and security and achieving our Organization's permanent aims.149.	We are convinced that it is essentially through the United Nations  which continues to spare no effort to achieve its mission  that the real international com-munity of States can be created; this is indispensable to the fulfilment of the real aspirations of those peoples who love peace and justice  so that universal civilization may triumph throughout the world."
"118",6164,"SGP",34,1979,"ï»¿I should like to begin by expressing the gratitude of my delegation to the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. Indalecio Lie'vano of Colombia.75.	Secondly  I should like to congratulate President Salim most warmly on his unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. At the age of 37  he is the youngest person ever to have been elected to that high office. In the short time during which he has presided over this Assembly  he has already impressed us with his efficiency  competence and fairness.76.	I should also like to pay a sincere tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. He is a tireless worker and traveller in search of world peace and of peaceful and constructive solutions to international problems. During the past year he visited the countries of East and South-East Asia in order to learn from their leaders about the problems of their region. We also commend the Secretary-General's initiative in convening the Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons in South-East Asia  held in Geneva from 20 to 21 July 1979.77.	I propose to depart from the usual practice of focusing attention on numerous specific regional and national issues. My delegation will deal with those when they come up for consideration.78.	The close of a decade is conventionally the occasion for a retrospective assessment of the past to discern what the future holds for us. The 1970s  which we are leaving behind  has by all accounts been the most disastrous decade for mankind since the end of the Second World War. In comparison with it  the preceding two and a half decades were years of steady achievement for most of mankind; and even those who experienced disappointments and setbacks were hopeful that  given time and effort  they could correct their errors and join the mainstream of progress and advancement.79.	The 1970s have rudely shattered this easy optimism about the future. A great many things have happened during the 1970s to convince some people that the era of uninterrupted progress is over and that mankind has entered a new cycle of chaos and disintegration. There is an all-pervading uneasiness that we are inhabitants of a planet where more and more things are getting out of control and that we are plunging towards some undisclosed disaster. Not a day passes without world leaders meeting to reverse this drift but their failures so far leave the impression that they are trying to manage the unpredictable.80.	It is true that the decades preceding the 1970s were marked by crises too. They  too  had their moments of anxiety and uncertainty. But by and large they were manageable crises: temporary aberrations in an otherwise stable world order.81.	The crisis of the 1970s is of a different order of magnitude. It attacks the accepted foundations of the system  suggesting strongly that they can no longer bear the load of human problems. The system's potential has been used up. It has reached the point of exhaustion  decay and spreading chaos. It is what sociologists call a systemic crisis and the 1970s have given clear warnings that were drifting towards such a crisis. A feature of systemic crisis is that it infects all subsystemsâpolitical  economic  social and ideological. It embraces all nations and the crisis afflicts the rich and advanced nations as well as the poor and developing nations.82.	What I want to do is direct the Assembly's attention to the global crisis because it embraces us all and  if left unresolved  can affect solutions to regional and national problems  for these  too  have their roots in the global convulsion. I can think of no better forum for the resolution of the global crisis than the United Nations. Collectively the 152 nations present here represent all of humanity. The global crisis which threatens us is not the creation of Providence  but the consequence of sins of commission and omission on the part of all of us represented here. Since the crisis is of our making  it is also within our capacity  provided we have the courage to face up to new realities  to undo what we have done. That is why I do not believe that the ongoing crisis is irreversible or that we should resign ourselves to the inevitability of disaster.83.	If we approach the present crisis in a spirit of resignation or  as some of us are inclined to do  minimize the importance and extent of the global crisis  then the 1980s will inflict far greater damage and human suffering than that exacted by the 1970s. It is my considered view that the weight of the crisis  as in the 1970s  will bear down more heavily on the third-world countries than on rich  advanced societies. Some of us may find satisfaction in the sorry plight of the developed and rich countries. True  the rich countries are going through the torments of political instability  sluggish economies and growing unemployment. But their sufferings are of a different order from those rampant in the third world. The victims of the crisis in developed societies are buffered by various forms of welfare assistance which may not make life satisfactory for them but prevent it from being a Iife-or-death struggle. The rich countries can ride the crisis better and emerge when the crisis endsâas it eventually mustâbattered and bruised certainly  but without having lost their powers of recuperation. A dramatic illustration of this thesis is the example of Japan and Germany. Both those countries suffered nearly total destruction politically  economically and institutionally. Yet within a decade or so they recovered sufficiently to exceed their pre-war achievements first in the economic field and now in other spheres of endeavour. This is because bombs and enemy occupation  including colonial and imperial occupation  could not destroy the accumulated knowledge and skills of those two peoples or their patriotic will to undertake the great sacrifices and stringent discipline necessary for their national recovery. That is the miracle of Germany and of Japan.84.	The impact of the crisis on third-world countries is of a different order altogether. Foremost among the disasters it has brought is that  as the danger of open conflict between the rich  advanced nations has receded  the third-world countries have been emerging as the arenas for international turmoil and conflicts. These initially take the form of conflicts between third-world countries  but  because modern wars have to be fought with sophisticated arms that only advanced nations can provide  these bilateral and multilateral third-world conflicts can easily be converted  as they now are  into proxy wars for great Powers.85.	Since 1945 there have been in all some 135 major and minor wars involving some 80 countries and responsible for some 25 million casualties. With rare exceptions the armies involved were from third-world countries. Today the fighting armies are wholly from third-world countries. The great Powers have so perfected the technique of proxy wars that it would not be necessary for advanced  rich nations to fight future wars on their own soil  or to use their nationals  their citizens  as cannon-fodder. Why should they  when third-world countries provide the cockpits and the cannon-fodder  wittingly or unwittingly?86.	If the global crisis is left unresolved  the indications are that in the 1980s civil wars  small-nation wars and proxy wars will spread further in the third world. Already across southern Asia  South-East Asia  the Middle East  Africa and Central America  border and territorial disputes  recollections of injustices from times past and social upheavals are igniting countless conflicts among comrades and brothers in underdeveloped countries. All these conflicts are ripe for conversion into great-Power proxy wars. Though I welcome the detente between the great Powers  we in the third world should be aware of the dangerous implications it has for us. The detente is an understanding between the great Powers that under no condition will they wage war directly against one another because nuclear wars imply mutual annihilation. That is what detente is all about.87.	But nowhere does detente repudiate great-Power rivalry or resort to proxy wars. So it is inevitable that the third world should provide the arenas for proxy  wars. That this could be the trend is evidenced by the militarization of an increasing number of third-world countries  most of them desperately poor  through the supply and sale of arms by advanced countries.88.	An even more telling evidence of militarization is the third world's share of global military expenditure over the past decade. According to an estimate made some five years ago  it shot up from 15 percent of total global expenditure to 23 per cent in the third-world countries. In the light of the proliferation of new wars since then  such as the major one in Indo-China  the percentage has probably increased. A quarter of the third world devotes more than a quarter of its public spending to arms. This is the militarization of the third world.89.	One significant point worth noting about these wars  whether proxy or not  is that they can be switched on and off at will by the half dozen or so of the world's major arms suppliers. The arms supplier can call the tune to which his desperate clients must dance. The proxies  having liberated themselves from classical imperialism  are now in bondage to new forms of imperialismâperhaps not as visible as the earlier version  but affording as much control by the overlord over his subordinates as was afforded by the earlier imperialism. When third-world armies can be induced to operate on an intercontinental basis where their national interests are not even remotely affected  then we get a measure of the powers of control this new imperialism can exert.90.	This control is based on exploitation of the petty and  from the point of view of the great Power  totally irrelevant ambitions of a growing number of small nations. This has contributed in significant measure to the crisis of the 1970s.91.	Nationalism  initially a positive and constructive force in third-world countries  has now entered a destructive and reactionary phase. It is now reproducing in the third world the errors and distortions that European nationalism produced in its immature historical phase. Third-world nationalism has entered its phase of racial  religious and cultural persecutions. The solidarity which transcended racial  religious and cultural differences has weakened or totally collapsed in many third-world countries. The third-world countries quite justifiably charged their former imperial rulers with racial discrimination  and yet an increasing number of them now adopt this terrible vice as necessary for national dignity and survival. I need only draw the attention of this Assembly to the openly-declared policy of Viet Nam of ejecting millions of its nationals who have lived for generations in that country for no reason other than that they are ethnic Chinese.92.	Racialism is not a monopoly of Europe: we have adopted that vice. I mention this only as an instance of the growing tendency of third-world nationalism to adopt the vices of its former imperial masters  while carefully eschewing some of their virtues. And this tendency has now culminated in the greatest vice of all: the emergence of third-world imperialism. In the 1970s we had many instances of a third-world country invading another and absorbing it outright for the greater glory of the fatherland  or setting up suppliant puppet regimes. We are learning: picking up the vices of our former masters  but not their virtues.93.	The ongoing invasion of Kampuchea by Viet Nam is but a recent example of emerging third-world imperialism. An interesting feature of the war now going on in Indo-China is that the proxies  as well as their patrons  all profess the Communist faith: Viet Nam  Kampuchea  China  the Soviet Union.94.	So the crisis of the 1970s brought to the surface the hidden fact that wars are not wholly a capitalist phenomenon  and nor are aggression and imperialism. In fact  today capitalist States live far more amicably with one another than do Communist States or those that claim inspiration from that doctrine.95.	These  then  are some of the weaknesses  largely self-induced  within third-world countries which make them easy candidates for proxy wars. Unless these weaknesses  which are spreading rapidly throughout developing countries  are remedied  the 1980s may see many of them broken and battered beyond recovery  or once more enslaved to mighty nations. It may take some of them many generations more to shake off the new servitude because  unlike the first  its chains are nearly invisible and its operations too complex and subtle for identification and resistance. The enthusiasm and utter sincerity with which proxies  wittingly or unwittingly  promote the interests of their patrons is evidence of the tantalizing invisibility of the new imperialism which some advanced nations are erecting. Most proxies sincerely believe that their patrons give lavish aid and assistance to the military efforts of small nations and risk conflicts with other great Powers simply to further the happiness and the trivial ambitions of their proxies. The proxies may have serious reservations about this in private  but their public enthusiasm is incredible. It underlines my belief that once a hold has been secured the proxy has little free will left.96.	These aberrations can be taken as unmistakable warnings to the third world that greater tragedies await it if it does not correct its accumulating errors. I believe that these errors can be rectified and that the disaster that could engulf us can be averted. We can and should do it in the 1980s. After that  it may be nearly impossible for the third-world countries to change course. But to reverse this drift towards disaster  it is necessary for the third world to recognize that it has committed and is committing errors  instead of attributing its difficulties to its imperial past and to the machinations of the rich advanced nations. Certainly  our imperial past is a factor  but with each passing day the consequences of imperialism are becoming more tenuous and our problems are increasingly the consequence of our own actions. Many of us discarded colonialism and imperialism some 30 years ago; to keep on invoking the past as responsible for our present condition is to ignore that this is the consequence of what we ourselves have done since independence. The fact that some third- world  countries are doing better in coping with the present crisis suggests strongly that what we do  rather than what a vanished imperialism did  is the primary source of our difficulties.97.	Equally  I admit that the rich and advanced nations are not exactly bending over backwards to help us. On the contrary  if the 1970s are any guide  political and economic stability in third-world countries is not high on the advanced nations' priority list. As I elaborated earlier  great-Power rivalry requires the ignition of safe proxy wars  and proxy wars are more possible if there is an unstable third world. 98.	In the economic field  the post-war zeal on the part of the rich countries for promoting economic development in third-world countries has evaporated. There are many reasons for this  one of which is the ending of the first cold war and the advent of detente. The need to win over cold-war allies from the third world is therefore not as pressing as it once was.99.	The other and more important reason is the fear  on the part of developed countries  of competition from economically successful third-world countries. A number of third-world countries  primarily from east and south-east Asia and from Latin America  have demonstrated a capacity to compete successfully with advanced countries in an expanding range of industrial products. Initially these were simple manufactures like textiles  garments and foot-wear  but in the 1970s a few third-world countries were turning out more sophisticated products which compete successfully with those of advanced countries.100.	The third-world countries which reached this level of competence were no more than a dozen  but it was enough to set off an alarm in advanced countries  which saw in such successes a possible threat to their dominant economic position and privileges should third-world countriesâover a hundred of themâreach a similar level of competence in the course of time.101.	From the economic standpoint  these fears about an economically dynamic third world are both groundless and self-defeating. But given the fact that the advanced countries had already entered a recessionary phase  this minor challenge from the third world has stimulated further protectionist tendencies. The most strident demands for protection from third-world competition have come from Western trade unions  rather than from their capitalists. The Western proletariat views the emerging third-world proletariat less as an ally and more as a foe.102.	The protectionists from the developed world are  in effect  arguing that the post-war liberal economic order established in 1944 at Bretton Woods should be dismantled. One of the main pillars of that arrangement was free trade  with provisions for the removal of tariff barriers. And the biggest proponents of this are liberals in the developed world. They are also against the Bret- ton Woods economic order.103.	Yet  under the Bretton Woods arrangementâ though it was not wholly responsible for itâthere was a sustained rise in income levels such as was never witnessed before in human history  in both developing and developed countries. Though the average figures may mask differences in the performance of individual countries  per capita income in the third-world countries under the Bretton Woods arrangements grew at an unprecedented annual rate of 3.4 percent  slightly higher than that for countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. It is also a fact that economic growth was fastest in developing countries based on a free economy and with no inhibitions about the flow of foreign investments or multinational operations. This is a fact  unpleasant though it may be.104.	The developing countries which are now demonstrating a capacity to compete successfully with the advanced nations are wholly those based on a free economy  those which took full advantage of the Bretton Woods agreement.105.	For these reasons  Western protectionists are keen on scrapping the old liberal orderâthe Bretton Woods arrangement. What they would like to see emerge out of the ashes of the old order are more barriers to competition from third-world countries. Given such barriers  there is very little hope of third- world countries ever emerging economically and  of the few that have managed to climb up the ladder  being able to remain there for long.106.	There is much in the criticisms advanced by proponents of the New International Economic Order which is valid  but some of the practices and attitudes of the developing countries will  I believe  work against the third world and reinforce the strength of the protectionists in rich countries.107.	First  the developing countries cannot demand free trade while growing more and more protectionist themselves. There is possibly a case for a constructive protectionism for third-world industries in their early stages  but protectionism can become a cover to protect inefficient and uneconomic enterprises sustained largely by exploiting the local consumers. Their ability to grow by competing in the more lucrative international markets would be severely curtailed. Rich countries can afford to featherbed ailing industries  but poor countries cannot for long.108.	The other is the confrontational approach of third-world countries towards multinationals. Admittedly  the multinationals are not philanthropic organizations: they are profit-oriented  and their loyalty is to this central fact. But when they are assured of this  they bring new technology  skills and established world markets which poor countries  given the need to operate in a global economy  cannot acquire  if ever  even over many generations.109.	Here  some developing countries see eye to eye with the protectionists  who are perhaps even louder in their protests over the havoc wrought by Western- based multinational operations overseas. But if you read the protests of the protectionists in the developed countries carefully  you will discover that their objections are not to multinationals as such but to their operations overseas. More multinational operations overseas mean fewer jobs at home and more effective competition from third-world countries. No great multinational enterprise has been closed down in any advanced country by either industrial action or government legislation  but it would have been if it was intrinsically evil.110.	The main point I want to put across is that it is in the long-term interests of third-world countries  whatever the shape of the New International Economic Order that will emerge  to ensure that the principle of free trade should be made a cardinal principle of that Order. Sooner or later  the present economic crisis must work itself out  and the world economy will enter a new phase of prosperity and expansion. When that comes  protectionism  if well entrenched  will once again ensure that the third-world countries get only the leftovers from the main banquet table.111.	But to take advantage of the new prosperity  our domestic economies must be sound and dynamic. The third-world countries must re-examine brutally and frankly the many economic shibboleths which they have translated into economic policies and which have propelled them from one disaster into another. They should search other third-world countries objectively to make a compendium of economic policies that have worked and those which have not.112.	In my view  the policies that work best are those based on free competition  with the government's role limited to protecting the people against the harshness and injustices that unrestrained competition could inflict  and redistributing the fruits of competition without deadening the competitive spirit.113.	The other approach is economic development through government controls and bureaucratic planning. However attractive this may be in theory  in practice this has rarely worked in third-world countries: even third-world countries which believe in controls turn to the free economies of the Western worldânot to the socialist economiesâwith demands for aid  investments  markets and technology.114.	Underlying the turmoils and conflicts in the third-world countries  to which I referred at the start of my address  is mounting economic discontent. Sixty percent of the world's population belong to the low- income group  and they are all in the third world. Life is getting not better  but worse  for more and more people  thanks to uncontrollable population increase. We can produce statistics testifying to advances in this or that sphere of life in the third world  but growth rates can hide unpleasant realities.115.	I can do no better than to quote an eminent World Bank official  Mahbub Ul Haq  on the real meaning of statistics about economic performances:""When you rip aside the confusing figures on growth rates you find that for about two thirds of humanity the increase in per capita income has been less than $US 1 for the past 20 years/1116.	What the statistics about per capita income tell us is the extent to which national wealth has grown  but not how this has been distributed among the population. If there is unequal distribution of wealth between rich and poor countries  there is also just as great a disparity in its distribution between rich and poor people within third-world countries 117.	Therefore it is imperative in the 1980s that we approach our economic problems not in the spirit of mediaeval religious ideologues who debated and killed one another over the question of how many angels could dance on the point of a needle  but as problem- solvers who must deal with realities as they are and change them on the basis of what is possible or not possible at a given time.118 The rich world will continue to remain indifferent to the pleas from the third world  sunk in poverty  whose main demand is that it should get a free lift on the gravy train of the rich. I do not think we are going to get any free lift  however much we shout. The hitch-hikers will  in my view  most certainly be left behind.119.	However  a prosperous and economically dynamic third world  comprising some two thirds of the worldâs population  would be sufficiently attractive to get better terms from the rich than we can now. The market-hungry rich nations would be on the doorstep of prosperous third-world countries with their money and their blueprints. Where they could make profits they would be less inclined to make mischief. They would have a vested interest in ensuring our economic and political stability  because that would provide them with their bread and butter too."
"119",6244,"SLE",34,1979,"ï»¿Permit me  on behalf of the Sierra Leone delegation  to extend to you  Mr. President  our warmest fraternal felicitations on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Sierra Leone is indeed happy to see you conducting the deliberations of this body during this session. Your long and active involvement with the United Nations  your devotion and dynamic contribution to the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and to the non- aligned movement  all qualify you for the high office to which you have been elected. My delegation is therefore convinced that an African of your calibre and experience will undoubtedly conduct the deliberations of this Assembly to the satisfaction of every State rep-resented here. We have no doubt on that score and  to that end  I pledge the co-operation of my delegation. We also find it reassuring that you come from a country  the United Republic of Tanzania  that has over the years been in the vanguard of the liberation struggle for the vindication of the rights of man  particularly in southern Africa.144.	I should also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano for having performed his task so admirably during the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. We place on record my Government's appreciation of his contributions.145.	Before I proceed any further  please allow me  Sir  to pay a tribute at this juncture to a comrade in arms in the liberation struggle. I refer to the demise of President Agostinho Neto  the late President of the People's Republic of Angola. In his death  the cause of the rights of man has suffered a loss  for he was indeed a valiant fighter who found no sacrifice too great for the cause of the liberation of man. May his soul rest in peace.146.	When it was founded 34 years ago  the United Nations had many laudable objectives  including the need to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom  to inculcate in nations the practice of tolerance and living together in peace with one another as good neighbours  and to utilize international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples. Since then  it has remained an indispensable forum for the rationalization and harmonization of divergent political  economic  social and cultural views  in the pursuit of those objectives.147.	We are assembled here once again for another three months to reassess the progress and achievement which mankind has made in the pursuit of those objectives  which are today as valid as when they were first postulated some 34 years ago  for they represent in truth the eternal verities of our world.148.	Sierra Leone  like most other States Members of this Organization  shares an abiding faith in its existence and in the pursuit of the objectives to which I have just referred. Our annual session affords us the opportunity of reflecting on those principles and objectives and on the continued usefulness of the Organization. In that regard  we note that the Organization has not always been as effective as most of us would have wished in facing up to certain crucial issues. But despite its short-comings  the existence of our Organization has  over the years  transformed the relations of Member States from confrontation to co-operation. That is as it should be  for it is the raison dâÃªtre of the United Nations to provide a common platform for the international community in its collective search for solutions to common global problems.149.	The potential for mankind to achieve its finest hour in international economic co-operation and development has never been greater. Ironically  the prospects of its realizing that potential are  for the moment  bleak  gloomy and uncertain. The potential is at its greatest because mankind has today at its disposal unparalleled human  financial  managerial  institutional and technological resources to transform the face of our one earth into something brilliant  prosperous and efficient. Indeed  mankind has the capacity to ensure an equitable and widespread application of the benefits of modern science and technology for a crucial and effective improvement in the quality of life throughout the globe. However  our aspirations and even our most reasonable expectations have been thwarted and frustrated by men who are hesitant or afraid to share their know-how  to transfer their skills and to inject financial resources into those countries which are in greatest need. This hesitation may well be the product of a pusillanimous and less-than-magnanimous spirit and it manifests itself today all too glaringly in the new restrictive protectionism  inflation and monetary instability  contraction in foreign trade  recession in domestic growth and the painful pangs experienced by countries like mine in financing meaningful development along the paths and within the time-frame we had anticipated.150.	The problems confronting the international com-munity call for urgent and imaginative solutions and not for distracting and enervating debates on procedure and methodology. The negotiations of the United Nations are replete with examples of these wranglings: the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy for the third United Nations development decade and even most  if not all  of the working groups of UNCTAD abound with examples of long-drawn-out procedural cavilling. In an Organization which accommodates as many ideologies  cultural attitudes  religious persuasions and political differences as there are States Members  it is understandable that there must be divergent ideas about the best ways of affecting our programmes. However  it is our view that the wranglings have been stretched to the point of fatuity and sterility.151.	As we make ready to face the seemingly daunting challenges of a new decade  we must record our extreme disappointment at the dissipation of the resources available to man and the lack of application of those resources towards productive and human ends. And the decade of the 1970s will long be remembered as the era in which the global economy sank into a severe depression and the spectre of economic and social dislocation became a near-reality for almost every State.152.	Indeed  as the decade of the 1970s comes to a close  there is evidently hardly any room for comfort for any of us here. The current decade witnessed the addition of a new dimension to the now almost familiar  if uncomfortable  global polarity of East-West confrontation  namely the North-South dialogue  a process that has so far very little to record by way of achievement  but on whose successful conclusion may well depend the peace of our one world.153.	UNCTAD continues to be a focal-point for crucial discussions on international socio-economic cooperation and development matters. My Government Wishes to place on record its appreciation for the work done by the UNCTAD Secretariat. This body continues to be a vehicle for espousing the third world's views on trade and development issues in their most useful and refreshing light. It was no accident  therefore  that the debate at the last session of UNCTAD in Manila was significantly focused on the need for fundamental structural changes within the international economic community and for a redefinition of the relationship between the various units in the structural chess-board of modern international economic relations.154.	My Government believes that there is every virtue in pursuing the broader objectives which the international community has come to accept in the mid- 1970s as not only expressive of global interdependence but necessary for the continued survival and viability of the world as a whole. Of course  every State Member of the United Nations has been buffeted  in one way or another  by the billows of the recession as they smite the world economy; but the group of States that has been most vulnerable are the developing countries  and for them the problem in reality is not recession but slow and tortuous strangulation  as their socio-economic development programmes are brought to a grinding halt for lack of resources and they painfully founder and may soon go under.155.	It is therefore my delegation's view that there should be a global approach to the transfer of real resources in all their related forms  for this is a necessary concomitant for the establishment of a New International Economic Order. Such resources- should be provided on a continuous  predictable and increasingly assured basis.156.	The role of multilateral development institutions  whether regional or global  in the development process  particularly of the developing countries  is of crucial importance today. Consequently  it is desirable that access to the funds of these institutions be consistent with the objectives and priorities compatible with over-all sustained growth. It is therefore important that there be a determined resolution to increase the funds available to multilateral development institutions  to enable them to embark on their activities. Commensurate with this  there is a need for improvement in the aid practices of these institutions  particularly with regard to local cost programme-financing  which has inevitably reduced their net effect.157.	Furthermore  most developing countries today have to contend with large deficits in their balance of payments  mostly induced by external factors which it is far beyond their competence to control  in addition to a shortage of long-term capital inflow to support investment and development. The international monetary system is proving ineffective in dealing with these problems primarily because it was not designed with these countries in mind. The prevailing system prescribes restrictive adjustment measures  having very little relevance  if any  to the socio-political circumstances and the problems of long-term restructuring in developing countries.158.	Moreover  the heavy burden which this approach has placed on the developing countries has dampened their development efforts and in some cases aborted them  A system is therefore needed whereby the IMF will play a more responsive and effective role in financing intermediation relative to the special circumstances of the developing countries. This proves all the more the necessity for a world conference wherein monetary problems  not only of the developed countries but also of the developing countries  could be seriously addressed  a conference which would lead to the creation of a new international monetary order responsive to  and in tune with  the circumstances of our time.159.	A burden that has proved the common lot of nearly all countries here today is the energy crisis. Long-term prospects for sustained economic growth become unpredictable and uncertain because we cannot reasonably confirm the continued availability of energy  which is increasingly being priced out of reach. Traditional economics did not isolate or ascribe to energy the significance which it has now come to assume as a factor of production in the last quarter of the twentieth century. The inclusion in our agenda of a separate item on new and renewable sources of energy underscores the crucial importance which the international community must attach to this problem.160.	For developing countries  the energy crisis is more than just an energy crisis; it is a crisis for survival  particularly for non-oil-producing Members of this fraternity of States. It is time  therefore  that the inter-national community paid attention to the plight of the oil-importing developing countries. In this connexion  therefore  the forthcoming United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy should address itself to the provision of this all-important and indispensable factor on terms which will accelerate development in the least-developed countries and ensure the continued lubrication of the industrial sinews of the world on a more assured basis.161.	In the meantime  the international community should take immediate ameliorative steps to help the non-oil-producing countries whose economies  and the very fabric of whose societies  are faced with imminent stagnation and break-down as a result of the energy crisis.162.	It is true that a New International Economic Order cannot be affected overnight  and this is not what we are asking for. What we do ask for is a reform of the system to permit greater participation and sharing of the benefits of world prosperity. Indeed  world peace not only means the end of world conflict  but also relates to justice in the relations between States and between members of the same States.163.	In the light of the foregoing  as we stand on the threshold of the 1980s  the necessity to achieve the goals and objectives of the New International Economic Order has never been more compelling  and as we prepare the international development strategy for the 1980s we trust that this Organization will be able to incorporate into that strategy the necessary goals and objectives which will ensure that we do not miss the opportunity to resolve our problems in a manner more congruent with the needs of our time and the future.164.	Even in the last quarter of the twentieth century  nation-States are still emerging as members of the inter-national community. This itself is a reflection of the aspiration with which we were imbued some 34 years ago in San Francisco to enable the peoples of the world to live in larger freedom. This hope was concretized  in 1960  in the now-seminal resolution 1514 (XV) on the right of self-determination of peoples. Regrettably  however  this hope is yet to be universally realized.165.	It is  therefore  a matter of satisfaction and it is with some pride that Sierra Leone  as a member of the Special Committee on decolonization  welcomes Saint Lucia's emergence as a free  independent and sovereign State to take its rightful place in this council of nations. We congratulate it and feel confident that it will live up to the principles and objectives of this Organization.166.	However  the hope for larger freedom for the peoples of the world is still to be fully realized  for there are areas of our one world  particularly in southern Africa  still under colonial and racist domination epitomizing the denigration of man in its cruellest form. Southern Africa  where racism is enthroned as an official policy  compounded by a complex criss-cross of economic and other interests  remains today the supreme challenge to the yearning of oppressed peoples to achieve the right of self-determination and to flourish in that larger freedom predicated in San Francisco some 34 years ago  without regard to creed or colour.â167.	The South African apartheid regime continues to perpetuate its odious policies despite the untiring efforts by this world body to condemn its inhuman activities and make it abjure its ways  which are not only inconsistent with the principles of human rights but contrary to the essence of man. There  in South Africa  man is still subjugated  denied his basic rights  exploited and discriminated against because of the colour of his skin. Every so often we hear of wrongful arrests and imprisonment  brutality and torture by the police  the victims only distinguishable by the colour of their skins.168.	Suppression and maltreatment continue unabated in deliberate defiance of the will of this Organization and world opinion. The collaborators of apartheid who publicly condemn it but surreptitiously encourage it by business and other links should hold themselves responsible for this and at the bar of public opinion are as guilty as the regime itself.169.	Permit me to draw the Assembly's attention to the current visit of a South African rugby team to the United Kingdom. The Commonwealth Heads of Government  at their Gleneagles meeting in 1977  arrived at a formula on sporting links with South Africa  which was reproduced in the Commonwealth statement on apartheid in sport and attached to the final communiquÃ© issued in London in 1977  and here I quote it:""Heads of Government specially welcome the belief  unanimously expressed at their meeting  that in the light of their consultations and accord there were unlikely to be future sporting contacts of any significance between Commonwealth countries or their nationals and South Africa  while that country continues to pursue the detestable policy of Apartheid.""'170.	It is  therefore  a matter of extreme regret and pain that Her Britannic Majesty's Government  and particularly its Secretary of State for the Home Department  did not see the inadvisability of letting that team into the United Kingdom. The fact that it has been allowed to take place may well undermine confidence and cause a breach in the dike against apartheid. If we allow this to happen  we are giving succour and comfort to the practitioners of that odious policy  and that is not what we want or are seeking.171.	The question of Namibia has remained one of the gravest challenges to the authority of the United Nations. First by outright defiance and now by one subterfuge after another  South Africa has set its will against the international community in the latter's attempt to find a solution to the plight of that unfortunate Territory  to ensure its transition to independent statehood 172.	In addition to its despicable policies within South Africa itself  the apartheid regime has set itself up as a predator on neighbouring African countries and has  over the period  been carrying out a series of aggressive air raids and military attacks against Angola and it has lent similar support to the regime in Rhodesia in its attacks against neighbouring Zambia and Mozambique  a situation that is manifestly a threat to international peace and security. South Africa  in truth  is today the problem child of the international community.173.	In the latest move in a series of intrigues to frustrate the aspirations of SWAPO and exclude that organization from any further political activity in Namibia  the South African apartheid Government has instituted a puppet National Assembly with so-called legislative powers in preparation for the conferment of a sham independent status. I would reiterate Sierra Leone's continued support for Security Council resolutions 385 (1976)  435 (1978) and 439 (1978) and our recognition of SWAPO as the sole authentic representative of the Namibian people and we condemn any and every attempt by the South African racist regime to-subvert the United Nations formula for self- determination and independence for Namibia.174.	Zimbabwe has  today  presented the international community with a test to prove peaceful negotiations as a viable alternative to war  as a means of achieving self-determination and independence. The recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Lusaka adopted a formula which  with the backing and full support of the United Kingdom Government  which still bears- legal responsibility for that Territory  holds out a prospect for accommodation and reconciliation to -the inhabitants of that troubled Territory.175.	That is a process with which the Government of Sierra Leone fully identifies  but at the end of the day the current exercises in London must give birth to a Government that is both representative and reflective of the wishes of the majority of the people of that Territory and Zimbabwe should have genuine independence.. At this juncture  all that the international community could wish is that sanity and goodwill prevail at Lancaster House in London  and this  we believe  is not too much to ask at this stage. We all watch with ambition the transition of Rhodesia into a free  sovereign and genuinely independent Zimbabwe.176.	The Middle East is yet another area of our turbulent world yearning for peace  whether it be in the trials  the tribulations and the severe and desperate plight of the people of southern Lebanon or in the Palestinians' desire to achieve a State of their own.177.	Some 30-odd years ago  the walls of this Organization were reverberating with passionate and clamorous calls for the creation of a State for a people that had  in the annals of man's inhumanity to man  suffered some of the most cruel and brutal manifestations of that inhumanity  epitomized in its being scattered all over the world in the Diaspora and in the unspeakable horrors of the gas chambers of the Nazi holocaust.178.	The conscience of the international community was moved  and the basic humanity residing in the breast of that community saw the justice of the case and responded in 1947 by the creation of a State for the people of that Diaspora. This resulted in the birth  in 1948  of what today we know as the State of Israel  [t is  therefore  to us one of the saddest and most inexplicable paradoxes of the human condition that that State should itself today be seen wittingly or unwittingly to be the cause of yet another Diaspora  by setting its face granite-like against the creation of a State for a people that is enduring a fate not very dissimilar from its own. The State of Israel owes its existence  I dare say  to the response of the international community in putting right centuries of wrongs the Jewish people had had to suffer.179.	Let Israel  therefore  have the courage  the de-termination and  I implore it  the basic humanity to let the Palestinians have what was granted it some 30-odd years ago  namely  the right to self-determination  to a State of their own within which they would be able to mould and shape their own destinies.180.	Let Israel  therefore  not allow psychological fears born of insecurity and scarred memories nurtured on suspicion to stand between it and this humane and basic objective.181.	This is the challenge I believe the rest of mankind can throw out to the Israeli leadership to see if it has the courage  the magnanimity  the creative imagination and  indeed  the humanity to rise up to that challenge. It is time the challenge was taken up. Time  decidedly  is running out  for failure to meet that challenge is yet to record and endorse another bleak chapter in the annals of man's inhumanity to man. But this time round  the State of Israel  yesterday the victim  will today be the perpetrator. The friends and even those who are not friends of Israel would not wish this accolade to be granted to it.182.	The solution to the problem does not  in our view  lie in limited peace treaties  however well- intentioned  for there can be no vicarious parties. The Palestinians themselves must be involved in the search for a solution. A further requirement for a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Middle East problem is the withdrawal of Israel from occupied Arab territories  with the right of all  including Israel and the Palestinians  to live within recognized and secure boundaries.183.	Peace-keeping is the vocation of the United Nations. This is inevitable  and it should be so  given the fact that we have as Members a collectivity of sovereign States with disparate and clashing interests. Over the years  the Organization has embarked  even in the midst of controversy  on this calling with commendation. We take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the men who have staffed the operational forces in the field over the years. For the success of a peace-keeping operation  the support and understanding of the parties themselves concerned in the dispute  the understanding and support of Member States themselves  and  indeed  of the general international community  are vital. For peace-keeping  as it has been said  is an invaluable addition to the armoury of peace at man's disposal  especially in circumstances where the very fabric of the international community is threatened with imminent collapse. We must therefore devise ways and means of making this process more systematic  reliable and immediately available as circumstances require  for it is  indeed  the veritable complement to peace-making; you cannot make peace if you cannot keep it.184.	One of the resources at man's disposal for the improvement of his circumstances is technology and  like the sorcerer's apprentice  man's evil genius has indulged itself in a near-fatal fascination with this modem magic wand in the accumulation  over the years  of awesome and destructive armament. The gravity of this position impelled this Organization to call last year for the tenth special session of this Assembly  dedicated to disarmament  to see how this evil and destructive streak in man could be held in check. For the arms build-up was considered to be not only a threat to international peace and security  but also an unconscionable waste of the world's resources  which only impoverishes man both spiritually and materially  and does not contribute to his general welfare.185.	There was one common theme running through that special session on disarmament  namely the imperative necessity for the reduction of the arms build-up  leading to complete disarmament. It is therefore gratifying to my delegation to learn  a year after that special session  of the conclusion of the second SALT Treaty. This may be a small step in the process  but it is a step that holds out hope for mankind and deserves the support of the whole international community.186.	It is time it was realized that the survival of the world can be secured not by a balance of terror  but rather by the building up of mutual confidenceâa fact that is becoming increasingly clearer every day  as manifested in the increasing and inevitable interdependence of our one world.187.	The universal respect for the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms is central to international economic and social co-operation. For at the end of the day  it is the individual who is the centre of our preoccupation and exertions at the international level  and the well-being of the individual should be the measure of our efforts and of our concern. It is therefore proper that this Organization should concern itself with the promotion and advancement of human rights. It is consequently a cause for some gratification to my delegation to note that over the past year some progress has been made in this direction  both on the regional and international levels.188.	At the regional level  for example  the Organization of African Unity at the sixteenth ordinary session of its Assembly of Heads of State and Government  held in Monrovia from 6 to 20 July 1979  set up a committee of experts with a view to studying the possibility of setting up a committee on human rights for Africa. Also  at the conclusion of the last Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held in Lusaka from 1 to 7 August 1979  it was decided to study the possibility of setting up a Commonwealth Human Rights Commission. These developments augur well for the cause of human rights. We look forward to the institution of these bodies.189.	At the international level  one derives some hope from the alacrity with which the international community responded to the plight of the Indo-Chinese refugees by attending the international conference in Geneva in July this year.  It is the belief of the Sierra Leone delegation that a strict observance of and adherence to human rights would not have given rise to this situation. The fate of the Indo-Chinese refugees  because of its attendant drama  displayed in its most cruel form the tribulations of refugees. And we have been told that in Africa alone there are 4 million refugees. Refugees  in our view  are the product of a disregard for human rights and the fundamental freedoms of the human person. It is therefore incumbent on each and every State represented here  as members of the international community  to act in such a way that the tide of refugees is stemmed and turned off  and that individual may live safe and secure within their respective communities. Refugees  whatever the cause  are a standing indictment of the international community.190.	I cannot conclude my remarks without reference to the work and devotion of our distinguished Secretary-General and his staff  in keeping alive in our breasts the collective hope of humanity that man can have  and does deserve  a better future. The Secretariat of the United Nations has over the years  with its devotion and assiduity  tried to keep us together in our collective search for that better future. They deserve our gratitude  and they should not  in our view  be apotheosized in a shimmering glass tower 40 storeys high  and the United Nations itself is not so dangerous a place as some sceptics would have us believe.191.	Finally  as we begin the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  we still find ourselves compelled to contend with some of the serious economic  social and political problems of our time  problems which are themselves a reflection of the international community we have to live in. Time was when nation- States seemed capable of pursuing survival  even in isolation. Today we live in an era of interdependence. In fact  this is the purpose of our annual sessions when  from this podium  as representatives of our States  we come here to reflect aloud on our collective search for solutions to these problems.192.	As we conclude yet another decade and are about to start a new one  we believe that we have enough blueprints for a solution to these problems. What is now required of the international community is to summon the necessary political will to translate these blueprints into programmes of action. This is the challenge of the 1980s and it is our belief that it is only by a positive response to that challenge that man can survive into the next century in his eternal quest for freedom and self-being. We owe it to ourselves and to posterity. Let us continue."
"120",6290,"SLV",34,1979,"ï»¿The just recognition by all delegations of your high qualities  Sir  is the most eloquent proof of the wisdom of the African States which put forward your candidacy and  in turn  of this Assembly  which elected you by acclamation as its President for this session. I am convinced that you will be able to render a most distinguished service to the international community  as you have already done in other offices  and am therefore very pleased  on behalf of the delegation of El Salvador  to congratulate you whole-heartedly.297.	The delegation of El Salvador would like to express on this occasion its appreciation and congratulations to Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre  a distinguished son of Colombia  for the wisdom  tact and moderation with which he performed the tasks of the presidency of this Assembly at all times during its thirty-third session.298.	We should also like once again to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his constant contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the Organization through tireless efforts  not only here at Headquarters but also in the countries and regions where the most serious situations of crisis and conflict exist. We express our gratitude to him and his colleagues for the diligence and efficiency with which they are carrying out their difficult administrative tasks.299.	In keeping with the decisions adopted at the beginning of this session on the basis of the wise recommendations which our Secretary-General formulated in his report of 13 June last on the problem of the rationalization of the procedures and organization of the General Assembly  I intend to be very concise and to take up only some of the aspects of the international situation. I hope thus to contribute to saving the time and money of the Organization and  hence  that of each and every one of its Members.300.	It is with joy that we welcome the admission of Saint Lucia  a Caribbean country belonging to our American regional group  which was admitted to membership in the United Nations by acclamation at the last meeting of this session on 18 September. On behalf of the people and Government of El Salvador  it is my pleasant duty to extend to the representatives of Saint Lucia our warmest welcome and offer to them our friendship and co-operation.301.	There are very few events that have occurred during the Organization's 33 years' existence that are as important and encouraging as the historic visit of His Holiness Pope John Paul II and his most eloquent statement made to this Assembly on 2 October. His appeal for peace  understanding and solidarity among individuals and nations constitutes the greatest incentive for our Organization in its efforts to strengthen peace and to promote the development of all and their mutual understanding.302.	As the representative of a people whose vast majority is of the Catholic Faith  I should like to thank the Holy Father for his lofty message from this very rostrum and in all places and on all occasions where he has fervently exalted the values of the human being and prayed for our prosperity and happiness.303.	The Government of El Salvador is pleased to congratulate most warmly the brotherly people of Panama and their Government on the implementation on 1 October 1979 of the new Panama Canal Treaties which  following a long and painstaking negotiation and thanks to the goodwill of the United States of America  now return to that Republic of the isthmus the full exercise of its sovereignty over a considerable portion of its territory and guarantee its permanent neutrality. This is indeed an historic event of the greatest meaning  received with great joy by all Latin Americans and applauded by the international community as a victory of diplomacy and law.304.	The Government which I have the honour of representing maintains the traditional policy of the Republic of El Salvador  one of the founding States of this world Organization  namely  a firm adherence to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter.305.	Among the objectives of the United Nations is that of encouraging international co-operation and  in that context  contributing to a solution of economic and humanitarian problems that exist.306.	The serious and regrettable consequences of events that have taken place in this Hemisphere during the last year have indicated the urgent need for the co-operation of the United Nations and other international organizations.307.	ECLA was diligent in elaborating and circulating  in August of this year  a report on the economic repercussions of the recent political events in Nicaragua  a valuable document which served as a basis for the Committee of the Whole of ECLA to consider the urgent problem of the reconstruction of that country.308.	El Salvador has felt and continues to feel as its own the suffering of our brothers the people of Nicaragua caused by a bloody and prolonged struggle which took place in tragic circumstances. Our Government has done everything within its power to assist the people of Nicaragua in this emergency; it has contributed and is prepared to continue to contribute to the international efforts undertaken for its reconstruction and recovery. It actively participated in the meeting of the Plenary Committee of ECLA and in the initiative for the inclusion in the agenda of this Assembly session of item 124 entitled ""Assistance for the reconstruction of Nicaragua''. It will take part in the consideration of that item with the firm desire to ensure that assistance is given that is commensurate with the human and material losses resulting from the conflict and with the size of the programmes the Government of Nicaragua intends to undertake in its task of reconstruction.309.	Just as painful has been the destruction and loss of life caused by the forces of nature in two other countries in our regionâDominica and the Dominican Republic. In the same spirit of brotherly solidarity  El Salvador has offered its co-operation to the Governments of both countries  and it is prepared to do so also in the framework of international organizations.310.	Development and peace are the major objectives of the United Nations systemâwhich is made up not only of the Organization as such  but of many specialized agencies  whose services we do not always acknowledge and whose real significance we do not always appreciate. We often confine ourselves to pointing an accusing finger at the deficiencies in their activities  without thinking about the positive aspects and the benefits which we ail receive from them.311.	The Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization  issued in mid-September  states:""It cannot be said that the past year has witnessedany striking progress on our main problems. Indeed the lack of progress  especially on the economic side' is distinctly disappointing and in strong contrast to the evident urgency of most of the problems."" This statement by the highest administrative authority in our Organization is confirmed when we observe the persistence of the serious economic and social problems which now face all countries  in greater or lesser degreeârich  poor  large  medium-sized or small countries. These problems  however  most affect those whose development is not very advanced  countries which  by and large  do not have the human  material and technological resources which are necessary effectively to eradicate poverty  ignorance  disease  unemployment  food shortages  the energy crisis and soon- factors which contribute to an increase in internal tensions generated by discontent and disagreement with situations which must be corrected; and for that  international co-operation is required.312.	As a developing country  El Salvador is greatly interested in the work carried out by the United Nations system as a whole in this field. To give but a few examples  we understand the difficulties which the Economic and Social Council often has to face as well as the obstacles faced by UNDP and ECLA. Nevertheless  these agencies and bodies perform extremely important functions for the benefit of mankind.313.	The present Government of El Salvador is committed to carrying out an ambitious programme of integral development and improvement through its own efforts and through international and inter-American co-operation  which is referred to as the ""national programme of well-being for all"". That programme is under way  despite internal agitation and disquietâwhich are not conducive to tranquil and successful work in all its aspects.314.	At the same time as this great work is being carried out in the economic and social fields  through programmes encompassing all the areas of human advancement and development  the Government of El Salvador is envisaging a series of legal and political measures designed to continue to improve and consolidate the mechanisms of democracy so that in the next elections to the Legislative Assembly and the municipal councils  in the entire country  which will be held in March 1980  and in all future elections  the representative will of the people of El Salvador may find channels which will be increasingly adequate to express themselves in full freedom.315.	Thus  in the effort to safeguard and deepen the democratic system  the Government of El Salvador  and especially the President of the Republic  General Carlos Humberto Romero  has worked in the context of their historic and patriotic responsibility. It is truly a healthy challenge for all the forces of conscience in the country to surmount the many problems that face El Salvador by means of harmonious and civilized solutions.316.	The Government of El Salvador has invited the OAS to be a worthy witness of this process of genuine and renewed democratization of the political life of El Salvador and to assist us in various procedural aspects of that development. We have requested its valuable co-operation  thus giving clear proof of the seriousness and openness of the intentions of our Government.317.	All developing countries members of what is known as the Group of 77 are concerned at the fact that no progress has been made in the North-South dialogue because of the notorious resistance of the industrialized countries. All the efforts made so far have failed because of that resistance  as was demonstrated once again in the negotiations which have taken place in the past year as well as in the fifth session of UNCTAD held in Manila  from 7 May to 1 June 1979.318.	It would seem that the industrialized States of the North are not fully aware of the fact that just as the time came for the eradication of colonial empires  the time has now come for the effective establishment of a new international economic order  characterized by the disappearance of the great inequalities"" between the economically powerful countries and the countries which until now have not greatly developed  but which are struggling to improve themselves and can do so only through the elimination of the very privileges and advantages enjoyed by the former  particularly in regard to international trade.319.	Finally  on 8 April 1979 it was possible in Vienna to arrive at the adoption and signing of the Constitution of UNIDO as a specialized agency  This event constitutes one of the few achievements of the past year.320.	As at the last session  we must once again express regret at the fact that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has not been able to complete its work. At the eighth session of the Conference  which took place in part at Geneva and in part in New York  relatively little was achievedâparticularly during the second part of the sessionâin the consideration of the integrated composite negotiating text.  In Geneva  at least  a working group existing for the purpose carried out a first revision of the integrated text  while noting that many questions and proposals had not yet been the subject of adequate consideration. In New York  it was not possible to carry out a second revision.321.	At the end of the session  the general view of groups of delegations was that at the next session  in 1980  the convention on the law of the sea would have to be adopted so that it might be signed as soon as possible in Caracas  Venezuela  as had been agreed. In order to carry out that objective  it was agreed to divide the session into two five-week periods  and a time-table was adopted which  if successful  will culminate with the adoption of the instrument.322.	While acknowledging that this is an extremely complex and delicate matter  entailing many varied and great interests  we believe that the working method adopted in the ""gentlemen's agreement"" of 1974"" may perhaps not be the most appropriate for the elaboration of an instrument as important as this one. A proof of that is the fact that the first session took place seven years ago and we are still awaiting what may perhaps take place in 1980. The circumstances may have been very different and the number of States much smaller  but the United Nations Charter was worked out and signed in a mere eight months from the preparatory work done at Dumbarton Oaks in 1944 until the final stages of the San Francisco Conference the following year  which lasted barely two months.323.	With regard to human rights  my delegation would like to repeat the position of its Government with regard to the competence of the bodies established by this Organization and by some regional entities to consider the subject. That competence  in our opinion  represents progress in the development of international law but at the same time we should like to point out that this innovation  introduced in recent times  in no way authorizes States as such to emit judgements outside of the afore-mentioned international or regional bodies on the conduct of the authorities of other countries with regard to human rightsâand much less to condemn foreign Governments  which would clearly constitute undue interference in their internal affairs.324.	The policy followed in that area is all the more unacceptable since it does not take into account the critical situations which specific Governments have to face in dealing with openly subversive movements inspired  prepared and guided from abroad as part of a well-known international conspiracy. Those movements must be rejected by the Governments in question through actions which can hardly be called violations of human rights.325.	That does not mean that there is no validity in the international concern to ensure that human rights are better protected and practised in the world. But we must understand that that concern should be in the context of the limits of a relation of friendship  realism and constructive coexistence among States.326.	My Government would like to repeat its position with regard to the problem of the Middle East. El Salvador believes that a just and lasting peace in the region can be achieved only on the basis of the following premises: first  the recognition of the existence of Israel as a State by the Arab countries; then  the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of the Arab States  in particular of the Palestinian people. Moreover my country is in favour of the full implementation of the principle of the admissibility of acquiring territory by force and has been consistent with this policy in its international relations  We state that in keeping with our desire for universality in relations  an attribute of State sovereignty  we desire to maintain friendly ties on the basis of mutual respect for all parties to the conflict  and categorically affirm that this does not imply that we are linked with any specific political position of the parties concerned  since the policy followed by the Government of El Salvador is merely the logical corollary of a position of principle. We therefore reject any attempt to link the international conduct of El Salvador with that of any of the States of the Middle East.327.	The question of Cyprus has persisted for many years  despite the attempts of the United Nations and the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General to find a solution. The talks which the Secretary-General helped to bring about were suspended in their second stage  and  as he states in his report   . [an] approach  based on the existing guide lines and accords  could lead to a rapid improvement of the situation in the island that . . . would be vastly preferable to continuing to cling to an unsatisfactory and potentially unstable status quo"". 328.	Namibia and Zimbabwe  in southern Africa  also continue to be hotbeds of tension and a source of concern to the United Nations. However  there do not seem to be insuperable difficulties in the way of finding a solution to the problems. In any event  the co-operation of all parties concerned is indispensable. In the specific case of Namibia  the plan of action of the Security Council offers good prospects  and we hope that it will be implemented.329.	In the cases which I have mentioned and in many others the peace-keeping operations decided upon by the Security Council or the General Assembly can and in fact do play a very important role. This is an international activity which  although unknown in earlier times  has emerged in the United Nations  and makes it possible for the Organization effectively to carry out one of its primary roles.330.	The procedure of mediation which the Republic of El Salvador and the Republic of Honduras adopted to solve their problems  in existence since the 1969 conflict  continued to develop successfully under the wise leadership of the mediator  Mr. Jose Luis Bustamante y Rivero  who has had the co-operation and the full political will of the two countries and of their respective Governments.331.	Along with mediation  and acting in the context of the procedures contemplated in the Agreement which led to the adoption of that means of peaceful solution  representatives of the Governments of both countries have held several meetings where  by means of agreement or direct negotiation  it may be possible to bring about the success of the final objective with the help of a mediator  that is  the signing of a general treaty that will put an end to the outstanding problems. My country would like to reaffirm its commitment to peace and its desire to live in peace and harmony with its sister republics of Central America.332.	The Sixth Conference of the Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Countries was held recently in Havana  the Republic of Cuba. My country  in the use and exercise of its status as an observer  attended that great forum of the developing world  sharing the thoughts vividly expressed by other participating countries designed to preserve the philosophical principles and fundamental axioms of those who established the non-aligned movement.333.	The problem of Belize has not yet been solved. In this connexion  the Government of El Salvador is firm in its well-known view that  by means of procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes as laid down in international law  it will be possible to arrive at a negotiated solution that will satisfactorily reconcile the rights of Guatemala with the vital interests of the people of Belize.334.	To say that disarmament is a problem of transcendental significance for the whole world and a constant cause of concern for the United Nations is a truism. Even more dangerous than conventional wars of limited scope is the truly grave risk of a nuclear war whose consequences would be catastrophic not only for the warring parties but for all mankind. It is on the two super-Powers  therefore  that depends basically the solution of the disarmament problem in its various and complex manifestations.335.	The Assembly has on its agenda for this session many items on the activities of our Organization in the field of disarmament  many of which should perhaps be considered by the First Committee in working groups set up on the basis of affinity of aim.336.	Of special interest are the reports submitted by the Committee on Disarmament and the Disarmament Commission. The latter  as a deliberative body in this matter  made up of all the States Members of the Organization  in referring in its report to the elements of a comprehensive programme of disarmament included important considerations that I should like to emphasize. The Commission stated among other things that:""8. The immediate objective of a comprehensive programme of disarmament should be to maintain and further the momentum generated by the tenth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  to initiate and expedite urgent negotiations on halting the arms race in all its aspects  to open a process of genuine disarmament on an inter-nationally agreed basis and to increase international confidence and relaxation of international tension.""11. During the first stage of the implementation of the comprehensive programme of disarmament  special attention should be given to the immediate cessation of the nuclear arms race and the removal of the threat of a nuclear war."" 337.	Regarding disarmament measures  the Commission has in view the prohibition of nuclear weapons  the cessation of the nuclear arms race in all its aspects  the cessation of the conventional arms race and the prohibition or restriction of the use of certain conventional weapons  including those which may cause unnecessary suffering or have indiscriminate effects.338.	The United States of America and the Soviet Union subscribed in the course of the past year at the conclusion of the second round of SALT 11 to the Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. Its aim  upon coming into force and being implemented in good faith by both parties  is to mitigate the well-grounded fears of total destruction that keep both those countries and the rest of the planet in a constant state of perfectly understandable anxiety.339.	While the United Nations has not fully achieved all the major objectives that led to its creation over three decades ago  no one can deny that it is carrying out an invaluable mission in this contemporary world characterized by the discontent  non-conformity and even the despair of many peoples faced with obstacles that impede or prevent the realization of their aspirations for independence or for genuine economic and social improvement. In many parts of the world this results in conflicts and often in regional armed disputes which undermine the security of States and jeopardize international peace.340.	Nevertheless  this Organization and the various specialized agencies of the United Nations system constitute the most adequate instruments for patiently seeking a solution of the major problems that affect  oppress and afflict mankind.341.	In concluding my statement I should like most solemnly to repeat the desire of my Government to base its conduct on the principles of law and its unshakeable faith in the United Nations as the supreme forum where the most important questions of the individual and social life of human beings and of relations between States should be and are being discussed."
"121",6362,"SOM",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of my delegation  and in my own name  I should like to extend to Ambassador Salim sincerest congratulations upon his election to the high and demanding office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly  and to express our confidence and conviction that under his wise guidance and direction this thirty-fourth session will bear fruitful results.148.	I also wish to convey to his predecessor  Mr. Lievano of Colombia  our appreciation and esteem for the able and effective manner in which he fulfilled the difficult task of conducting and steering the thirty-third session of the Assembly.149.	The Somali delegation extends its best wishes of welcome to Saint Lucia on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations.150.	I want also to express our profound appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his untiring efforts in the promotion of the effectiveness of this world body and in his search for solutions to the intricate problems facing humanity. We assure him that we shall give him our whole-hearted co-operation in the future as we have given it in the past.151.	May I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the late President of the People's Republic of Angola  Mr. Agostinho Neto  whose untimely death has deprived the brotherly people of Angola of a valiant freedom fighter and great statesman. I wish to extend my delegation's heartfelt condolences to the family of the late President and to the Government and the people of Angola.152.	The policies and points of view I wish to express on behalf of my Government arise from three sources. The first is our involvement with the principles and issues of deep concern to our regional organizationâ the OAU. The second is our adherence to the principles of non-alignment  and the third is our belief that international peace and security can only be assured by a democratized system of international relations  operating within the framework of the United Nations.153.	I shall speak first of questions which affect the Somali Democratic Republic as an African State and as a member of the OAU.154.	I must emphasize  first of all  our confidence in the ability of the OAU to continue to develop its cooperative efforts in the political  economic  technological and social fields. Too often the positive aspects of African co-operation are overlooked and the inevitable failures of our comparatively young organization are given prominence. We believe that the OAU will be able to face up to the challenges before it by taking account of the realities of the present while remaining true to the spirit of the Charter.155.	Let me state here our conviction that the cooperation that exists between the OAU and the United Nations strengthens both organizations and contributes to international peace and security.156.	The OAU rightly gives pre-eminence to questions related to the right to self-determination  decolonization and independence  and it is natural that this should be the case since it is on the basis of this right  proclaimed in the United Nations Charter  that the vast majority of African countries achieved their independence. Therefore we continue to be in the vanguard of the struggle to eliminate the last vestiges of colonial rule and to complete the process of self-determination and independence on the African continent.157.	Our commitment to the cause of the total liberation of the African continent remains firm and unequivocal. The explosive situation in southern Africa arouses our grave concern and calls for more determined effort against the unjust policies posed by the racist minority regimes  which further escalate the current reign of terror and violence in flagrant violation of OAU and United Nations resolutions and international public opinion. Of late  South Africa has taken the dangerous step of installing a puppet regime in Namibia. Any attempt  overt or covert  to impart a semblance of legitimacy to an unrepresentative government is bound to be doomed to failure. The South West Africa People's Organization  as the sole representative of the people of Namibia  deserves our full moral and material support.158.	In Zimbabwe  despite the recent cosmetic changes and developments  the situation remains as tense as ever. As long as the people of Zimbabwe do not attain real independence on the basis of universally accepted democratic principles  the liberation struggle will continue with full force and vigour. We pledge to the valiant people of Zimbabwe our full support and urge them to stand fully united in this moment of unprecedented crisis.159.	In South Africa itself the abhorrent practice of apartheid continues and the rights of the majority of African people are openly trampled upon. Our solidarity with our oppressed brothers and sisters remains firm and unshakeable. They should intensify their legitimate struggle against the racist minority regime until final victory is won.160.	International concern has rightly focused on the well-known colonial situations in southern Africa  but attention should also be paid to other areas in Africa where peoples are being deprived of the right to self- determination and independence and where the consequent tensions and conflicts endanger regional and international peace and security. This is certainly the case in the Horn of Africa  where colonial struggles have been intensified and internationalized through foreign intervention.161.	The peoples of Western Somalia and Abbo  who constitute a distinct national group with a strong sense of national identity  are fighting a legitimate liberation struggle against oppressive colonial rule. As in other colonial situations  they have had to resort to armed struggle because their attempts to obtain their freedom through peaceful means have been consistently and often brutally opposed. Their struggle has been temporarily set back by the introduction into the Horn of Africa of the armed presence  on a massive scale  of a super-Power and its surrogates. But the fundamental causes of that struggle remain  and there will be no lasting peace in the area until the people have been allowed to exercise their inalienable right to self- determination and independence.162.	In the case of Eritrea  whose autonomy had been established on the basis of an international (decision  it is a terrible indictment of our Organization that there was only apathy and indifference towards Ethiopia's illegal ending of Eritrea's autonomy. Today there is also indifference towards Ethiopia's ongoing  brutal war against the Eritrean people  waged with the help of foreign mercenaries armed by a super-Power 163.	The settling of African conflicts within Africa and through the machinery of its regional organization is one of the fundamental reasons for the existence of the OAU  which has a respectable record in this regard. My Government  along with many other African Governments  is deeply concerned over the precedents for foreign intervention in African affairs that have recently been set. We hope that the majority of African States will guard against this retrograde trend which heralds a return to imperialist domination and undermines the positive role of the OAU in the mediation of African conflicts.164.	We also deplore intervention by one African State in the affairs of another because of opposition to the policies of its Government. Where the pre-eminent right to self-determination is not involved such intervention can only damage the structure of African peace and security built on the principles of the OAU.165.	With regard to the approach that should be taken to African political problems  particularly those of the Horn of Africa  my Government maintains that neither the African nor the international community should believe that the causes of deep-seated disputes based on unjust  callous or thoughtless decisions of colonial and imperial times can be glossed over  or the destiny and identity of whole peoples erased by simplistic resolutions aimed at preserving the status quo. The desire Peoples for freedom will always come to the surface  and the attempt to deny their aspirations will always cause tension and conflict. We believe that the sensible course  and one which follows the principles of the Charter and the logic of history  is to set in motion  preferably under United Nations auspices  the processes leading to self-determination and independence.166- The current situation in the Middle East is another matter of grave concern to this Organization. We should adopt positive and practical measures in support of the legitimate cause of Arab people under Israeli domination and oppression. We are fully committed to the fundamental position that the national rights of the Palestine people  including the establishment of a State of their own  must be fulfilled. We continue to condemn Israel unreservedly for its intransigence and demand that it must cease its acts of continued aggression and withdraw from all Arab lands occupied since 1967  including the holy city of Jerusalem. Only if these fundamental elements are complied with can the danger to peace and stability in the region be eliminated.167.	The denial of human rights in the Middle East  in southern Africa  in the Horn of Africa and in many other areas of the world points to the tragic discrepancy between the development of the concept of human rights in this century and the frequency with which those rights are violated on a large scale. In recent days the attention of the international community has turned to the plight of hundreds of thousands of the people of South-East Asia who have become refugees because of their ethnic background. The Somali Government and people deplore the enforcement of policies which contravene several provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and which have contributed directly to the deaths and cruel suffering of so many Asian men  women and children.168.	The refugee problem is not  of course  confined to South-East Asia. It has also assumed gigantic proportions in Africa. While African countries have an outstanding record for the provision of emergency aid  long-term hospitality and the assimilation of refugees  the refugees within their borders often undermine development efforts and place heavy burdens on the economic  political and social structures of developing or severely under-developed countries.169.	The Somali Democratic Republic is still providing food and shelter for hundreds of thousands of people who became refugees as a result of the war of liberation in Ogaden. The present refugee population in Somalia  based on realistic assessments  exceeds 500 000âand the number is increasing daily in alarming proportions. The Government of the Somali Democratic Republic  in fulfilment of its heavy responsibility for providing the necessary care and protection for such a massive number of refugees  has recently launched an emergency national campaign to cope with this grave situation. We are grateful for the international assistance we have received in this task  but our refugee problem causes great difficulties for a small and underdeveloped country like our own.170.	My Government hopes that the international community will bring pressure to bear on all Governments whose inhuman policies of repression and tyranny contribute to the refugee problem. These Governments should be induced to provide guarantees of the human rights of people who wish to remain in their homelands  who wish to leave in an orderly and humane manner  and who wish to return voluntarily.171.	I turn now to my Government's position on wider questions of international concern  which we view from the perspective of non-alignment. We believe that the non-aligned movement can be justly proud of its achievements. Through its strict adherence to authentic principles  and its firm opposition to military alliances and power blocs  the movement has clearly established itself as a countervailing force in a world still troubled by super-Power confrontation  and it has made a significant contribution to the relaxation of international tension.172.	The unremitting opposition of the non-aligned States to all forms of colonialism and imperialism has been a significant factor in the liberation of millions of people from colonial domination and in their enjoyment of the rights to self-determination and national sovereignty.173.	Believing as we do in the value of the non-aligned movement's contribution to international peace and security  my Government sincerely hopes that the movement will remain true to its original character as an independent force in international relations  free from great-Power rivalry and influence. Indeed  we believe that the movement will continue to be an effective force in international affairs only if it proceeds with a firm belief in the continuing relevance of its established principles.174.	We are therefore very much disturbed over attempts being made both from outside and from within the movement to divert it from its true course and to channel its policies in one direction. We have made very clear our opposition to this attempt to change the essential nature of the movement  and we are happy that our position is shared by the majority of the members of the non-aligned group of States. It is indeed gratifying to note that this correct line of the non- alignment policy has been fully endorsed and reaffirmed by the majority of member States at the recent Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Havana .175.	The question of disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament  is especially relevant to the nature and goals of the non-aligned States. Whatever influence non-alignment has had on the world scene has not been based on military power  but rather on the rejection of militarism as the moving force in international affairs. My Government is convinced that  unless significant steps are taken to implement the disarmament programme which was inspired by the non- aligned group and approved by the tenth special session of the General Assembly  all efforts of the world community in the political  economic and social and technological spheres will prove fruitless  and mankind's very survival will be in doubt.176.	The most urgent disarmament priority is  of course  that of nuclear disarmament. The tragic aspect of the senseless spiralling of the nuclear arms race is that billions are spent each year on nuclear weapons  while the majority of the world's people suffer from hunger  poverty and disease.177.	The non-nuclear-weapon States view with a deep sense of frustration the failure of the nuclear Powers to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty and to approach in earnest the task of achieving a mutual and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons.178.	The non-aligned effort to preserve the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace has been severely undermined by the actions of nuclear Powers. The increasing use of the Indian Ocean by those Powers to further their global strategies severely jeopardizes the right of Indian Ocean States to determine their prerogative to dispose of their natural wealth and resources as they see fit. In short  it endangers their hard-won independence and national sovereignty.179.	Unfortunately  in recent times both of the superpowers have consistently increased their military presence in the Indian Ocean in the context of their global rivalry. I have already referred to the massive introduction by one super-Power of military equipment and foreign forces  including foreign mercenaries  into the Horn of Africa. This flagrant violation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace can lead only to further escalation of great-Power military rivalry and the increased de- stabilization of the area.180.	The military presence of the nuclear Powers in the Indian Ocean also introduces a dangerous element into the struggle for self-determination and for the elimination of racism  colonial rule and foreign domination  which have long been major concerns of the countries of the area.181.	My Government supports what we are sure is the universal wish that the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea will be able to complete the long and difficult task of drawing up a treaty on the law of the sea at its next session. The successful conclusion of that task would indeed be an outstanding example of international co-operation and one with significant implications for the strengthening of friendly relations between States and the strengthening of international peace and security.182.	The question of the nature and powers of the sea-bed authority continues to be one of the problems which remain outstanding. We hope that the Conference will reach an agreement on the establishment of a sea-bed authority which will be able to ensure a wide and just distribution of the benefits accruing from deep sea-bed mining.183.	My Government believes that another urgent priority of the international community is the establishment of a new international economic order. We regret that the efforts of the third world over the past five years to set in motion a constructive and co-operative process leading to fundamental changes in the world economic situation have met with very little success.184.	The recent general agreement between developed and developing countries on the main elements of a Common Fund to stabilize commodity prices and the debt relief extended to some of the poorest countries by a small group of developed States are indeed valuable accomplishments. However  it is evident that the developed countries  by and large  have not yet committed themselves fully to the task of closing the widening gap between rich and poor countries  nor have they accepted the thesis that their own prosperity is inescapably linked with that of the developing countries which contain the vast majority of the world's people.185.	Unfortunately  a psychological barrier  largely composed of persistent colonial attitudes  still divides the nations of North and South. Recent developments in several international forums and the over-all results of the fifth session of UNCTAD have served to show the dimensions of this barrier. They have also shown that the principle of interdependence  which had gained acceptance for a brief period  has been negated by isolationist attitudes and policies.186.	The developed countries are understandably preoccupied with the problems of inflation and the slowing of economic growth  problems that also have serious repercussions in the developing world. But these problems cannot be divorced from the world economic situation as a whole.187.	The World Bank's estimate that by the year 2000 constant hunger and low life-expectancy will be the lot of 600 million people should underline the humanitarian dimension of the task ahead.188.	While my Government is aware of the external factors which need changing or improvement so that development can be more speedily promoted  we are fully conscious of the heavy responsibility of third- world countries for their own development. The Somali Government and people are committed to a policy of national self-reliance carried out within a strong framework of regional co-operation. We believe that co-operation between developing countries in technical and other fields is an essential component of the new world economic order and that one of the most important goals of this co-operation must be increased food production  both for national self-sufficiency and for money-earning exports.189.	My Government fully supports the joint OAU- ECA development strategy for Africa  and we attach particular importance to the proposal for an African common market. We are glad that in the formulation of the African development strategy prominence is being given to the view that African peoples must evolve patterns of development that can borrow from other societies without alienating us from our indigenous cultural heritage.190.	Whatever may be its weaknesses and divisions  the United Nations family of organizations has embarked on great political  economic and humanitarian ventures  and it is obvious that no one would want it to turn back. My Government believes that the world community can indeed go forward towards peace and progress if it adheres to the principles of collective security and the interdependence of States  which underlie the provisions of the Charter. With renewed dedication to the Charter principles  we should work together positively in a spirit of global solidarity towards the enhancement of international peace and cooperation and to combat colonialism  neo-colonialism  imperialism  hegemonism and other forms of domination  which today constitute potential sources of conflict and tension in the contemporary international situation. Only through a genuine commitment on our part to the universally accepted democratic concepts of justice  equality and human dignity  both at the national level and in the field of international relations  can we make a meaningful contribution towards the creation of a better world that is responsive to the persistent demands and expectations of mankind as a whole."
"122",6399,"STP",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  the thirty- fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is being presided over by a distinguished diplomat whom the whole of Africa is unanimous in recognizing as a man of commitment and devotion to the cause of the oppressed peoples. Over the long years of national liberation struggles  our peoples have always found in you  in your country the United Republic of Tanzania  in your people and in your Government the support  acceptance and understanding so necessary for the continuation of our struggle.114.	The Tanzanian people uncompromisingly cast off once and For all the shackles of oppression and exploitation. This stands as an example to the peoples fighting to recover their dignity and to establish a just and equitable society. The constant contribution of the United Republic of Tanzania to the defence of the ideals of the peoples of the world and its attachment to the cause of the total liberation of the African continent have conferred upon the Tanzanian people and its great leader. President Julius Nyerere  a remarkable place in the world of today.115. When we speak of you. Sir  we are speaking above all of a friend and the Ambassador of the United Republic of Tanzania  a country with which my own country  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  enjoys the best possible relations. Mr. President  in congratulating you on your unanimous election  my delegation is simply recognizing once again the fine qualities as a diplomat which you demonstrated so strikingly during your chairmanship of the Special Committee on decolonization  and we wish to express our certainty of your success in your work.116.	My delegation would also like to congratulate your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Indalecio Lievano  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia  on the results he achieved at the last session.117.	The United Nations is now the richer by the presence of a new Member  recently come to independence. It is with great pleasure that we extend our warmest congratulations to the delegation of Saint Lucia 118.	We are meeting at a time when the African continent is stricken with dismay at having had to bear  in the short period of less than a year  the sudden loss of two of its most brilliant sons: President Houari Boumediene of Algeria and President Agostinho Neto of Angola.119.	It is for his devotion to the cause of building a democratic Algeria  an Algeria of the people  for his dominant role in the struggle to bring about a new international economic order  for his unswerving defence of the cause of the peoples  particularly those of Africa and the Middle East  and for his example of integrity and honestyâit is for all these things that President Houari Boumediene will be remembered for ever as an eminent statesman and as a man who discharged to the full his historical responsibility.120.	The history of the people of Sao Tome and Principe will record the very positive action taken by President Boumediene in the negotiations in Algiers in November 1974 for the transfer of power from the colonial authorities to the liberation movement of Sao Tome and Principe  the legitimate representative of the people of Sao Tome and Principe.121.	This sense of history  this need to give expression  at the cost of any sacrifice  to the will of an entire people and this ability to interpret that will to the point of identifying completely with it were also found abundantly in the person of Agostinho Neto  the President of the People's Republic of Angola. President Agostinho Neto was a committed man; committed to his people  whom he led during its long struggle for national independence until the proclamation of the People's Republic of Angola  and committed  too when that national independence  once won  encountered all sorts of difficulties  difficulties which in the strength of his commitment he was able to overcome with patience and determination. President Agostinho Neto was also  and perhaps most importantly  a man committed to the future of the African continent  a future of freedom and dignity. The People's Republic of Angola was  in the mind of President Agostinho Neto  yet another piece of Africa liberated. The existence of the People's Republic of Angola and the consolidation of its political and economic independence had a fundamental objective: that of accelerating the process of the total liberation of the continent.122.	The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe is convinced that contemporary history will give prominence to the contributions of President Houari Boumediene and President Agostinho Neto to the cause of a race of man that would be more humane.123.	On 16 September 1975  in this Assembly  my country  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  made its debut before the international community as a full-fledged  free and sovereign State. The States Members of the United Nations gave us a warm welcome and we had the opportunity to express our gratitude for the unswerving support we had enjoyed throughout our struggle to win political independence. We were at pains to inform you of the difficulties which faced us  and to explain to you our commitment and determination to build  with our efforts and your solidarity  a more dignified existence for the people of Sao Tome and Principe.124.	Four years have elapsed since that day  and we thought it our duty to inform you of the first results in our work of national reconstruction. We hope and wish that this may be a contribution to our common task of creating a more harmonious future for mankind.125.	After five centuries of colonialism and obscurantism  what was the situation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe on 12 July 1975  the day of its accession to independence? We took over a country with no infrastructure for development. Our isolation from the outside world was nearly total  and made worse by the inadequacy and precariousness of the means of communication  We had a dependent economy in a country rich in potentialities. Among the people  there reigned ignorance  a high rate of infant mortality  an alarming rate of illiteracy and a very low life expectancy. In the face of this situation  to which was added the lack of qualified personnel  our determination to build our country was never shaken and the co-operation of Member Statesâalthough limited and far from meeting our needsâwas quickly forthcoming. The changes made over these four years have not yet solved all the problems faced by our people.126.	Still these changes have made it possible for our hope for a better life to become a certainty  a certainty strengthened by the success already achieved in vital sectors such as health  education  food and  above all  the creation of an infrastructure for a harmonious development which  given our natural potential  will make it possible to satisfy our essential needs.127.	In this process of development  we have had to face two fundamental difficulties. First  as the plan for society envisaged by the liberation movement of Sao Tome and Principe is translated into specific actions designed to promote the welfare of our people  it gives rise to resistance and hostility on the part of a minority whose frustrated ambitions have led to two attempted coups dâÃ©tat  and to threats of invasion by mercenaries  thanks to the support that minority still enjoys among those forces which are hostile to the peace and progress of the people of Sao Tome and Principe. We had the opportunity last year to set forth these facts in detail before this Organization.  This minority  blinded by greed and devoid of the slightest feeling of identification with the real problems of our people  continues to use every possible pretext to destabilize the country.128.	This situation  taken together with the Lack of available resources  the shortage of qualified personnel and the occurrence of natural disasters such as the drought which afflicted our country in 1978 leaving its effects on agricultural production  and  finally  the African swine fever  which led to the extinction of our herds of swine  has greatly jeopardized the implementation of many projects.129.	Furthermore  the crisis in the world economy has a particularly strong impact on developing countries in general and on island nations in particular  whose economies depend on the production for export of a single crop which is subject to uncontrolled price fluctuations. Our appeals for international co-operation have not always been answered in an effective way  and this has caused problems which our efforts and our determination have not been able to overcome.130.	It is within that context that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe has provided the entire population with medical assistance  including free medical care and compulsory education.131.	In the social field  we must stress the establishment of a social security insurance system which guarantees to all a life free from the nightmare of insecurity and of fear for the morrow.132.	In the economic sector  the expropriation of large agricultural land holdings  the management of which was threatened by their abandonment by the former colonial owners  has enabled our Government to initiate a policy of crop diversification  the results of which will  in turn  make it possible for us to meet certain yet unfulfilled needs of our population.133.	The control of foreign trade has made possible the better utilization by our Government of the proceeds from our exports and a more rational import policy.134.	The stimulation of other areas of production is an urgent task  given its importance for our efforts to overcome the state of dependence on cacao as our single cash crop. The development of fishing and of other agricultural-food industries is also among the main priorities of our Government.135.	The results of our efforts to overcome the isolation imposed upon us by our island state have been more modest because of the almost total absence of a communications network.136.	The scope of the problem far exceeds our present resources and abilities. The co-operation of international organizations and Member States could be an important contribution to solution of this problem  which is of such vital and timely importance to our country.137.	Our achievements in the housing sector have been equally modest. The colonial authorities were never concerned with providing workers with housing worthy of the name. Hence the building of homes on the agricultural land-holdings emerges as one of our foremost priorities  although the lack of resources has prevented us from meeting this requirement adequately.138.	We should like at this stage to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his efforts in mobilizing international assistance for our country. The fact that this was only one of the many tasks entrusted to him by our Organization is eloquent testimony to his indefatigable efforts to implement our decisions.139.	In presenting this brief report of our principal achievements and continuing difficulties  our intention has been simply to give an idea of the basic importance which the people of Sao Tome and Principe attach to their attainment of independence.140.	For generations which have been subjected to colonialism  the difference between past and present is not merely that of regained freedom: the difference is that in the past our future was uncertain  if not non-existent. The present that we are building for ourselves day by day in the face of all sorts of difficulties will  we are convinced  guarantee a future of happiness and well- being for the people of Sao Tome.141.	This concern for the future prompts us to pay particular attention to children. Hence the commemoration of the International Year of the Child is an event which has mobilized the efforts of all strata of our population. Its importance is attested to by the fact that the committee entrusted with the organization of activities connected with the International Year of the Child was sponsored by our Head of State himself.142.	The admission of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe to the United Nations has set the seal on its status as a free and sovereign country  believing strongly in the ideals which led to its creation  and has committed it to the cause of peace  progress and well-being for all mankind. As a full-fledged Member of the international community  we have now embarked upon the process of joining the various specialized agencies within the United Nations system.143.	The purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are actively reflected in the non-aligned movement  which is such a dynamic force in the embodiment of the aspirations and hopes of the vast majority of the peoples of our planet.144.	Intimately linked by a common past of domination  oppression  exploitation and contempt for their dignity  sharing the devastating effects of the prevailing international situation imposed and maintained by relationships of inequality established way back in their history  and suffering day after day from shortage and privation  the non-aligned countries constitute the most important element within the peace-loving progressive forces struggling for the establishment of a new international political and economic order whereby peace  equality and co-operation will take the place of war  injustice and exploitation.145.	This community of interests cemented by a common past was reconfirmed by the success of the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries  held in Havana last September.146.	The strengthening of the anti-imperialist positions of the movementâwhich implies consistency with the principles of the struggle against colonialism and neo-colonialism  apartheid  racism  zionism and ail forms of exploitation and dominationâthe reaffirmation of its principle of peaceful  active coexistence among States and its opposition to the division of the world into alliances or military blocs make an important contribution to the total liberation of peoples and the establishment of the essential foundations for promoting the advent of an era of peace so ardently desired by the peoples of the whole world.147.	We are convinced that under the chairmanship of the Republic of Cuba  whose commitment to the policy of non-alignment was once again so amply demonstrated  the non-aligned movement will go on to record new and significant successes.148.	The creation of conditions conducive to an environment of peace  security and progress for all mankind is one of the major objectives of the United Nations. Its implementation is closely linked with the struggle of peoples for total emancipation and for freedom of choice concerning the most appropriate ways and means of achieving their aspirations.149.	The total decolonization of peoples still living under foreign domination thus becomes a matter of highest priority in the evolutionary process of the world today. For the developing countries  the solution of the crucial problems besetting them demands respect for their independence and territorial integrity  the effective exercise of sovereignty over their natural resources  acceptance of their social and cultural diversity  and mutually advantageous co-operation.150.	In spite of our solemn declarations about the need to contribute to the total fulfilment of the noble objectives of our Organization  among which ensuring the right of peoples to freedom and independence occupies a prominent place  peoples throughout the five continents of the world still live under foreign occupation and domination  their legitimate aspirations ignored  their rights usurped  and their struggles subjected to all kinds of indescribable trafficking.151.	The persistence of these situations  the responsibility for which lies unfortunately with certain States Members of the international communityâbecause of the sacrifice of human lives to which it leads  because of the insecurity it injects into whole communities  because of the destruction of values which it engenders and because of the contradiction which it entails vis-a vis the ideals which we defendâconstitutes so many distressing and repugnant acts of aggression which curb the harmonious progress of the world today.152.	The right of peoples to self-determination is one of the most important achievements in present-day life  and the recognition of this right underlies the profound changes which have occurred in international society over the past few decades.153.	Our country  the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  the embodiment of the age-old aspirations of the Sao Tome peoples for a free life  has inherited from its triumphant anti-colonial struggle the responsibility which is common to all the States Members of our Organization: namely  actively to support the irreversible process of the liberation of other peoples. This explains the concern of our Government in the face of the difficulties imposed on the liberation struggles in various parts of the world  particularly the African continent.154.	In the southern part of our continent racist minorities persist in denying millions of people their true status as subjects of history. Aware of their precarious existence the systems of oppression which are repugnant to the conscience of mankind are every day revealing themselves more brutal in their acts of aggression  more persistent in their obsessions and more insensitive to and arrogant towards the appeals of the international community.155.	At the same time  supported by forces which make defending their economic and strategic interests in the region the raison d'etre of their policy and the right of peoples to freedom an aberration  these regimes seek to make the international community an accomplice of their system of oppression.156.	It is a fact that the colonial question of Rhodesia is not limited merely to the simple promotion of the cause of Africans within the machinery of the repressive racist apparatus. It is fundamentally a question of transferring power from the racist minority to the legitimate representatives of the African majority; it is in fact a question of destroying the repressive racist machinery and allowing the people of Zimbabwe to take charge of their country. The so-called internal settlement cannot win recognition from the international community because of the very fact of its fraudulent nature.157.	Although the minority Rhodesian regime wants to get us accustomed to its unilateral taking of positions  in spite of the decisions taken in so many international meetings  whose purpose was to find a solution favourable to the majority of the people of Zimbabwe  our Government is following with sustained attention the negotiations going on in London. We hope that the administering Power will live up to its responsibility fully in its search for ways and means of permitting the majority of the people of Zimbabwe to exercise their right to self-determination and independence 158.	To the Patriotic Front  the sole and legitimate representative of the people of Zimbabwe  which in its persistent armed struggle is opening up the path to true liberation  we should like to express here our firm support and active solidarity.159.	With regard to Namibia  in whose forthcoming independence we came to believe at the time we took part in the debate at the thirty-third session of the Assembly  our hopes have been drowned in the innocent blood of the Namibian people that continues to drench the paths of liberty  which has fallen victim to South African Fascist repression.160.	The plan prepared by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  with the active participation of all interested parties and in keeping with Security Council resolutions 385 (1976)  435 (1978) and 439 (1978) has not been put into effect because of the delaying tactics of1 South Africa.161.	Thwarting the efforts of the international community to find a solution capable of putting an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia  South Africa wants to impose upon the Namibian people the so-called National Assembly. This attitude should be most vigorously rejected by the international community and calls for a clear  firm and consistent stand to be taken.162.	The Security Council  in the face of this situation which poses a threat to international peace and security  should take action in keeping with Chapter VII of the Charter and order economic sanctions against South Africa.163.	We wish to reiterate to SWAPO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people  our commitment to active support for its liberation struggle for the national independence and territorial integrity of its country.164.	South Africa  sustained and encouraged by its allies  is persisting in its policy of apartheid and has reduced the people of South Africa to the status of mere means of production which it coops up in Bantustans and uses in order to perpetuate their odious system 165.	No one can deny today the important life- support role being played by the economic and financial co-operation of the West in the survival of the racist regime. Shaken by the continuing revolt of the oppressed peoples and the most vigorous rejection by the international community  the apartheid regime finds in this co-operation the support it needs to keep its repressive machine active ana efficient. That makes its stance of defiance of mankind even more arrogant and limits the effects of its increasing isolation. We are convinced that history will record the fact that those who are so obsessed by their immediate short-term interests are prolonging the death-throes of a regime which is the most repugnant and despicable of our time and every day is imperilling the security of the African continent and thus threatening international peace.166.	Faithful to the principles and objectives proclaimed by the Charter of our Organization  we should step up our action in solidarity vis-^-vis the South African people and support the national liberation movement  which  in the towns of the racist citadel and in the countryside  is communicating to the enemy its faith  which we should share  in the inexorable end to this racist nightmare.167.	To the National African Congress of South Africa  we wish to express our total determination to continue to provide it with the support and solidarity which it deserves in its just struggle.168.	At the same time  concrete and effective measures  as provided for by our Organization  should be adopted and resolutely applied as a matter of urgency.169.	The repeated acts of aggression against fraternal front-line countries  particularly Angola  Mozambique and Zambia  to prevent them from doing their historic duty towards the liberation movements of southern Africa deserve the most vigorous condemnation from us.â170.	Furthermore  the international community should provide assistance to these countries to help them overcome the damage they have sustained as the result of these barbarous acts of aggression.171.	With similar concern  we are following the development of the struggle in the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic for the assertion of its identity as a full-fledged member of the international community. This situation gives rise to even greater concern if we take into account that the total liberation of the African continent should be one of the major purposes of our collective efforts. It is within this context that we condemn the invasion of that country by the army of a neighbouring State.172.	We wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Islamic Republic of Mauritania on its positive attitude towards the peace proposal presented by the Frente POLISARIO.173.	It has now become obvious to the international community that the only obstacle to peace in the area lies in the negative attitude of the Kingdom of Morocco  which persists in thwarting the relevant decisions of the OAU and the General Assembly.174.	The elimination of hotbeds of conflict  which threaten international peace and security and jeopardize the possibility of harmonious peace and cooperation among the peoples of our planet  is one of the tasks to which our Organization devotes sustained and continuous attention.175.	If the results that have been achieved so far have been modest  this is due partially to the complexity of the problems that we face. Also  the decisions adopted by the United Nations are in some cases deliberately ignored  and even thwarted in their essence and aims  by Member States whose first obligation should be to promote their effective implementation. These facts are disturbing in themselves  and in certain situations take on a highly negative significance.176.	The question of the Middle East is a flagrant example of the situation that we have just described. After more than three decades of intensive debate the relevant decisions of the principal organs of our Organization have not decisively influenced the solution to the Palestinian problem even though the main guidelines which could promote consistent action have long been laid down.177.	We must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign homeland  to return to the land of their birth and to have restored to them the Arab territories occupied by force by Israel in 1967. We must recognize the right of all the States in the area to live in peace within internationally recognized frontiers. Four wars  with all their train of death and destruction  a situation of permanent insecurity  and millions of people condemned to enforced exile have not succeeded in bringing peace to the region.178.	True peace and real security for the peoples of the region cannot be brought about without the consent of the Palestinian people. Such consent presupposes recognition of their legitimate rights.179.	It is clear to us that any solution to the Palestinian problem must envisage the participation of the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people  the PLO. If so  it is difficult for us to understand how the Camp David agreements could really be expected to lead to the peace which is so ardently desired in the Middle East.180.	By ignoring the other parties directly concerned in the conflict  excluding them from the negotiations  denying the fundamental nature of the Palestinian problem in the Middle East question and attempting a partial solution to the question  the Camp David agreements seem to have placed one more obstacle in the path of a viable and definitive solution to the Middle East problem.181.	Far from reducing tension  these agreements have actually promoted an escalation of violence in the area. Far from prevailing upon the Zionist State to refrain from aggressive action against Lebanon  these agreements have led to their intensification. Far from the arms potential in the area diminishing  these agreements have actually increased it alarmingly since they were signed. The resistance and determination of the Arab and Palestinian peoples  far from breaking  has grown steadily since that time.182.	Once again we reaffirm our support for the PLO and all Arab peoples in their legitimate struggle for the recovery of their occupied territories  for the creation of a sovereign Palestinian State and for lasting peace in the area.183.	The situation prevailing in the eastern Mediterranean is also a matter of concern.184.	In Cyprus the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of that country continue to be threatened in spite of our decisions and the personal efforts of the Secretary-General.185.	We express our hope that there will be an effective application of resolution 3212 (XXIX) and an end to all outside interference in the internal affairs of this sovereign State.186.	We repeat our support for and solidarity with the Korean people in their struggle for the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean homeland. We very much appreciate the initiative taken by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the problem.187.	The record of the activities of the United Nations in the field of decolonization is a good one.188.	The end of the process of decolonization  in spite of remaining difficulties  has today become irreversible and is a matter of urgency. We should like here to refer particularly to the armed struggle of the heroic people of East Timor  legitimately represented by FRETILIN  who are seeking to gain their independence. We call upon our Organization to intensify its efforts in order to prevail upon the invading country to respect the rights of the people of East Timor to express themselves freely on their future  in keeping with the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.189.	The right to self-determination of the peoples of the world necessarily presupposes that after winning independence and in keeping with the socio-cultural realities  they should be totally free to adopt the policies of development that best conform to their aspirations. This right of peoples to decide on their own future has become imperative in present-day historical development  and a necessary condition for the establishment of a new international order which would be more just and more conducive to the self-fulfilment of men and women. Unfortunately this respect for the rights of peoples to self-determination and to decide on their own future has not yet been accepted by the whole international community.190.	In Africa  Asia  Latin America and Europe people are subjected to oppression and the exploitation of their natural resources and their labour. These victims of fear  poverty  humiliation and torture have made their rebellion and courage their principal allies in their fight against these dictatorial and bloody regimes.191.	These peoples have earned the respect and admiration of the international community. Their victories have been very hard-won at a cost of thousands  and in certain cases millions  of innocent victimsâmen  women  old people and children  whose only crime against imperialism has been the wish to assert their human dignity and reject exploitation  domination and moral degradation.192.	These obsolete or obsolescent regimes have always found in the imperialist forces the moral  political  economic and military support to help them fight their peoples who have risen up or are rising up to say ""enough"" to the regimes of oppression. These forces have on their hands the blood of innocent people  yet they invoke human rights in support of regimes which have silenced  in the peace of the graveyard  the cries of people who struggle against domination and exploitation.193.	We know that the voracious machine of imperialism always needs human sacrifices in order to maintain its economic and strategic interests. But as long as there are people who are determined  the forces of oppression are condemned to disappear; hence their hatred for and ruthless aggression against any regime which clearly and consistently has made liberty and the dignity and well-being of the people its fundamental objective and article of faith.194.	Underlying this fact  which today has become undeniable  is the right of all peoples to exercise permanent and effective sovereignty over their wealth and natural resources.195.	In promoting the true exercise of this right  the United Nations will make a considerable contribution to the developing countries  whose situation today is due principally to the foreign domination imposed by imperialist ambition.196.	It is not a matter of defending autarchy  a fact which has been superseded by the realities of today  but rather a matter of promoting true international cooperation based on equality  equity and mutual advantage in mutual respect for the sovereignty of each State.197.	In this way we shall create the conditions which  once prejudices have been dispelled and artificially erected barriers broken down  will usher in an era of fruitful co-operation and the peoples of the world will be engaged in building a world of peace and brotherhood among men.198.	In this area also  our efforts have met with resistance from those who  impressed by the privileges conferred upon them by the present order  deny by their very actions the idea of a new international economic and political order.199.	Although we recognize the complexity of certain questions that are being studied  we feel that the results achieved so far in the negotiations to bring about a new international economic order are still modest  not to say disappointing.200.	These results reflect the absence of any real political will on the part of certain industrialized States to restructure the principal machinery and institutions governing world economic activity.201.	This refusal to engage in a more constructive dialogue only delays the solution of some problems that are vital for developing countries and is a factor for tension which it is urgent to eliminate.202.	Because of the important role that UNCTAD is designed to play in the international economic negotiations affecting international trade and problems relating to economic development  particularly the negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order  it has become the principal instrument of the General Assembly for examining and following the evolution of the international economic situation  in the light of the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 1995 (XIX) and UNCTAD resolution 90 (IV).  That is why we believe that the strengthening of UNCTAD should be considered as one of the key elements in the current restructuring of the social and economic sector of the United Nations.203.	In view of the wide range of questions on the agenda and of those on which a decision was not taken at the fifth session of UNCTAD  held in Manila from 7 May to 3 June 1979  the results of that session were extremely limited. However  we hope that the target of $350 million set for the creation of the Common Fund will soon be achieved and that the negotiations for the effective creation of that Fund  which was scheduled for December this year  will be successful.204.	The transformation of UNIDO into a specialized agency 3 at the same time as it strengthens the role of the United Nations in the industrial development of developing countries  also represents progress which we hope will help us to overcome the delays which have occurred with regard to the achievement of the objectives advocated in the Lima Declaration and Programme of Action on Industrial Development Cooperation. 205.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  in the context of negotiations for the establishment of a new international economic order  assumes the utmost importance.206.	The creation of machinery that will make feasible the practical implementation of the concept of the common heritage of mankind and the solution of problems still unsolved is a task to which the participants in that Conference will be able to give the best possible response.207.	The efforts which have been made in the past several years to carry out intensive negotiations have already begun to yield certain results  and we hope that the forthcoming sessions of the Conference in 1980 will make possible the adoption of a convention which will govern the activities of States on the seas.208.	These efforts should in no way be compromised by unilateral measures  and for this reason we appeal to all the participants to refrain from such acts.209.	The unbridled arms race  and in particular the nuclear arms race  because of the latent danger it represents for the whole of mankind and because of the waste of human capacities and precious resources for purposes which are far from being the goals we are aiming at  constitutes a serious impediment to the patient efforts of the international community to create a world of peace  progress and fraternity among peoples.210.	The trend in favour of the arms race advocated by certain sectors should be resisted through our firm determination to bring about general and complete dis-armament under effective international control.211.	The results of the tenth special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament  demonstrate our collective will that each Member State should promote the putting into effect of the measures advocated in the Final Document adopted at the end of the session and that the common aspiration of our peoples to peace should be the major concern of our Governments. In the world of today we must all fully assume this collective responsibility. From that standpoint  my Government reiterates its devotion to the principle of convening a world conference on the whole question of disarmament within the framework of the United Nations.212.	In this connexion  we are pleased to note the signing of the SALT Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. This marks an important stage  to the continuation of which we should devote our best energies and abilities.213.	In that way we shall be acting in keeping with the aspirations of the peoples and we shall be contributing to ensuring that humanity never loses its hope in man."
"123",6431,"SUR",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  we of the Republic of Suriname  should like to begin by telling you how much we welcome your election as President of this General Assembly  a signal honour which we see as a fitting tribute to your widely admired ability and diplomatic skills.3.	Of great significance to the United Nations must be the fact that a representative of the United Republic of Tanzania  a country whose moral strength has always placed it in the forefront of the forces of progress  has been chosen to guide our debates and discussions. As one of our outstanding diplomats in the field of multilateral diplomacy  you played a pivotal role in the decolonization process. As Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  your positive influence has also been felt throughout the years in many other areas of activity of the United Nations. I am sure our debates and negotiations will be uplifted by your personality and your unique experience.4.	Allow me to take this opportunity to express our deepest appreciation for the superb stewardship exemplified by your predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano  in presiding over the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.5.	I should also like to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the very able and conscientious way in which he continues to direct the work of our Organization towards more harmonious co-operation among nations and the maintenance and consolidation of world peace.6.	My delegation welcomes Saint Lucia in our midst as an independent and sovereign State. On this happy occasion we extend our most cordial congratulations to the Government and people of Saint Lucia on its membership in the world Organization. We are convinced it will make an important contribution to translating the goals and principles of the United Nations into reality.7.	A year ago while addressing the General Assembly  I had the honour of stating the views of the Government of Suriname on the grave and menacing problems of our day. I said on that occasion that the thirty-third session of the General Assembly was unfolding against the grim backdrop of increasing political and economic tensions  leaving little room for optimism.8.	During the past year  those tensions have not diminished. Once again we meet at a time of profound international anxiety. Though people the world over want real peace and tranquillity  they seem as far as ever from attaining these goals.9.	The situation in several parts of the worldâSoutheast Asia  southern Africa  the Middle Eastâhas not changed for the better since we met in September of last year.10.	Even on our own continent we have witnessed turmoil and fury in the sister nation of Nicaragua. However  the forces of freedom and human dignity have finally triumphed. We sincerely hope that  having overthrown the Somoza regime  the proud people of Nicaragua will under its heroic leadership at last win the peace and prosperity for which they shed their blood.11.	For us in Latin America  1 October 1979 was a day of great joy and historical significance. On that day our sister Republic of Panama established its sovereign rights over part of its territory  thus starting the liquidation of one of the remaining relics and symbols of foreign domination in our continent. We trust that this first step will result in the effective exercise by the Government of Panama of its sovereignty over its entire national territory  not later than foreseen in the relevant treaty.  We in Suriname share the joy of the Government and people of Panama and we take this opportunity to extend to the Government and people of Panama our warmest congratulations.â12.	We should also like to express our sincere appreciation to President Jimmy Carter and the Congress of the United States of America for the wisdom they have demonstrated in dealing with this sensitive matter.13.	The situation in southern Africa has been further aggravated by the devious tactics of the South African Government designed to block any peaceful solution of the Namibian question. The chances for a peaceful settlement in that Territory under the aegis of the United Nations seem to be receding ever further. The answer seems more elusive than ever  as the Pretoria Government continues to block implementation of a genuine negotiated settlement along the lines of the proposals of the five Western members of the Security Council  which led to the adoption of Security Council resolution 43 I (1978).14.	In Zimbabwe as well  the hope for a peaceful settlement has not been fulfilled. On the contrary  the situation has grown more complicated and intractable  since the establishment of a new regime in that country after the holding of elections in which the major opposition parties  the Zimbabwe African People's Union and the Zimbabwe African National Union  could not participate. Because these parties were excluded we cannot accept the outcome of those elections. Neither can we accept the legitimacy of the new regime  based as it is on a constitution that grants a veto power in Parliament to the small white minority and preserves that minority's fiefdom in the armed forces  the police  the judiciary and the civil service.15.	For these reasons  the delegation of Suriname is adamantly opposed to recognizing the new Salisbury regime  as well as to lifting sanctions at this stage. We are not  however  giving up hope for a peaceful way out and we appeal to all parties concernedâthe followers of Bishop Muzorewa  the members of the Patriotic Front and those belonging to the white minorityâto join in the new efforts towards finding a solution which can avoid still further destructive racial  as well as tribal wars  in that Territory.16.	In this respect  we fully support the agreement that emerged from the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held in August of this year in Lusaka. We fervently hope that the talks now being held in London will produce a democratic constitution acceptable to the parties concerned  as well as to the international community.17.	The Middle East conflict still hangs like a dark cloud over us. In the absence of a comprehensive peaceful settlement  involving all parties concerned  and in particular the Palestinians  this problem will continue to haunt us. The sooner we can dispel it  in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter  the better.18.	We of the Republic of Suriname remain convinced that success in the peace talks on the Middle Hast question can be achieved only by the full participation of the representative of the Palestinian people  the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  These negotiations must be based on the right of the Palestinian people to establish their own independent State  on the one hand  and on the right of Israel to live in peace within recognized and secure borders  on the other.19.	The hostilities in the Middle East have resulted in territorial gains by one nation at the expense of others  They have also resulted in ever increasing tension in that part of the world and have engulfed its peoples in increasing suffering. In this respect we want to endorse once again the doctrine that acquisition by force creates no rights.20.	My Government is anxiously watching the continuing conflict. We should like to reaffirm our conviction that a solution to the Middle East question must be based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It is of the utmost importance to break the existing deadlock via the resumption of negotiations among all parties concerned.21.	The menace of a war breaking out is growing daily with the incalculable spread of the means of destruction. The unabated arms race is morally and materially intolerable: morally  since it engenders a state of insecurity and anxiety; and materially  because the incessant piling-up of armaments throughout the world  in particular by the great Powers  inevitably leads to increasing reliance on force and  consequently  to a further erosion of the rules of international law. 22.	As the super-Powers continue to strive for a margin of superiority over each other in terms of armed strength  the temptation to strike first grows  despite full knowledge of the consequences of a universal cataclysm and the terrible catastrophe it would entail for vanquished and victors alike. However  established military alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization are not the sole culprits; the arms race is not their monopoly.23.	According to reliable sources  the military spending of third-world States in Africa  Asia and Latin America has doubled during this decade  with those States now spending on arms three times what they receive in official development aid for their economies. As peaceful nuclear technology spreads  so does the capability of producing nuclear weapons  and yet  so far  no effective world-wide proliferation control exists.24.	Over the past few decades some important treaties and agreements have been concluded  such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons the Declaration on the sea-bed and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction. However  the efforts made hitherto in the cause of disarmament within the United Nations framework have on the whole been insufficient  hesitant and rather half-hearted. The holding last year of the tenth special session of the General Assembly  the first devoted exclusively to disarmament  was an encouraging sign  though its main objective was not to conclude specific treaties.â25.	Moreover  while the session yielded consensus on a broad programme of action  it also highlighted ominous differences between the nuclear and non-nuclear States on important issues such as non-proliferation  the relationship between nuclear and conventional disarmament and the question of securing assurances that nuclear weapons or the threat of nuclear weapons would not be used against non-nuclear States. The absence of agreement on those existential problems does not augur well for the future.26.	We must continue  within the framework of the United Nations  and particularly within the scope of the deliberative and negotiating instruments established during that tenth special session of the General Assembly  to search for methods aimed at a progressive reduction of various kinds of armaments. The delegation of my country is of the opinion that we should immediately take up the question of prohibiting all nuclear tests. We believe  furthermore  that regional agreements to ban nuclear arms should be concluded  along the lines of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco).27.	The Tlatelolco Treaty is a glimmer of light on the otherwise bleak and gloomy horizon of international disarmament politicsâand the same can be said about the signing of the agreement resulting from the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT] by the United States and the Soviet Union. Additional Protocol II of the Tlatelolco Treaty has been ratified by all the nuclear Powers  while Additional Protocol I has now been signed by France and the United States of America. The Government of Argentina  furthermore  has on several occasions during the past year declared its intention to ratify the Treaty  which leads us to conclude that the Tlatelolco Treaty will soon be the first effective regional anti-nuclear weapons treaty.28.	My Government is keenly following the negotiations under way in the Committee on Disarmament on other weapons of mass destruction which  we hope  will lead to a convention on the prohibition and elimination of chemical and radiological weapons. In this connexion we particularly welcome the convening at Geneva during the month of September of the plenipotentiary United Nations Conference on Prohibitions or Restrictions of Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.29.	Although I gladly acknowledge that since the Second World War much of positive value has been achieved in settling international problems within the United Nations framework  we must bear in mind that  in view of existing geo-political realities  the role of our Organization in resolving international conflicts is a limited one.30.	It is still a sad fact of life that it is neither here in this Assembly nor in the Security Council that the outcome of many grave world problems is decided. It is  indeed  particularly disturbing to have to recognize how small a part the United Nations is playing in solving those problems. Public opinion nowadays does not focus first and foremost on what is happening in New York  but on what is happening in certain capitals.31.	Certain circles are inclined to blame the manifest weakness of our Organization primarily on the Charter. Although the United Nations Charter  like any other human effort  is not devoid of flawsâand I am referring among others to the veto power of the permanent members of the Security Councilâthere is on the whole nothing essentially wrong with the Charter itself.32.	In our view  the principal reasons for the erosion of the image of the United Nations are the non- implementation of its resolutions by Member States and the growing tendency to keep important questions out of its sphere of influence.33.	'This tendency is to some extent due to a broadly shared contention that the United Nations in its procedures is not equipped to deal efficiently with the problems of our contemporary world. We are  however  in a position to take practical measures which could lead to a substantial and speedy improvement of the modus procedendi of the General Assembly and its Main Committees  the specialized agencies and the organizations affiliated with the United Nations.34.	This could be done by abolishing as far as possible all general debates  with the exception  of course  of the general debate right here in this hall.35.	The general debates have in our opinion caused undue delay in the negotiating and decision-making processes of  among others  the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries  held in Buenos Aires last year  the fifth session of UNCTAD  held in Manila  the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  held recently in Vienna  and many sessions of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Those debates in many cases amounted to duplications of previous statements and have in our view seriously limited the time available for concrete negotiations and the reaching of agreements.36.	My delegation would therefore suggest that the written contents of statements of a general political nature be submitted for distribution prior to or at the beginning of those conferences. We should thus be able to devote a maximum of the time available to the negotiating and decision-making process.37.	Furthermore  it would be recommendable to limit the number of resolutions  whose implementation puts too great a burden on the administrative machinery of the Member States  in particular that of the smaller countries. At the same time we question the effectiveness of many of the resolutions.38.	The efficiency of our Organization could  moreover  be enhanced if the General Assembly would adopt the many recommendations of the Special Committee on the Rationalization of the Procedures and the Organization of the General Assembly.39.	Furthermore  the contribution of the United Nations in certain areas of conflict is unquestionably being held to a modicum by the lack of political will of some of its Members to take action where such action is called for and when it is within the realm of the possible. It is  for example  not consistent with the dignity of the United Nations to remain inactive regarding the imposition of comprehensive sanctions on the Republic of South Africa when the Charter provides for the right of the Security Council to take measures in this case  which clearly constitutes a threat to international peace and security. As the representative of my country  I once again stress the necessity of imposing mandatory sanctions on South Africa  a decision to which in our view the Security Council is morally and legally bound in duty to take.40.	On the other hand  the timely arrangement by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of a meeting last July of more than 70 countries to discuss measures to deal with the refugee problem in South-East Asia has greatly enhanced the image of our Organization.41.	Political events in that region of the world have resulted in a refugee problem of enormous magnitude. However  the task of alleviating the lot of those un-fortunate people is a problem that should be dealt with in the absence of political motivations and treated as a purely humanitarian problem. In saying so I should like to express our admiration for what the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has done. Indeed  its work in this respect deserves the highest praise  in which it may take the most legitimate pride.42.	I do not forget that some individual countries have made great sacrifices in assisting refugees who have entered their territories. My country  for instance  is willing to absorb a number of refugees. The Parliament of the Republic of Suriname has adopted a resolution to that effect  and my Government is now drawing up the necessary plans.43.	We cannot deny that whenever our world Organization fails to deal decisively and boldly with dangerous problems  whether they are of a political or an economic nature  it loses its prestige throughout the whole world  and the multitude of ever increasing resolutions will not mask the naked truth. On the other hand  while adopting a critical attitude  we should not overlook the fact that the importance of the United Nations success is often not sufficiently appreciated. Disputes have occurred that might have led to resort to force had not the United Nations intervened. In other cases  when a dispute has arisen between Member States  the mere fact of the existence of the United Nations and the corresponding obligations incumbent upon Member States have erased the tension between the parties concerned  making it easier to reach a peaceful and honourable settlement. Furthermore  public opinion  which is always haunted by the problems of the maintenance of world peace  follows with greater interest the political work of the United Nations  thus frequently overlooking its successes and those of its specialized agencies in the technical  economic  social and humanitarian fields.44.	In the light of the foregoing I wish to express once again the firm dedication of the Government of my country to the principles of the Charter and to the ideal of the brotherhood of manâthe ideal that led to the founding of our world Organization.45.	A grave economic crisis threatens to descend upon us  and there looms the spectre of economic warfare between the rich nations and the poorer nations. We wonder whether the United Nations and its subsidiary and affiliated bodies will manage to survive as a political instrument for regulating meaningful and just international economic relations. Past and present negotiations between the developed and the developing countries have spelled a succession of serious disappointments because they have failed to arrive at tangible and just solutions and at the establishment of a new international economic order. It is a fact of life that the future of the vast majority of developing nations is now largely decided by the industrialized Powers and the oil-producing States. There should be no attempt to hide this incontrovertible fact.46.	One of the essential objectives of the New Inter-national Economic Order initiated by the non-aligned movement at its 1973 summit Conference in Algiers was to strive for rapid growth in developing countries so that they would win full  equal and effective participation in solving their international economic problems.47.	The concept of the New International Economic Order has been subject to a wide variety of interpretations. We may conclude that the past five years have been marked by the efforts to reduce the one-sided dependence of developing countries on the over-all interests of the industrialized countries and to accelerate their development on the basis of collective as well as individual self-reliance. Without ignoring the resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly and the results of the major conferences that have been held in the context of the New International Economic Order  it is a matter of deep concern that so many of the expectations of developing countries and the commitments made by some industrialized countries are as yet still unfulfilled.48.	Imbalances and inequities between developing and industrialized countries still persist in international economic relations. Official development assistance and other long-term aid flow have failed to expand adequately in real terms. Stabilization of commodity prices through the establishment of an appropriate Common Fund is still at an embryonic stage.49.	Meanwhile  continuing economic recession  persistent inflationary pressures  unemployment and rising payment deficits have increased the vulnerability of these countries. Here I would point especially to the non-oil-producing developing countries  mine among them. The collective trade gap of these countries widened from a deficit of $34 billion in 1977 to one of $53 billion last year. The spectacular surge in oil prices has not only hit hard at external accounts  but has also contributed to raising the prices of imported manufactured goods; this in its turn has depressed the export earnings of the developing countries.50.	Several representatives have already pin-pointed the phenomenon of protectionism. The export earnings of the developing countries also suffer from the protectionist measures of the industrialized countries. Beyond direct restrictions  a great variety of other measures  such as industrial standards  health regulations  government procurement and subsidies on domestic production have a discriminatory impact on the export capability of the developing countries.51.	During the fifth session of UNCTAD in Manila  the developing and the industrialized countries were able to reach agreement on a plan of action for structural adjustment  related to trade and policies and measures to deal with protectionism. When and how the Plan will be implemented is not clear and we would reserve our judgement on this matter.52.	The developing countries must bear in mind that in the industrialized countries day-to-day political realities influencing or even determining government actions tend to place immediate domestic concerns ahead of commitments to the developing countries. In the long run however  we seriously doubt whether this attitude will help to solve the problems now facing the industrialized countries  as it negates the interdependence and the mutuality of interest of both groups of nations. In this respect  we fully agree with the President of the World Bank  who at the UNCTAD session said that trade protectionism is rarely the right instrument to safeguard income and employment levels. More often it only succeeds in converting potential short-term private costs into long-term social losses.53.	Is there any reason for optimism after this rather gloomy assessment of the scope of problems facing the developing countries? In our opinion  long-term economic self-interest will make it necessary for the industrialized countries  including the centrally planned economies of the USSR and Eastern Europe  to negotiate with more understanding  taking into consideration the underlying economic and social conditions of the developing countries. We base this opinion on the industrialized countries' need not only for oil  but also for raw materials  access to foreign markets and investment opportunities in the third world.54.	The lack of a streamlined steering body within the developing world has up to now been one of the most serious causes of its rather limited impact in talks with the developed world.55.	It is of vital importance for the developing nations  through the machinery of the Group of 77  to prepare their positions in a timely and effective way. This could be furthered considerably by setting up a permanent secretariat of the Group of 77 to carry out the essential preparatory work of analysis  co-ordination and planning. Experience gained by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development would seem to underline the value of such an approach. The proposal for establishing such a permanent secretariat is indeed not new  but has not been decisively dealt with so far. We do hope that the Group of 77 will soon take a positive decision on this matter.56.	The Secretary-General of our Organization  in his recent statement to the Economic and Social Council at its summer session in Geneva  drew the attention of Member States to the energy problem. It goes without saying that the supply of oil and its cost are a matter of extreme importance to the world economy  and constitute an essential element in the balance of payment of all  in particular of the non-oil-producing developing countries.57.	Contrary to the developing countries  the industrialized countries  being fortunate enough to have financial means  technology and know-how at their disposal  are in a much better position to develop new and renewable sources of energy. I would therefore like to appeal to all Member States  but in particular to the non-oil-producing developing countries  to start preparing now for the forthcoming United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy in 1981.58.	In this connexion  my delegation whole-heartedly supports the decision by Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at its recent meeting in Havana  that the international energy issue should be discussed in the context of global negotiations within the United Nations  with the participation of all countries and in relation to such other issues as the problems of the development of the developing countries  financial and monetary reforms and so on. Following the Havana Conference  the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 recommended to this Assembly the adoption of a proposal made by the Group of 77 along the lines of the decision by the non-aligned movement. More specifically  it was proposed that global negotiations should be held at the special session of the General Assembly scheduled for 1980  which may have a considerable bearing on the development strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. This item could be of great  if not indeed of crucial  importance in making that Assembly a success. It places the all-embracing energy problem squarely within the overall context of development. It thus marks a significant departure from an approach according to which it appeared possible to deal with that problem on a separate or piecemeal basis. My delegation welcomes the proposal as a possible major break-through and we will give it our most vigorous support.60.	We consider the problem of energy to be a crucial part of our future development and though we realize that reaching an agreement will not be easy  we do hope progress will be made to relieve some of the heavy burdens weighing down the non-oil-producing countries.61.	In this connexion  I whole-heartedly support the proposal of the President of Mexico  Mr. Jose Lopez Portillo for the adoption of a world energy plan aimed at assuring an orderly  progressive  integrated and just transition from one age of man's history to the next. We also strongly support President Lopez Portillo's proposal to establish a working group composed of representatives of the oil-producing countries  of industrialized countries and of developing petroleum-importing countries for the preparation of the energy plan. In making this historic proposal President Lopez Portillo has  as in the case of disarmament and the establishment of a New International Economic Order  once again demonstrated his country's deep commitment to the solution of the problems of mankind.62.	My country has actively participated in ongoing talks on the future convention on the law of the sea  because my Government is convinced that only a comprehensive and balanced treaty on the law of the sea can prevent a scramble of claims to explore and to exploit the wealth of the oceans beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.63.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has doubtless made substantive progress in certain areas. On the other hand  the results of the negotiations have been meagre in many respects  especially when we recall that the Conference has now been in session for a total of 63 weeks over the past six years. Notwithstanding the many compromise proposals put forward in the various negotiating groups of the main Conference committees  several issues remain unresolved. The problems still pending concerning the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone between adjacent or opposite States are a clear example of the lack of the spirit of compromise needed to settle the hard-core issues plaguing this important Conference.64.	With regard to an equitable system for exploring and exploiting the sea bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  my delegation need hardly stress that one of the main targets of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is translating the concept of the sea as the common heritage of mankind into binding rules and regulations  taking particular account of the interests and needs of the developing countries. It is disappointing to note that the Conference is still far from the true meaning of this concept. My Government sincerely hopes that in the months ahead the Conference will find the ways and means to resolve these problems during the final phase of its work.65.	After its achievement of independence  my country did not hesitate to adopt in the sphere of foreign policy a line of conduct dictated by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and consonant with those of the non-aligned movement  of which we became a member during the recent Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government in Havana.66.	Our deep sense of attachment to the sister nations of Latin America and the Caribbean has in each case been met with a sympathetic response  for which I thank them here  on behalf of my country and on my own behalf. It is a very pleasant task on this occasion for me to express our satisfaction at seeing the principles of cordial and good-neighbourly relations reaffirmed during my visit to Guyana in June of this year. That visit proved once again that good faith and mutual understanding can lead to harmonious and effective cooperation among nations.67.	Individual nationsâand indeed all human institutionsâhave to go through difficult periods in their lives. We all must face the fact that in the course of events mistakes have been and are being made. In both the political and economic arenas  the world community has come up against great and serious difficulties that threaten the machinery of international cooperation. The recognition of these difficulties as such should muster our individual and collective will to deal with them in a realistic manner.68.	I hope and trust that when  in the future  we look back on our work this year  it will be seen not as a year of retrogression and disruption  but rather as a year in which we took a decisive step closer to peace and towards the kind of greater understanding in which faith in a peaceful future survived."
"124",6603,"SYC",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  I should like first of all  on behalf of the delegation of Seychelles and on my own behalf  to congratulate you most warmly upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty- fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The delegation of Seychelles is particularly pleased at your election to the presidency of this session for two reasons. On the one hand  you come from a country that is a neighbour and friend  the United Republic of Tanzania  with which Seychelles has very close ties of co-operation and  on the other hand  you  Comrade Salim Ahmed Salim  for many years within the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples of which you were the Chairman  tirelessly pleaded the cause of independence and the right to self-determination of the people of Seychelles. Now that Seychelles is a free and independent Republic  I wish publicly to pay you a well-deserved tribute. Judging from past experience  we know that you will carry out with competence the lofty task and delicate function with which you have been entrusted. You may rely on the complete cooperation of the delegation of Seychelles.2.	I also take pleasure in warmly thanking the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his unflagging concern for the future of our Organization  and in particular for his interest in my country over the past year. Here I should particularly like to recall that the Secretary-General  pursuant to General Assembly resolution 33/129 of 19 December 1978 concerning assistance to Seychelles  took steps to send a mission to Seychelles in May 1979 for the purpose of inquiring into the progress made in implementing the special economic assistance programme. That mission's report will be presented to us during this session; it is agenda item 12 of the Second Committee's work. 3.	I should also like to congratulate the State of Saint Lucia  a newly admitted Member of our Organization.4.	My delegation also wishes to express its gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Indalecio Lievano.5.	Seychelles is a small country  a third-world country  a poor country that has recently gained its independence. The people of Seychelles are a revolutionary people who have been following the socialist road to development since 5 June 1977. We are progressive  fiercely attached to our independence and to the principles of non-alignment. On the important international political questions confronting our world  our positions are firm and frank. They are dictated by the principles of justice  equality among peoples and respect for the freely expressed will of the peoples. We are firmly anti-imperialist  anti-colonialist  anti-racist  anti-Fascist and anti-Zionist.6.	We are particularly concerned with the situation in southern Africa  for in that region of the world  imperialism is allied with racism in order better to exploit  in the most humiliating manner  millions upon millions of our African brothers.7.	Contrary to what the imperialists maintain  we see the Patriotic Front as the sole legitimate representative of the aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe. Negotiations are being held at London; their sole valid objective should be  in essence  the effective transfer of power to the African majority. The Patriotic Front has evidenced considerable goodwill in agreeing to participate in the Conference and to sit at the same table as the renegade Smith and his close collaborator  Muzorewa. There is every reason to believe  however  that Smith  Muzorewa and their allies are not sincere. If they were  their deadly air force would already have stopped its daily bombing and massacre of whole populations in certain regions of Mozambique.8.	We condemn these shameful acts of aggression against the brother country of Mozambique  and we reiterate our conviction that Smith and Muzorewa do not want a peaceful settlement. We must redouble our vigilance in order to ensure that the London Constitutional Conference  skilfully manipulated by the agents of imperialism  does not degenerate into a mere manoeuvre for legitimizing the puppet and racist Smith- Muzorewa regime and lead finally to the isolation of the Patriotic Front. Let us not forget  in fact  that that is the only result of the London Conference that would be acceptable to the imperialists and their allies. 9.	The people of Namibia are victims of the worst humiliations inflicted by the racist regime of South Africa. Our Organization is morally bound to adopt severe sanctions against South Africa and to compel respect for them  even by force. That regime insolently flouts United Nations resolutionsâour resolutions. The racist South-African troops have with impunity occupied a part of Namibian territory; the Pretoria regime  with impunity  is blocking the settlement put forward by the United Nationsâin other wordsâby ourselves  a solution that would enable the Namibian people to accede to national sovereignty by peaceful means.10.	Our Organization is guilty; by its inertia  it endorses the occupation of Namibia by South Africa and the abominable crimes committed by the racists against the Namibian people. Unfortunately  South Africa has powerful allies among us. This is the cause of our Organization's cowardice vis-a-vis the fate of our Namibian brothers. The people of Seychelles  however  reiterate their steadfast solidarity with the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] and are determined to give this solidarity substance through actions  lending material assistance to the extent our limited means and modest abilities permit.11.	South Africa is the revolting bastion not only of racism  but also of capitalism and imperialism. In the country of apartheid  imperialism wears the mask of racism; imperialism allies itself with racism in order better to exploit the toiling African masses. And we know who the natural allies of the apartheid regime are; we know the countries from which the heavy investments that feed its economy come  leading to the achievement of super profits.12.	For that reason  we say that  in order for the struggle against racism to be truly effective  it must be waged together with the struggle against imperialism. By undermining the structures of imperialism in southern Africa  we will destroy the bases of racism. Racism will no longer have any place in a society from which man's exploitation by man will have been banished once and for all.13.	As regards the problem of Western Sahara  we are proud to state that  ever since our own liberation  Seychelles has lent its brotherly and unqualified support to the gallant Saharan people fighting for their independence under the leadership of their vanguard  the Frente POLISARIO. Moreover  we have recognized the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic for nearly two years now. We congratulate Mauritania on its courageous decision to forgo any territorial claims  nevertheless  we deplore the expansionist policy of the Moroccan leaders  and we urge the Rabat authorities to revise their Western Sahara policy.14.	In the Middle East  the crisis is becoming more acute  and international security is threatened by Israel's aggressive and expansionist policies. Moreover  we also are confronted with the policies of the Governments of Washington and Cairo  which persist in maintaining an increasingly hostile attitude towards the rights of the Palestinian people and towards the total and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all occupied territories. Their policies run counter to relevant resolutions of the United Nations and of the non-aligned movement. That is why the delegation of Seychelles vigorously denounces the Camp David agreements  which constitute a flagrant betrayal of the Arab cause and of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. We are told that Egypt signed a partial peace treaty with Israel.  But who gave Egypt a mandate to dispose of territories that do not belong to it  or to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinian people and in the name of the Arab nation? The Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We reaffirm that in law the alleged Camp David agreements are null and void.15.	The demilitarization of the Indian Ocean is a subject of particular concern to my country. The awareness on the part of the peoples of our region of the forms and dangers of the strategy of imperialism has been constantly developing for the past several years. The struggle to declare the Indian Ocean a zone of peace is linked to the basic interestsâimmediate and long- termâof all islands and coastal countries of the Indian Ocean. That is why we once again appeal for the dismantling of all foreign military  naval and air bases  particularly the Diego Garcia base  for the prohibition of any nuclear explosions in our region  and for the reciprocal and concerted withdrawal of all military presence from non-coastal countries  as the final stage following the dismantling of the military bases.16.	Recently the countries of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] at their Assembly in the Monrovia summits and the non-aligned countries in Havana  once again adopted declarations calling on all States to convert the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace  free of rivalry and competition  and from which all nuclear weapons would be banned. The Heads of State or Government present at those two conferences similarly appealed to our General Assembly to invite the great Powers and the principal users of the Indian Ocean to participate with the coastal countries in the expanded Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean so as to convene and organize the long-awaited United Nations Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean on the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 3259 (XXIX) and 3468 (XXX).17.	In March of this year  in a message addressed to the White House  President Rene' implored President Carter to refrain from stationing a new naval forceâthe Seventh Fleetâin our region  because  as he explained its presence would only accentuate the rivalry between the Powers  which would impede our policy of turning the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace.18.	We urge the great Powers not to ignore all these appeals  in their own interest as well as ours.19.	As regards the question of Kampuchea  my delegation fails to understand how anyone can persist in defending the representatives of a now-deposed Government which was one of the bloodiest in modern history. If the Pol Pot regime were still in power in Kampuchea the Seychelles delegation would understand why  invoking the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States  certain delegations might refrain from denouncing the crimes and atrocities which it committed.20.	May I emphasize  parenthetically  that denunciation of the atrocities of a Government or of a dictator does not  in my delegation's view  constitute interference in a State's domestic affairs; quite the contrary  it is a duty of international solidarity towards the populations which are victims of such crimes.21.	However  since the bloody regime of Pol Pot has been deposed  and since another Government now actually controls Kampuchea  the principles adduced by those who still support that regime can only be fallacious or irrelevant.22.	The Republic of Seychelles  without wishing in any way whatsoever to set itself up as a censor of the legitimacy of any Government  has recently recognized  at the Havana Conference  through President France Albert Rene himself  the People's Revolutionary Council of the People's Republic of Kampuchea as the sole legitimate and genuine government of Kampuchea. We therefore hope that wisdom will prevail and that  in the very near future at all international gatherings  Kampuchea's seat will be occupied by the true representatives of the Kampuchean people  because let us not forget in this debate that only the people of Kampuchea should count.23.	Having stated my country's position on the major issues of present-day international political life  I should like to make a few comments concerning the serious economic problems facing the countries of the third worldâthe so-called developing countries  although in actual fact the majority of us are just under-developed.24.	Our countries  which represent 65 per cent of the world's population  account for only 15 per cent of world production  only 8 per cent of which is industrial production. Our total foreign debt exceeds $300 billion; our average per capita income is 14 times lower than that in developed countries.25.	In our Organization we are all representedâthe rich and developed countries as well as the poor and under-developed ones. We are all aware of the disastrous economic situation that is afflicting two thirds of mankind. We all say that the situation has become untenable  and we are all speaking of a new international economic order. And we enter into dialogues: North and South  UNCTAD  the European Economic Community and the group of African  Caribbean and Pacific States  and so on. But since we refuse to come to grips with the fundamental cause  since we are unwilling to grasp the root of our difficulty  the increasing number of dialogues in which we engage are but dialogues of the deaf. It is sufficient to mention the fifth session of UNCTAD  held recently in Manila  and the recent negotiations between the European Economic Community and the group of African  Caribbean and Pacific States for the purpose of renewing the Lome accords of 1975.26.	We must be frank and honest. The fundamental cause of the evil is imperialism  which is the most advanced stage of capitalism  and the economic structures that flow therefrom. Imperialism has converted our countries into simple producers of raw materials  which are bought from us at prices fixed by the buyer. Imperialism has converted us into consumers of finished products  which are sold to us at increasingly higher ratesârates set by the seller. Imperialism imposes upon us models of development that are reproductions of those of the rich countries  for the most part the Western countries. Imperialism tries to divide us into those of us that produce oil and others  and accuses the former of being responsible for the crisis that is shaking the world economy. Imperialism has converted our under-developed countries into pariahs of the international economic system.27.	The new international economic order must necessarily entail the dismembering of international economic structures that have been imposed by imperialism. Those among the under-developed countries that believe that by entering into a dialogue with representatives of imperialism we shall succeed in improving the situation are lulling themselves with illusions  and they will soon drown in their own contradictions. Padding up the system or giving it a face-lift will only bring about disappointments.28.	The under-developed countries must refuse to be simple producers of raw materials; they must refuse to be always the receivers of assistance; they must lose their inferiority complex vis-a-vis the rich countries  and they must invent their own models for development.29.	In addition  the rich countries should cease behaving as conquerors of the world. They must admit that they have exploited the under-developed countries and that in large measure their wealth is the result of the plundering of raw materials from the third world. The rich countries must recognize that they must discharge an enormous debt towards the under-developed countries. In a word  they should cease behaving like imperialists.30.	Then the rich countries and the poor countries could meet with each other as equal partners  as partners in development. Then  and only then  could a fruitful dialogue be begun.31.	But I must confess that my delegation is pessimistic. It will not be tomorrow that the depth of hope will appear at the end of the tunnel. We are pessimistic because we observe that the most powerful among us are unwilling to question the foundations of capitalism and imperialism. And yet if they thought about it they would see that that would be in their own interest too.32.	In conclusion I should like to refer to the recent non-aligned Conference in Havana  at which more than 90 Members of the United Nations were representedâ approximately two thirds of the delegations present here. The Seychelles delegation hopes that the Declarations adopted by the Heads of State or Government will be the subject of a serious and thorough study on the part of all United Nations bodies. If it is not  that will be a serious error  because these documents set forth the legitimate aspirations of two thirds of mankind. "
"125",6638,"SYR",34,1979,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to extend to you  Sir  and to the friendly people of the United Republic of Tanzania warmest felicitations on your election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We highly appreciate the great role you have played over the years in presiding over the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and in representing your country in the Security Council. Your qualifications and experience will certainly lead our session to the success we all aspire to. We assure you that we shall spare no effort in co-operating with you towards that end.225.	I wish to take this opportunity to hail the success achieved by the previous session under the presidency of Mr. Lievano.226.	I also congratulate the State of Saint Lucia on its admission to membership in this world Organization.227.	The increasing role of the United Nations and the growing world interest in this role emphasize our joint responsibility for the necessity to seize the opportunity of our meeting in this new session of the General Assembly to examine the international situation  evaluate the consequences and effects of the events that have occurred since our previous session and to seek  seriously and attentively  a solution to the many international problems that confront us  some of which have produced such increasing tension that they imperil international peace and security  entailing dangers of unlimited consequences.228.	It is evident that international detente has sometimes succeeded in keeping the world removed from the cold war  on the one hand  and in creating a new atmosphere of international co-operation on the other. However  international trust in detente cannot be enhanced unless the framework of such a process is expanded to encompass the whole world and to help in solving intricate international problems. The continued presence of such problems  and the aggravation of some of them  such as the Middle East problem  underscore the need for the participation of all States on an equal footing in drawing up the detente policy so as to give this policy the required comprehensive international dimension  and in developing the detente process so that it will become a positive factor in ensuring international peace and security and setting up new systems which will be more just and equitable in the area of international relations.229.	Total and comprehensive disarmament is a major objective which the world community is striving to achieve. Such efforts were recently demonstrated at the tenth special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament. The desire of the international community to stop the arms race  to ban the use of nuclear weapons and prevent their proliferation  and to establish a number of zones free of nuclear arms  was stressed at that session.230.	However  the arms race remains a fact threatening mankind with unlimited dangers  especially if we recall that two of the largest arsenals of modern weapons are in the hands of the racist aggressive regimes in occupied Palestine and in South Africa.231.	Therefore  we cannot but emphasize that disarmament can be achieved only through the elimination of colonialism  racism and zionism  and all aspects of aggression  occupation  domination and foreign exploitation; only if all peoples enjoy security based on justice and equality; and only when all peoples feel reassured as to the respect of their territorial integrity  independence  sovereignty  and their right to self-determination and to the choice of the system they desire.232.	Since the end of the first part of our preceding session  a great victory was won in Asia when the people of Iran  under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini  eliminated an edifice of imperialism  reaction and terrorism and has consolidated Iran's sovereignty  independence and non-alignment. In this way  the aspirations of the people of Iran for liberty  justice and progress have been fulfilled.233.	In Latin America  another great victory was achieved by the people of Nicaragua  who have freed themselves from the Fascist Somoza regime  and are now enjoying freedom.234.	In Africa  African vigilance has decisively destroyed schemes to thwart the heroic struggle of the people of Zimbabwe  who boycotted the spurious elections and rejected their outcome. It is ironic that the plotters  thinking that their scheme had fooled African and international public opinion  are now calling upon the world to recognize the new regime and to lift the sanctions imposed on Rhodesia.235.	Nevertheless  such bright spots in the international scene do not obscure our vision regarding the many critical problems that remain unsolved and that imperil international peace and security.236.	In South Africa  the apartheid regimes are adamant in defying world public opinion  international statutes  and the United Nations Charter and resolutions. These regimes practise apartheid  racial discrimination and terrorism. They are setting up domestic Bantustans and are committing cruel aggressions against the frontline African States. Owing to the weak international measures of deterrence against the aggressiveness of the said regimes  the region has become one of the worst hotbeds of tension in the world and directly threatens the security and independence of the African continent  and in particular  of the front-line States. In this connexion  we wish to stress our absolute support and backing for the liberation movements in South Africa  Zimbabwe  and Namibia in their struggle to secure the rights of their peoples to self-determination  independence and national sovereignty. We also affirm our support for the resistance of the front-line African States to the brutal racist aggressions  and the manoeuvres aimed at liquidating the cause of national liberation of the peoples of southern Africa.237.	In Asia  we can but express our deep regret for the explosion of the situation in South-East Asia  which has shaken the stability of the region  has threatened the independence of its peoples  and has reduced the area to another hotbed of tension.238.	Furthermore  the Korean question remains unsolved. This prompts us to stress the need for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and for the start of the necessary dialogue between the two parts of Korea  in the implementation of the joint communique signed in 1972 for the peaceful unification of the country and the realization of its independence and national unity.239.	The situation in Cyprus remains tense and calls for concern. This makes it necessary to speed up the efforts aimed at a negotiated solution between the two communities under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General based on the relevant United Nations resolutions  and within the framework of the respect for the sovereignty of Cyprus  its independence  territorial integrity  unity and non-alignment.240.	Despite the strenuous constructive efforts exerted by the group of developing countries during the sixth and seventh special sessions of the United Nations  and the North-South dialogue in Paris  and more recently at the fifth session of UNCTAD  to convince and persuade the advanced industrial countries to co-operate in establishing the new international economic order  these countries have continued to place obstacles in the path of the desired co-operation  clinging more and more to the privileges afforded them by the prevailing economic  commercial and monetary system  which is far from being just and is based on exploitation. As a natural consequence  the provisions of the General Assembly resolutions adopted at the two sessions remain a dead letter  and the Paris and Manila conferences have ended in failure.241.	This will certainly widen the gap between the rich and the poor countries. It will further deprive the developing countries of sources of economic development and will bar them from acquiring the modem technology needed for such development. It will certainly lead to the strengthening of the blockade imposed on the developing countries by certain advanced industrial countries  in co-operation with transnational firms  to compel them to sell their raw materials at very cheap prices  while the former countries raise the prices of their manufactured goods to an extent that is threatening to destroy the economies of the developing countries.242.	In this respect  we wish to warn against the danger of drifting along with the claims of some of the advanced industrial countries  especially the United States of America  which attribute the causes of the present international economic crisis to the so-called energy crisis  and blame the developing oil-producing countries for this crisis.243.	Therefore  we stress the need for the cooperation of all developing countries  especially in preparing for the United Nations special session scheduled for next year on international economic co-operation  with the aim of achieving a basic change in the present structure of economic relations  and setting up the new world economic system  so as to consolidate the economic independence of the developing countries  to ensure prosperity and stability for the peoples of the world  and to help guarantee international peace and security.244.	While reviewing current issues  we find it necessary to point to the problem resulting from the attempts made by certain countries to give far-fetched interpretations to the concepts related to human rights in order to justify their interference in the internal affairs of States  in particular those of the third-world countries  under the pretence of protecting human rights.245.	We must warn against the dangers of such attempts  especially in view of the fact that their advocates belong to those countries which continue to provide all kinds of arms to the regimes of oppression  aggression and racism  and this not only violates human rights but also impairs the dignity of man and threatens his very existence.246.	Owing to our belief in the rights of the individual  of groups and of peoples  big and small  we find it necessary to counter this offensive  which tries to focus the attention of world public opinion on the rights of individuals and minorities in this or that country  and to distract attention from the basic rights of millions of people who are labouring under the yoke of colonialism  occupation and racial discrimination and are even deprived of their right to live. Human rights cannot be safeguarded under conditions of the use of force  repression  and colonialist and racist oppression  or by depriving people of their country  land and home. A striking example is the suffering Arab  who is living under the yoke of racist Zionist colonialism in Palestine and in the occupied Arab territories  and the suffering of the Africans  who are living under the yoke of racist regimes in South Africa  Rhodesia and Namibia.247.	These issues which I have mentioned were among the issues dealt with by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held early this month in Havana and attended by the representatives of 94 States  representing the majority of the peoples of the world. The Conference enjoyed great success  thanks to the adherence of the heads of State and delegations to the principles of the non-aligned movement  and their determination to move from the state of confrontation among blocs and military alliances to the stage of solidarity and cooperation  in order to spare the world the tragedies of war and the disasters of stultifying economic crises. The non-aligned countries are determined to seek a world that preserves the dignity and life of man without fear and to ensure for peoples the right to self-determination  to choose the political and social system that suits them best  and to participate in establishing a world of peace  security  co-operation and solidarity. Major credit is due to President Fidel Castro and the friendly Cuban Government for facilitating the success of the Conference.248.	The outcome of the Havana Conference will play a major role in world development. It will provide the United Nations with additional energy and fresh initiatives towards constructive work. The principles of the non-aligned movement  the resolutions adopted by the Conference and the positions taken by it on such principles represent the high human aspirations of all peoples to achieve a better world  free from the evil of colonialism  racism and zionism  free from oppression and exploitation and free from all aspects of influence and the imposition of wills and policiesâa world from which the causes of war and aggression have been completely eliminated.249.	The Sixth Conference of the non-aligned countries expressed its aspirations and hopes to serve the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. They are based on the experience of humanity over hundreds of years and on the lessons learned from the sufferings of peoples as a result of wars and aggression. They are based on the hopes of peoples for peace  security and progress. I am therefore convinced that the results of the Havana Conference will receive the support and appreciation of Members.250.	Anyone who strives for the attainment of peace and prosperity for mankind must be concerned about the most dangerous hotbed of conflict in our world today  a hotbed that has existed for more than 30 years in the Middle East. The situation in that region constitutes a grave threat to world peace and security. There is a growing possibility of armed conflict  the consequences of which will not be confined to the region but might engulf the great world Powers. Such a conflict  even if limited in its geographic framework  might jeopardize the welfare and progress of peoples and lead to complicated economic  financial and social crises that would shake the world economic system and cause a tangle of chaos and disorder  with unpredictable consequences.251.	I point out such risks so clearly because my country feels them keenly and warns against them in the light of the events that we all experienced a few years ago. These risks are the result of Israel's stubborn persistence in its aggressive policy  its settler-colonialist expansion  and its refusal to recognize the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and to withdraw completely from the Palestinian and Arab territories. The recent developments that have occurred  notably from September 1978 up to the present time  have rewarded the aggressor with the fruit of his aggression and perpetuated the gains acquired by the enemy through force of arms and acts of aggressions.252.	The most dangerous manifestations of such developments are represented by the Camp David agreements and the Egyptian-Israeli Treaty of Peace. These the United States of America has designed  supervised  organized and formulated  and has given them its blessing by signing them. Thus  this superpower has fundamentally participated in creating new factors that led to gravely intensifying the crisis in the region and has brought the hotbed to which I have referred to the brink of explosion and collapse. It would have been much better for the United States of America to remain committed to the grave responsibility and task which the United Nations Charter entrusts to the permanent members of the Security Council  namely  to safeguard international peace and security. This super-Power has  however  shirked this mission and these responsibilities with respect to the Middle East. This is a very serious development  from which we should draw a lesson for the future.253.	An objective analysis of the two Camp David agreementsâA Framework for Peace in the Middle East  Agreed at Camp David  and Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel  signed between the Egyptian regime and the Zionist entity of Israel at Washington on 17 September 1978 and especially the first agreement  proves beyond any doubt that the two agreements have violated international legitimacy and the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations. I shall summarize the proofs and arguments establishing those violations.254.	First of all  with regard to the right of self-determination  Article I of the United Nations Charter stipulates that the second purpose of the international Organization involves ""... respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples . . . "". Such rights have been confirmed by many declarations and decisions adopted by this Assembly. Resolution 3236 (XXIX)  adopted on 22 November 1974  reaffirmed the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination without external interference  That people has been waging an honourable struggle for self-determination  The torch of that struggle serves as a beacon for other oppressed peoples. But what have the Egyptian regime  Israel and the United States administration done to this right that has become a main pillar of the international political system?255.	The first Camp David agreement has totally neglected this right. It has disregarded the Palestinian cause  which all Members have recognized as being the core of the conflict in the Middle East  as they have also recognized that the conflict will not end until a fair and equitable settlement is found for the Palestinian cause. More important is the fact that the agreement does not recognize the rights of the Palestinian people  although it was generous enough to offer administrative self-rule for the inhabitantsâas if there were no other ties binding them and as if they were merely a group of people that included Palestinians and Zionist settlers living in settlements that are being widely and constantly established.256.	The matter does not end here  for in a letter to Beginâone of the nine letters considered an integral part of the first Camp David agreementâPresident Carter stated that he had been informed by Begin that he understands the terms ""Palestinians"" and ""Palestinian People"" to mean ""Palestinian Arabs"" and the expression ""West Bank"" to mean ""Judaea and Samaria"". Thus the agreement denies the very existence of the Palestinian people and admits only that there are Palestinian inhabitants and individuals and claims that the West Bank is an Israeli territory bearing an Israeli name.257.	The agreement divides the Palestinian people with respect to so-called self-rule. It limits participation in self-rule to the inhabitants of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and negates the rights of the other two groups of this people  namely  those living under occupation since 1948 and those dispersed outside their homeland to all parts of the world.258.	The institutions of self-rule  as I indicated earlier  will be elected under Israeli military occupation in the absence of any international control. This is contrary to the practice followed by the United Nations  which requires the consultation of peoples with respect to self-determination.259.	Consequently  the right to self-determination has been violated; the Palestinian people have been ignored; and the occupation will continue through a formula that was plotted and imposed by the three parties at Camp David.260.	In this connexion  I wish to ask  how can the Egyptian regime; Israel and the United States of America decide the fate of the people of Palestine? Is the right to self-determination to be exercised by the people concerned  or by three arch-enemies of that people? The parties who met at Camp David have conferred this right upon themselves in the name of colonialism and Zionism. Who gave the ruler of Egypt the right to represent the Palestinian people without being authorized by anyone to do so? Anwar El-Sadat arrogated to himself this right when he wrote to President Carter that ""Egypt would be ready to assume the Arab role emanating from these texts after consultations with Jordan and representatives of the Palestinian people"". Jordan has refused to have anything to do with the Camp David agreements and the parties to them. The Palestinian people has also refused to conduct a dialogue with the ruler of Egypt  who continues to encroach upon the rights of the Palestinian people  unjustly and aggressively appointing himself as its representative.261.	Secondly  I come to sovereignty over the land. The measure of self-rule devised in the first Camp David agreement is based on a concept separating the people from the land. Such a system was never witnessed before in history  not even in the ages of darkness and slavery. It has separated the people from the land and its resources. Even water resources will not be the property of the people  but will remain under the control of the colonialists.262.	The first Camp David agreement has deferred the discussion of sovereignty over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip until after the transitional period. Throughout this period  the occupying authorities will remain in the occupied territories and the process of colonization and Judaization will continue. This is a process that ultimately aims at creating a new fait accompli in the occupied territories  so that it will thus become impossible to establish Palestinian Arab sovereignty there in the future.263.	Israel is determined  as is confirmed by the statements made by its leaders  to offer two possibilities  both of which would lead to the same outcome: either acceptance of the principle of Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  or continued application of the formula of self-rule  leaving the issue of sovereignty open to endless negotiations  while the Israelis continue the process of colonization throughout the period of the negotiations. In a statement on Radio Israel on 25 September 1978  Menachem Begin said:""After five years of self-rule  and when the subject of sovereignty is raised  we shall establish our right over Judaea and Samaria and Gaza. If no agreement is then reached  self-rule shall continue in those areas  and with it the measures of Israeli security"".In another statement to the daily newspaper Yedioth Aharanot on 1 October 1978  Begin said that he had explained to President Carter that he had accepted ""self-rule"" just for the sake of advancing the peace process with Egypt  ""but this would never mean giving up our sovereignty over these territories.""264.	Subsequent events have proved that Israel is persisting in this attitude. In deeds and words Israel is showing that it will maintain sovereignty over the entire Palestinian homeland. Its persistence in implementing its plans of building settlements and the decision taken by the Israeli Government on 16 September 1979 permitting Israelis to purchase and own lands in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are but two of many irrefutable proofs of this.265.	With respect to Jerusalem  despite the fact that the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly have affirmed the invalidity of Israeli measures  such as annexation and the alteration of the geographical  historical and demographic features  Begin notified President Carter in the annex to the agreement that ""Jerusalem is one city indivisible  the Capital of the State of Israel"".18 The President of the Egyptian regime has endorsed this claim in a letter to President Carter where he said: ""In this way  the City [Jerusalem] shall be undivided.""266.	Thirdly  I come to the right of return. The flouting of the international community by the parties to the Camp David agreements with respect to the right of return of the Palestinians to their homes and properties has attained its peak. Since the inception of the United Nations and up to this date there has been no resolution that has year after year been reaffirmed more often than resolution 194 (III)  which was first adopted by the Assembly at its third session on 11 December 1948  and was reaffirmed in particular in resolution 33/112 of 18 December 1978  supported by all States Members of the United Nations with the exception of Israel and El Salvador.267.	Despite this clear and collective international will  the parties to the Camp David agreements have feigned forgetfulness of the right of return and have negated it. They have limited it exclusively to persons displaced from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967. As to those expelled and rendered homeless from 1948 to 1967 and after the 1967 aggression  the parties to the Camp David agreements have decided these persons should remain exiled from their homeland for ever  without having any national identity or a people to belong to. Thus  we are facing today a situation that is unique in the period since the Second World War  the most serious feature of which is the heinous disregard by the Egyptian and the United States Governments of a resolution that is virtually part of international law because of the numerous affirmations thereof by the United Nations over a period of more than 30 years.268.	Furthermore  the return of those persons displaced in 1967 is to be entrusted to a committee whose task  as stipulated in section A  paragraph 3  of the first agreement  will be ""to decide by agreement on the modalities of admission of persons displaced from the West Bank and Gaza in 1967  together with necessary measures to prevent disruption and disorder."" This means that Israel  as member of the committee  has the right to refuse the return of any Palestinian whom it may consider likely to cause disruption and disorder. Thus  of the more than 2.5 million Palestinian refugees very few would be allowed to return. This would have the effect of annulling the historic resolution 194 (III) and scores of other resolutions affirming the right of return of the displaced Palestinian people.269.	Fourthly  I turn to the question of the violation of the sovereignty of other States. The tragic sufferings of the Palestinian people appear to be regarded as insufficient by parties to the Camp David agreements  who have proceeded to impose terms of their own on other sovereign States Members of the United Nations. In the section entitled ""Associated principles"" of the first Camp David agreement  there is a text stating that:""Egypt and Israel state that the principles and provisions described below should apply to peace treaties between Israel and each of its neighboursâ Egypt  Jordan  Syria and Lebanon"".270.	Accordingly  the parties to the Camp David agreements have violated the first principle of the Charter of the United Nations inasmuch as Article 2  paragraph 1  of the Charter lays down the principle of ""the sovereign equality of all its Members"". The parties at Camp David  however  have permitted themselves to infringe the sovereignty of States Members of the United Nations  to impose upon them a specific will  and to commit them to specific measures and policies  as if those parties represented the will of the world. In fact  they are actually violating the will of the international community and the Charter of the United Nations.271.	Fifthly  I shall speak of the contravention of the will of the international community. Security Council resolution 338 (1973) states in paragraph 3:""Immediately and concurrently with the ceasefire  negotiations shall start between the parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.""The Security Council was of the view that such appropriate auspices could be provided by the co-chairmanship of the USSR and the United States in a conference in which all parties concerned would take part. In resolution 344 (1973)  the Security Council expressed its confidence that the Secretary-General of the United Nations would play a full and effective role in the Peace Conference on the Middle East  and would preside over its meetings if the parties so desired.272.	To carry out their plot  parties to the Camp David agreements disregarded all these resolutions issued by the highest international authority entrusted with matters of international peace and security. They singled themselves out from the whole world  and without the consent of the other parties concerned  laid down the features of what they unjustly call ""a just peace in the Middle East"".273.	Where  it may be asked  is the co-chairman of the Peace Conference  namely the Soviet Union? Where is the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the role he was to play? Where are the other parties concernedâSyria  Jordan and the PLO? Where is the adherence to the United Nations resolutions that have defined the bases of a just peace and laid down its framework? The parties to the Camp David conspiracy left the circle of international legitimacy for that of darkness and plot.274.	For the same reasons and on the basis of the same facts  the Assembly adopted resolution 33/28 A on 7 December 1978  which  in paragraph 4:""Declares that the validity of agreements purporting to solve the problem of Palestine requires that they be within the framework of the United Nations and its Charter and its resolutions on the basis of the full attainment and exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right of return and the right to national independence and sovereignty in Palestine  and with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization"".275.	Sixthly  the agreements are a step towards war. The Egyptian regime  Israel and the United States are trying to deceive world public opinion by claiming that what they accomplished at Camp David is a step towards comprehensive peace. What kind of peace are they talking about  when the United States  under the Camp David agreements  has pledged to furnish Israel with huge quantities of modern sophisticated weaponry  some of which have not yet been supplied to the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization? The fantastic amounts in billions of United States dollars pledged by the United States to Israel in the form of weapons and joint enterprises to manufacture modern aircraft are sufficient to reveal this deception which is feeding the war machinery of the Israeli aggressor to help it to continue with its expansionist invasions.276.	Perhaps the best refutation of that delusion is the situation prevailing in southern Lebanon. Since the signing of the Camp David agreements  whereby Israel became reassured of the total disregard by the Egyptian Government of international legitimacy and of Egyptian national and pan-Arab obligations  Israel has intensified its land  air and sea attacks against southern Lebanon. These acts of aggression constitute a continuous war of annihilation against the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples. In these attacks Israel is using the most modern weapons supplied by the United States  with the result that thousands of innocent peopleâwomen  elderly men and childrenâare killed; towns  villages and their economic life are destroyed; hundreds of thousands of civilians are forced to leave their homes. By means of this war  which Israel is waging after having received the green light at Camp David  the Israelis want to perpetuate their occupation of some regions in southern Lebanon through their agents  who have betrayed their country and their people.277.	I have only outlined the situation prevailing in the Middle East  and the risks and dangers which the Camp David agreements entail  the effects of which will not be limited to the region.278.	Despite all these circumstances which I have outlined  Syria is still determined to do its utmost to help establish a just peace. I repeat what we have always declared before this Assembly and from every other international rostrumânamely  that for a Middle East peace to be just  the following two conditions must be met: first of all  Israel's withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967âa total comprehensive withdrawal without any modification of boundaries  and without any diminution of Arab sovereignty over the Arab territories; secondly  recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian peopleâin particular  the right of return  the right to self-determination and the right to the establishment of a national independent State in their homelandâand the participation of the PLO on an equal footing with all other parties concerned in all matters related to the Palestinian cause and its people.279.	The facts of the status quo in the Middle East prompt us to assert two important facts: first  that the situation in the region is extremely dangerous and might lead to an explosion  the intensity of which may cause a world catastrophe; secondly  that if the aggressor and those collaborating with it are not confronted with a decisive and firm stand on the international level  they will continue to defy the will of the international community. This would cause further tension in the region  and would make the region the most dangerous hotbed of tension in the world  thus endangering international peace and security.280.	Having presented the above analysis  I wish to conclude by saying that the least that can be done to counteract the Camp David agreements is for the international community to condemn them so that the course to peace would remain open  blessed by the Assembly's will and support. Thus the Assembly would be expressing its respect of the United Nations Charter and its principles and would be contributing to the enhancement of the role of the United Nations in preserving international peace and security."
"126",6683,"TCD",34,1979,"ï»¿First of all  it is a signal honour and pleasant duty for me  as head of the delegation of my country  to convey my country's greetings to our Assembly  which represents the greatest forum for dialogue among the nations and peoples of the world.60.	I should like  on behalf of my delegation and for myself personally  to express our profound grief on learning of the premature death of one of the illustrious sons of Africa  President Agostinho Neto of the People's Republic of Angola  a great fighter for freedom. To the Government and valiant people of Angola we transmit our profound condolences and wish them courage in this grievous time of trial.61.	Let me now warmly congratulate Mr. Salim on his unanimous election to the exalted and onerous post of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His election honours  in more ways than one  his great and beautiful country  the United Republic of Tanzania  and is also a source of satisfaction and pride for all Africa  whose contribution to the quest for solutions to the problems of our time becomes thereby an incontestable reality. In view of his eminent qualities as a skilled diplomat and statesman  we are certain that under his dynamic direction the work of the present session will conclude with happy results.62.	We should also like to pay a warm tribute to his eminent predecessor  the Ambassador of Colombia  who  with his authority and wisdom  successfully guided the work of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly to its conclusion.63.	Finally  may I warmly welcome Saint Lucia's admission as the one hundred and fifty-second Member of our Organization. The presence of a new Member cannot but strengthen the great United Nations family and bring it closer to its objective of universality.64.	It is because of energetic and continued action by the United Nations that the world has for more than 30 years enjoyed a relative peace. Nevertheless  the regional conflicts which persist in certain parts of the earth could  unless we are vigilant  at any moment break this peace and security to which all peoples legitimately aspire.65.	Thus  the situation in the Middle East remains explosive  despite attempts at a peaceful settlement of the conflict; southern Africa remains a subject of grave concern for the international community because of white domination; certain African States south of the Sahara  because they are so weak  are constantly threatened with destabilization  and that jeopardizes peace on the continent; and  finally  certain South-East Asian States are not exempt from similar threats. The problem of genuine disarmament under effective international control still remains in the realm of theoretical discussion  despite the efforts made in this respect by the United States and the Soviet Union in signing the agreements resulting from the first and second rounds of SALT.66.	No real progress has been made in the economic field since the principle of reviewing international economic relations was decided on by the sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly.67.	All those questionsâall of them equally importantâmust find their solutions in the appropriate framework  which is that of the United Nations. Our country strongly supports the strengthening of its role for the settlement of the major problems of the world.68.	Before defining my delegation's position on certain of the aforementioned subjects  I should like  with the Assembly's permission and indulgence  briefly to describe the situation of my country  Chad  particularly since the distressing events that occurred at the beginning of this year.69.	Since 1965  that is to say five years after its accession to independence  Chad has never known the political calm likely to promote the development activity that is so necessary for a country that is particularly economically disadvantaged. At that date difficulties arose between the Administration and a part of the population in the centre and east of the country. These were the Mangalme events that were at the basis of a revolt which resulted in an armed opposition and which  on 22 June 1966  led to the establishment of the National Liberation Front of Chad [FROLINAT].70.	FROLINAT has struggled for 13 years to establish social justice by the suppression of tribalism  regionalism  and nepotism and to achieve our national independence and respect of our territorial integrity by a systematic opposition to any foreign domination no matter what its origin.71.	After the fall of the Tombalbaye regime on 13 April 1975  the military regime of General Malloum appealed to the armed opposition for national reconciliation among all the sons of Chad who were divided by internal quarrels. The armed opposition did not remain insensible to that appeal and there were several meetings between the emissaries of the central power and the leaders of the various opposition trends.72.	We mention in particular the meetings at Zurich  Switzerland  and Libreville  Gabon  between the representatives of the Malloum Government and the original FROLINAT. If the expected results did not materialize  those meetings none the less made it possible to establish a dialogue between the Government and the opposition.73.	Further  an important conference was held from 23 to 27 March 1978 in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya between representatives of the central power and those of FROLINAT  in the presence of the delegations of Sudan  Niger and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  all three countries that border on Chad. That Conference concluded with the signing of an eight-point joint communiquÃ©' establishing  inter alia  a cease-fire and freedom of movement over the entire national territory; but it was violated and later denounced by the signatories.74.	Furthermore  from July to September 1977 negotiations were carried out at Khartoum  under the auspices of the Government of the Sudan  between representatives of the Government and another opposition faction  namely  the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North. An important agreement was signed as a result of those talks which provided  in particular  for the release of prisoners and those held for political reasons and the formation of a government of national union.75.	To implement that document the signatory parties prepared and adopted on 25 August 1978 a fundamental charter which was the new institutional framework for the country. It provided for the establishment of a Government of National Union  headed by the President of the Republic and a Prime Minister. That Government came into being on 29 August of the same year.76.	But from the first months of the coming into force of that charter difficulties arose that led to an outbreak of hostilities on 12 February 1979 during which N'Djamena  the capital of Chad  was sacked. That was a genuine civil war that resulted in the loss of numerous lives and much material destruction at N'Djamena and in other parts of the country.77.	Faced with these distressing events  which dangerously threatened the unity of the country  the countries that are brothers and friends of Chad  especially the neighbouring countries  did not remain indifferent and rushed to Chad's aid. Thus the Presidents of the Sudan and Nigeria offered to mediate among the antagonistic factions in Chad. Following upon an understanding between the Sudan and Nigeria  it was decided to convene in Nigeria a meeting on national reconciliation in Chad.78.	Between 8 and 15 March 1979 a first conference was held at Kano  in northern Nigeria  between the conflicting parties in Chad  in the presence of the countries that are neighbours of Chad. It led to the conclusion of the so-called Kano Agreement on the national reconciliation of Chad. According to this Agreement  all the political institutions resulting from the Fundamental Charter were to be dissolved on 23 March 1979 and give way to a Transition Government of National Union  which was to be formed only after a second Kano conference consisting of all the Chad political groups.79.	That precaution was taken because not all the opposing factions in Chad had participated at the first Kano Conference.80.	However  until such time as that government could be formed  a Provisional Council of State made up of the four parties in Chad signatories to the Kano Agreement was to assume the management of the current affairs of the country from the date of the dissolution of the institutions.81.	The second Kano Conference was held from 3 to 11 April  but it failed even before it had really begun because from the very beginning it came up against the problem of the representation of the factions which had not been present at the first Kano Conference. Indeed  the participation in the Conference of the newly arrived parties was challenged by some of the groups that had signed the Kano Agreement. Given this deadlock  the only solution open to the participants was to set up a commission of inquiry made up of two representatives for each participating country and one representative for each faction in Chad. The mandate of that commission was to verify the actual politico-military existence in Chad of the new factions which came forward at the second Kano Conference and to report to the Chairman of the Conference in order that he might convene a new meeting aimed at forming the Transition Government of National Union.82.	But before the Commission could even begin its work  the factions that had signed the Kano Agreement proceeded to form a Transition Government of National Union in accordance with an agreement signed on 17 April 1979 at N'Djamena  nevertheless leaving open the possibility for those factions whose genuine existence was subsequently established by the commission of inquiry to joining that Government.83.	That was a mistake which did nothing to promote a happy outcome of the crisis in Chad.84.	Indeed  the Government formed at N'Djamena was challenged not only by the factions in Chad that were not represented therein but also by the countries neighbouring Chad  which legally remained seized of the problem. 90. Hence a third conference on Chad was convened from 25 to 27 May 1979 at Lagos. The N'Djamena Government  considering that the commission of inquiry had not yet submitted its report  did not deem it useful to participate in the Conference 91- On the other hand  the factions that had been challenged had  for their part  participated in the Lagos meeting  at which they had officially subscribed to the Kano Agreement and  like the participating countries  demanded that the N'Djamena Government resign.92.	The situation therefore remained confused and tense until the organization  upon the initiative of the Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Sudan and the Federal Republic of Nigeria  of a fourth conference on the national reconciliation of Chad.93.	That Conference was held from 13 to 21 August 1979 at Lagos at the ministerial level and later at the level of Heads of State  with the personal participation of the Presidents of Nigeria and Cameroon and the Second Vice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Sudan  as well as the Deputy Secretary-General for Political Affairs of the Organization of African Unity [OAU].94.	It is fitting to note here that the OAU  having been seized of the problem of Chad at the sixteenth ordinary session of its Assembly of Heads of State and Government at Monrovia  decided that  in addition to the six neighbouring countries of Chad  Benin  the Congo  Liberia  the Ivory Coast and Senegal should be associated as observers in the next conference on Chad. Thus all the neighbouring countries and the observers took part in the Lagos Conference.95.	Thanks to the praiseworthy efforts of the participating and observer countries and the effective contribution of the OAU  as well as the determination of all the parties in Chad to arrive at a solution  an agreement was concluded on 21 August 1979 on national reconciliation in Chad. Similarly  a programme of action was adopted by the various factions to serve as a working framework for the Transition Government of National Union.96.	The President and the Vice-President of that Government were designated at Lagos. They were Mr. Goukouni Oueddeye and Lieutenant-Colonel Kamougue Wadal Abdelkader respectively.97.	The Transition Government of National Union will be formed in the coming weeks  as soon as the neutral force  which will be composed of elements from Benin  Guinea and the Congo  reaches N'Djamena and demilitarizes the capital.98.	That Government  which  according to the Lagos Agreement  is to last for 18 months  is entrusted with leading the country and preparing free elections to be held within the time prescribed.99.	Until the formation of that Government  Chad is being governed by an interim committee under the authority of the President of the Transition Government of National Union  the Head of State.100.	As representatives will have noted  we would not have reached this happy result so early  bearing in mind the complexity of the problem of Chad  had we not benefited from the wise counsel and advice which were ceaselessly offered by our neighbours and brother countries  which spared neither time nor effort to assist the people of Chad in seeking a solution to their problem.101.	Hence  I should like from this rostrum to express the sincere thanks and profound gratitude of the people of Chad to all those countries which assisted us  particularly Nigeria  during this sombre period in the history of our country.102.	The Government of Chad when it is formed will not fail in due course directly to express to the Heads of State of the countries concerned the gratitude of the people of Chad.103.	In the settlement of our problem  Africans have demonstrated for the first time their ability to help each other in solving their disputes  even in the case of internal disputes. Let us hope that this solution will be lasting and definitive so that it may serve as a useful example for the African continent or elsewhere.104.	Just as they have effectively helped us to find a solution to our internal tragedy  I sincerely hope that the African States will within the OAU evince the same ability and determination to find a solution to the frontier dispute between Chad and its neighbour to the north  the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.105.	It is in that spirit that we confidently await the outcome of the follow-up action that the OAU intends to take on the matter we submitted to it at its fourteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government at Libreville in 1977. 106.	I reaffirm here the devotion of my country to the cardinal principles governing relations between States  which are included in the Charter of the United Nations and that of the OAU and continued in their relevant resolutions  namely  respect for territorial integrity and national sovereignty  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and the peaceful settlement of disputes between States.107.	Chad belongs to the non-aligned movement and remains profoundly attached to its principles  namely  the rejection of alignment  peaceful coexistence  the independence of States  the rejection of any form of subjection  the rejection of any form of pressure in international relations  and just and equitable international co-operation.108.	Our absence from the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries at Havana is not to be understood as a deliberate failure to meet our obligations; it was due to obvious causes arising out of our domestic situation.109.	Chad was already at a disadvantage because it is a land-locked country  and now  after 19 years of chaotic mismanagement of its affairs and 13 years of armed struggle which reached its peak in the latest events  at this moment it presents a distressing spectacle. Indeed  the national economy is in a catastrophic state  and must be reorganized in its entirety.110.	Agriculture and cattle-raising  the two key sectors of our national economy remain at this time completely disorganized  and productivity is steeply declining. This means that there may well be not only a substantial drop in the volume of food production  but also a low agricultural output for export  which is the sole source of foreign exchange for our country.111.	The means of communication  already inadequate  must be completely refitted.112.	The important Chad International Telecommunications Centre and the National Radio Broadcasting Station were seriously damaged during the fighting in the town of N'Djamena. Their reconstruction will require several billion CFA francs. Some temporary installations now link Chad with the outside world.113.	Roads in various parts of the country are in a state of advanced deterioration  and some are even impassible because they have not been maintained for 15 years.114.	Hospitals and clinics are indescribably out-of- date  and basic medication of every kind is lacking. To this we must add a shortage of medical staff after the mass departure of those who worked with us.115.	One of the many concerns which the Chad authorities must face  and which will require urgent action  is the beginning of the school year 1979-80. The State will find it almost impossible to ensure the normal resumption of schooling because in primary schools  we lack the indispensable materials for the schooling of children  and for secondary education and the University of Chad  we must further cope with the departure of almost all the technical assistance teaching staff from France and elsewhere.116.	Government financial institutions are no longer meeting their payments.117.	This means that the Republic of Chad is facing problems which seriously jeopardize any economic or social development. These problems can only be solved by urgently mobilizing international aid for reconstruction.118.	The delegation of the Republic of Chad therefore launches an urgent appeal to the entire international community from this rostrum of the General Assembly of the United Nations to the international organizations and to all the States Members of the United Nations for immediate aid to the people of Chad.119.	By your indulgence  Mr. President  I should now like to dwell for a moment on some international problems of our time. I am thinking first of the right of peoples to self-determination.120.	Since the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  important victories have certainly been won over colonialism and neo-colonialism. But there are still millions of human beings who still suffer under the yoke of oppression and discrimination because certain regimes  on the basis of ignoble principles  continue systematically to oppose the political emancipation of peoples and refuse to recognize the inalienable right to freedom and to self- determination. Thus  the struggle for political emancipation of peoples who are fighting against all forms of dependence and exploitation remains the essential characteristic of the international situation.121.	The hotbeds of crisis  of tension  the acts of aggression under the pretext of defence  the current of instability which goes beyond boundaries and shakes even the most well-established regimes  and therefore threatens international peace and security  abundantly prove that no people can accept the imposition of a will other than its own  and that all peoples are determined to make the greatest sacrifices for their freedom.122.	Of these various hotbeds of tension  southern Africa constitutes the major theatre of operations. There  since the defeat of Portuguese colonialism  the enemy has shown itself more implacable than ever  and its repressive  aggressive and expansionist traits have become more marked.123.	In Namibia  there is no progress to be observed. Had the international community assumed its responsibilities  we could today have had that country seated among us. The settlement arranged under the auspices of the United Nations to put an end to the illegal administration of the Territory by South Africa  and to bring the people of Namibia to independence has become a dead letter because of the backsliding and the delaying tactics of the Pretoria racists.124.	In Zimbabwe  we have seen various moves; the so-called internal settlement  a pretence of biracial government  prefabricated elections and so forth intended to safeguard the illegal powers and privileges of the white minority. Chad would like to reiterate its position here in respect of the problem  namely  that the end of the mandate of the United Kingdom over Zimbabwe can only be accepted when Zimbabwe receives all the attributes of international sovereignty in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of its people.125.	In South Africa  the Pretoria racists are hardening their policy of repression  of deportation of inhabitants to concentration camps falsely called Bantustans  of arming to the teeth  and of committing daily acts of aggression against the front-line States.126.	The continuation of this situation in southern Africa is  beyond doubt  due to the granting of aid to the racist regimes in Salisbury and Pretoria by certain Western Powers  which  in other circumstances  claim to be the zealous defenders of respect for human rights.127.	In the Middle East  the very essence of the conflict  which is Palestine  continues to be flouted. It is regrettable that  at a time when there is a certain will to peace  the policy of annexation of territory is continued  thus exacerbating an already critical situation. Chad believes that there will be no true peace in the region until the Palestinian people recover the full exercise of their inalienable rights  including the right of return to their homeland and the right to independence under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization.128.	What has just happened in my country might lead some to believe that elementary human rights are affected. That is not so  nor will it be. The protection of the dignity of the human being  a guarantee of peace  is of major importance for Chad. That is why we believe that the battle waged by certain peoples must be understood as a demand for the exercise of elementary human rights.129.	Certain Powers continue to make of international detente a private preserve  by constantly having recourse to the old sacrosanct principles of the balance of power  spheres of influence and military alliances. This means  as a corollary  the stockpiling of increasingly sophisticated weapons  particularly nuclear weapons.130.	Chad appreciates the political will of the United States and of the Soviet Union  expressed by their signing of the agreement resulting from the second round of SALT to work against the qualitative and quantitative aggravation of the arms race. But we know that  in a general way  nuclear-weapon States adhere to their own narrow-minded conception of security. This is why it is time for the United Nations to deal with this matter  beginning by the urgent implementation of the programme of action  and particularly of the measures for nuclear disarmament which are provided for there. This would at least have the effect of placing any action and any problem of disarmament under effective international control.131.	The General Assembly of the United Nations is holding its thirty-fourth session at a time when the international community is registering increasing alarm at the state of the international economy  the consequence of which is jeopardizing the growth of the developing countries.132.	For the delegation of the Republic of Chad  failure to carry out the decisions and recommendations adopted by the States Members of our Organization here in this very Assembly hall may well further aggravate the crisis which has shaken the world for several decades already. The problem is to master the events which have brought into question the international community's economic order  and to bring about the necessary changes leading to a new economic order based on equity and effectiveness.133.	Unfortunately at the present stage in the evolution of affairs  none of the solutions adopted by the United Nations seem to have captured the attention of those States which hold the controls of the established system  even though all of them recognize the need for change.134.	Contrary to common sense  the developed countries are becoming increasingly concerned with short-term economic policies  aimed at rebalancing their own economies. One of the nefarious attitudes adopted by certain countries is that of the thrust towards protectionism  despite the lessons of the past. This attitude not only will create difficulties for the weaker economies of the developing countries  but will jeopardize the harmonious development of their own economies. In brief  at the practical level everything seems to be going against the bringing into being of the new international economic order desired by all.135.	My delegation believes that sustained priority should be given to concerted measures for restructuring  which is the only means for bringing about a continuing and lasting economic upsurge. These measures should take account of the interdependence of structural transformations in the developed and developing countries  the increased global demand and the greater productive capacity of the developing countries.136.	In the opinion of my delegation the accommodations accepted by the many conferences of recent years  within the framework of strengthening the commodities sector  should receive particular attention from our developed partners. For it is upon this sector that a major part of the speedy economic development of almost all countries of the third world depends. Indeed  commodities play an important role in the economy of the developing countries and the strengthening of this sector will attain two essential objectivesânamely  immediate substantial advantages for the majority of the populations of the producer countries and an important contribution in foreign exchange which is needed to support industrial projects in those countries.137.	Therefore  it seems to be of paramount importance to accelerate the processes of the implementation of the Integrated Programme for Commodities and the setting up of its key element  the Common Fund  whose role is to improve the structures of markets and international trade in commodities.138.	The question of the indebtedness of the developing countries  and more particularly of the least advanced among them  remains central to the debates of the General Assembly. The measures of relief in this connexion provided for in the relevant resolutions of sessions of UNCTAD should be applied without delay.139.	The least advanced of the developing countries suffer more than others from the effects of international economic disturbances. Despite the special measures taken for their benefit in recent years  their economies continue to be imperilled. No recovery is possible for these countries if the new special measures expected from the developed countries and from international institutions do not provide a large degree of assistance  both financial and technical.140.	The delegation of Chad wishes nevertheless to emphasize here its satisfaction with the results achieved by the second United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. The institutional and financial measures adopted at Vienna at the beginning of September  for the use of science and technology for development  constitute in our opinion progress towards satisfying certain fundamental needs of the developing countries.141.	Besides the earnest co-operation that they expect from the developed countries  the developing countries must mobilize all their efforts for a genuine economic  scientific and technical co-operation. Links of common activities  such as those proclaimed in the declarations and programmes of action of Mexico  Manila and Buenos Aires and in the programme of action of Arusha  and recently by the non-aligned countries at Havana  should not only accelerate the development and transformation of the economies of the developing countries but also enable them to achieve a much sought-after collective self-reliance.142.	In conclusion  I wish to remind the General Assembly that Chad is a poor country. Moreover it is land-locked  and is therefore a victim of drought like all the countries in Sahelian region. Apart from the unfavourable geographic conditions  the country has been torn apart for 13 years by a fratricidal war which has heavily burdened its development in all sectors of social and economic life.143.	The Lagos accord which has just been signed by all the protagonists in Chad constitutes a decisive step towards a global solution to our tragedy.144.	The sons of Chad are convinced of the imperative need for a genuine national reconciliation among them which will enable them together to wage the real battle that is worth wagingâthat for the economic and social progress of Chad through the exploitation of all its many natural resources.145.	To this end the people of Chad  who have suffered so much  physically and spiritually  ardently desire to live in peace  harmony  concord and understanding both within their internationally recognized boundaries and with the neighbouring countries to which they are linked by geography and history.146.	Similarly my country wishes to maintain ties of friendship and co-operation with all countries that love peace  justice and freedom. In so doing it could make its modest contribution  through the United Nations and other international organizations  to the quest for solutions to major world problems  thus participating in the maintenance and strengthening of world peace and security"
"127",6729,"TGO",34,1979,"ï»¿Throughout the world people are wondering whether next year will succeed in being the year of justice for the peoples  since 1979 has been for the third world  and for Africa in particular  a year of disappointments.160.	Embroiled in an accelerating evolution and precipitated into a series of crisesâthe energy crisis  the economic crisis  the moral crisis  the financial crisisâ our world has probably never been so much a prey to self-doubt as it is now concerning its capacity to resolve the problems it faces.161.	The fear distilled in various places by crises both profound and irrational has  as it were  forced human societies into a defensive posture in which they with-draw into themselves. In attempting to draw up the balance sheetâwhether when dealing with UNCTAD or the North-South dialogueâwe are inevitably led to note a record of failure: justice for peoples is still hard to find.162.	Politically speaking  aside from the major catastrophes caused by the need of peoples to recover their liberty by bloodshed and armed conflict  other even more deadly catastrophes are being bred in secret because those who could still do something to change the course of events remain bent on their own narrow and selfish exclusive interests and are  as always  awaiting the advent of the irreparable before they begin timidly to grope towards a solution in the name of who knows what right of what people  whereas they have within their grasp the actual key to solutions for the crucial problems of our time: justice for peoples in order to bring about universal peace.163.	While speaking of justice and universal peace  we wish to pay a respectful tribute to the memory of a man who devoted his whole life to the emancipation and well-being of oppressed peoples. Of course I have in mind Mr. Agostinho Neto  whose sudden death was a cruel loss to Africa and the world.164.	Before I set forth in this Assembly the views of my Government on some of the problems that face the international community  which in varying degrees affect our peoples and dangerously threaten international peace and security  I should like to convey to Mr. Salim the very warm congratulations of the Togolese delegation on his election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. His distinguished personal and intellectual qualities  his well-known and highly appreciated tact  his vast experience and profound Knowledge of international affairs  hand in hand with his acute sense of impartiality  are in keeping with the importance of the tasks that await him and are an earnest of success for our work. I should like to assure him that the feelings of profound and sincere friendship of the Togolese people for the fraternal people of his great and beautiful country  the United Republic of Tanzania  as well as for the illustrious African leader Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  are abiding.165.	I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Indalecio Lievano of Colombia  upon the particularly brilliant way in which he conducted the proceedings of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly.166.	I should be failing in my duty if I were not to pay a particular tribute to our dynamic Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the indefatigable messenger of peace  for his tireless efforts to seek the best possible solutions to international problems that are so complex and at times so difficult. I am not unaware of his difficulties  but I know how much of himself he invests in all conditions and circumstances  and how he does his very best and uses his competence to the utmost in grappling with these problems. We should like him to see in these words testimony of our profound feelings of gratitude and admiration.167.	We should like to congratulate Saint Lucia on its admission to our Organization.168.	Once again  we have met in this temple of dialogue  of consultation and reflection in order to consider together the difficult problems of a troubled and disoriented world that is sliding irresistibly towards major tragediesâunless we all do everything in our power to see to it that this last quarter of a century does not become one of despair but rather a time when justice for men and peoples becomes actual fact.â169.	The events which have disturbed and shaken our universe  our values and our certitudes have woven an ever more inextricable web and have forced all of us to face up to the fact that we have an imperative duty  each nation having to do its best within the limits of its means and responsibilities  to contribute to the building of a new world revolving on an axis of the cardinal concepts of justice for men and justice for peoples.170.	An illustrious thinker once said quite rightly that peace does not come about by chance. It is not just an idea in the mind. It is a creation that requires effort and patience. Nations are the midwives of peace  but peace is not delivered without effort. Peace cannot be the product of a benevolent order given from outside. It must be the end of a journey  of the determination of all to win it and to strengthen it; it is the fruit of justice for peoples.171.	It is to indulge in understatement to say that the international political situation has never been so tense  so uncertain and so threatening. It is thus with sadness and bitterness that we observe that this peace  which we so ardently seek and about which we have spoken so much at each of our sessions  has not yet been brought about.172.	These are the grim realities which embroil our troubled universe  rent as it is by convulsions of all kinds which augur nothing reassuring. In the face of these facts  we have no right to refrain from expressing an opinion on the situations of conflict  the most crying injustices or the gravest infringements of the rights of peoples and of States  because this state of permanent tension  of social injustice and profound economic imbalance comprises the factors that threaten international peace and security.173.	On the African continent  the South African and Rhodesian colonialist and racist regimes  on the strength of the material  financial and military support of certain States  which are  incidentally  members of our Organization  are trampling underfoot with impunity  in a permanent attitude of defiance  the fundamental rights of millions of Africans. The active complicity of certain States still makes it possible for these political systems that are an outrage of the man of today to prosper in the shadow of a repressive and particularly ruthless apparatus 174.	The situation prevailing in Namibia is one of the tangible manifestations of this. The Namibian people have constantly been subjected to acts of inhumanity of all kindsâarbitrary arrests  torture  murder  deprivation of elementary rights  intimidation and so forth. What is worse  the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa is continuing with the complicity and connivance so familiar to all of us  despite the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly of our Organization and of the Security Council. By its obstinate desire to destroy by every possible means the national unity and territorial integrity of Namibia  the racist and retrograde regime of Pretoria is giving us additional evidence of a further escalation in its defiance of the international community by unilaterally organizing elections in this Territory in flagrant contradiction of Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978).175.	It is our impression that the retrograde regime of apartheid and racism wants  in defiance of the will of all mankind  to stifle the voice of justice which rang out from the hearts of Soweto and Sharpeville and which was echoed by all southern Africa. Where is justice for the Namibian and South African peoples?176.	This situation  which is  to say the least  inadmissible  flouts the moral authority of our Organization and constitutes a constant source of concern for all States that prize peace  justice and freedom.177.	Today  the forces of oppression are still able to contain the anger of the young people within certain limits  which are illusory because they are transient  by trampling underfoot elementary rights and human dignity  but they will not be able to go on doing this indefinitely. If they continue in their obstinacy  tomorrow the youth of Africa  over-exploited as it is  will choose the path of desperation and mobilize itself on the model of the international brigades of 1936 to demand in an historic trial of strength that the right of the peoples of Namibia  of Zimbabwe and of the blacks of South Africa to dignity  liberty and independence be finally recognized.178.	If it is this that is sought by those who are so stubborn in sustaining apartheid  those who obstinately refuse independence to Namibia and Zimbabwe  those who obstinately reject elementary justice for all  it is to be feared that our Organization will tomorrow find itself on the horns of a formidable dilemma. It is high time to practise equity and justice for peoples in order to avoid the inevitable social explosions with their incalculable consequences.179.	South Africa will  sooner or later  have to face the fact that the inalienable rights of the Namibian people to self-determination and independence can be effectively established only by means of free elections held under the auspices and control of the United Nations. Similarly  the transfer of powers can take place only within the framework of the relevant resolutions of our Organization and in respect for the integrity of that Territory  which includes Walvis Bay.180.	It was  therefore just that the international com-munity rejected the so-called elections of December 1978 organized by South Africa with a view to perpetuating its abominable policy of apartheid  racism and bantustanization. In order to thwart the annexationist designs of the racist regime of Pretoria  our Organization should hesitate no longer in taking against Pretoria the energetic measures prescribed in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. All the required conditions already exist. We no longer have the right to remain indifferent to this painful and tragic problem  which is liable  by reason of its insupportable and explosive nature  to plunge us all inevitably into open warfare  with all the attendant suffering. It goes without saying that the destiny of Namibia will be decided on only by its true and authentic representativesâin other words  by SWAPO  and not by the henchmen of apartheid.181.	Never  I am sure  has it been more urgent for the international community to demonstrate its solidarity with the liberation movements in southern Africa  to render increased and more sustained material  military and financial assistance to SWAPO and at the same time to step up its pressure in order to facilitate the peaceful settlement of this problem by the speedy realization of the inalienable rights of the Namibian people to self-determination and true national independence in a Namibia that includes Walvis Bay  in conformity with General Assembly resolution 33/206.182.	With regard to Zimbabwe  does the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference now under way in London  which is following up the commitments recently made by the United Kingdom  the administering Power  open up any fresh prospects?183.	At all events  the administering Power  the United Kingdom  and all participants must realize that no solution apart from the actual effective and complete transfer of power to the black majority under international control is liable to settle the problem of Zimbabwe  and this transfer will always remain a fiction if a solution is sought without the participation of the Patriotic Front.184.	In the meantime  it is our duty to condemn all the numerous attempts on the part of certain Powers and of transnational corporations aimed  on the one hand  at violating or neutralizing the sanctions against Rhodesia and  on the other hand  at according a semblance of legitimacy to a regime that would exclude the Patriotic Front.185.	It is therefore important that all States Members of our Organization work together to create the necessary conditions for the accession  in security and dignity  of Zimbabwe to independence. In this way  we will be giving proof of our will for peace  justice and freedom to be established finally in this country.186.	In this regard  the 19-member Committee on Assistance to Front-line States set up by the OAU at its most recent meeting in Monrovia will study specific solutions to the numerous problems facing the peoples of the region and will have as its primary objective the consolidation of the economies by initiating a process of breaking the isolation of the front-line countries with a view to increasing and strengthening their collective autonomy.187.	Along with this series of initiatives  which will quickly be set in motion  it is the duty of us all to help to train young people from these countries in distress. Each of our countries should in the future consider offering facilities for the training of these young people. My country  whose actions for peace require no further proof  considers as an honour and a privilege the trust vested in us once again by the OAU by confirming us in the chairmanship of this committee. We will therefore do everything in our power to make our modest contribution to this historic action on which the whole of Africa has embarked with courage and determination.188.	With regard to the Western Sahara  the agreement recently signed between Mauritania and the Frente POLISARIO constitutes a new basis for a peaceful settlement of this distressing problem. The Togolese delegation  while congratulating Mauritania and the Frente POLISARIO for their efforts  expresses the hope that this agreement  which ushers in a new era of peace in international relations  will be followed by others.189.	In this regard  we wish to make a pressing appeal to Morocco to join this movement for peace. My country feels that self-determination through universal suffrage is the only path to peace in the region. Decolonization by means of a so-called referendumâwhich has never actually been organizedâis  to say the least  surprising  disturbing and unacceptable. Also  since the problem of Western Sahara is a clear-cut problem of decolonization  the situation calls for a global approachâespecially in view of the fact that decolonization by a tacit referendum is unprecedented and inconceivable; nor is it in keeping with the rules of international law  with the right of peoples to self- determination or with the requirements of justice for peoples.190.	My delegation remains  therefore  convinced that the States of the region will succeed in finding a satisfactory solution to the problem of Western Sahara which will take into account the aspirations and the legitimate interests of the Saharan people.191.	In the Middle East we can detect a faint glimmer of hope. But there remains along way to go before a just and lasting peace is achieved. As the old Chinese proverb says  ""Even the longest journey begins with the first stepâand I would add that the essential thing is that the first steps should be in the right direction. That is why any search for a lasting solution must of necessity be free of tangential preoccupations and must be resolutely oriented towards peace; that is why it is necessary to face all the facts or we risk falling prey to the greatest of illusions. The Middle East problem must be rightly identified.192.	To say that settlement of the present problem of peace in the Middle East must take account of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people is merely to acknowledge the simple truth. It is a matter of justice  of justice for the Palestinian people 193.	We wish to reaffirm to these people our unreserved support in the valiant struggle which they are waging under the aegis of the Palestine Liberation Organization  their sole and authentic representative  for the exercise of their inalienable and imprescriptible rights to self-determination  to a homeland and to national sovereignty.194.	We remain convinced that in the Middle East there can be no valid or lasting solution if it does not settle the central question of the plight of the Palestinian people. A just and lasting solution can only be found with the participation of all the parties concerned and can only be based on a general consensus inspired by justice  a consensus which would make it possible for all the peoples of the area to have their place in the sun and to live as good neighbours in a climate of mutual respect  concord and solidarity.195.	The Zionist policy of allowing the wanton establishment of settlements on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip is hardly a positive sign on Israel's part with regard to the Palestinian question. For our part  we continue to believe that sooner or later Israel will shed its outmoded ways of thinking and face the fact that peace in the Middle East necessarily entails the implementation of the relevant resolutions of our Organization  particularly those relating to the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  for  fundamentally  a solution must be found which will ensure justice for all the peoples of the region. It is only this justice which can serve as the solid basis for a lasting peace.196.	The Government and the people of Togo cannot bring themselves to concede that these essential elementsâthe right to self-determination and a home-land for one group and the right to existence and tranquillity for the otherâshould be sacrificed on the altar of arrangements which are liable to complicate the situation even further.197.	Much has been said and without doubt much will be said in the course of this session about the Camp David agreements. 198.	With regard to my own country  Togo is neither a zealot nor an unconditional supporter of agreements to which it is not a party  but neither is it willing to be a fanatical opponent of them.199.	The fact is that the Togolese Government is firmly devoted to the settlement of conflicts by peaceful means and is moved by any initiative leading to that end. That is why Togo has stated its position by expressing satisfaction at the peaceful orientation of the approach to the Middle East problem  while indicating that these agreements would be a good thing if considered as only a beginning: a point of departure for a solution to the fundamental problem constituted by the essential elements which I have just outlined.200.	Who would dare to deny that these agreements have gaps and pitfalls in them? Aware as we are of the reflexes which inspired certain of the clauses  it does not seem to us positive consistently to condemn those who are making attempts at finding peace. The weight of our Organization should serve to create the conditions of trust needed to fill the gaps and avoid the pitfalls.201.	For our part it is not possible for us to concede the argument that Egypt has embarked on a process of peace with the clearly defined intention of betraying the Arab cause  a cause which it has defended for more than 30 years in conditions familiar to us all  and of cynically sacrificing the Palestinian people.202.	This  too  is a question of justice to the authorities and people of Egypt. Surely it is premature to charge them with deliberate betrayal.203.	We further refuse to believe that the hostility expressed towards the Camp David agreements is the result of a plot hatched against peace by those who would view with favour  and would in some way profit from  a war. Nor are we convinced that attempts to bring about a settlement of the Middle East problem can stem from a vicious and cynical intention to involve any one of the peoples of the region in a conspiracy against any other.204.	We understand and profoundly respect the sensibilities and reactions of all the parties and  rather than giving ourselves over to the unfair exercise of putting people on trial for their intentions  we invite all peoples of the area to a new communion so that together  in a spirit of tolerance and solidarity  they may once again find the conditions for a lasting and fraternal peace.205.	This peace which we all so ardently desire will only be effective if it extends also to all parts of the world in which there are unfortunately still hotbeds of tension which could tomorrow become real powder- kegs.206.	In this regard  the Togolese delegation regrets that concrete initiatives have not been taken with a view to creating the objective conditions needed for the peaceful reunification of Korea in accordance with the South-North joint communique' of 4 July 1972  that is: the withdrawal of all foreign military forces stationed in South Korea and the transformation of the Armistice Agreement into a peace agreement.207.	The Togolese delegation hopes that the true aspirations of the Korean people will prevail without foreign interference because throughout the world justice for peoples can only be brought about and guaranteed in so far as negative external influences are removed.208.	With regard to the Comorian island of Mayotte  note should be taken of the wish expressed by the Comorian and French authorities to abide by the recommendations of the OAU and the United Nations  which call upon them to discuss the problem of that island and thus to find a solution in keeping with the requirements of justice and the principle of the territorial integrity of colonial entities at the time of decolonization.209.	The excessive accumulation of nuclear weapons and the strengthening of military bases  particularly in the areas of the Indian Ocean  the Persian Gulf  Southeast Asia and in other parts of the world continues quite rightly to arouse tremendous concern and to constitute a dangerous threat to international peace and security.210.	As in the past  the Togolese delegation will continue to support and endorse all positive initiatives with a view to making of those regions true zones of peace  free from the presence of all foreign military forces.211.	We must  however  recognize that peace can only be effective if it leads to complete and general disarmament. That is why the convening in 1982 of a special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations devoted to disarmament is in that regard most timely. We wish to express the hope that concrete measures will be adopted to that end. The Togolese delegation wishes to take this opportunity to express once again to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union its satisfaction at the most praiseworthy efforts which they have undertaken in the SALT negotiations and it calls upon them to conduct those negotiations  under the authority of the United Nations  until complete disarmament has been achieved.212.	A distinguished African head of state  known for his wisdom and his lucid appraisal of the events which disturb our world  declared quite rightly with regard to military expenditures:""Is it possible for us to contemplate without bitter-ness the unequal weight respectively accorded in the world to expenditures for life and death? Surely it is a matter of infinite sadness that the most costly and most often followed course is not that of international mutual assistance  but rather that of military armaments and budgets which each year swallow up more than $US 200 billion.""To waste money in order to acquire deadly weapons which are used to hold in check and maintain in destitution the poor people who are being exploitedâsuch is the tragic formula of deterrence adopted in our time to perpetuate injustice. This is at once revolting and shocking  especially when we realize that more than 2 billion human beings live in conditions of total deprivation; and that  furthermore  more than a billion suffer from hunger and malnutrition. These figures express the grim reality of every day that the Lord gives. When will justice shower its blessings on human beings in distress? It is high time  because anger is at its apogee and there are rumblings of revolt.213.	Today less than ever can the developed  industrialized countries which persist in wasting the wealth of the planet continue to shroud themselves in a veil of modesty  the better-to hide from themselves the deprivation of the rest of the world  because it is certain that deterrence will result rather from a democratic sharing of abundance than from the bogey man of the bomb.214.	The risks of revolution by those who are hungry and exploited will be eliminated rather by the practice of justice for all and solidarity than by the diversions of scientific exploits in outer space. Peace in the world will result from the establishment of justice for the people and this justice itself resides in the equitable distribution of abundance rather than in the unbridled arms race and subversion throughout the world.215.	The economic problems with which we are con-fronted contain within themselves elements of genuine confrontation  and thus permanent danger. Hence they are liable at any moment to lead to breaches of the peace  if we do not in common devise means of overcoming those problems  which are born of profound imbalances in the unfair and iniquitous structures of economic international relations.216.	That is why we should like to be able to interpret General Assembly resolution 32/174  which convenes for 1980 a special session to evaluate progress towards the establishment of a new international economic order  as the sign of that determination to accelerate the advent of a new kind of economic relations which would finally lay the groundwork for justice for the peoples.217.	In the face of the repeated failures of development strategies  the failure to adapt objectives of growth to the actual concerns of developing countries  and the lack of political will and generosity on the part of industrialized countries  it is more than ever urgent and indispensable to reformulate the fundamental conditions which should be met by the whole complex of relations between the third-world countries and a renovated international system.218.	Since 1973 the energy crisis  by aggravating the international economic situation in other respects  has given a new dimension to the problems of inflation  to the imbalance of payments and to the evolution of the cost of living. The deficit in the balance of payments of the developing countries jumped abruptly from $US 12 billion in 1973 to more than $30 billion in 1977 and it is expected that it will be in the neighbourhood of $35 billion in 1979. For the end of 1977  the external debt accumulated by the developing countries which do not export oil was estimated at about $US 300 billion. Behind these figures lurks the spectre of poverty  starvation  malnutrition  of endemic disease and illiteracy from which the majority of the people of Asia  Latin America and Africa suffer. Behind these figures  where does one find justice for the people?219.	Social injustice in the affluent countries has created a category of misfits  incapable of integrating themselves within the global society  a category of alienated people without ideals  who believe that they have to drown their troubles in alcohol  in drugs and in vice. Thus in the so-called developed countries we find those who have become the exporters of a product of a completely different kind: mercenaries. This scourge mobilizes men of no scruples whatsoever  hired killers  and sends them to developing countriesâthe very countries which have the least need of this kind of product and which rightly do not ask for these mercenaries. In this field  too  the affluent countries impose by force merchandise unfit for consumption while the developing countries seek nothing other than justice and peace for their people.220.	In the final analysis  it is the whole complex of international economic relations which is in crisis  just as is energy. The failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD has served only to aggravate further the already worrying situation  and has obstructed the process which should lead to the establishment of a new international economic order. In the face of this tragic situation which is liable  unfortunately  to last for a long time to come  the international community should define as quickly as possible a global approach likely to give a concrete and achievable content to international economic co-operation  assuring prosperity for all  and according particular attention to the specific needs of the most seriously affected developing countries: the least advanced  the land-locked and island countries  as well as those affected by natural catastrophes. The industrialized world must demonstrate more willingness to listen  more understanding  a greater spirit of solidarity. It is a matter of reason; it is a question of justice  justice for all people. Peace and tranquillity depend on this  and therefore the salvation of us all.221.	A ray of hope was born with the recent conclusion of the negotiations concerning a new Lome convention. In many respects  the new convention certainly proved to be less innovative  reflecting in its provisions a kind of contained fear in the face of the uncertainties of the future. In spite of this weakness  the second Lome convention does clearly and unequivocally express the will of the 57 African  Caribbean and Pacific States and the 9 States members of the European Economic Community to contribute to bringing about a new order of more balanced and closer relations between the industrialized and third-world countries. Our country which  in 1975  was the host for the signing ceremonies is honoured that it has once again been chosen to play host to this historic event. Togo  land of peace  working as it does with determination and consistency to bring about a world of greater justice and solidarity  is not indifferent to this mark of confidence.222.	As we see  tremendous tasks await our Organization. For them to be carried out fully the increased support of all its Members  large or small  rich or poor  weak or powerful  will be needed. It behoves each and every one of us to make a contribution  however modest  to the performance of these noble tasks. There can be no doubt that this is a long-term enterprise. The road is strewn with traps  with conflict  with contradictions  which must be overcome. However  our constant readiness to envisage change which will recognize and guarantee the right of peoples to live in freedom  decency and dignity should encourage us to transcend our differences in the name of the necessary complementarity and interdependence of us all  in a world which is shrinking more each day.223.	How true it is  in the words of the President- founder of the Rassemblement du peuple togolais  His Excellency General Gnassingbe Eyade  President of the Togolese Republic:""It is up to us to allow hope to spring anew in the breast of man by our determination to remain what we are  to find our own road and to follow the paths which we must trace ourselvesââ224.	May all States Members of our Organization  acting in a spirit of firm solidarity  join forces to combat the growing threats to our collective well-being  and unite in order to establish the framework of a world order where all destinies will draw upon the physical and intellectual energies available to build in common a world more in keeping with the profound aspirations for peace  justice for men and justice for peoples."
"128",6775,"THA",34,1979,"ï»¿I wish at the outset  on behalf of my Government and my delegation  to extend to Ambassador Salim  a great son of Africa  my warm congratulations on his election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Owing to his long experience in the many facets of United Nations affairs  I am confident that our deliberations during the current session will produce fruitful results under his wise guidance. The delegation of Thailand pledges its full co-operation and support in making this session of the General Assembly a successful one.167.	I should also like to express my sincere appreciation to the outgoing President  Ambassador Lievano of Columbia  for his contribution to the success of the last session.168.	We should also like to thank the Secretary- General for his dedicated efforts towards the maintenance of peace and the promotion of international understanding and co-operation.169.	The African continent remains in the forefront of the struggle for just and equal treatment of all peoples  regardless of race or colour. My delegation maintains its steadfast support of this historic struggle and is firmly opposed to the racist policies and practices being employed against the black majority in southern Africa  particularly the abominable crime of apartheid. We are following the London meeting on Zimbabwe with close attention  and are more than ever convinced that the right of self-determination of peoples  in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and with relevant resolutions  must ultimately prevail. Thailand's position in this regard applies to other areas of the world as well.170.	In the Middle East  my delegation fully recognizes the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people that have repeatedly been upheld by the United Nations. Israel must relinquish its illegal occupation of Arab territory forthwith and  in the meantime  it must respect the rights of the Arab people in the occupied territories. Thailand thus joins the overwhelming majority of world public opinion in deploring the establishment of Israeli settlements  as well as all efforts to transfer ownership of Arab lands in such territories. At the same time  my delegation is convinced that all States in the area have the right to exist in security and with freedom from external aggression or armed intervention.171.	In South-East Asia  as a result of .Vietnamese armed intervention; the Government of Democratic Kampuchea was toppled and replaced by the so-called United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea. The members of the Association of South East Asian Nations [ASEAN]  concerned by this turn of events  and in particular by its security implications and its possible impact on the delicate political equilibrium in the region  quickly convened a meeting of their Foreign Ministers at Bangkok. In the Joint Statement issued at Bangkok on 12 January 1979  the ASEAN Foreign Ministers strongly deplored the armed intervention against the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kampuchea and called for the immediate and total withdrawal of foreign forces from Kampuchean territory. Further  they reaffirmed the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own future  free from interference or influence by outside Powers. These points were later incorporated into the draft resolution presented to the Security Council several days later by all of its non-aligned members.  Unhappily  despite the support of 13 of the 15 members of the Council  this draft resolution was not adopted because of the negative vote cast by a permanent member.172.	The prospects for peace and stability in Southeast Asia were further dimmed when  on 17 February 1979  Chinese troops made an armed incursion into Vietnamese territory. The ASEAN countries were gravely concerned that the fighting would escalate into a larger conflagration involving other Powers from outside the region. They therefore sought yet again to end the fighting by making their appeals to the parties concerned in the United Nations. Their efforts were finally expressed in the form of a draft resolution submitted for consideration by the Security Council on 16 March of this year.  The operative paragraphs of that draft resolution called on the parties to the conflicts to cease all hostilities forthwith  to withdraw their forces to their own countries and to settle their disputes by peaceful means. The draft also appealed to Powers outside the region to exercise the utmost restraint and to refrain from any acts that might lead to a further escalation of the conflicts in Indo-China. When it was put to the vote it again received the support of 13 member countries  but failed to be adopted owing to the negative vote of the same permanent member. The fact that the ASEAN countries chose to deplore both the Chinese incursion into Viet Nam and the Vietnamese intervention in Kampuchea fully and clearly demonstrated their earnest desire to remain neutral in the conflicts  from which position they hoped to be able to exert a stabilizing influence on the developments in the region.173.	As a result of the inability of the Security Council to take any action on the Kampuchean issue  the fighting in Kampuchea raged on and  indeed  expanded westward. Many divisions of Vietnamese forces deployed along the Thai-Kampuchean border have created tension and the situation there is fraught with grave danger  Any renewed fightingâand the fighting is most likely to escalate with the end of the rainy seasonâcould have serious repercussions on regional and international peace and security.174.	It has nevertheless been and will continue to be my Government's unswerving policy to remain neutral and not involved in the conflict between the two socialist States  with both of which Thailand maintains diplomatic relations. However  we are also determined to protect our independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. In this regard  Thailand is most gratified that our ASEAN partners  as well as many other friendly countries  have shown their willingness to support us. This was evident in the communiquÃ© and statements of the Twelfth ASEAN Ministers Meeting held on 29 June 1979 in Bali  Indonesia.175.	The decision taken by a vast majority of the membership of this Assembly on 21 September to maintain the status quo on the question of the Kampuchean seat very clearly reflected the following facts.176.	First  the majority felt that to alter the status quo at this point and in the present circumstances would imply a sanctioning of international behaviour not in conformity with the provisions of the United Nations Charter 177.	Secondly  although a country may disagree with the internal conduct of another sovereign State  that by no means gives it a justification for resorting to armed intervention against that Stateâan act which is in flagrant violation of the principles of independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.178.	Thirdly  the right of self-determination must be upheld and all States  whether large or small  should be able to continue to look to the United Nations as an Organization based on internationally recognized legal and moral principles.179.	For Thailand's part  our firm position on this question of the Kampuchean seat was motivated neither by any outside power nor by animosity towards any country. However  we strongly believe that principles governing peaceful relations among States and the self-determination of nations must be strictly adhered to. This is vital  not only for Thailand but also for the future of the South-East Asian region and the world as a whole.â180.	Our overriding desire is for the people of Kampuchea to be given the opportunity to determine their own future in the exercise of their inalienable right to choose their own government  free from outside interference or coercion. Furthermore  we in Thailand have a sincere desire to continue to develop good bilateral relations with all three Indo-Chinese States  including Viet Nam  and to co-operate with all in the interests of peace and stability in the region of South-East Asia.181.	One of the unfortunate results of the conflict in Kampuchea is the prevailing large-scale famine and starvation in that war-torn country. That is a serious humanitarian issue which requires urgent attention by and immediate assistance from the world community. If nothing is done to alleviate the situation  it will produce a new exodus of Kampuchean people into neighbouring countries  thus creating further tension as well as threatening regional peace and stability.182.	In this regard  the Thai Government welcomes the efforts being made by international organizations and interested donor countries to send food relief to Kampuchea and will continue to render its full co-operation in those relief efforts. It is only logical to expect that the food should reach the Kampuchean civilian population  for whom it is intended  directly on a non-discriminatory basis  and that such relief aid should not serve to prolong the fighting and bloodshed in Kampuchea.183.	The effort at this Assembly of Thailand and other countries members of ASEAN with regard to the Kampuchean situation is to call for continued world efforts to arrive at a political and not a military solution to this problem. Continuation of a military solution will only add to the untold misery and deprivation already suffered by the Kampuchean people and it could lead to grave consequences for the region and for the world as a whole. We therefore continue to support any peaceful political solution to the conflict that is acceptable to the Kampuchean people themselves and that will ensure the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that war-ravaged country. In pursuit of these aims  we believe that this world Organization would be in a unique position to make a lasting contribution if it were entrusted with a peace-keeping role in the area of conflict. Furthermore  under the auspices of the United Nations or of its Secretary-General  an appropriate opportunity could be found and facilities provided for the parties concerned to engage in a dialogue with a view to finding a durable peaceful solution to the conflict. In any event  the demands of the situation require that all peace-loving nations here in this Assembly should work together for the cause of peace in South-East Asia  as well as for the right to self-determination for Kampucheans and all peoples in the region. A positive solution to the Kampuchean problem will no doubt contribute significantly to the efforts of South-East Asian countries in the realization of the concept of the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in the region.184.	The establishment of a zone of peace in South-East Asia remains one of the goals to which the ASEAN countries are committed. We continue to look forward to the day when that region will be free from major Power rivalry and interference  and all the nations in the area can live in peaceful coexistence with one another. Although it is the main responsibility of the South-Eastern Asian countries themselves to create the necessary conditions for the establishment of such a zone  it will nevertheless require the active cooperation and support of the international community  particularly the major Powers.185.	Let me now turn to one of the grave problems facing mankind today  a problem closely linked to the conflicts in Indo-China  that is  the Indo-Chinese refugees.186.	Since the end of the tragic Viet Nam war in 1975  hundreds of thousands of displaced persons have left Laos  Kampuchea and Vietnam for new opportunities elsewhere. Recently the plight of the boat people from Viet Nam has attracted much publicity and captured the world's attention. However  from 1975 on displaced persons from Laos and Kampuchea have trekked over- and into Thailand and the influx continues unabated. Today there are approximately 200 000 such ""land cases'' in Thailand who are being given temporary shelter  food  clothing and medical care in additional to another 7 000 boat cases from Viet Nam and Kampuchea. My country  purely for humanitarian reasons  has agreed to give temporary refuge to them  pending permanent resettlement in third countries. But this large and continuing influx has created a multitude of security  political and socio-economic problems for Thailand and has imposed on the Thai Government and people a heavy financial and administrative burden  which is only partially alleviated by assistance from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  as well as from other international sources. Many of these displaced persons have been in Thailand for over three years  and so far only one in every 10 displaced Laotians and Kampucheans has been repatriated for resettlement elsewhere. We in Thailand became convinced that the heavy burden involving the Indo-Chinese refugees  both the land and the boat cases  must be shouldered by the whole international community  and not just left to the transit countries in South-East Asia alone. This conviction of ours was further reinforced when over 80 000 Kampucheans came over into Thailand by land in the aftermath of Vietnamese armed intervention against Kampuchea  thus imposing an extraordinary burden on Thailand and creating grave dangers to its security and stability.187.	When the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom  Mrs. Margaret Thatcher  proposed that an international conference be convened under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to consider the problem of refugees and displaced persons in South-East Asia  my Government strongly supported it. The Thai delegation subsequently took an active part in the Meeting on Refugees and Displaced Persons convened by the Secretary-General in Geneva on 20 to 21 July of this year. The international community at long last showed a greater willingness to share the heavy humanitarian burden with countries of first transit in concrete and meaningful ways. The resettlement places offered by third countries increased to 260 000 and $US 190 million in cash and kind were pledged. The Government of Japan generously offered to cover half of the budget for the High Commissioner's operations in South-East Asia. My delegation would like to express once again our deep appreciation to the Secretary- General for his personal efforts in convening the Geneva Meeting to deal with the humanitarian aspects of the problem. While the results were encouraging  we believe they fell short of providing an over-all and lasting solution to the problem  because the question of the ""land cases""  which constitute the bulk of Indo- Chinese displaced persons  was not sufficiently dealt with.188.	I wish to reiterate here the principles which the Thai delegation submitted at the Geneva meeting. These principles must be strictly adhered to if we are to have an equitable and successful humanitarian solution to the problem of Indo-Chinese refugees and displaced persons. They are: first  in any effort to solve the problem  equality must be given to both land and boat cases; secondly  more processing centres must be established  particularly in Viet Nam and other countries of origin  with international assistance and under the High Commissioner's auspices  for both land and boat cases; thirdly  those who have been the longest in temporary camps or processing centres must be given prior opportunities for resettlement in third countries.189.	At Geneva  regrettably  it was deemed politically advantageous not to examine the root-cause of the departure of so many refugees and displaced persons from the three Indo-Chinese States. It was pointed out that this was better left to another appropriate meeting at a later stage. Subsequently  however  political considerations seemed to paralyse further initiatives  and the idea of a follow-up meeting dissipated. In this connexion  the Thai Government is of the opinion that no durable solution of the land cases emanating from Kampuchea and Laos is possible unless and until we tackle the problem at its root. During the Geneva Meeting  Viet Nam undertook ""for a reasonable period of time"" to stem the illegal outflow of ""boat people"". Thailand and its partners in ASEAN welcomed this commitment on the part of Viet Nam. In this respect  it is the fervent hope of the Thai Government that a similar agreement reached recently between Thailand and Laos will help stem the illegal flow of people from Laos into Thailand. In Kampuchea  the root-cause of the problem is the foreign armed intervention and the continued fighting there. Another factor is the widespread famine in that war-ravaged country. Unless fighting stops and a peaceful condition returns  with due recognition of the political and other rights of the Kampuchean people  there will be no lasting solution to the refugee problem.190.	As for the future  my Government would support the convening of an appropriate international forum to deal comprehensively with the land cases in South-East Asia in order to find effective solutions to this serious problem confronting all of us in the international community.191.	Another grave problem confronting the international community  especially the youth of today  is that of narcotics. Thailand has been engaged in major efforts with the United Nations and like-minded nations to eradicate the illegal production of narcotics and to disrupt drug trafficking via Thailand. The many significant seizures of opium and heroin in Thailand during the past year  as well as the arrest of major drug traffickers  testify to the strong determination of my Government to expurgate this evil. Meanwhile  the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control has  for the past five years  been performing commendable services through its programme to encourage hill-tribe farmers in my country to change from poppy cultivation to other crops. It has  furthermore  been helping to develop crop substitutes  such as coffee  vegetables and fruits  which would bring these hill-tribe fanners equivalent or even higher incomes. At present  the Thai authorities are working with members of the Fund to extend these successful projects to a wider area.192.	I turn now to economic problems. During the past 12 months the world has been faced with increasingly grave economic difficulties. Inflation and unemployment have reached a new high in many countries. Protectionism has unfortunately increased  foreign trade has slowed down and the rate of economic growth has been slow and erratic. The developing countries have found it more and more difficult to finance reasonable rates of development. This universal problem has been further exacerbated by recent substantial increases in the prices of energy-related products. There have been some improvements here and there  such as the recent trade negotiations undertaken by parties to GATT and the agreement on the fundamental elements of a common fund for commodities  the employment of quotas and the increase in special drawing rights in September 1978. But  on the whole  those ongoing multilateral negotiations have failed to achieve adequate results commensurate with the existing magnitude of the need.193.	A new impetus in the North-South negotiations is needed. This could be achieved only through the exhibition by all parties concerned of a real political will to reach practical solutions. The international community needs to move vigorously in two areas specifically. First  negotiations on the implementation of the New International Economic Order need to be stimulated and brought out of the present stalemate. Secondly  the world energy problem needs to be solved by a coordinated and imaginative effort on the part of the whole international community. Thailand supports the view of the Group of 77 that the international energy problem should be discussed in the context of global negotiations within the United Nations  with the participation of all countries and in relation to such other issues as the problems of development  financial and monetary reforms and international trade and commodities  all of which have an important bearing on the establishment of the New International Economic Order. My delegation believes that the United Nations  which is well equipped with machinery for intergovernmental discussions and negotiations  is the ideal forum where all these efforts could best be carried out.194.	I should also like to take this opportunity to offer my delegation's warm welcome to Saint Lucia  the newest and one hundred fifty-second Member of our world Organization  admitted at the beginning of this session.195.	Lastly  I turn to the role of the United Nations itself. To the oft-heard question whether this world Organization is in a position today to contribute effectively to the solution of the problems confronting the international community  in my delegation's opinion the answer is an unreserved ""yes"". One of the principal roles of this Organization  through its various organs  is to help form world opinion on some of the most pressing issues  to create an awareness of the problems confronting individual countries or the world community as a whole and then to find constructive and durable solutions for them. It is with such faith in the continuing usefulness of the United Nations that my country attaches great importance to it and pledges its full support for the further success of this world Organization."
"129",6892,"TTO",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago  and on my own behalf  I take great pleasure in extending to you  Sir  our sincere congratulations on your election as President of this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. My delegation pledges its fullest cooperation to you in the firm conviction that  through your efficient and distinguished guidance  our deliberations will have the very best chances for success.156.	It gives me great pleasure also to express our appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Lievano for the skilful and able manner in which he discharged the arduous responsibilities which fell to him as President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly  and to our Secretary-General and his staff I wish to convey  through you  our thanks for their untiring efforts to enhance the quality of life for us all.157.	My delegation joins with those who have preceded me to this rostrum in extending a warm and sincere welcome to our sister Caribbean nation  Saint Lucia  as the one hundred and fifty-second Member of the United Nations family. In so doing  I should like to express the hope that this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  the last of this decade  will usher in a new era of co-operation among nations  and that the people of Saint Lucia and of new Member States will in future be spared the frustrating experiences of many of our peoples who have looked to the United Nations with high aspirations  but who  in the words of the Secretary-General  have been shackled ""to an [international] economic system which no longer meets the requirements of an interdependent world of free nations""158.	Since last we met  the attentions of the world have been increasingly focused on events in the Caribbean. One of the active volcanoes in the region  La Soufriere in Guadeloupe  resumed activity with devastating effect; and in recent months  two tropical hurricanes of unprecedented ferocity  David and Frederic  swept through the region  leaving in their wake a trail of death and destruction. This accumulation of disasters causes me to recall proposals made by the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago some 10 years ago that there should be instituted at the regional level a system of special insurance protection which would facilitate an early return to normalcy after such inevitable disasters. There was no positive response to those proposals at the regional level. However  in the light of the recent disasters the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has taken the initiative of establishing a fund to assist the less developed countries in the Caribbean region to finance the reconstruction which must of necessity take place after natural disasters. This disaster relief fund  with a target of $50 million  has been established with an immediate allocation of $ 10 million.159.	We are poised today on the brink of the 1980s. What hopes can we take with us across this threshold? Before the reports of this General Assembly are circulated  we will have entered the new decade  unhappily still carrying with us all or nearly all of the short-comings of the 1970s. The very worst of these wrongs is the lack of urgency or concern on the part of some for the plight of countries in the third world. It is the plight of developing countries struggling to negotiate new rules for the conduct of international economic relations. The rules we seek will provide a climate conducive to fairer and more equitable intercourse so that  through our own efforts  we can ensure a better quality of life for our people.160.	The experiences of the 1970s lead me to question seriously the integrity of those who continue to pay lip service to the desirability of a strong world economy founded on the logic of interdependence between rich and poor  but who at the same time cling tenaciously to every facet of privilege they command through the existing world economic order. The effect of this posture is to stifle any advantage  real or imagined  that might accrue to developing countries. It is clear  as we enter the 1980s  that many Governments are not prepared even now to make the political commitment required to translate the ideals of the 1970s into realities. Economic growth in developing countries still seems to be regarded as a threat. Economic co-operation therefore must be selective  the argument continues  reserved only for those areas that would complement further growth in developed countries  and even then meted out in small  ineffectual doses.161.	Where we as developing countries have been able through our own efforts to wrest a comparative advantage in a few industries  some of our major trading partnersâwho alone are capable of undertaking structural adjustment measuresâhave responded harshly with new  protectionist measures.162.	I should like to identify for the record specific areas where the efforts of the 1970s have fallen far short of the desired goals and where it is my hope the international community will concentrate all efforts in the 1980s to ensure that the real issues are confronted with the determination necessary to surmount them.163.	What are these real issues? The first is trade. Looked at from the point of view of trade as an engine of growth in developing countries  the decade of the 1970s as not given much cause for celebration. Manufactures still account for only a small percentage of the export trade from developing countries  while primary commodities  excluding petroleum  account for the bulk of merchandise exports from the third world.164.	This situation is part of an interesting  albeit very frustrating  mosaic. The role as purveyors of raw materials that has been traditionally reserved for the developing countries has been encouraged through the creation of institutional machinery and the provision of financial assistance to ensure adequate supplies  and even surpluses. Falling prices have characterized the trade in primary commodities during the middle and late 1970s  with the result that developing countries have tended to steer away from new investment in primary commodities  or they do soâat great costâ with the certain knowledge that such action would serve only to exacerbate an already grievous economic situation  both domestically and internationally.165.	In many instances  the choices open to developing countries have been rigidly circumscribed. Opportunities for alleviating unemployment and ensuring economic growth through industrialization have been frustrated by the new protectionism. Exports of manufactured products  including processed foods  textiles  clothing and foot-wearâall natural outlets for developing countries  particularly the least developedâhave been the subject of voluntary restraints  export restraint agreements  orderly marketing arrangements  non-tariff measures  and in some cases even subjected to increased competition through the granting of subsidies to declining industries in developed countries. These are the facts of the new protectionism. The Assembly will understand the concern of a small developing country like Trinidad and Tobago in this area  when much of our development thrust for the future will depend on gaining access to international markets for our steel and aluminium products.166.	The role of lower prices as a disincentive for new investment in primary commodities is paralleled by the granting of smaller  totally unviable quotas for manufactured goods to the smaller or least-developed among the developing countries  thus forcing the weakest economies into defensive  inward-looking trade strategies that in themselves limit flexibility and heighten the incidence of burdens on those least capable of bearing them. Without the assurance of export markets  the economies of the third-world countries will continue to stagnate  with all the attendant social ills and consequences that go hand in hand with such stagnation.167.	In the face of this dilemma  we have witnessed the failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD and the remission of all substantive issues to the permanent machinery of that organ. We have witnessed  after long and expensive negotiations  the conclusion of an International Sugar Agreement that has had no impact whatsoever on the depressed market conditions. Meanwhile  and perhaps not without significance  two of the most important traders in sugar remain outside the confines of this Agreement.168.	After long and arduous negotiations spanning several years  we have witnessed the creation of a Common Fund  which is the key instrument of the Integrated Programme for Commodities. The wars of attrition have taken their toll on this Fund and have reduced it to its mere price-stabilization functions  with the real problem of funds for industrialization still being left to voluntary efforts 169.	We have witnessed also the failure of the multilateral trade negotiations to respond to the major trade interests of the developing countries. Far from according special and differential treatment to developing countries  our developed trading partners have required us to grant concessions that were in some instances far in excess of the concessions they received.170.	Trade has not been the only area of discontent for developing countries during this current decade. Industrialization and related issues have been the cause of great concern to many developing countries  the experience of my country in this regard being a notable example.171.	To the extent that a shift towards industrialization is crucial to the development of countries heavily dependent on a few primary commodities  to that extent is it fair to say that the international community has failed to provide the type of assistance necessary to facilitate that shift. Funds disbursed by international institutions for industrialization and for research and development in that field in developing countries still constitute no more than 5 per cent of the total development assistance to those countries. This is an indictment of the system  which appears consciously and deliberately to address the wrong problem 172.	My delegation is encouraged  however  by one reason for optimism in this area of industrial cooperation. I refer to the conversion of UNIDO into a specialized agency. It is the hope of the Government of Trinidad and Tobago that this agency will prove to be responsive to the needs of developing countries and stronger and more effective in assisting industrial development in those countries.173.	The importance of this new institution within the United Nations family cannot be over-emphasized. However  it cannot be a success unless all nations work towards the strengthening of its role and capacity and assist it in its efforts to promote industrialization and to foster industrial co-operation among all nations.174.	The transfer of technology from developed to developing countries is one further area in which the efforts of the 1970s have not been crowned with success. My delegation continues to be concerned over the lack of progress towards the adoption of an international legally binding instrument that would facilitate and increase the international flow of all forms of technology from developed to developing countries under favourable terms and conditions.175.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago continues to maintain the view that the code of conduct on the transfer of technology  when adopted  should serve as a vehicle to eliminate restrictive and unfair practices affecting technology transactions and that it should help to strengthen the national technological capabilities of the developing countries.176.	With regard to the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  I dare to express the hope that this Assembly will succeed in establishing effective machinery for the completion of negotiations on the Vienna Programme of Action on Science and Technology for Development.  It will then be incumbent on Member States to muster the necessary political will to finalize the programme so as to bring the Conference to a successful conclusion. This is an area to which the Government of Trinidad and Tobago attachesâ great importance and which  I am sure  must play an essential role in the development of the economies of third-world countries in the 1980s.177.	The closing years of this decade have seen in Trinidad and Tobago an acceleration of our efforts to industrialize  using our hydrocarbon resources to feed and to fuel those efforts. Problems of trade  industrialization  research and development  and the transfer of technology have ail been brought into sharp focus during this process of accelerated industrialization. There has been no easy solution. The problems involved in the transfer of technology have  however  by and large proved to be among the most intractable.178.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has had to devise mechanisms  including Government-to- Government arrangements  to ensure that technology transfers take place. In this form of international co-operation  Governments undertake to guarantee performance in respect of projects and contracts. Provision is also made for the transfer of technology involved in projects. Further  the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has  through this mechanism  a reliable point of reference for establishing the bona fides of companies participating in such projects. One interesting development has emerged from this experience. It is that some Governments are able to ensure that transfers of technology take place  notwithstanding the fact that the technology involved may be privately owned.179.	This form of co-operation has also been useful to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago since it has facilitated joint-venture participation with companies in the public and the private sector from both developed and developing countries in a variety of projects. It has made it possible to tackle real problems  whether they are of a financial  export  marketing or technological nature or involve ongoing maintenance. In each case  through negotiation it has been possible to reach accommodations acceptable to all parties.180.	Economic stability  growth and a better quality of life cannot be enjoyed if vast areas of the world continue to be engaged in political conflict and warfare or subjected to the dehumanizing practices of racism and apartheid. In this regard  the record of the 1970s is unenviable.181.	We  the peoples of the United Nations  must indicate in no uncertain terms our resolve to face the common problems that affect us individually as nations or collectively as States Members of this body. The goal of global peace cannot be achieved unless the major areas of tension throughout the world are eliminated and disputes settled in a fair and equitable manner.182.	Several issues still remain for resolution in the coming decade  The questions of peace in the Middle East and in Cyprus and of peaceful change in southern Africa have been on our agenda for decades and have preoccupied Governments because of their adverse effects on the maintenance of international peace and security. Despite the continuing concern of the international community  there has been little progress towards universally accepted solutions. What are needed now are bold new initiatives to be taken by all interested parties in order to achieve in the Middle East a comprehensive settlement that would recognize the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.183.	The situation in southern Africa is fraught with danger for the international community. Intransigence on the part of the white racist minorities brings nearer the prospect of a racial conflagration on a grand scale  with consequences of further bloodshed and greater human suffering. The peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia must be permitted to exercise fully and freely their right to self-determination and independence  and they and all peoples of southern Africa must be enabled to enjoy all their fundamental human rights irrespective of race  colour or creed.184.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has noted the stand taken by the OAU on the question of the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination. My delegation maintains the view that the international community has a duty to see that this question is resolved through peaceful means and within the context of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).185.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its support for the people of Belize in the exercise of their right to self-determination leading to a secure independence and condemns all attempts to inhibit the exercise of that peremptory right of the people of Belize. The administering Power and all those nations with a real capability should take measures within their competence to implement speedily General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 33/36 with respect to Belize  and to guarantee by all credible means strict respect by all States for the inviolability of the frontiers and for the territorial integrity of an independent Belize.186.	The Government of Trinidad and Tobago appeals to States Members of the United Nations to abide by the principles laid down in the Charter  and to refrain from breaching those principles on the basis of short- term expediency. In this regard  and as an extension of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States and non-intervention in the domestic affairs of States  Members of this Organization should take particular care to ensure that their territories are not used as bases for subversion of the legal Governments of other Member States.187.	There are other tasks facing us in the new decade. Besides the resolution of the issues affecting economic development and international peace and security  we cannot expect to maximize the use of human resources or improve the quality of life until Governments are prepared to tackle in a comprehensive and integrated manner the basic social ills that confront our national societies.188.	Full and equal participation of women is crucial to world development and peace. It is essential that the World Plan of Action for the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Women's Year  adopted at Mexico City  be implemented at the national  regional and international levels. In this context  I should observe that Trinidad and Tobago has an established National Commission on the Status of Women. My delegation urges that the draft Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women be completed at this session of the General Assembly  and be available for the 1980 World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality  Development  Peace.189.	The United Nations and the intergovernmental organizations associated with it must  within the coming decade  launch and maintain a concerted attack on these problem areas. It is hoped that with the harmonization of medium-term plans  the Secretariat of the United Nations and the various specialized agencies will be able better to co-ordinate their activities in the implementation of policy directives from their principal legislative organs in these fields of activity. Part and parcel of their future activities must be the provision of training to nationals of developing countries and the creation of institutions in developing countries that can help Governments to deal on a continuous basis with these crucial social problems.190.	My delegation welcomes the preparations for the 1983 United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy which should lead to greater global co-operation in the development and transfer of technology relating to these forms of energy for the benefit of all countries and in particular for those developing countries which do not possess vast amounts of conventional energy resources such as coal  nuclear energy and hydrocarbon deposits  and which will require cost-effective energy resources for the continued economic and social development of their peoples.191.	We move into the new decade of the 1980s with a comprehensive catalogue of grievances that need to be settled. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is conscious of  and also deeply concerned about  the proliferation of institutions to which the Secretary- General alluded  and the extent to which this institutional escapism is being used to obfuscate real issues or to relegate the just demands of the developing countries to the cobwebs of international institutional networks.192.	If the international community wishes to identify the real problems and assist the development of developing countries  then the perspective of genuine interdependence rather than that of narrow nationalistic goals must inform the attitudes of those countries with the capacity to assist in the solution of these problems.193.	If the international community really wishes to optimize the utilization of the limited natural resources of this planet  all nations must strive towards forms of co-operation that will not involve exploitation of the poor by the wealthy  or the subjugation of the weak by the strong.194.	These are some of the tasks that will continue to face us in the 1980s. We must have the courage to recognize them. We must have the political will and conviction to acknowledge them. We do have a duty to overcome them."
"130",6937,"TUN",34,1979,"ï»¿The delegation of Tunisia is happy at Mr. Salim's election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We feel sure that his wide experience and high efficiency are the best guarantee for the success of the work of the current session of the Assembly  which is meeting at a time when international relations are passing through critical circumstances. We are also sure that he  as one of the great sons of the African continent will contribute to solving the problems that face the international community in general and the peoples and countries which are still suffering under the yoke of colonial hegemony and foreign occupation  in particular. This is not surprising  because he  like his great country  has always been in the vanguard of those who have served the cause of these peoples inside and outside Africa and  in particular  the cause of the Palestinian people. I would like to assure him that the delegation of Tunisia will exert every effort and make every fraternal endeavour to assist him in carrying out the great tasks that he will assume during this session.115.	Allow me also to express my appreciation to his great predecessor  Mr. Indalecio Lievano Aguirre  who presided over the work of the previous session with great dedication and efficiency.116.	It is with great pleasure that we reiterate out-expression of appreciation and thanks to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  who  with constant enthusiasm and great intelligence  has restored to the United Nations its natural role in dealing with international causes and managing them.117.	However much we try to have hope we cannot consider that the international situation justifies even the most cautious optimism. In fact  the major problems that we face  far from finding a solution  are becoming more complicated because of unfavourable developments which have diverted them from  rather than drawn them closer to  their correct solution.118.	This is the case in the Middle East where tension has been maximized  threatening international peace and security more and more directly and continually. Though the Arab countries have affirmed their desire for peace and have exerted every effort to that end  Israel continues  without fear  to carry out its policy which is based on occupation  aggression and expansion  without any heed to right and justice and the resolutions of the United Nations. In addition to its acts of aggression and repression against the Palestinian people  and to the measures that Israel takes to entrench its roots in Palestine and to Judaize Jerusalem  it continues also  in spite of general reprobation  to set up settlements in the occupied territories prior to their total annexation by means of a tested method  that of the fait accompli.119.	Israeli leaders have given their unjust ambitions free rein and do not even trouble anymore to camouflage their deliberate intentions  overtly declaring that they are entitled to claim sovereignty over the West Bank and deciding that the Holy City of Jerusalem will remain the ""Eternal Capital of the State of Israel"". Thus the whole world can see that Israel is asking for much more than its right to exist. In addition to the fact that it can conceive of its existence only in the denial of that of others  it claims in fact and in particular the alleged right to continue to carry out its Zionist strategy of total and systematic occupation and expansion according to a plan that was prepared a long time ago.120.	Obviously  the behaviour of Israeli leaders  whether in the occupied territories  in the south of Lebanon or in other areas  aims at nothing less than breaking the determination of the Palestinian people to exist  and thus annihilating it morally and physically.121.	The injustice imposed on the Palestinian people has been perpetrated for over 30 years now  giving rise to wars  bloodshed and continued conflicts and problems in a particularly sensitive spot of the world which  because of its strategic position and economic resources  may become the starting-point of a world explosion  the consequences of which can hardly be measured.122.	In response to this intransigent defiance  the latest initiatives taken and the partial treaties which followed are but a ridiculous and superficial answer to the question. So those who had believed that the Camp David agreements might be a potential starting-point for the progressive restoration of peace have been compelled to face the reality and retreat from the illusion they harboured. Indeed  the obvious position taken by the Government of Tel Aviv and the clear statements made by official Israeli authorities leave no doubt as to their intention to pursue and reinforce their aggressive policy against the neighbouring Arab States and their total denial of the rights of the Palestinian people to exist and exercise its sovereignty.123.	In fact  I have several unavoidable questions in mind. To what extent can we trust such an unequal negotiation in which one party offers to disarm  whereas the other party strongly persists in its preparation for war? What may be the result of a negotiation in which the possibility of contact with the official representatives of the Palestinian people is denied and repressed? And  finally  how effective can such a negotiation be if it is applied to the outer shell with no heed to the core of the dispute  which is  above all  an Israeli-Palestinian conflict.124.	Tunisia believes that this initiative was an error resulting from a confusion and an erroneous analysis.125.	As early as 1965  President Habib Bourguiba  in an historic speech delivered in Jericho before Palestinians  drew attention to the core of the Palestinian issue and to the necessity of a settlement on the basis of a return to international legitimacy and the recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to their homeland and to independence.126.	Following the defeat of 1967  the President of the Republic of Tunisia repeated his condemnation of the confusion that was prevailing and that tended to make of the Palestinian problem a marginal issue.127.	Events and developments that followed the signing of the Camp David agreements have proved once again that any endeavour for peace in the Middle East which did not tackle the core of the problem  that is the recognition of the PLO as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people and of the right of that people to self-determination and to live in sovereignty and dignity within an independent Stateâ was doomed to failure because it ignored the reality and true nature of the facts.128.	Speaking of avoiding crisis  tension and aggression  I should say that Africa has not been more fortunate in this respect. Still dragging the heavy heritage of the colonial era  entangled sometimes in serious problems issuing from the chaos of the post-colonial period  it has not always succeeded in overcoming the major handicaps which hampered its stability and its development  with a view to severing once and for all the bonds of external dependence. Those bonds have become stronger over the years and throughout the successive crises  aggravating the fragility and the vulnerability of the African States.129.	While we witness in the south a type of virulent and hard-to-beat colonialism that is alien to our age  and where racism  and its most hideous manifestation  apartheid  are imposed with unprecedented violence and persistence  the African continent is shaken from north to south and from east to west by the tremor of instability and tension which dangerously threatens its security and world peace.130.	The numerous conflicts among African nations offer favourable ground for external intervention. Unfortunately  Africa  already the victim of rivalries stirred up by foreign interests  has become the arena where foreign influence and greed abound.131.	In South Africa  the Pretoria Government is reinforcing its policy of oppression and exploitation  with its racist laws  and is trying to extend its apartheid policies to Namibia  which it continues to occupy illegally. Supported by its relations with certain countries and by the secret assistance it continually receives  it is increasing its military and nuclear potential and planning a long-term strategy  by launching a so-called southern community with a view to making its domination of the region irreversible and killing the aspiration of the people to dignity and freedom.132.	In Zimbabwe  Ian Smith continues with his manoeuvres in order to maintain illegal power and the privileges of the white minority through an alleged internal settlement  a biracial  fake Government and sham elections. We believe that these manoeuvres seriously impede the normal process of decolonization and the assumption of power by the black majority. The so-called legitimacy  to which the colonialist system has often tried to give credit by bestowing the seal of legitimacy on worthless attempts  cannot be misleading when the repressive war continues to be so cruelly waged against the people of Zimbabwe  together with aggressive actions against neighbouring countries.133.	After long hesitation  and as a result of the pressures put upon it by the African and Asian countries of the Commonwealth  the United Kingdom Government  it seems  has now decided to recognize the Patriotic Front  as the sole party qualified to discuss the future of Zimbabwe and the fate of its people. By accepting the London assignments  the leaders of the Patriotic Front have once more affirmed their will to settle the problem by the most peaceful means. It is now for the United Kingdom Government to live up to the responsibilities vested in it as the Administering Authority.134.	The United Nations cannot proclaim the termination of the British Mandate over Zimbabwe until that country is given the real attributes of national sovereignty according to international law and in line with the legitimate aspirations of its people 135.	In Namibia  the settlement that was arranged under the supervision of the United Nations  with a view to putting to an end the illegal administration of that Territory by South Africa and enabling the Namibian people to achieve independence  is at an impasse as a result of the changing manoeuvres of the Government of Pretoria  whose delays and hesitations unmask its true intentions. It is regrettable that the five Western countries do not seem eager to impose the settlement plans  though they were its initiators. However  the decisive contribution the Security Council ought to bring to the solution of this problem should not divert anyone from the urgent obligation to support the resistance of the Namibian people and its heroic liberation movement  SWAPO.136.	Generally speaking  faced with the deteriorating situation in the southern part of the African continent  and with such negative developments  the international community and the United Nations have the duty to affirm their solidarity with the peoples of the area with a view to strengthening the heroic struggle those peoples continue to wage under the leadership of their respective national liberation movements and to enabling them to realize their legitimate aspirations to freedom  dignity and sovereignty.137.	Our concern for and attention to international economic affairs are not less serious than those we pay to political matters. In this field  too  the present outlook does not leave much room for optimism. The current year has not yet witnessed any noticeable improvement in the international economic situation.138.	The advanced countries continue to be troubled by their problems  which have now become common matters  such as the slackening of the growth rate  unemployment  and the persistence of sky-rocketing inflation  with all the resulting consequences for the economies of developing countries.139.	The third world has often tried to call the attention of the developed countries to the real reasons for the crisis: the fact that the developed countries  which are unable to control their internal imbalances  refuse to recognize that such imbalances are  above all  the symptom of a defective adjustment of their economic structures and of a basic imbalance in international economic relations.L40  No measure imposed by circumstances  and adopted by the developed countries under the pressure of present events  even at the highest levels  will be sufficient to bring the long-term solutions the world needs  The real solution still lies in a fundamental restructuring of world economic relations  in line with the objectives and principles of the new international economic order  which would at the same time take into account the legitimate interests of a(l the parties concerned. especially the developing countries.141 	The third world  for its part  has spared no effort to see that this restructuring is carried out within the framework of an open and constructive dialogue. Since the convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly in 1974  the third world has intensified its efforts to this end  proposing clear and reasonable objectives  according to new principles recognized by the General Assembly as being necessary if a meaningful content is to be given to the concept of interdependence.142.	Since that date  many developed countries have undergone an undoubted evolution; they no longer consider the establishment of a new international economic order a threat to their economies or their economic and social systems. However  those countries with the greatest economic influence still continue to oppose any change.143.	This opposition has resulted in the failure of most of the attempts at making the dialogue between the North and the South succeed. We still remember the failure of the fifth session of UNCTAD  held at Manila some months ago  to find acceptable solutions for the major problems on its agenda.144.	The Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  Following three sessions held in New York  has adopted some recommendations concerning the transfer of resources and agricultural development in the developing countries. However  these recommendations  though encouraging in some ways  are still clearly insufficient. In addition  the refusal of the major developed countries to help the Committee of the Whole to achieve any success regarding the question of industrialization has been another source of concern and disappointment.145.	The United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  recently held in Vienna  achieved an agreement by all parties on some important issues  in particular those relating to procedural matters and to the financing of the Programme of Action  and we acknowledge those good results with satisfaction  However  there are other essential problems  such as that of the transfer of technology  which have not found a satisfactory solution  and have been referred to other negotiating forums.146.	These are examples that we have drawn from the many meetings and conferences that were held during the past year to activate development and international co-operation. All these examples confirm that the dialogue continues  but that its continuance is the result solely of the efforts exerted by the Group of 77  assisted by a small number of developed countries which share their faith and determination. These examples also indicate that the dialogue faces difficulties which have become well known and are identified. These are related to the basic aspects of the new international economic order that we are all trying to establish.147.	For us  a developing country  these difficulties consist in an absence of a transfer of resources from developed countries  in the refusal of these countries to allow some of their industries to develop in our countries  in the lack of access to technology and technological information  in the fact that our industrial and agricultural products are prevented from entering the markets of the developed countries and in the instability of the prices of our essential products.148.	We should also like to play our full part as responsible and sovereign States in the process of decision-making on world economic problems  in particular those relating to the international monetary system and the rules governing world trade.149.	To our repeated appeals for a serious examination of these difficulties  the developed countries have often responded by stressing their own problems which  they allege  are the result of the price of energy imposed by the oil-producing developing countries.150.	While it may be easy to refute that allegation with regard to the effect of the price of petroleum on the current economic crisis and on inflation  we feel that it would be better to affirm that it is time to adopt a new approach to the North-South dialogue  a comprehensive one which would permit viable negotiations on the most important obstacles in the way of one or the other party  including those relating to the field of energy  and allow us to reach acceptable solutions  always bearing keenly in mind the problems of the developing countries  especially since these have become increasingly acute.151.	In order to ensure that such comprehensive negotiations have every chance to succeed  we consider that it is necessary that they take place within the framework of the United Nations with the full and complete participation of all countries concerned. It is  above all  necessary that all countries should display real political will  in particular the developed countries  which have so far adopted a reserved and negative attitude towards many of the attempts to give full scope to the North-South dialogue.152.	Acting in its geographical context  Tunisia believes that the States bordering on the Mediterranean constitute a group that is united by a common destiny and that  therefore  it is most important for them to work towards a policy of security aimed particularly at turning that interior sea into a peaceful lake.153.	This process  which culminated in Helsinki  and was discussed again in Belgrade and in Malta  and which will also be dealt with soon in Madrid  contains the seeds of a new relationship based on security and co-operation and the search for complementarity rather than antagonism.154.	However  there is still a long way to go before we can establish an atmosphere of real trust and draw up a charter among the littoral States of the Mediterranean Sea for a unified policy in the fields of investment  energy  the marketing of products  employment and maritime law  in addition to full cultural co-operation. Such a model of international relations will be the best example and will ensure the security of the area and the prosperity of its people. This is not a fairy-tale desire  remote from reality or difficult to achieve.155.	We are satisfied with the initiative that was adopted by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State of Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Havana  which called for the holding of negotiations between the North and the South  and also the practical proposals which the Group of 77 formally presented at the last meeting of the Committee of the Whole. That Committee affirmed the importance of this initiative and submitted a draft resolution to the General Assembly to give them the priority commensurate with their importance and to examine them during the current session in order to adopt a resolution thereon.156.	We believe that an important stage has been begun in this regard and we hope that the hesitation which the advanced countries have shown will be abandoned after serious examination of the real possibilities that such an initiative provides to activate such negotiations and to give them a new impetus in which the interests of all can be taken into consideration. Thus  the new development decade which the United Nations is about to enter may become one of economic upsurge for all developing countries and one of harmony in international economic relations.157.	The problem of information was also a topic of concern as a result of the Committee that was set up last year to review the policies of the United Nations and its activities in this field. This Committee has not yet carried out the task entrusted to it in the best possible manner  for reasons beyond its control  but it has at least drawn up a frame of action  which we must carry out. A working group was also able to examine the problems of the Department of Public Information attached to the United Nations. That Committee was set up as a result of recognition by the international community of the need to establish a new world information system. Therefore we should affirm the need for the Committee to continue its work and we should renew our trust in it  strengthen its mission and open it to all Member countries. We hope that the General Assembly will unanimously adopt a resolution on that topic.158.	The last Conference of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Havana  although it did not achieve all the aspirations and hopes pinned on it  nevertheless reached just and durable solutions to the most important topics of interest to the international community. We refer to its resolutions on the Middle East  the southern part of the continent of Africa  disarmament and international economic relations  The Tunisian delegation is sure that at this session the General Assembly will take into consideration all the positive elements to which we have referred and which represent an important contribution by the non-aligned countries. This movement will remain  in spite of all the transient storms  because it represents a balance in a world divided around the two major Powers. Any consolidation of the unity of these non-aligned countries will be of benefit to the international community as a whole.159.	We hope that the General Assembly under your supervision  Mr. President  will pave the way for adequate and durable solutions to the most important problems before us  particularly since there is obvious international concern about problems such as the Middle East and the south of the African continent. This is affirmed clearly by the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on these topics. The only obstacle that has prevented the return of peace to those two areas  in spite of the recognition by all of their strategic importance  is the intransigence of some groups of people whose feelings and actions are dominated by racial supremacy and hatred. It is feared that such tensions in these areas will lead to explosions threatening world peace and security. The United Nations can  through the good intentions which we hope all its Member States will show  force these minorities  however strong they may be  to return to the correct path in the interests of the international community and their own interests.160.	We wish the General Assembly every success in imposing peaceful solutions to all the problems facing the international community through international consensus."
"131",6984,"TUR",34,1979,"ï»¿It is a great pleasure for me to join the previous speakers in congratulating President Salim most warmly on his election to the high office he now occupies. As I wish him well in the discharge of his heavy responsibilities  I should like to emphasize that my delegation and I are confident that the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly will carry out its work effectively and efficiently under his able guidance. May I be permitted to pay a tribute to the country he represents and stress that my Government attaches special importance to promoting its relations with the United Republic of Tanzania in all fields.247.	I should also like to take this opportunity to pay homage to Mr. Salim's predecessor  Mr. Lievano of Colombia for the efficient and skilful manner in which he performed his duties during the last session of the General Assembly.248.	I wish to recall once more the eminent qualities of our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and to reiterate our sincere appreciation for his dedicated and untiring efforts in the attainment of our common goals.249.	Permit me also to avail myself of this opportunity to express our warm welcome to Saint Lucia on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations. We consider this admission to be a further step towards the true universality of the Organization.250.	Each session of the General Assembly provides us with the opportunity of taking stock of the situation in the world and of the trends affecting the course of events in international relations. In line with this practice  the speakers who have taken the floor before me have analysed in detail the present world developments. I should like to stress briefly the conclusion that was reached by many and which I fully share.251.	In spite of the determined efforts deployed during the past year in all international forums  particularly within the United Nations system  and through bilateral contacts  the international scene continues to be characterized by tensions and conflicts.252.	In the search for solutions to these tensions and conflicts  the correct approach should be to discern their real causes. Whatever may be their nature  political or military  the underlying causes are often economic and social. Therefore  while tackling some of the urgent international issues separately  this interrelationship should always be kept in mind.253.	Our major concern in international relations is the establishment and maintenance of peace  security and stability among nations.254.	Much has been done in the quest for a better world  and a more congenial international setting for peace and security. In this quest it is our belief that detente represents the guiding factor for present-day international relations. In present world conditions there is no alternative to detente. As I stated last year  from this very rostrum   every country  big or small  developed or developing  has a stake in the relaxation of tension and should  on the basis of equality participate actively in the efforts to promote peace and security  Detente must therefore become universal  en-compassing all regions of the world and all aspects of international life.255.	Detente is in conformity with the principles that guide Turkish foreign policy  which is aimed at developing relations with all the countries in the world  particularly with neighbouring countries  on the basis of non-interference in internal affairs and mutual respect for independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and the equality of rights.256.	Inspired by Ataturk's motto  ""Peace at home  Peace abroad  Turkey has played an active role in fostering the process of detente and has consistently contributed to the work leading to the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and to its follow-up. It is true that we should not expect spectacular achievements in the relatively short time that has elapsed since the Conference. Yet it is gratifying that the process of detente in Europe is continuing and even acquiring new dimensions. The Madrid review session to be held next year will  in our view  constitute a crucial step in this evolutionary process. All participating countries bear a special responsibility to contribute to the success of the Madrid meeting. We believe that a careful and thorough preparation is therefore indispensable. Bilateral contacts and consultations will certainly play an important role in this respect. We should not lose sight of the fact that the momentum of the detente process should be sustained by timely and appropriate efforts. Hence the importance of the Madrid follow-up meeting.257.	Detente is indivisible. It should not be confined to Europe alone. Serious thought should be given to encouraging such a process in other regions through constructive initiatives and positive actions. We see no other way of ensuring peace  security and stability throughout the world.258.	Another crucial matter that interests us all is arms control and disarmament. General and complete disarmament under effective international control is and will continue to be the ultimate goal of the international community. World public opinion is becoming increasingly aware of the need for stopping the arms race and allocating the material and human resources thus released to economic and social development.259.	Arms control and disarmament is a long process that will require purposeful and constant efforts by all countries. Progress towards this objective will have to be achieved gradually but effectively  and our primary aim should be to stop the arms race and reduce the danger of nuclear war. Reduction of the level of armaments is an equally important task. Our method should be a step-by-step approach. We should aim at specific  feasible measures. Therefore  we are of the view that steps at present being undertaken will play an important role in the attainment of the over-all objective.260.	Let me add that Turkey welcomed the second SALT Treaty recently signed between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America as a major step in this context. It is our hope that this important development will have a positive bearing on other arms control and disarmament negotiations in Europe and in the world in general.261.	Another significant initiative is the Vienna talks on force reductions in Central Europe and associated measures. The successful conclusion of these negotiations will contribute to peace and security in Europe and to conditions conducive to a more stable military relationship based on reduced force-levels. While backing the current efforts in that direction  we believe that the measures to be undertaken should not adversely affect security and stability in other regions of Europe.262.	I should now like to turn to the situation in the Middle East  which continues to be one of the major areas of tension in the world. Turkey  as a country of the region  follows the developments there with close attention.263.	As we have stated on several previous occasions  a comprehensive  just and lasting solution of the Middle East problem can be achieved only through Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab territories and from the Arab sector of Jerusalem occupied in 1967 and through the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to establish their own independent State. That is why we consider the question of Palestine to be the core of the Middle East conflict  and that is why we believe that the active participation of the PLO  which is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  should be secured in any peace-making process if there is to be peace in the region.264.	Another source of deep concern in the Middle East is the situation in Lebanon. The events of recent years have caused great sufferings in that country and have put in jeopardy its territorial integrity. The situation in Lebanon is in itself inextricably linked with the over-all problem of the Middle East. Repeated attacks by Israel further aggravate the situation and constitute another serious impediment in the way of bringing about peace in the area.265.	The acute problems awaiting solutions in southern Africa continue to be another source of disappointment to the international community.266.	The Turkish people have always rejected all forms of oppression  exploitation and discrimination. The active and determined stand we have taken against racist policies is a natural consequence of this traditional position.267.	Indeed  having led the way for liberation movements earlier in the century under the leadership of Kemal Ataturk  the Turkish people are following the situation now prevailing in Africa with deep concern.268.	The Government of South Africa  which has institutionalized the policy of apartheid  has remained undeterred by and insensitive to the repeated demands of the international community. It has stepped up its oppressive measures and has continued its policy of bantustanization. These developments have further aggravated the prevailing situation in southern Africa. The Government of Turkey strongly condemns the policy of apartheid and advocates continued United Nations efforts to eliminate this policy. We are firmly convinced that further effective measures should be adopted against South Africa.269.	As a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia from its inception  we maintain  as before  that the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa is unacceptable. We fully support the people of Namibia and their sole legitimate representative  SWAPO  in their rightful struggle to achieve self-determination  freedom and genuine national independence. We remain convinced that the United Nations plan  for the establishment of an independent and democratic Namibia through elections to be held in accordance with Security Council resolutions 385 (1976) and 435 (1978) is the only feasible way to achieve a peaceful solution of the Namibian problem.270.	As regards the question of Zimbabwe  I should also like to reaffirm my Government's support for the legitimate struggle of the Zimbabwean people  led by the Patriotic Front  against the vestiges of racism and towards the achievement of a solution based on genuine majority rule. We believe that any solution concerning the future of Zimbabwe must be worked out with the participation of the Patriotic Front so that it can be internationally recognized.271.	In this connexion I should like to note that the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held at Lusaka last August  has brought about a new stage concerning the solution of the question of Zimbabwe. We welcome the constructive efforts of the front-line African States in this regard  as well as the initiative taken by the United Kingdom to hold a conference in London with the participation of all parties concerned. We hope that this Conference will contribute to the solution of the Zimbabwean question  taking into account the aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe.272.	The African nations are facing particularly difficult problems. The security and stability of the continent will depend on finding urgent and effective solutions to these problems. The eradication of colonialism  racism and apartheid and the acceleration of development are the pressing tasks of the world community as a whole. It can easily be said that in the coming years Africa will constitute the testing-ground for international solidarity and true co-operation.273.	In their efforts for development primarily based on national and collective self-reliance  African countries will certainly be in need of and benefit from the positive contributions of the international community as a whole and of the developed countries in particular.274.	However  while providing such support and assistance  non-African countries should refrain from intervening in inter-African disputes and interfering in the internal affairs of African States. Turkey firmly believes that inter-African disputes can and should be resolved by the African countries themselves.275.	As a developing country  Turkey is well aware of the obstacles facing the developing countries in our age. This is why we are ready to make available our own experience and capabilities in contributing to the efforts the African nations make towards development and self-reliance.276.	In recent years  we have increased our contacts with many African countries in order to promote economic  cultural and technical co-operation.277.	Traditionally  peace has been considered as a product of an equilibrium based on security and the political independence of States. Today there is a growing awareness that this equilibrium has  in fact  economic and social dimensions. Political independence  in this context  is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to remedy the ills of under-development. There can be no stability in an international environment where disparity between rich and poor nations attains such disquieting proportions.278.	Unfortunately the record of our activities within the United Nations system is not yet very promising in this respect. Expectations raised by the consensus on the establishment of the New International Economic Order have not been met. Rather a dismal picture is the result so far of many endeavours.â279.	One has to admit that this is a rather peculiar situation: rich and poor countries agree on broad objectives for the establishment of a more equitable international order  and yet they fail to adopt the practical measures required by their consensus.280.	To our mind  one of the main reasons for this bleak picture is the absence of the necessary political will on the part of the industrialized countries. Only with such will can one overcome short-term  narrow and even parochial interests which have hitherto impeded progress in a North-South dialogue. Only through significant progress on substantive issues can a new impetus be given to the dialogue.281.	Since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system  we have been passing through a transitory stage characterized by a set of modi vivendi reached temporarily by the major industrial Powers with respect to international monetary and trade issues  as well as economic policy concertation among them. Nevertheless  in the present climate of uncertainty implicit in transition  it is no longer possible to preserve the old international order by minor adjustments or short-term counter-cyclical measures.282.	What we need is to aim at a new international order conducive to the development in a truly interdependent world of the developing countries with their full and active participation. Only in such a new international order can the inflation and unemployment besetting the world economy be tackled and global economic growth be resumed on a sustained basis.283.	I should like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly two points that I consider particularly important.284.	First  in our view the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/ 174 should allocate its remaining time  until the 1980 special session of the General Assembly  to determining how best it can launch the new phase of global negotiations. We should accordingly modify  at this session of the General Assembly  the mandate of the Committee so as to enable it to discharge this major task until the convening of the special session. Turkey is ready to contribute actively to such an initiative.285.	We are convinced that the incorporation of' 'energy"" in the dialogue is of tremendous importance for all countries  developed and developing alike. Incidentally  since the industrialized countries had in the past fully recognized and even ardently defended the need for incorporating the question of energy in the dialogue  we expect that they will support the initiative now taken in this respect by developing countries.286.	In fact  there are many reasons justifying the inclusion of energy in the dialogue. Indeed  the pricing of oil  its interaction with world inflation  and conservation measures to be adopted by developed countries  as well as the problem of meeting the primary energy requirements of developing countries on a sustained basis are some of the snort-term and long-term issues related to energy which can be usefully discussed within this dialogue. In the short run however  the energy issue is related to the acute balance-of-payments difficulties of oil-importing developing countries. In fact  these countries have reached such a stage after recent price rises that their oil import bills start drawing heavily on their total export earnings. This development has compounded the existing balance-of-payments difficulties or these countries arising from strong inflationary trends in the industrialized world.288.	I must make it clear that collective self-reliance lies at the core of this problem. It is a promising sign  therefore  that this crucial point has been fully recognized in the resolution adopted at the Havana Conference of non-aligned countries.289.	We carefully listened to Mr. Jose Lopez Portillo'  the President of Mexico  and greatly appreciated his innovative contribution to a better understanding of the world's problems which await urgent solution. We fully share his conviction that the energy issue should be tackled within a ""more complex whole: a new world economic order""  with all its linkages  and within the framework of the new international development strategy as a means of implementing the necessary measures.290.	It is also our considered view that the United Nations system is the most appropriate  indeed the only ""fully instituted forum""  in which to handle global energy questions. We are convinced that the proposed energy plan could best be approached within global negotiations which  we earnestly hope  will be launched at this General Assembly session  and will be fully open to all countries  not only during negotiations  but also during the preparatory stages.291.	I now come to the second point which is the rampant trend of protectionism in international trade. The development of developing countries depends to a considerable extent on continued growth in their export earnings. And yet  protectionist practices in industrialized countries are rapidly increasing. This poses not only a great danger to the economies of developing countries bat also a threat to the very foundations of the liberal and interdependent world order advocated by the industrialized countries themselves. There is an urgent need for determined international action to stop this trend. Such action would be to the benefit of both sides. The growth of the economies of the developing countries through increased access to the markets of developed countries would in the long run have beneficial effects on the industrialized countries by enabling them to sustain their own level of growth and welfare.292.	We live at a very critical period in history. While developing countries are determined to realize economic development  the international economy plunges from one recession into another with a prospect of long-term slow growth.293.	At this juncture  the New International Economic Order appears as an historic opportunity and a challenge both for those who have been blessed with the bounties of the industrial age and for those who are disadvantaged. We should welcome this challenge without further delay. Negotiations on the New International Economic Order must be pursued uninterruptedly and persistently. We must mobilize all our efforts  resources and imagination to explore new approaches to co-operation. Above all  we must not allow ourselves to become discouraged or to abandon a worth-while objective.294.	Before concluding I would like to touch briefly upon the question of Cyprus.295.	 The Secretary-General in his report to the General Assembly on the work of the Organization makes the following observation in connexion with the question of Cyprus:""It seems to me  however  that a far-sighted and determined approach  based on the existing guidelines and accords  could lead to a rapid improvement of the situation in the island that would serve the interests of all concerned and would be vastly preferable to continuing to cling to an unsatisfactory and potentially unstable status quo.""296.	The Turkish Government fully agrees with the Secretary-General's observation. In the view of my Government  the key to improving the present situation in the island and even to finding a solution lies in the process of negotiations between the two Cypriot communities  to be conducted on an equal footing.297.	The Turkish community of Cyprus pursues the sole objective of ensuring its security as well as its fundamental and legitimate rights as an equal partner in an independent  sovereign  non-aligned  bi-communal  bizonal  federal Republic  closing the doors to any possible repetition of oppression by the other partner. This noble aim must be supported by all those who respect human dignity and justice. Turkey  for one  fully supports it.298.	In the view of the Turkish Government  the 19 May agreement provides the necessary framework for the solution of the Cyprus problem on the basis of fundamental and legitimate rights of the two communities as equal partners. It cannot and should not be seen as an escape from commitments undertaken on the basis of the Denktas-Makarios four-point guidelines of 12 February 1977. 299.	The Cyprus question has today reached a stage where the common purpose of the international com-munity  as well as that of the parties directly concerned  is to encourage the pursuit of the intercommunal talks in a continued and sustained manner. To that end  my Government is determined to support the serious intensive efforts that are under way thanks to the good offices of the Secretary-General in order to reactivate the intercommunal talks. In our view  if the momentum of the break-through of 19 May 1979 is to be maintained and if the negotiating process is to be given a chance to make substantial progress  it is essential that the parties should refrain from violating the letter and spirit of point 6 of the 19 May agreement which provides for the improvement of the atmosphere so as to facilitate negotiations.300.	Attempts to change the nature of the good offices entrusted to the Secretary-General and to take the Cyprus problem on to platforms other than its proper platform  that is to say to the intercommunal talks  are nothing but a manoeuvre aimed at avoiding serious negotiations and as such are doomed to failure. We still hope that the Greek Cypriot leadership will realize this fact and co-operate with the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the resumption without further delay of the intercommunal talks. We also continue to hope that the Government of Greece will bring itself to encourage current efforts designed to make possible the resumption of those intercommunal talks  which is  in fact  the only valid exercise in clearing the way for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cyprus question."
"132",7046,"TZA",34,1979,"ï»¿It is with great pleasure  and a modest measure of pride  that I congratulate you  Sir  on behalf of the Tanzania delegation  upon your assumption of the high office of President of this General Assembly. Your special relationship with us needs no explanation. All we are left to do is to wish you great success and assure you of our total co-operation in the honoured role in which you have been placed by the international community. I wish  at the same time  to express our thanks through you to the States Members of the United Nations. The United Republic of Tanzania sees in your election to the presidency of the General Assembly a mark of appreciation of its contribution to the endeavours of this world body to promote international peace  understanding and co-operation. We are certain that you will discharge your responsibilities with skill and distinction  and thus do credit to the African region and the non-aligned group of nations to which you and your country belong.2. Your predecessor  Ambassador Lie'vano  distinguished himself in office by his dedication  patient diplomacy  fairness  courtesy and competence. We hope his record will be an inspiration to you  and we wish him continued success in the service of his great country  Colombia.3. Allow me now to pay a tribute to the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has had a very busy year. His untiring efforts in search of solutions to the complex problems of the world have taken him to many places around the world. I want to recall particularly his unfailing efforts to solve the problems of southern Africa. I also recall his fruitful attendance at the sixteenth ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in July in the Liberian capitalâMonroviaâ where he made a comprehensive review of the state of the world today. By the dedication and constructive role Mr. Waldheim has charted for his office  the prestige and the hopes that we have in this world body have been very much enhanced. We wish him continued good health.4.	We learnt with deep shock of the untimely death  early this month  of Mr. Agostinho Neto  the President of the People's Republic of Angola. Mr. Neto and his countrymen have had a long association with my country and people  a relationship which deepened through Angola's armed struggle for independence. The association ripened in the post-independence years as  along with the other front-line States  we met  planned and worked together to discharge the duty entrusted to us by the OAU to act as a firm rear base for the armed struggle for the liberation of southern Africa. With his passing  Africa has lost a great son  a great patriot  a great freedom fighter  a great revolutionary thinker and a great statesman. I ask the Angolan delegation to convey my delegation's heartfelt condolences to the family of the late President  to the MPLA Workers Party  and to the Government and people of Angola.5.	Since the United Nations was founded over three decades ago  visible and significant success has been achieved m the process of decolonization. Tanzania salutes the invaluable contributions made by the United Nations in enhancing the cause of peace and the freedom of millions of peoples from colonial domination and oppression. From the time the General Assembly adopted resolution 1514 (XV)  19 years ago  many countries  including my own  have joined the ranks of free and independent nations whose tribute to the United Nations is their presence in this chamber as equal Members. In this session we have admitted to membership the new State of Saint Lucia and I take this opportunity to congratulate that State and to welcome its representatives in our midst.6.	This Organization's decolonization agenda is not yet finished; in fact  what remains is the most critical phase. In what is now almost an annual ritual  this General Assembly will address itself to the questions of Southern Rhodesia  Namibia  and South Africa  in conformity with the various resolutions of the OAU  the non-aligned movement and the United Nations. Over the past year we have seen a lot of movement but no basic change in the political situation in the region.7.	In Rhodesia  the illegal racist regime succeeded  through a constitutional fraud and an electoral farce  in entrenching white minority rule with a front of black faces. No Member State has been deceived by these manoeuvres  and we urge the maintenance of sanctions against that regime  and the denial to it of international recognition.8. 	The new Government of the United Kingdom has called a conference in London of all the parties to the Rhodesian conflict following the Commonwealth agreement reached at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  at Lusaka in August  on the way to proceed to a negotiated settlement  I should like to reiterate my country's attitude to these talks.9.	We support the Commonwealth agreement on Rhodesia. We welcome the talks and believe that they can produce agreement on a genuinely democratic constitution and on the modalities of free and fair elections acceptable to the international community to put such a constitution into effect. Ian Smith  who is avowedly against majority rule  together with his black puppet Government  must not be allowed to stand in the way of an agreement. We stress the imperative  affirmed by the United Kingdom Government itself  that independence should not be given to Rhodesia by the United Kingdom on the basis of principles and conditions essentially different from those which applied at the accession of other former British colonial territories to independence.10.	The talks in London provide a last opportunity for a negotiated settlement. Should they fail to live up to the Lusaka agreement  there is only the alternative of war to the finish. And my country will support the Patriotic Front so that it can intensify and win that war.11.	Namibia  which is a United Nations Territory  continues to be occupied illegally and with impunity by South Africa. South Africa has blocked the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  thus dealing a contemptuous blow to the expectations of a settlement by peaceful means. Not only has South Africa continued to defy the will of the international community over Namibia  but it continues to use that Territory to commit repeated aggression against neighbouring African States  killing and maiming thousands of defenceless refugees and engaging in the wanton destruction of property.12.	The responsibility of the United Nations is clear: it  in its turn  must answer the challenge of South Africa. The United Nations must reaffirm and demonstrate increased support for the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the sole and legitimate representative of the people of Namibia  which is committed to ending South African occupation. Secondly  the United Nations now must impose sanctions against South Africa under Chapter VII of the Charter. Censure  in the circumstances  is not enough; it is in fact the same as condonation.13.	In South Africa itself the regime's enforcement of the policy of apartheid has become more vicious as it receives and develops more weapons of oppression against the majority African people. More Western investment flows into the country to provide the economic buttress of apartheid and the vilest system of oppression of man by man. Once again the United Nations must institute effective measures  including sanctions  to force South Africa to abandon apartheid. To stretch the Organization's tolerance further will do great damage to its credibility.14.	During its thirty-third session  the General Assembly affirmed the inalienable right of the Saharan people to self-determination and independence  I want to seize this opportunity sincerely to commend the Government of the brotherly Republic of Mauritania for the great statesmanship it has displayed in dealing with the problem of Western Sahara. The decision of the Mauritanian Government to withdraw from Western Sahara should be saluted by all people of good will. The people of Western Sahara  like any other people  have the right to self-determination. My Government has always given unqualified support to the Saharan people through their authentic representatives  the Frente POLISARIO  in their struggle against colonial occupation.15.	We recall that Morocco once laid claim to the whole of Mauritania as part of its territory  refusing to recognize Mauritania's independence. But in the end it had to give up that claim. We hope that sooner  rather than later  Morocco will be persuaded to accept the right of the people of Western Sahara to self- determination and national independence.16.	We are at the end of the Disarmament Decade  as well as the Second United Nations Development Decade. The General Assembly resolutions which declared the Disarmament Decade envisaged a relationship between disarmament and development  anticipating that resources saved from the arms industry would be diverted to social and economic development for the benefit of the population of the world. Today this objective has not been achieved. Considerable human and material resources are tied up in armament programmes  to the detriment of development  particularly for the third world.17.	Only limited measures have been achieved in dis-armament  from the 1963 test ban Treaty to the current agreements reached within the framework of the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT]. And sometimes one is constrained to wonder if these treaties do not set the rules for spurring the arms race  rather than stopping it. Nevertheless  they do give some encouragement  because they are a pointer to the fact that the will to negotiate  to reach a broad level of disarmament  is not lacking.18.	The developing countries have a vital interest in disarmament. They must be concerned about the ever-growing military complexes in the powerful countries in this world. Power rivalries have a habit of spilling over into the third world  causing local wars  tension between small and poor nations  and the continual diversion of scarce human and material resources to national defence. Therefore  the arms race among the big Powers contributes to world-wide inflation and increased poverty in the third-world countries and militates against co-operation for development among them. My delegation therefore supports and renews the call for general and complete disarmament under international supervision.19.	As one of the littoral States of the Indian Ocean  my country notes with great concern that over the past few years great-Power military presence has greatly increased there. We call for greater co-operation from the great Powers and the major maritime users of that ocean in the efforts and negotiations aimed at implementing the 1971 United Nations Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.20.	The Cyprus stalemate persists  at the cost of great human suffering. We urge the parties concerned to give momentum to the initiative taken earlier this year by our Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  so that apolitical settlement may be achieved  based on the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non- alignment of the Republic of Cyprus.21.	In the Middle East peace remains as elusive as it was at the time of our last session. My delegation believes and supports the view that peace cannot obtain in this region while two gross injustices are allowed to continue and to become entrenched. One is the denial to the Palestinian people of the right to a homeland and State of its own; the other is the occupation by Israel of Egyptian  Syrian and Jordanian land. We support the right of the Palestinian people  led by the Palestinian Liberation Organization  to have a State of their own; we support the right of Egypt  Syria and Jordan to use all appropriate means to recover their territory; and we energetically condemn Israel's murderous military attacks on Lebanon.22.	To come nearer our own country: we consider that the island of Mayotte is part of the Republic of the Comoros and support that country's aspiration to maintain its political unity and territorial integrity.23.	My delegation notes that Korea remains divided. We appreciate the Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification. We hope that this goal will be achieved  without foreign interference  on the basis of independence  peaceful reunification and a greater national unity.24.	Mr. President  we would like to echo the ringing appeal you made in your inaugural address on the plight of refugees around the world. Refugees represent a global humanitarian problem which demands the attention of this Organization. In Africa alone we have more than 4 million refugees  who have to find resettlement in other African countries  which already find it difficult to maintain a decent standard of living for their own populations. It will be seen that the world has so far paid only scant attention  in terms of the input of resources  to resettling African refugees  some of whom are victims of oppression and of the suppression which is visited upon them by the minority racist regimes in southern Africa. We therefore support the creation of a special fund for refugees and commend all steps now being taken to alleviate the human tragedy that is taking place in South-East Asia. We hope that  as a result of the lessons of this tragedy  equal attention will be paid now and in the future to the problems of refugees in other parts of the world.25.	The world economy is in the throes of the most severe crisis in history. Inflation  unemployment  currency fluctuations and instability in the international commodity trade have now become commonplace.26.	The impact of this crisis is being felt by all peoples and all nations. The developing countries  however  whose economies are much weaker and more vulnerable to the influence of external conditions  have been hardest hit. Thus for many developing countries the world economic crisis has led to the deterioration of their terms of trade  the aggravation of their already severe balance-of-payments difficulties  heavier debt problems and the erosion of their meagre savings which could have been used to finance development programmes for people already living below the poverty line.27.	Some developed countries  individually and collectively  have over the past few years adopted and implemented some measures aimed at insulating them from the impact of the world economic crisis. These measures have not only failed  but they have also aggravated the economic problems of the developing countries which have had to bear the cost of the adjustment measures adopted by those developed countries. For example  we have seen the proliferation of protectionist measures adopted by certain developed countries which then apply them to the imports of both primary and processed goods from the developing countries. These measures have produced serious constraints on both the agricultural and industrial development efforts of the developing countries and have led to further deterioration in their terms of trade.28.	The failure of these isolated  self-seeking and piecemeal measures confirms our conviction that the economic problems which continue to haunt the world stem largely from the incompatibility between the existing international economic system designed for the colonial era  and the new realities of today's world of interdependence. These are not problems of a mere cyclical nature; they are clearly rather of a structural nature. Mankind can only be rescued from further economic disruption and political conflict through the fundamental restructuring of economic relations among nations and the establishment of a new equitable international economic order.29.	Unfortunately movement in this direction is not spirited and there are those who think that time is an unfailing catalyst of economic regeneration. In the ongoing negotiations for the establishment of a New International Economic Order  too much time has been spent in restating the problems and too few concrete decisions have been taken. This gap between words and deeds is a manifestation of the Tack of political will in some developed countries.30.	At the fifth session of UNCTAD in Manila a new programme of action for the least developed countries was launched but  sadly  agreement could not be reached on some of the major issues which constitute the foundation upon which the programme could be successfully built. These include market access for the manufactured goods of developing countries  reform of the international monetary system  the establishment of a compensatory financing facility to meet shortfalls in the export earnings the developing countries derive from commodities and automaticity in aid disbursement. The refusal of some developed countries to pledge contributions to the ""second window' or the common fund of the Integrated Programme for Commodities is one more indication of this lack of political will.31.	We are therefore approaching the end of the Second United Nations Development Decade with no room for complacency. With a full load of resolutions by this Assembly and other United Nations organs largely unimplemented  the backlog of action that will be carried over to the third development decade is extremely heavy. Nations and Governments should be required to renew their dedication and commitment  but above all there will be a need for the political will to translate the various decisions into a time-table of concrete action. My delegation wishes to express the hope that the third development decade will be more dynamic and that greater political commitment will emerge among Member States in the search for a more balanced world economy and greater prospects for real development in poor countries.32.	Both at the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77  held at Arusha from 6 to 16 February this year  and at the recently concluded Conference of non- aligned countries   co-operation among developing countries within the framework of national and collective self-reliance was strongly emphasized. We urge both the United Nations development system and the developed countries to give full support and assistance to the developing countries  so that they may strengthen and expand their mutual co-operation.33.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is a decisive test of the spirit of meaningful dialogue between the North and the South. Sea-bed resources declared to be the common heritage of mankind by this Assembly touch the very core of world peace and equity. The joint management of sea-bed resources should have as its primary objective the promotion of equal opportunity to acquire sea wealth and should be seen to have the effect of redistributing global wealth. The progress made thus far at the negotiations in Geneva and in particular the unanimity reached in establishing an international sea-bed authority should give all of us cause for satisfaction  despite the crucial operational details that still remain outstanding. We also trust that the Conference will respect the August 1980 deadline for concluding the negotiations.34.	The year 1979 is the International Year of the Child  and it is now resolutely drawing to a close. I wish to commend all the Member States which have striven to make the year a success. I wish also to commend UNICEF  which was given the onerous but joyful responsibility of focusing upon and promoting the welfare of children. It is my hope that member nations will increase their contributions to UNICEF  so that the interest in and concern for the rights of the child  so widely generated in this Year  may be promulgated by permanent programmes for the development of the child. If we are to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war as the Charter enjoins us  we cannot do better than invest in our youth.35.	We are on the threshold of a new decade. We may appraise the past decade differently. Some may see in it a neap of thwarted ambitions; others may see a pit of unrealistic expectations and demands. But on one thing we can agree. We can agree that this has been a decade of dialogue  a momentous dialogue  about how we should shape our world anew so that all its people can live in plenty and in peace; so that all its nations can survive and thrive in equality  freedom and friendship. Let us then proceed to agree that we shall make this coming decade a decade of action to promote these goals of progress and prosperity  in the spirit of the United Nations."
"133",7091,"UGA",34,1979,"ï»¿It gives me tremendous pleasure and pride to convey to you  Sir  in the name of the Uganda National Liberation Front and on behalf of the entire people of Uganda  our warmest congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly.

Mr. Waldheim has done his utmost to find solutions to otherwise intractable problems and to instil a sense of direction and commitment in this Organization."" .. .respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion..5.	May I also take this opportunity to pay a tribute to President Agostinho Neto of the People's Republic of Angola. The untimely death of that outstanding revolutionary is a great loss to us all. The people of Angola have lost an illustrious and dedicated leader  Africa has lost a valiant freedom fighter  and the world has lost a most able statesman. Although President Neto is not in our midst now  his indomitable spirit marches on and will continue to be a source of strength and inspiration to many of us.6.	Let me take this opportunity to welcome to the family of nations the newest Member of this Organization  Saint Lucia. We look forward to working together for the realization of a more just and peaceful world.7.	This is no ordinary occasion for the people of Uganda. This session of the General Assembly holds special significance for us. As representatives are aware  the people of Uganda have just emerged from a most harrowing nightmare. We have just broken free from the yoke of one of the most vicious dictatorships of modern times. For the first time in eight years we are able to raise our voice in the community of nations as a free people.8.	Under the Amin dictatorship our people suffered untold indignities  torture and death. At least half a million people were murdered in cold blood. However  the purpose of my address today is not to catalogue the atrocities of the Amin regime.9.	Let me  however  touch briefly on the attitude of the United Nations with regard to events in Uganda during that period. In our struggle against the Fascist dictatorship we were inspired by the commitment of the international community to human rights. That commitment is clearly set out in the Charter of this Organization. The Preamble of the Charter reaffirms the faith of the peoples of the world"" .. .in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small10.	Among the purposes and principles of the United Nations set out in Article 1 of the Charter is the promotion and encouragement of11.	Again  in Article 55 of the Charter it is stated that the United Nations shall promote"" .. .universal respect for  and observance of  human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinctions as to race  sex  language  or religion.ââ12.	In the light of the clear commitment set out in those provisions of the Charter  our people naturally looked to the United Nations for solidarity and support in their struggle against the Fascist dictatorship. For eight years they cried out in the wilderness for help; unfortunately  their cries seemed to have fallen on deaf ears.13.	The United Nations looked on with embarrassed silence as the Uganda tragedy unfolded. Meanwhile  the Amin regime continued with impunity to commit genocide against our people. We would be less than honest if we did not say openly and clearly that the people of Uganda were deeply disappointed by the silence of this Organization at the time of their greatest need.14.	The Uganda situation is merely one example of a very serious global problem involving extensive violations of human rights. The increasing number of refugees and displaced persons is sufficient testimony to the gravity of the situation. Yet  somehow  it is thought to be in bad taste or contrary to diplomatic etiquette to raise matters of violations of human rights by Member States within the forums of the United Nations.15.	For how long will the United Nations remain silent while Governments represented within this Organization continue to perpetrate atrocities against their own people? Governments come and go  but the peoples of the world remain a permanent constituency of the United Nations. It was for the well-being of the peoples of the world that the United Nations was founded in the first instance. Indeed  it is for their welfare that the United Nations must continue to work. It would be unfortunate if this Organization were reduced to a club of governments afraid to speak out boldly for the rights of the citizens of the world.16.	I find it difficult to embrace the view that matters concerning human rights lie exclusively within the domain of the domestic jurisdiction of the States concerned. Such a view renders meaningless the human rights provisions of the Charter of this Organization. A careful study of the despotic regimes around the world would  moreover  show that many of these regimes are brought to power at the instigation of external forces. They are maintained in power by the military and financial assistance provided by their external sponsors in spite of internal opposition. Without external collaboration  it would be impossible for these regimes to sustain their stranglehold on the local people. If the process of internal oppression is linked to external elaboration  how can its undoing be purely a matter of domestic concern?17.	We are convinced that the United Nations must become a more effective force for the promotion and enforcement of human rights all over the world. It is for this reason that Uganda supports  among other measures  the proposal now under discussion for the creation of an office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.18.	In this connexion  I must pay a particular tribute to the non-governmental organizations that continue against all odds to speak out for human rights. The people of Uganda are especially grateful to the International Commission of Jurists  Amnesty International and the All Africa Conference of Churches for their support during the struggle against the Fascist dictatorship.19.	I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the peoples of Nicaragua and Equatorial Guinea on successfully dislodging the dictatorships that had oppressed their peoples for so long. We hope that this is the beginning of a world-wide trend of vigilance against despotic regimes.20.	So far I have spoken about the despotism of governments against their own citizens. The Uganda National Liberation Front is also most concerned about those peoples of the world who continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination.21.	At the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries in Lusaka in August  Uganda welcomed and supported the proposal for an all-party conference on Zimbabwe. That conference is currently taking place in London. We are awaiting its results most anxiously. This is the last chance for the United Kingdom to discharge its responsibility for Zimbabwe. We therefore hope that the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference will produce an acceptable arrangement for the peoples of Zimbabwe that will lead to genuine and peaceful majority rule. Should the Conference fail to produce an acceptable arrangement for the peoples of Zimbabwe  then Uganda will have no alternative but to intensify its support for the Patriotic Front in its armed struggle against minority domination.22.	Uganda deplores the continued violation of the territorial integrity of Mozambique and Zambia by die puppet regime in Salisbury. We deplore the barbarous and cowardly massacres of innocent Zimbabwean women and children in the refugee camps.23.	The racist regime of South Africa continues to defy the will of the international community on the question of Namibia. It is tightening its grip on the Territory by refusing to withdraw its military and police personnel from Namibia  by attempting to annex Walvis Bay and by resisting any steps aimed at granting independence to the people of Namibia. Instead  South Africa is trying to impose an internal settlement calculated to entrench the Turnhalle Alliance and create a puppet regime in Namibia  which excludes the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  the sole and authentic representative of the people of Namibia. Uganda pledges its total support for SWAPO and calls upon all peace-loving peoples of the world to ensure that Namibia's territorial integrity and independence is protected.24.	The question of South Africa and the racist policy of apartheid remains an issue of great concern to the people of Uganda. We urge the Western countries to withdraw their colossal investments in South Africa. We support the international calls for economic sanctions against the racist regime. We deplore the continued collaboration between South Africa  on the one hand  and Israel and several Western countries  on the other  especially in the area of nuclear research and weapons technology.25.	The Uganda National Liberation Front fully supports the struggle of the people of Western Sahara for self-determination and national independence under the leadership of the Frente POLISARIO. Uganda has therefore extended recognition to the Government of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic as the sole and legitimate representative of the peoples of Western Sahara. We once again call upon Morocco to renounce any claims over Saharan territory and withdraw its troops of occupation. In this regard we should like to congratulate Mauritania for its courageous decision to withdraw its troops from Saharan territory and for recognizing the legitimate rights of the Saharan people. We are confident that it will not be long before the free voice of the Saharan people will be heard in this Assembly.26.	The Uganda National Liberation Front recognizes the right of the people of East Timor to self- determination and national independence. We deplore any unholy alliance and machinations designed to frustrate the fulfilment of the legitimate rights of the people of East Timor.27.	The people of Uganda are very concerned over the situation in the Middle East. It is obvious that at the heart of the Middle East problem is the Palestinian question. Any serious proposal for peace must begin with recognition of this reality. We recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and national independence in a homeland of their own. We recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.28.	Another major area of concern for the Uganda National Liberation Front is the current international economic situation. The state of the world economy has today reached crisis proportions. This crisis stems in part from the deterioration in the terms of trade  the introduction of protectionist measures by the developed countries  runaway inflation and recession in the developed countries  monetary instability  the failure by most developed countries to meet the agreed target for official development assistance and  generally  the lack of political will on the part of the developed countries to implement the decisions of the international community regarding the establishment of the new international economic order.29.	The crisis has had its severest effects on the developing countries and particularly the least developed among them. The failure on the part of the international community to bridge the gap between North and South  and indeed the widening of that gap  is a matter which the international community must address itself and find urgent solutions to  because  in the final analysis  the ultimate guarantee for international peace and security is the economic well-being of all nations. In an interdependent world  lack of development or economic stagnation anywhere affects economic advancement everywhere.30.	The disappointing outcome of the fifth session of UNCTAD does not augur well for the ongoing North- South negotiations. In spite of the present stalemate in negotiations in various international forums  Uganda firmly believes that it is still possible for the developed and the developing countries to engage in meaningful dialogue based on the principles and objectives of the new international economic order  which were adopted by consensus at the sixth special session of the General Assembly. In this regard it is necessary for the international community to adopt fundamental structural changes in international economic relations and in the international monetary and financial institutions in order to ensure effective participation by all countries  including the developing countries  on the basis of equality in the decision-making process.31.	Economic and technical co-operation among developing countries is  in our view  an important means of achieving the rapid development of the developing countries  and we fully subscribe to the strengthening of collective self-reliance among developing countries.32.	What is required above all is political will on the part of all countries  particularly the developed countries  to resolve the pressing economic and social problems that confront the world  The developing countries have demonstrated their readiness and political will for genuine and action-oriented dialogue with the developed countries  and it is our sincere hope that this will be reciprocated.33.	Unless these inequalities are corrected  they will remain a potent source of international conflict and strife.34.	Finally  I wish to return briefly to the situation existing in Uganda today. It is important for the international community to appreciate the magnitude of the problems that the Government of the Uganda National Liberation Front is called upon to solve before our country can return to even a semblance of normal life.35.	For eight long years our country was subjected to a level of plunder and destruction unprecedented in the recent past.36.	The agricultural sector  which constitutes the backbone of our economy  was adversely affected. Uganda's leading agricultural crops  such as coffee  cotton and tea  to mention only a few  were completely neglected. The fanners were not encouraged to grow these crops  and the little that reached the market was smuggled out of the country by Amin's soldiers. Coffee exports fell from 175 000 tons in 1970 to 80 000 tons in 1978  due to increased smuggling by Amin's soldiers and coffee being left unattended. Cottonâonce a major foreign-exchange earnerâvirtually collapsed as production fell from 450 000 bales in 1970 to 60 000 bales in 1977 and 1978. Tea and sugar production fell from 18 000 tons to 11 000 and from 144 000 tons to 12 000  respectively  during the same period.37.	It was not only agriculture which suffered from the economic chaos of the Amin era  but also industry. The manufacturing sector was equally affected  as funds earmarked for the importation of raw materials were diverted to purchase military hardware and consumer goods for the army. Production in the textile industry fell from 55 000 metres in 1970 to 3 300 metres in 1978; cement production fell from 191 000 tons to 73 000 tons in 1978; copper production fell from 17 000 tons to 2 000 tons in 1976  when production came to a complete halt.38.	Financial institutions were forced under coercion to extend credit facilities to Amin's henchmen without any regard to their credit-worthiness. As a result such people defaulted and the financial institutions were forced to write off the loans as bad debts.39.	Instead of adopting rational fiscal policies  Amin's regime resorted to printing more money. We inherited an economy with a very high rate of inflation. Government borrowing from financial institutions increased from 35 per cent in December 1970  to 72 per cent in March 1979.40.	The tourist industry  which used to be the second biggest foreign-exchange earner  came to a complete halt. The transport and communications sector was disrupted to the extent that the ordinary farmer was unable to transport his produce to the buying centres. The few commodities that reached the villages were sold at such inflated prices that only a small section of the population could afford them.41.	The war of liberation also took its toll. There were the usual consequences of any war: the destruction of life  property  buildings and installations  and plant and machinery  Indeed two of our cities are literally in ruins and the rest are in various states of disrepair.42.	Apart from the physical destruction  Uganda has been facing security problems. As Amin's army disintegrated  the soldiers discarded their uniforms and arms  seized public and private vehicles and fled across our borders.43.	Like every society  Uganda has its share of criminal elements  and these flourished under Amin's dictatorship. These elements lost no time in seizing the discarded uniforms and arms  and some of them even looted armouries in and around the capital  Kampala  as Amin's henchmen fled in disarray. This has contributed enormously to lawlessness  especially in the Kampala area.44.	Amin's Government and everything associated with it was hated intensely by the local population. One consequence of this hatred was that  as the liberation forces entered Kampala  the civilian population went on a spree of looting shops  government and private houses  and offices. Within a few days all shops in Kampala were empty and in need of extensive repair.45.	The Government has been doing everything possible to contain the security situation in the country. We have been struggling to contain the wave of crime and political murders perpetrated by the remnants of Amin's hated secret police  which used to be known as the State Research Bureau  and his murder squads  called the Public Safety Unit  and by the remnants of his huge army  who have vanished  armed to the teeth  among the local population. They frequently surface in gangs to terrorize and murder the local people.46.	The Uganda National Liberation Front Government finds itself caught up in a vicious circle. The expectations of our people since liberation have naturally been very high; failure to meet at least the most basic of their needs  such as those for salt  soap  clothing and medicines  will create greater political problems; greater political problems will hamper our efforts to rebuild the economy; yet without a functioning economy we cannot meet the most basic needs of our people  and therein lies the vicious circle.47.	We need the help of the international community to break this vicious circle. Our appeal is not without precedent in recent history. When Europe lay prostrate at the end of the Second World War  the Marshall Plan was instituted to achieve for Europe -what our country is desperately in need of today  namely  economic recovery. We do not ask for anything of the magnitude of the Marshall Plan. We are only asking for basic requirements to get us on our feet again.48.	Uganda is a rich and fertile land; our country is blessed with a glorious climate; we have a very talented people. However  we need financial  material and other forms of assistance from the international community in order to mobilize these resources into a force for national reconstruction and rehabilitation. We earnestly hope that the community of nations will help us to resurrect the promises of our land and rekindle the hopes of our people."
"134",7136,"UKR",34,1979,"ï»¿Permit me  on behalf of my delegation  to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly and to wish you success in your important work. We welcome the people of the State of Saint Lucia  which has become a new Member of the United Nations.114.	The delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic wishes to express its profound condolences to the delegation of the People's Republic of Angola and the Angolan people on the untimely death of their President  an outstanding leader of the African national liberation movement  Agostinho Neto. We wish to express our profound sorrow and condolences to the delegation and people of fraternal socialist Czechoslovakia on the passing away of the former President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  Ludvik Svoboda. Our people  who are now celebrating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the liberation of the Soviet Ukraine from Hitlerite invaders  will never forget that Czechoslovak forces  under the command of General Svoboda  took an active part in the liberation of our Republic from the Fascist occupiers.115.	The decade of the 1970s will no doubt go down in history as a time when the peoples of the world intensified their struggle for peace and relaxation of international tension. It is precisely during these years that detente has become the dominant international trend and has made it possible to avert the threat of a deadly war  thus serving the interests of the whole of mankind. Legal  moral and political barriers are being built and strengthened to thwart those who relish military adventure. The first steps have been taken to limit the arms race. A major step to curb the arms race was the signing in Vienna by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  the President of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR  Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  and Mr. Jimmy Carter  the President of the United States of America  of the Soviet-American Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. When ratified and fully implemented it will undoubtedly be a solid barrier to the unrestrained build-up of nuclear arsenals and will facilitate movement towards genuine disarmament.116.	The movement towards detente which has marked the decade about to close has not materialized by itself. It has been a result of the efforts of socialist countries and other peace-loving States and peoples of the whole world. Further progress towards this goal will require considerable effort and perseverance.117.	Today as never before  durable peace and security depend on the total cessation of the policy of violence and intervention in the internal affairs of States  a policy which is pursued internationally by certain states. That policy is carried out in obedience to various slogans  but its essence is the same: the claim to hegemony over other States or groups of States and the desire to gain a dominant position either in the world at large or in one of its regions. The policy of diktat and threats  the establishment of spheres or zones of influence has more than once brought the world to the brink of war and  indeed  has plunged it into the abyss of military catastrophe. Nobody has forgotten the hegemonism underlying the bloodthirsty policies of Hitlerite fascism  which unleashed the Second World War. The demonic Fuhrer coveted many lands  including the lands of the Ukraine  which he intended to turn into a colony settled by representatives of the ""master race''. While celebrating the thirty-fifth anniversary of the liberation of the Ukraine from the Fascist invaders  we recall that our people  together with all the fraternal Soviet peoples  were forced to sacrifice the lives of millions of our sons and daughters in order finally to crush the hegemonistic ambitions and designs of the Hitlerites.118.	History has demonstrated convincingly that hegemonism is repugnant in all its forms and manifestations. It is particularly dangerous in our time when those who pursue a policy of hegemonism possess  or can acquire  nuclear weapons. That is why the policy of hegemonism should be condemned by the United Nations in strongest terms and the world community is in duty bound not to permit any attempts to pursue it.119.	We categorically support the important and timely proposal of the Soviet Union  introduced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR  Mr. Gromyko  for the inclusion in the agenda of this session of an item entitled' 'Inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"". We are confident that the new proposal of the USSR will have the broad support of peoples and States which are interested in the consolidation of the principle of sovereign equality in inter-State relations.120.	Durable peace  the security of nations and the development of peaceful and equal co-operation among themâthat is the key to the foreign policy of the socialist countries. At the same time  one cannot overlook the forces which are at work in the world stubbornly trying to undermine detente  to threaten international security and to intensify the atmosphere of fear and hostility. To this end they trot out the stale political slogans of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism. Facts convincingly show that anti-communism and anti-Sovietism have always been and will always be the rallying cry for the most reactionary forces. As the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine  Mr. Shcherbitsky  stressed: ""Anti-communism is not only the most bitter foe of progress  but it is out of date historically  and is ideologically and politically bankrupt""..121.	The myth of the so-called Soviet military threat is by no means the least of the weapons in the political arsenal of anti-communism. It has been used on more than one occasion in the past and it is being used again to obstruct the efforts of peoples working for the cessation of the arms race and for disarmament. We are convinced that that myth will be recognized as the greatest lie of the twentieth century. But it still flourishes wherever capital holds sway  wherever the rights of the working people are trampled upon and wherever all means are employed to intimidate the people of the country concerned with an alleged threat of aggression from without. Meanwhile  vast mountains of weapons are piling up and that is the real threat to peace in the world. That threat is all the more dangerous  because in some countries war propaganda is still openly disseminated and plans for pre-emptive nuclear strikes against certain countries are proclaimed. All this misanthropic propaganda is camouflaged by the fabrications of a so-called Soviet military threat.122.	The Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community have never threatened anybody and will never threaten anybody. As Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev said:""We are motivated by one idea: to preserve and strengthen peace  to enable the peoples of the world to devote themselves exclusively to and to concentrate all their efforts and resources on productive ends.""A concrete and tangible rebuttal of the slander has been the consistent struggle of socialist countries for curbing the arms race and for disarmament.123.	The policy of limiting the nuclear arms race is the corner-stone of all efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the struggle for international security and disarmament. Of special significance is their joint proposal on the termination of the production of all types of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of stockpiles to the point of total elimination. Of course  it would be unrealistic to expect that all nuclear weapons could be eliminated at once. It would be plainly impossible. A responsible approach suggests that appropriate measures of nuclear disarmament should be carried out with the participation of all nuclear States  stage by stage  in a specific order and according to a mutually acceptable time-table.124.	The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR believes that as soon as possible we must embark on preparatory consultations and talks on the termination of the production of nuclear weapons and the gradual reduction of stockpiles of such weapons  to the point of their complete elimination. In our opinion  the efforts of this session of the General Assembly should focus on that objective.125.	We believe that the elimination of nuclear weapons should be accompanied by political and international legal measures to ensure die security of all States. Of particular significance in this connexion would be an early conclusion of the world treaty on the non-use of force in international relations.126.	As is already known  talks are now in progress on a number of problems of disarmament and international security.127.	A certain degree of agreement has been reached between the USSR  the United States and the United Kingdom on complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon testing. In the opinion of our delegation the General Assembly should support an early conclusion of a treaty on complete and general prohibition of nuclear-weapon testing.128.	Recently the USSR and the United States submitted a draft containing the main elements of a treaty on the prohibition of development  manufacture  stockpiling and use of radiological weapons  which are a new type of mass destruction weapons. Measures should be taken to draft such a treaty and bring it into force at the earliest possible date to join existing agreements on limiting the arms race. At the same time we feel that the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty on that question will be the most effective way to prevent the emergence of new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction.129.	The purposes of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons are served by the proposals of the Soviet Union and a number of other countries for the conclusion of an international convention on the strengthening of guarantees for the security of non-nuclear-weapon States. We would point out that the idea that these guarantees should be embodied in an international document has formed the basis for talks on this subject in the Committee on Disarmament. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR believes that at the present time work on this convention could well be accelerated.130.	We also believe that it would be important to embody in an international agreement the obligations of both nuclear and non-nuclear States not to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of those countries where they do not exist at present. We hope for a constructive exchange of views on this subject at this session.131.	The world community has been demonstrating active interest in the early prohibition of chemical weapons. Talks on this subject are under way  but they should be expedited.132.	A world disarmament conference could lend powerful momentum to intensifying the efforts of States in bringing about disarmament. It would enable all States to participate on an equal basis in the taking of effective decisions on the whole range of problems associated with disarmament.133.	I shall now speak briefly about another problem connected with disarmament  namely  halting the unproductive expenditure of labour and material resources on the arms race. The dimensions of this expenditure are eloquently demonstrated by the data contained in the most recent report of the Secretary- General of the United Nations on the economic and social consequences of the arms race and military expenditures. According to that report  over the last five years world expenditures for military purposes have exceeded $US 1.8 trillion. It should be stressed in this regard how immediate is the problem of reducing military expenditures  a problem which has been repeatedly raised by the socialist countries.134.	We have on the conference table quite a few constructive proposals for the limitation of the arms race and for disarmament. We understand that to put these proposals into effect is no simple matter. We need for that purpose first of all a demonstration of political will and action in the spirit of co-operation in the search for mutually acceptable decisions. That is why the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic supports the proposal of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic for the ""Adoption of a declaration on international cooperation for disarmament"". Strict observance of the principles contained therein would undoubtedly yield appreciable results and facilitate the achievement of progress in talks on real disarmament.135.	International peace and security would be a hundred times more stable today if all States were to bring their policies into line with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. However  even now in various parts of the world the imperialists and their henchmen  the opponents of peace and detente  are tireless in their efforts to preserve hotbeds of tension  and even to create new ones.136.	Thus  the situation in the Middle East remains as explosive as ever. The path of one-sided concessions to Israel and separate deals has not led  and cannot lead  to the establishment of lasting peace in that area. It is clear that the United Nations cannot possibly associate itself with an approach of that character. In accordance with its fundamental resolutions  a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East is possible only on the basis of the inadmissibility of the seizure of territory by means of aggression  the total withdrawal of Israeli troops from all Arab lands occupied in 1967; the exercise in practice of the inalienable rights of the Arab people of Palestine  including their right to self- determination and the establishment of their own independent State; and the ensuring of the right of all States in the Middle East to a secure and independent existence and development. The separate treaty between Egypt and Israel has led only to a further intensification of the aggressiveness of Israel against the Arab countries and peoples  and primarily against Lebanon and the Arab people of Palestine.137.	So far there has been no real progress towards the normalization of the situation in Cyprus. Such a course of events is obviously advantageous to those who are attempting to use Cyprus as a strategic staging area in the Mediterranean. The United Nations should play a decisive role in bringing about a settlement in the island and in ensuring the preservation of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.138.	Like other delegations  we whole-heartedly support the desire of the Korean people and the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to bring about the democratic reunification of the country and we are firmly in favour of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the southern part of the peninsula.139.	The situation in South-East Asia has become exceedingly complex in connexion with the recent aggression by China against the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the continuing threats of the Chinese leaders once again to take up arms ""to teach"" someone ""a lesson"".140.	The denouement of that aggression is well known. The heroic Vietnamese people  who for more than 30 years waged a self-sacrificing and arduous national liberation war  and won it  has firmly rebuffed the Chinese hegemonists as well. But now the aggressors and their accomplices are whipping up an anti-Viet Nam campaign in order to achieve what they were unable to obtain by means of aggression.141.	They were infuriated by the victories of the Kampuchean people over the criminal and inhuman regime of Pol Pot. However  in spite of all that  the People's Republic of Kampuchea will confidently move along the path of progress. We are convinced that the time is not far off when the lawful representatives of the Kampuchean people will come to take their rightful seats in this hall.142.	The position of those who are attempting to use the problem of the Indo-Chinese refugees for political ends against socialist Viet Nam is an outrage. However  these people are stubborn in their silence about the fate of millions of people who have fallen victims to the policy of aggression  diktat  apartheid  racial discrimination  foreign domination and occupation in South-East Asia itself  in the Middle East  in southern Africa and in long-suffering Chile.143.	Of course  one can scarcely expect the defence of human rights from those very people who trample them underfoot every day in pursuing a policy which has led to the massive and flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms  including the right to life. They have  at the same time  shamelessly distorted the truth about the development of true democracy in the socialist countries. The so-called ""champions"" of human rights interfere in the internal affairs of States and work against international detente. At the same time  they are attempting to consolidate and use for their own purposes all kinds of emigrant organizationsâa motley assortment of renegades and outcasts from their homes who have dug themselves in in the backyards of certain capitalist countries.144.	But all the attempts of the enemies of socialism as well as the attempts of those who so generously finance their provocative activities are doomed to failure. Attempts to exert pressure on the peoples of the socialist countries  including the Ukrainian people  are nothing new. They have not prevented the countries of socialism from achieving success in their work of peaceful construction and in defending their independence. They are not hindering our advances towards social progress even today.145.	Social progress depends  of course  on many factors  including the state of the world economy and international economic relations. The world has come up against the most profound and protracted crisis of capitalism which affects the whole system. Although the capitalist countries  and primarily their working classes  have suffered serious harm from the crisis  the main brunt has been borne by the developing countries.146.	It goes without saying that the responsibility of the developed capitalist Powers for the economic difficulties of the developing countries by no means comes to an end or expires with the end of the colonial period. The developing countries are still suffering from inequalities and exploitation within the capitalist system. Therefore  they are suffering worse from its endemic diseases than is anybody else. This has led to an intensification of inequality within the framework of ""interdependence"" which is being so vigorously preached recently at international conferences.147.	As a spearhead of neo-colonialism  there have emerged major monopolistic groupings. The transnational corporations have created their own ""economic order''. The borders of their economic empires overlap the frontiers of sovereign States. These corporations create a breach between manufacturers and consumers and use this fact to engage in widespread exploitation. The transnational corporations are receiving from the young States ever-growing profits  which far exceed the initial investment capital  are limiting the transfer to those States of the latest technology and are interfering in the internal affairs of these States.148.	To the accompaniment of hypocritical utterances by Governments purporting to condemn colonialism and racism  the Western monopolies are continuing to expand co-operation with the reactionary colonial and racist regimes in southern Africa. Fed by international monopolistic capital  they are its bulwark in southern Africa and its main political and ideological force.149.	One can say with the utmost confidence that the elimination of the remnants of the shameful system of colonialism and racism in Africa has entered its final phase. The powerful blows struck by the national liberation movements in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa are bringing closer the day when the racist regimes will be finally swept off the face of Africa. Nobody can possibly be convinced by the cosmetic means which the racist Government of the Republic of South Africa is attempting to use to beautify the ugly face of apartheid  or the farce which has been perpetrated in Zimbabwe with the creation of a puppet Government. The criminal practice of apartheid has not changed. In Zimbabwe we are witnessing a continuation of the cruel war against the African patriots. Piratical attacks on neighbouring States not only have failed to cease but have become ever more frequent.150.	The Ukrainian SSR is consistently in favour of the elimination of the racist regime in Zimbabwe and of the transfer of all power to the people as embodied by the Patriotic Front. We are in favour of the immediate and unreserved withdrawal of the Republic of South Africa from Namibia and of the transfer of power in that country to the South West Africa People's Organization. In common with other States  we believe that it is necessary to strengthen sanctions against the racist regime in Salisbury and to apply against the Republic of South Africa the full range of measures provided for in the United Nations Charter.â151.	The positive changes which have occurred in the world have led to the stepping up of the struggle of the people against imperialism and for independence and freedom. Afghanistan has chosen the non-capitalist course of development. The dictatorial regime in Nicaragua has collapsed  as has the Shah's regime in Iran. The world anti-imperialist movement has become ever stronger and has further consolidated itself as a result of an important international meeting  the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries in Havana. These and indeed other events are only in keeping with the logic of history and the interests of social progress and the interests of peoples. In this lies their vital force.152.	The 1970s have written a number of glorious pages in the history of the tireless struggle of the forces of progress for peace among peoples  for restraining aggression and for creating a sound foundation for universal security.153.	The United Nations has taken part in that process. It must continue to promote the elimination of war from the life of mankind. In this we see the main task of this session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  which should provide the world with a glorious and glowing prospect for the forthcoming 1980s."
"135",7183,"URY",34,1979,"ï»¿I should like to begin by congratulating Mr. Salim on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly  in which office  we are sure  he will act with the same skill as in the high offices he has held in his own country in the past.280.	We are pleased also to extend our congratulations and thanks for a job well done to the outgoing President  Mr. Indalecio Lievano.281.	We welcome the admission of Saint Lucia to the United Nations family and wish it well as a new Member of the Organization.282.	The major historical crises that mark stages of transition and announce world-wide change in the progress of humanity and wide ranging transformations in every sphere do not come about in a day. It is true that change and exchange of every kind are following more closely upon each other's heels today. But the processes involved none the less  of necessity  cover a long period. Hence  in coming together again in this world body  we are basically facing the same major difficulties as last year. Therefore  it is hard not to repeat the same or similar ideas. This does not bother us  because our job is not to be original but rather to be firm and constant in identifying and showing the consistency of the thinking and action of Uruguay in international affairs.283.	My country feels that the tremendous acceleration in every kind of exchange and the greater interdependency of peoples which gives the concept of mankind its real  concrete meaning and unity  with most important legal and political consequences  is such that today it is practically impossible for any people to live outside the international community  much less to develop and make progress  in isolation from the difficulties and problems of others.284.	'' Splendid isolation'' is no longer a shield or even a possibility. Interdependence has ceased to be a choice and  consequently  solidarity has become an imperative  as we said last year.  It is an idea which we wish to reaffirm and one which we shall not tire of repeating. We are deeply convinced that it is from this undeniable fact  seen as part of contemporary history  that is derived the fundamental role of peoples and nations which  while having no large economic or technical resources  no material potential for imposing decisions by force  are none the less rich in cultural and legal values.285.	Isolation is no longer a shield  we said. It seems clear  with no need for further demonstration  that not even the great Powers can allow themselves that luxury. To a great extent the future and peace of all peoples depend on their rivalry and antagonism or on their agreement and co-operation. But not even they have the option of a selfish turning inward  in indifference to the fate of the world. There will be no peace and no recovery for the international community as a whole unless the pressing problems of all its members  even the lesser among them  are resolved; unless there is a fair share for all in the riches of the world 286.	'In today's world  which has already become or. may become one single immense economic  technical  cultural circuit because of a system of communications which is more and more closely knit  no oneâand the small countries least of allâcan feel safe from political  social  economic or military hurricanes if they take the easy option of isolation. Only through constantly strengthening and consolidating the international legal order  following the guidelines traced by the great changes taking place throughout the worldâchanges that have promoted population growth and the amazing technological devolution of our timeâcan the problems  obstacles and challenges we are facing be met. Our era has been marked by particularly striking developments and has made an axiom of Terence's aphorism: ""I am a man  I count nothing human alien from me."" Nothing human can now be alien to us  whether we like it or not. Solidarity is no longer a choice but an imperative. It involves not only peace  but the survival of the human race for which  in the atomic era  peace is a necessary prerequisite.287.	In proclaiming these principles  my country is merely expressing once again its historical line of thought  the logical development of which leads us to maintain that the radical changes in the modem world determine a need for legal developments and the preparation of humanistic international law  based on solidarity.288.	The world crisis which we are witnessing calls for a supreme effort of the imagination and will in order to find world-wide solutions.289.	At the root of all contemporary problems lie the haphazard development of technology  the chaotic expansion of industry and the economy  the unequal and unfair distribution of the benefits of civilization among peoples  oversized urban agglomerations with their attendant tensions  and problems deriving from the lack of adjustment of a regulatory system that is still inadequate to meet the situation to a material reality that is slipping out of our grasp.290.	Among the critical aspects  one problem such as energy  because of its magnitude and its special characteristics  gives the clearest illustration of these ideas  since on the one hand it is highly representative of the exhaustion of natural resources while  on the other  it is typically an economic problem with deep- rooted social and political connotations.â291.	We firmly believe that the key to overcoming the current crisis lies in successfully regulating our conduct through laws appropriate to the new requirements of the contemporary world  an adjustment that necessarily implies reconciliation between man and nature. That move can only be achieved through untiring efforts to establish a new international economic order  through dialogue and mutual respect  and the equitable participation of all peoples in the production and use of the earth's resources.292.	As part of the world crisis we have mentioned  today habits of violence  hatred and cruelty are gradually gaining ground  becoming part of the political customs of all societies  both of those with a long tradition of institutional development and political maturity  and of those that recently emerged from the shadows of colonialism. This violence  this blind inhuman terrorism that usually prefers innocent victims  bears no relation to legitimate rebellion  which to some extent has promoted the institutional progress of peoples.293.	Terrorism has emerged and prospered also in societies governed by democratic institutions  where there is respect for individual liberties  civil rights and civic guarantees. These societies are not without their defects  errors and limitations  but at the same time they do offer means and machinery for improvement. Meanwhile  in those societies where systematic terror has been used  where every trace of freedom and free will has been banished  where the totalitarian State has abolished every advance so hardly won over centuries of humanism  paradoxically and symptomatically this problem does not arise.294.	In this tragedy  human rights are of necessity affected. It is very hard to defend institutions  the life and peace of citizens without violent situations arising which entail an incidental loss of law and abuses imputable to the more than natural failings of men and institutions.295.	I am referring in general to our Western societies because it would be very easy to show that similar situations have arisen in all of them lasting varying lengths of time and proving serious to a greater or lesser degree. And I am referring more particularly to my own country  wickedly caught by subversive acts of aggression  while a most legal regime is in full force.2%. My country cannot accept  because it would run counter to justice and law  that the defence of human rights should be systematically invoked against Governments of countries which have had to wage a hard and dearly-won battle against subversion and anarchy  while the trampling of those same rights or complete lack of them  as is the norm in other countries  is passed over in silence. These are calculated and censurable instances of discrimination which  in the final analysis  amount to active interference.297.	At this thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly  as at previous ones  Uruguay reaffirms its respect for law  including human rights. My country wants to see these more genuinely enforced throughout the world until they are a fact of life  something which is an impossible dream for millions of people who are still held down by totalitarianism today.298.	For this sentiment to be more than a mere expression of pious wishes  the international community will have to set up the proper legal machinery and impose concomitant attitudes in world public affairs so as to avoid the criminal practices which cast a shadow on the political struggle of our time  so that terrorism in all its pseudo-political forms can be fought. These are often confused with ordinary delinquency.299.	Uruguay has been part of the Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism set up by the Assembly to find solutions by arbitration  and we are disappointed at that Committee's failure. My country will support all collective measures put forward to combat this modern scourge  since we trust that these will cover every aspect and modality  and will take into account its real criminal etiology and its international character. Similarly  I reiterate support for General Assembly resolution 31/103 and say yet again that we are ready to sign a convention against the taking of hostages in so far as this meets the basic principles underlying our international calling.300.	We would like to see appropriate measures adopted to combat terrorism. We have submitted specific draft resolutions in this regard although we are aware of the difficulties of arriving at objective legal solutions. None the less it is to our satisfaction that two motions tabled by Uruguay have been adopted. One deals with the need for gathering sufficient statistical information about terrorist attacks at the world level  giving both the number and kind of victims and the material damage caused. The other is about the strengthening of measures to prevent access to various United Nations offices by terrorist elements. It is really regrettable that criminals should have the opportunity of hampering the process of drawing up international rules expressly designed to curb their crimes  with the tolerance of the very institution that seeks to condemn them and for which  in some instances  they serve as a source of information and advice.301.	Another topic of particular interest to my country is disarmament  which is not only important in itself as a practical outcome of the fundamental purpose to maintain peace  but also because undeniably it has environmental and economic connotations. Paradoxically  of late  particularly in the years of the Disarmament Decade  the arms race has become more intense than ever before. Without stopping to count the cost of unconventional weapons  the mind-boggling total of the arms trade alone is sufficient to explain the growing lack of transfer of resources to the developing countriesâa matter which we shall take up later.302.	My country has neither the size  the pretensions or the resources of a great Power  but nevertheless feels rightfully concerned at this frenetic arms race. Not only because of the recurrence of local wars or of the threat to world peace involved in the arms race  but because of the anomalous fact that  while we are witnessing the growth of serious social problems in various parts of the world  and we see with regret that funds essential to protect the environment or to promote the harmonious development of peoples are not forthcoming  astronomical sums  a tiny part of which would be enough to resolve many of these problems  are wasted on stockpiling huge arsenals  the use of which would mean mass suicide for mankind.303.	It is very saddening to see the great divide between reality and theory  between what is said and what is done. Disarmament is something which people have come apprehensively to regard as merely rhetorical. It is a game  a rarified dialectical diversion  and that is very serious.304.	We should like to reaffirm here our desire  and our conviction of the need to approach this problem realistically and with serious intent  and that is what we should like to see done. Partial compromises can be tried  and there can be categorical denunciation of any form of biological warfare which destroys or poisons ecological systems or alters the climate.305.	We are confident that those who have not already done so will soon accede to or ratify the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco). If the world cannot be rid of the atomic nightmare at a single stroke  at least regional agreements of this kind can help to achieve the same results through partial efforts and modest measures.306.	With regard to the deterioration of the environment  and the need for conservation to ensure survival of life on this planetâsomething I have already mentioned in a general wayâmy country unreservedly endorses the report of the Governing Council of UNEP which will be examined in detail in the Second Committee. Particularly important are the resolutions on land policy of which the Uruguayan delegation was a sponsor in Nairobi at the seventh session of the Governing Council of UNEPâthe resolution on tropical forest conservation and others directly relating to food production sources. My country  in any international gathering in which it has participated  has stressed the very highest priority and importance of a land policy which would ensure the conservation of existing land and the recovery  as far as possible  of land damaged by erosion due to bad farming methods and deforestation. The mere setting up of a World Food Council and a fund for the programme of action to eliminate hunger and malnutrition will have no substantial practical effect if the source of agricultural production deteriorates  as FAO has eloquently demonstrated.307.	This year was proclaimed the International Year of the Child. Children are the most pure and most vulnerable part of humanity  more deserving of attention and concern because they are the future  the continuing link  our hope for the future. The physical and spiritual health of our children is the guarantee of salvation for mankind in the years to come. The world of today offers us little comfort if we look realistically at the situation of children. Of the great masses of people in the so-called developing world who live and eat badly  it is the children who will pay the highest price for the problems  the adults of tomorrow  who will bear the consequences of the shortages of today. It is all very well to proclaim this the International Year of the Child as a means of drawing attention to children's problems and the need to resolve them  but we would be sadly mistaken if we were to believe that we should thus have dealt with the matter and exhausted all possibility of action. The solutions found for the major problems of the contemporary world will determine the fate of children today and of the children of tomorrow. The building of a more just and equitable world economy  the legal regulation of a world of self-seeking individualism and violence  halting the race to destroy the environmentâthese are the things which will decide the fate of the children  to whom we have dedicated this year in a gesture which we should like to see as something more than the empty symbol of academic considerations. Children are not a different species whose problems have to be treated as a separate issue. By resolving the major problems of the day we will prepare a better world for them. In this spirit  Uruguay has acceded to the declaration of the International Year of the Child and is carrying out a broad-based campaign about it at the national level.308.	Once again my delegation wishes to declare here its total rejection of apartheid as well as all forms of racism and racial discrimination  which we hold to be incompatible with the fundamental principles of our political and moral thinking. This position is not a new one  and it is not a stand we have taken suddenly. My country has forcefully maintained this view since the inception of the United Nations and the beginning of the process of decolonization.309.	Faithful to its convictions  Uruguay is party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and was the first country to accept the authority thereby created to receive individual communications and complaints. Despite the fact that there is no problem of discrimination in our country  the Government recently submitted to the Legislative Commission studying the new penal code  soon to be approved  designed to prevent and punish any incitement to racism or any act of racial discrimination. Thus Uruguay  as a State party to the Convention  is taking steps to carry out the aforementioned international agreement.310.	Besides the broad general matters that have a bearing on international policy  there are several practical problems that are of great significance in the sphere of principles or a serious threat to peace.311.	One of the most long-lasting and thorny problems is that of the Middle East  or the question of Palestine. The passage of time  instead of bringing calm and solutions  has seen the problem become more acute since no solution has been found to the plight of the Palestinian people who are guests of other Arab nations or refugees supported by international charity.312.	Uruguay has always maintained that any conflict must be resolved by means of dialogue and negotiation in the light of the principles of justice and healthy inter-national coexistence. It considers that Israel is already an irreversible fact and that it has a right to exist and to the recognition of just and secure boundaries. But  consistent with the principles that have always underpinned its legal thinking and political philosophy  it also reels that the Palestinian people have a right to self- determination  to a national territory and to statehood. Therefore it views with satisfaction the steps taken along these lines and warmly supports the efforts being made in the international arena to bring the parties closer to an understanding that would put an end to the deadlock so fraught with danger for the peace of the world. While my country welcomes as a positive Step forward the agreements that have been reached  it must still say with deep concern that that does not mean that finally there is peace in the region  because that is inconceivable without a complete and open-hearted agreement that will reconcile the parties on the basis of equality  mutual respect and recognition.313.	The long suffering of Lebanon  a nation dear to us for many reasons  is clear proof that peace is not possible in that thorny and difficult area of the world unless the principles of justice are applied  and those still seem far from being unanimously accepted.314.	We once again issue our country's appealâ which has been so favourably received in the pastâand reaffirm the responsibility of the international community to find  within the United Nations  definitive practical solutions that will ensure the integrity of this people  which has such wonderful traditions and culture  and guarantee its right to live in peace.315.	With reference to the elimination of the vestiges of the colonial past  my country cannot fail to reaffirm its unswerving policy of support for the self- determination of peoples.316.	In the case of Namibia  my delegation feels that the people of this former colony must have the opportunity to attain independence through the exercise of self-determinationâin other words  without outside pressure of any kind  in a climate of peace  with the guarantee of temporary administration by the United Nations  which would enable its citizens to decide on the political form they want and to elect their authorities.317.	The work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has now entered its final stage and is to end next year. We must prove those protracted and difficult negotiations worthwhile by adopting a convention that will give future generations a peaceful regime for the oceans based on equal legal protection of the legitimate interests of all States and the international community as a whole and on just and rational exploitation of the sea and its resources  on efficient and proper administration of the common heritage of mankind  and on an effective system for the peaceful settlement of disputes.318.	Compromise formulas to resolve outstanding issues must be found in order to attain these fundamental goals.319.	The recent eighth session of the Conference took a tremendously important step forward when it included in the first revision of the informal composite negotiating text a formula on the definition of the outer limit of the continental shelf that takes into account in a balanced way the various criteria advanced during the Conference. My delegation supported that formula in a spirit of compromise  and it will continue to make every effort to ensure that the other pending issues relating to the continental shelf may be resolved appropriately.320.	However  we are concerned over certain attempts to weaken in practice the regime of consent by the coastal States for scientific research on the continental shelf. The delegation of Uruguay has declared its willingness to co-operate in negotiating formulas that would improve the text from a technical standpoint or offer better prospects for consensus. But that is not the aim of suggestions that mean breaking with the principle of consent for scientific research in areas under the jurisdiction of the coastal State or that destroy the logic of the system already included in the composite text after difficult negotiations.321.	We naturally take a special interest in the work of the First Committee of the Conference concerning the sea-bed and ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. In that Committee negotiations have come up against major obstacles at recent sessions when there has been a polarization of positions. However  we note with satisfaction the progress made with regard to the machinery of the Authority and the system for exploration and exploitation  and we hope that the progress that emerged at the last session on the transfer of technology and financial agreementsâa matter of high priorityâwill be confirmed. We are also pleased by the effective steps taken in negotiations on the settlement of disputes concerning the sea-bed and on the final clauses.322.	We once again reaffirm the continuing validity of the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor  and the Subsoil Thereof  beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV). All the States of the international communityâthe overwhelming majority explicitly  the others implicitlyâhave acceded to those principles  which now form part of international customary law.323.	The principle that the sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and the resources therein constitute the common heritage of mankind is a binding rule of inter-national law. That principle  along with the complementary principles derived from that fundamental principle contained in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV)  especially the international legal regime to govern the sea-bed  form an indivisible normative entity  one of the pillars of the new law of the sea and the basis of any rule or body of law governing the exploration of the area and the exploitation of its resources.324.	Any legal regime  be it provisional or definitive  that applies to the area can therefore be established only with the consent of the international community  as it alone represents mankind. No State or small group of States can claim to replace the international community  because they would thus be taking upon themselves an authority they do not have. Therefore any unilateral legislation or measure or any kind of restricted treaty that had this as its purpose would be illegal because it would violate international law and make the State or States involved internationally liable.325.	As we move towards the last stages of the negotiations  Uruguay wishes to reaffirm its intention to do all within its power to ensure a successful outcome so that we may fulfil the hopes of all the peoples and Governments of the world and open up horizons of fruitful and mutual co-operation regarding the sea that will decisively further the advance of civilization and the welfare of all mankind.326.	Almost a year ago we noted in this Assembly Uruguay's special concern about the crisis in the inter-national economic situation during the last few years and its serious impact on the developing countries. One year has passed since then  and the hopes we had placed in the dialogue between the developing and developed countries  scheduled to be held in various bodies this year  have been disappointed once again. What meagre tangible results did emerge were due to the efforts of the developing countries themselves to lay the foundations for collective economic autonomy.327.	Signs of recession  inflation and unemployment persist in the industrialized countries and these constitute the present economic crisis  which still shows indications of temporary shortages of certain raw materials  a growing shortage of energy resources  instability in exchange rates  serious imbalances in the balance of payments  a return to protectionism  and other phenomena  which reduce our hopes of overcoming the crisis and  in fact  aggravate it.328.	We continue to see that a considerably larger proportion of available financial  scientific and technological resources is channelled into military and hostile activities  rather than into the quest for solutions to the basic problem facing mankind to ensure at least a minimum standard of living conditions for everyone.329.	One cause of the present crisis is the refusal of many developed countries to carry out a logical process of industrial reorganization  which would make it possible to establish industries where they could enjoy comparative advantages and make efficient use of production facilities.330.	In referring to this problem I cannot fail to mention the problem of energyâand to mention it indeed  with deep concern. This is the more so since  as I said one year ago in this Assembly  Uruguay has absolutely no oil and is one of the countries in Latin America whose oil imports account for a major share of its total imports. This distressing aspect of our economy prompted my country to take a realistic approach in dealing with this issue  and that is how we have dealt with it in all the international forums in which the issue has been considered directly or indirectly.331.	We respect the inalienable right of all countries to defend their own products  particularly in the case of oil  which is a limited and non-renewable resource; but we are concerned about the oil supply. It is not difficult to see that the trade balance of those developing countries which have no oil always shows a constant and increasing deficit when the prices of their commodity exports are falling while the prices of all their imports  but mainly oil  are rising sharply  as has been happening again this year.332.	That is why we feel that efforts to solve this serious aspect of the crisis should focus on the following points  which Uruguay has proposed in the relevant regional bodies. First  some machinery should be set up to ensure minimum supplies for developing countries that have no oil  so that they can meet their development targets. Secondly  balance sheets of energy deposits and reserves should be drawn up to provide us with full information about what energy is potentially available. And lastly  new alternative sources of energy should be investigated in a joint undertaking. This would require an increase in the flow of financial resources available for energy research.333.	We hope that the forthcoming United Nations conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy will help to find ways of enabling countries such as our own to emerge gradually from this deep crisis.334.	Finally  we have been alarmed at the attempts of the developed countries to include new concepts in the new international economic order  such as ""basic needs""  ""graduated approach""  ""access to supplies""  ââselectivity''  and so on  which we see as an attempt to neutralize the impact of the proposed structural measures and changes.335.	We cannot fail to say at this session of the General Assembly how greatly disappointed we were upon our return from Manila in the middle of this year  after the fifth session of UNCTAD. The Latin American countries had worked very hard and enthusiastically in the co-ordination meetings held in Caracas from 15 to 19 January before the session under the auspices of the Latin American Economic System  at the regional level  and later at the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 held in Arusha from 6 to 16 February. Through the Arusha programme for collective self- reliance  in which we placed so much hope  we wanted to start a genuine process of negotiation between developed and developing countries at the fifth session of UNCTAD. It proved almost impossible to achieve this desired and urgent focus of interest on the main issues facing the international community. Suffice it to recall that we came back from Manila with no resolution on the problem of interdependence despite all the attempts at the highest level to agree on such a resolution in the last few hours of the Conference  We also recall how weak a text was drafted  and with how much difficulty  on the short- and medium-term policy  and on action on protectionism. And there was no resolution on the conclusion of the multilateral trade negotiations of the GATT Tokyo round either. We were left with a feeling of frustration when we ended those negotiations by adopting rules and codes for international trade that basically met the interests of the developed countries and did not give due consideration to our own.336.	I turn now to monetary and financial problems. Having started from the premise of the need for effective participation by developing countries in the organization and administration of a new international monetary system that would allocate to us sufficient resources to overcome the problems of imbalance in the balance of payments  we were finally compelled to settle for a text which was basically addressed to the countries in the Group of 77.337.	As for the hopes placed in the work of the Integrated Programme for Commodities  which we adopted in resolution 93 (IV) at the fourth session of UNCTAD   we are discouraged to see that the work is progressing so slowly  not only because of the complexity of the problems and uncertainty about the sources and means of financing  but also  unquestionably and primarily  of the lack of political will. The fact that no concrete results emerged from the negotiations is due to the stubborn refusal of the developed countries to take constructive positions on the basic objectives of the Programme. And so the negotiations to conclude stabilization agreements on commodities have made no significant progress. As for negotiations on the establishment of the Common Fund  although there has been some progress  people in our countries have been understandably alarmed by the modest contributions to the ""second window""  which is of particular importance in that it is intended to finance activities such as research and development  quantitative and qualitative improvement in production  sales promotion  marketing  distribution and diversification.338.	This build-up of frustration in our dialogue with the developed countries has brought about in the Group of 77  as I said at the beginning of this section of my statement  a strategy of relying first and foremost on its own members in order to achieve development and establish a new economic order.339.	This new form of co-operation among developing countries  which Uruguay has resolutely supported  does not  however  imply a move towards absolutism and in no way affects the need to introduce structural changes in the relations of interdependence between North and South. But it cannot be denied that our hopes are now set on the efforts we may make as developing countries to intensify co-operation within the third world and thus gain greater strength  while at the same time following up development in ways more suited to our needs. Hence our country followed very closely the work of the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation Among Developing Countries  held at Buenos Aires last year  and took an active part in the elaboration of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action together with the plan of action for economic cooperation among developing countries set forth at the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 in Arusha.340.	As we pointed out last year  the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 must be strengthened so that it can serve as a forum for a large-scale consideration of international economic problems and thus give an impetus to negotiations going on in other economic bodies within the United Nations family.341.	In this connexion  my delegation fully supports the initiative taken by the Group of 77 in submitting to the third session of that Committee a proposal to be considered at this Assembly's session concerning the need to hold world-level negotiations on international economic co-operation for development.342.	Uruguay attaches particular importance to the problems of science and technology  but development can be achieved on a solid basis only if endogenous capabilities are enhanced in this area. Therefore  we have with the greatest of interest taken part in the work of the recent United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development  at which the international community acknowledged the need to strengthen the scientific and technological capacity of the developing world.343.	The agreements reached at that Conference  although they fall short of expectations  are a positive step forward in that they allow for greater co-ordination with regard to science and technology within the United Nations system  and thereby eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort. Countries also committed themselves to establishing a funding system with new resources.344.	Before concluding  we should like to turn to the Secretary-General's report on the work of this Organization. In this report  an open-minded  punctilious and objective approach is taken with regard to the many subjects with which it deals. We appreciate that the arduous task that lies before the Secretariat  and we also appreciate the effective way it has given its attention to the difficult international issues falling within the purview of the Organization. We should therefore like to convey our thanks to the Secretary- General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and through him to the staff of the United Nations.345.	In conclusion  I should like to express our un-swerving faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations that more than ever bind the efforts of the Organization to co-operate in achieving justice in the solution of international problems through law  in finally establishing peace as a consequence of justice and the triumph of freedom  without which  as one of our great jurists said  there can be no real law  no justice and no peace. These are spiritual values which  in the final analysis  condition the material and temporal world. That is why in the same line of thought we attach special significance to the address to be delivered by His Holiness Pope John Paul II  which will be inspired by a humanistic awareness  for it has an important part to play in the quest for just and peaceful solutions to the problems facing the world.346.	We are therefore prepared to do our part as a Member of the United Nations to see that it is an effective instrument in the attainment of these lofty aims."
"136",7230,"USA",34,1979,"ï»¿We meet in this General Assembly on the threshold of a new decade. It will be a time of complex challenge  a period in which  more than ever  co-operative endeavours among nations are a matter not only of idealism but also of direct self-interest.39.	The decade now drawing to a close has been characterized by rapid  far-reaching and fundamental change. Awesome technological developments are all about us. The assertion of national independence has reshaped the political geography of our planet. Within nations we see an accelerating rise in individual economic  political and social expectations. The unrelenting hostility of the cold war has given way to a more complex relationship between East and West  with elements of both competition and co-operation. The simple notion of a bipolar world has become obsolete. Increasingly there is a profusion of different systems and allegiances and a diffusion of political and military power. The world economic order is also undergoing inexorable transformations. Many nations formerly among the disadvantaged are now achieving global economic power. Economic interdependence has become a daily reality for the citizens of every nation.40.	These sweeping changes have for the most part worked in constructive directions  changing lives for the better and opening new possibilities for collective effort and creative diplomacy.41.	But while these developments demonstrate that progress is possible  they by no means demonstrate that it is inevitable. I say this for two reasons.42.	First  in a number of areas the pace of current progress is dwarfed by the scope of coming challenges. The next decade will decide whether we have the collective wisdom and the common will to surmount a series of imposing and interrelated problems which must be dealt with in a comprehensive manner.43.	The need to develop new forms of energy will pose a continuing challenge. We have entered the difficult transition from a petroleum economy to one based on other forms of energy.44.	Even without this added burden  we face an imposing task in providing for the basic needs of people and in narrowing the combustible disparity between wealth and despair. The food shortage facing developing countries  for example  was 12 million tons in 1975. It could be 70 to 85 million tons by 1990  unless productivity rises sharply.45.	We must strike a decent balance between the burgeoning demands of more people for a better life and the inescapable reality of a fragile environment.46.	Such prospects carry the seeds of future discord. As these seeds ripen  and the growth and spread of weapons continue  regional conflicts become all the more dangerous in their toll of lives and resources and in the heightened risk of wider confrontation.47.	And despite our emergence from the days of unrelenting hostility  the East-West relationship can deteriorate dangerously whenever one side fails to respect the security interests of the other.48.	Our ability to meet these tests depends on a second issue: will we confront such challenges together  and benefit together? Or will we let adversity divide us  and thus conquer?49.	I must be frank and say that I am not sure what the answer will be.50.	There are some reasons for encouragement. In recent years the nations here represented have found it easier  in many different forums  to talk with each other rather than at each other. East and West have entered into the broadest arms control agenda in history. The Soviet Union and the United States have negotiated significant limitations on strategic arms in a treaty that now awaits ratification. North and South have made progress on financial  trade and commodity issuesâfar more progress than has been acknowledged. Agreement has been reached on a sharp increase in the resources of IMF. Lending by the multilateral development banks has increased. Expanded trade opportunities have been opened by the recently concluded trade negotiations. We have moved ahead on other matters  such as international debt and a common fund for commodities. We should recognize such progress and build on it. We have taken steps as well towards the resolution of some deeply embedded regional disputes.51.	But I am concerned that there are also factors at work which could reverse this co-operative trend. The severity of the problems we face could drive nations to the pursuit of their own separate advantage at the expense of international co-operation. In times of economic trouble  even relatively prosperous countries find it more difficult to look beyond their internal concerns to meet international needs. Indeed  it is a vivid lesson of history that hardship can breed short-sighted insularity. It can arouse instincts for self-preservation at the expense of others. In such times  the voices of economic nationalism will be raised in all our countries. We must resist them. We must resist  as well  the voices of international confrontation. In a number of international negotiations  political as well as economic  we have worked our way through to the toughest issues involved. We must not react now in frustration  and unleash a spiral of rhetoric which could deepen rather than resolve our divisions.52.	The challenges of the 1980s can be metâif each of us here represented meets the responsibilities which we share.53.	Our first responsibility is to persist in the search for peace  to reduce both the danger and the destructiveness of war. The future of two regionsâthe Middle East and southern Africaâdepends on specific decisions that will be made in the coming months.54.	We believe that the 26 March Treaty between Egypt and Israel has reduced the dangers inherent in the Arab-Israeli conflict and has laid the foundation for a settlement that can be both durable and just.55.	But the dramatic achievement of peace between Israel and Egypt and the successful implementation of the first phases of the Treaty of peace have not obscured the necessity of moving toward peace between Israel and its other neighbours. Indeed it remains the resolute view of my Government that further progress towards an over-all peace is essential.56.	We know that an ultimate settlement must address the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The Palestinian question must be resolved in all of its aspects.57.	As the peace process continues to unfold  it is our deepest desire that representatives of the Palestinian people and the Governments of Jordan and Syria should join in this great quest.â58.	This is consistent withâindeed it underscoresâ our unshakable commitment to Israel's security and well-being  now and in the future.59.	None of the parties involved in this difficult negotiation has any illusions that resolving the Palestinian issue will be easy. But the United States is convinced that progress will be made towards that goal.60.	Preserving the integrity of Lebanon is also critical to peace in the Middle East. There has been a cease-fire in southern Lebanon  the fragility of which is underscored by the events of today. We need not only a temporary cease-fire  but a broader truce. We will be working towards such a goal in our discussions with other interested Governments here at this Assembly. Lebanon has suffered all too much.61.	The desire for peace is shared by all the peoples of the Middle East. We recognize that there are disagreements about how best to reach that common goal. We believe the course on which we are embarked is the right one  indeed the only one that has shown practical results. We call on all who genuinely seek peace to join in this endeavour.62.	A step towards peace has been taken as well on the Rhodesian conflict. The parties are now engaged in negotiation towards a solution that could combine true majority rule with essential minority rights. The United Kingdom Government  the Commonwealth nations  and the parties themselves deserve great credit for this new step. The deepening agony of war could be ended by agreement on a fair constitution and new elections  as called for in the final communique issued by the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held at Lusaka from 1 to 7 August63.	We have made substantial progress in Namibia. But obstacles remain. The contact group is working with the parties concerned to find ways to resolve the few outstanding issues. We do not underestimate the difficulties  but neither should any of us underestimate the opportunities that a settlement would bring for all of southern Africa.64.	In most negotiations  we can best make progress by stages. A knot can never be untied from the inside. We must begin with the parts that we can grasp  and work our way through to the end of the problem.65.	History will judge us severely if we let our opportunities for peace slip away. As negotiations proceed  the issues we address become progressively more difficult. But we must not let future fears or ambitions undermine the progress that has been made.66.	As we work on these and other conflicts; let us also squarely face the fact that our planet is plagued by those who make war on innocents  as we saw just weeks ago in the tragic death of Lord Mountbatten. We must have greater international co-operation to combat the barbarous practices of the terrorist. The United States strongly supports the basic elements of the draft convention against the taking of hostages  the conclusion of this treaty will contribute to a growing consensus that terrorism will not be tolerated  regardless of the political cause its perpetrators claim to pursue.67.	Finally  the requirement of peace carries with it an international responsibility to limit the spread and accumulation of arms. A particular obligation falls to the largest nuclear Powersâthe United States and the Soviet Unionâto contain the competition in strategic weapons. The treaty concluded after the second round of SALT can be a major step towards the fulfilment of that obligation.68.	The goal of strategic stability will be further served if the Soviet Union  the United Kingdom and the United States are able to agree on a comprehensive ban  on nuclear tests. As the nuclear super-Powers seek the path towards mutual restraint  all nations must also recognize the direct threat to their security from the spread of nuclear weapons. Developments in recent years can bring new impetus to the non-proliferation effortâincluding progress in the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluationâwhich can help us to find safer ways to develop nuclear energy for humanity; the strengthening of the IAEA safeguards; the substantial increase in the number of parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; the entry into force of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  which now finally appears within grasp; and the pledge by a number of nuclear Powers  under specific circumstances  to refrain from the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear States.69.	But there have also been serious setbacks- further demonstrations of intent to acquire nuclear weapons  in disregard of the inherent dangers for regional and international security. The Second Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to be held next year  will be a critical time for taking stockâand for redoubling our efforts to make progress on this urgent international priority.70.	Beyond the search for peace  a second responsibility that we share is to be sensitive to the international consequences of our national economic decisions  and to resist the temptation to solve our economic problems at the expense of others.71.	The imprudence of economic nationalism has been harshly demonstrated in the past. The world depression a half-century ago was spread  deepened and prolonged by a wave of protectionism. That memory has spurred us towards a new multilateral trade agreement intended to open markets and keep them open  even in a time of economic strain.72.	Today  let me address one of those issues which most clearly reflects the direct connection between national decisions and global consequences. That issue is energy. In almost no area is the need for common action more apparent or more urgent. It is an issue which now threatens to divide us  economically and politically. In a future of greater scarcity  these divisions could weaken the fabric of international comity which this organisation embodies.73.	All nations will suffer if all nations do not act responsibly in their consumption  of energy  in its pricing and in its production. Despite a difficult prognosis for our energy future  I believe the basis may exist for progress.â74.	Until the 1970s modern industrial economies operated on two basic assumptions  which also governed relations between oil importers and exporters. These two assumptions were that oil is cheap  and that supplies are unlimited. Now all nations realize that these assumptions no longer hold.75.	The commitments made by the major industrial countries at the Tokyo Economic Summit demonstrate this clearly. My Government is taking ambitious action to address the energy problem and is making efforts to exceed these commitments. President Carter has committed the United States not to import more than 8.2 million barrels of oil a day in 1979  and never to exceed the peak level of our imports reached in 1977. Total United States energy research and development this year is $3.2 billion. We are investing $528 million this yearâand $600 million next yearâin the development and use of solar energy. We are significantly expanding our development of synthetic fuels  to take advantage of the abundant coal and oil shale in our country.76.	Much of this new energy technology will have application in other countries as well. We will seek to make it available to others under mutually satisfactory conditions. For we recognize that by helping others resolve their energy problems  we help resolve our own.77.	Let me indicate some of the ways in which we are prepared to work with others to meet our common energy needs.78.	We have joined other industrial nations in agreeing to establish a provisional international technology group which will recommend ways to broaden international participation in the commercial development of alternative fuels.79.	I pledged last year that the United States would do more to mobilize its technical talents on behalf of the development of others. I am pleased to report that next month we will establish an Institute for Scientific and Technological Cooperation. This Institute will work for the goals set by the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. It will help the people of developing nations to benefit from our technologies. The Institute's Policy Council will include experts from developing nations. Energy development will be among its highest priorities.80.	We will participate actively in preparations for the 1981 United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy.81.	At the recent Tokyo Economic Summit  the World Bank was invited to take the lead in coordinating our assistance to developing nations in the field of energy. We suggest that the World Bank bring together a group of experts to review the question of energy research  development and training in detail. Specifically  that group could evaluate the work of existing energy research and training centres  both national and international  in developing countries. In addition  it could recommend how current institutions could be strengthened and whether new multilateral ones should be created. We are supporting the expansion of the World Bank's programme for the exploration and development of mineral fuels. The Bank is also considering whether local programmes of development finance are adequate to support the rapid application of solar  small hydroelectric and other renewable energy technologies in developing nations.82.	The Inter-American Development Bank has proposed creation of a facility to provide political risk insurance and loan guarantees for private investment in energy and minerals projects in its region. This could be an effective means of stimulating energy development there. We are willing to pursue with the Bank its initiative and work with other countries to develop an acceptable proposal.83.	As the industrial countries make serious efforts to restrict oil demand  and to help the developing countries meet their energy challenges  the question increasingly becomes whether the oil-producing nations are prepared to stabilize prices  and  to the extent it is within their control  ensure adequate supplies. A failure to do so will continue to have harsh consequences for the world economy  especially the poorer nations.84.	We understand the natural desire of oil-exporting nations to husband this valuable resource for future generations. And we accept the fact that oil prices must reflect not only the strength of demand  but also the long-term scarcity of supplyâso long as scarcity is never contrived to manipulate price 85.	But oil producers must understand that there is a limit to what the economies of the oil-consuming nations  and the global economy  can sustain.86.	We must all proceed with a responsible recognition that our national energy decisions will have profound global effectsâand will return either to haunt or to help their makers.87.	A third common responsibility is an intensified commitment to help improve the lives of our fellow human beingsâto provide the necessities of life  to afford the chance to progress  to assure a voice in decisions which will determine their future.88.	We have made progress in the field of human rights  but we must do more. In the past year  some nations have taken steps to restore legal protections and democratic institutions. And we have seen the inauguration of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights  the forceful call of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] for the creation of regional human rights institutions on the continent of Africa  and the activation of UNESCO's human rights procedures. The growing concern for human rights is undeniable. Yet the sad truth is that  even as we sit here today  men and women face torture  death and oppression for daring to exercise rights set forth in the Charter of this body three decades ago. Our joint challenge is to advance the aspirations of all peoples for human dignity.89.	Our commitment must be to economic as well as political and social rightsâfor all are indispensable to human dignity. Improvements in economic well-being  opportunities for participation in the political process  and a growing sense of both economic and political equity can do much to defuse the grievances which can lead to national convulsions and international tensions.90.	To meet this commitment to a better life for all peoples  we must each strive to move the North-South dialogue beyond grand themes and on to specific casesâto priority areas in which practical development goals can be met. Let me discuss in this connexion our efforts towards a goal we should adopt as a matter of simple humanityâthat by the end of this century no person on this bountiful earth should have to go hungry.91.	Last year  I noted that we must not be lulled by good weather and plentiful harvests into losing our sense of urgency. Since then  poor harvests in a number of countries have substantially increased the international demand for food. This situation underscores the need to accumulate adequate stocks to support world food security. I assure Members that the United States will do all it can to prevent a global food crisis. The American harvest this year will be of record size. We have removed all restrictions on wheat production for next year. We have established farmer-owned grain reserves which  through the accumulation and release of stocks  have helped stabilize supplies.92.	An international wheat agreement still eludes our grasp. We should not abandon this goal. But we should move immediately to complete negotiations for a new food aid convention. The World Food Council has urged an agreement by mid-1980. We support that recommendation. In the meantime  we are already implementing the higher food aid pledge the convention would entail.93.	At the same time  major emphasis must be placed on improving global food production. Over half of American direct development aid is now devoted to agriculture. We will continue working to improve the yields of major food crops  to preserve croplands and to expand research on ways to increase the production of traditional and new crops  especially those grown by poor farmers.94.	These efforts have received effective support from the International Agricultural Research Centres. We support proposals to double the resources contributed to those centres and intend to increase our contribution. We hope additional countries will become contributors.95.	We must be aware; however  that in the long run these efforts could be vitiated if the world's population growth is not slowed. Half the couples of child-bearing age still do not have adequate access to family planning services. We must strive to make family planning servicesâalong with other elements of basic health care  adequate food supplies and clean waterâ available to all as rapidly as we can.96.	And in the short run  we must be prepared to meet emergency needs wherever famine afflicts humanity or refugees seek havenâin Africa  in Latin America  in South-East Asia or elsewhere.97.	The proposal made by Vice-President Mondaleat the Geneva Meeting for a refugee resettlement fund reflects our belief that the international community should deal on a global basis with a global and grave refugee crisis. We urge broad participation in this fund.98.	Vigorous and large-scale international action is required to bring relief to the starving in Kampuchea  now facing one of the great human tragedies of modern times. Tens of thousands of sick and hungry Khmer are already pressing on Thailand's border. Hundreds of thousands may soon follow them. Even more widespread famine and disease are in prospect  especially in view of recent reports of intensified fighting. To avert unthinkable catastropheÂ» an international programme of humanitarian relief must be established in Kampuchea as soon as possible. International organizations must be able to bring a co-ordinated  massive and adequately monitored programme of emergency relief to all needy Khmer. We would endorse such an effort.99.	The food crisis in Kampuchea promises both to multiply the flow of refugees and to take a terrible toil among those who cannot escape. The flood of refugees from Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea already has brought great suffering to hundreds of thousands of innocent people  as well as imposed heavy burdens on countries of first asylum.100.	The international community has begun to respond. But humanitarian steps are not enough. The community of nations must make a more active effort to restore peace to the region and to resolve by non- military means the problems that developments in Indo-China have carried in their wake. They pose a threat to the stability of the region as a whole.101.	I believe we can meet the challenges before us. But let us not misjudge their magnitude.102.	Resolution of regional disputes and placing new limits on the instruments of war will require new acts of national and international will. The 1980s could portend a prolonged energy crisis. It could be a decade of widespread famine. Unless the swelling deficits of developing countries can be managed  many of their economies may stagnate and some could be threatened with collapse. Global problems like these require global solutions.103.	This Assembly will decide whether to launch a new round of negotiations on economic co-operation for development. Let me state today that the United States would participate  in the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  in consultations to decide on the most effective way of conducting such negotiations.104.	If new global negotiations are to succeed  the participants must be realistic about each other's political and economic capabilities. We must assign priority to those issues on which concrete results are possible  and we should avoid duplicating the work of existing institutions. In this way  the negotiations could help build a global consensus for action.105.	Many of the issues I have addressed are already prominent on the agenda of the United Nations. The need for co-operation in addressing them requires that we continue to strengthen this institution. Financial  procedural and management reforms are urgently necessary. As a first step  we urge that the Secretary-General's recommendations  now adopted by this Assembly  be fully implemented.106.	The urgency of the requirements I have described calls for something more on the part of all Members of the United Nations.107.	The distinctions between North and South  like those between East and West  reflect differing interests. They have a role in defining the issues and in clarifying our choices. But we must commit ourselves to finding areas where our interests converge.108.	Each of us has our special values to be nurtured  our particular goals to be served  and I do not suggest it can or should be otherwise. The United States believes in a world of diversity.109.	But let us resolveâhere  at this Assembly â to find in our common needs and common humanity a renewed dedication to the search for common ground."
"137",7289,"VAT",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  my address today will be published in its entirety just as I wrote it. Because of its length  however  I shall now read it out in a shortened form. 13.	I desire to express my gratitude to the General Assembly of the United Nations  which I am permitted today to participate in and to address. My thanks go in the first place to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. Last autumn  soon after my election to the Chair of Saint Peter  he invited me to make this visit  and he renewed his invitation in the course of our meeting in Rome last May. From the first moment I felt greatly honoured and deeply obliged. And today  before this distinguished Assembly  I also thank you  Mr. President  who have so kindly welcomed me and invited me to speak.14.	The formal reason for my intervention today is  without any question  the special bond of co-operation that links the Apostolic See with the United Nations  as is shown by the presence of the Holy See's Permanent Observer to this Organization.15.	Besides attaching great importance to its collaboration with the United Nations  the Apostolic See has always  since the foundation of your Organization  ex-pressed its esteem and its agreement with the historic significance of this supreme forum for the international lire of humanity today. It also never ceases to support your Organization's functions and initiatives  which are aimed at peaceful coexistence and collaboration between nations.16.	This confidence and conviction on the part of the Apostolic See is the result  as I have said  not of merely political reasons but of the religious and moral character of the mission of the Roman Catholic Church.17.	This is the real reason  the essential reason  for my presence among you  and I wish to thank this distinguished Assembly for giving consideration to this reason  which can make my presence among you in some way useful. Here  before the representatives of the States  I wish not only to thank you but also to offer my special congratulations  since the invitation extended to the Pope to speak in your Assembly shows that the United Nations accepts and respects the religious and moral dimension of those human problems that the Church attends to  in view of the message of truth and love that it is her duty to bring to the world. The questions that concern your functions and receive your attentionâas is indicated by the vast organic complex of institutions and activities that are part of or collaborate with the United Nations  especially in the fields of culture  health  food  labour and the peaceful uses of nuclear energyâcertainly make it essential for us to meet in the name of man in his wholeness  in all the fullness and manifold riches of his spiritual and material existence  as I have stated in my encyclical Redemptor Hominis   the first of my pontificate.18.	Now  availing myself of the solemn occasion of my meeting with the representatives of the nations of the earth  I wish above all to send my greetings to all the men and women living on this planetâto every man and every woman  without any exception whatever. Every human being living on earth is a member of a civil society  of a nation  man); of them represented here. Each one of you  distinguished ladies and gentlemen  represents a particular State  system and political structure  but what you represent above all are individual human beings; you are all representatives of men and women  of practically all the people of the world  individual men and women  communities and peoples who are living the present phase of their own history and who are also part of the history of humanity as a whole  each of them a subject endowed with dignity as a human person  with his or her own culture  experiences and aspirations  tensions and sufferings  and legitimate expectations. This relationship is what provides the reason for all political activity  whether national or international  for in the final analysis this activity comes from man  is exercised by man and is for man.19.	I would like to express the wish that  in view of its universal character  the United Nations will never cease to be the forum  the high tribune  from which all man's problems are appraised in truth and justice. It was in the name of this inspiration  it was through this historic stimulus  that on 26 June 1945  towards the end of the terrible Second World War  the Charter of the United Nations was signed  and on the following 24 October your Organization began its life. Soon after  on 10 December 1948  came its fundamental document  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  the rights of the human being as a concrete individual and of the human being in his universal value. This document is a milestone on the long and difficult path of the human race. The progress of humanity must be measured not only by the progress of science and technology  which shows man's uniqueness with regard to nature  but also and chiefly by the primacy given to spiritual values and by the progress of moral life.20.	Today  40 years after the outbreak of the Second World War  I wish to recall the whole of the experiences by individuals and nations that were sustained by a generation that is largely still alive. I had occasion not long ago to reflect again on some of those experiences  in one of the places that are most distressing and over-flowing with contempt for man and his fundamental rightsâthe extermination camp of 0Â£wie?im  Auschwitz  which I visited during my pilgrimage to Poland in June. This infamous place is unfortunately only one of the many scattered over the continent of Europe. But the memory of even one should be a warning sign on the path of humanity today  in order that every kind of concentration camp anywhere on earth may once and for all be done away with. And everything that recalls those horrible experiences should also disappear for ever from the lives of nations and States  everything that is a continuation of those experiences under different forms  namely  the various kinds of torture and oppression  either physical or moral  carried out under any system  in any land; this phenomenon is all the more distressing if it occurs under the pretext of internal security or the need to preserve an apparent peace.21.	You will forgive me  ladies and gentlemen  for evoking this memory. But I would be untrue to the history of this century  I would be dishonest with regard to the great cause of man  which we all wish to serve  if l should keep silent  I who come from the country on whose living body 06wie?im was at one time constructed. But my purpose in evoking this memory is above all to show what painful experiences and sufferings by millions of people gave rise to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which has been placed as the basic inspiration and corner-stone of the United Nations. This Declaration was paid for by millions of our brothers and sisters at the cost of their suffering and sacrifice  brought about by the brutalization that darkened and made insensitive the human consciences of their oppressors and of those who carried out a real genocide. This price cannot have been paid in vain. If the truths and principles contained in this document were to be forgotten or ignored and were thus to lose the genuine self-evidence that so distinguished them at the time they were brought painfully to birth  then the noble purpose of the United Nations would be faced with the threat of a new destruction. This is what would happen if the simple yet powerful eloquence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were decisively subjugated by what is wrongly called political interest but often really means no more than one-sided gain and advantage to the detriment of others  or a thirst for power regardless of the needs of othersâeverything which by its nature is opposed to the spirit of the Declaration. Political interest  understood in this sense  if you will pardon me  ladies and gentlemen  dishonours the noble and difficult mission of your service for the good of your countries and of all humanity.22.	Fourteen years ago my great predecessor  Pope Paul VI  spoke from this podium. He spoke memorable words  which I desire to repeat today: ""Never again war  war never again!"" ""Never again one against another  âor even ""one above another""  but always  on every occasion  ""with each other"".23.	Paul VI was a tireless servant in the cause of peace. I wish to follow him with all my strength and continue his service. The Catholic Church in every place on earth proclaims a message of peace  prays for peace  educates for peace. This purpose is also shared by the representatives and followers of other Churches and Communities and of other religions of the world  and they have pledged themselves to it. In union with efforts by all people of good will  this work is certainly bearing fruit. Nevertheless we are continually troubled by the armed conflicts that break out from time to time. How grateful we are to the Lord when a direct intervention succeeds in avoiding such a conflict  as in the case of the tension that last year threatened Argentina and Chile.24.	It is my fervent hope that a solution also to the Middle East crises may draw nearer. While being prepared to recognize the value of any concrete step or attempt made to settle the conflict  I want to recall that it would have no value if it did not truly represent the ""first stone"" of a general over-all peace in the area  a peace that  being necessarily based on equitable recognition of the rights of all  cannot fail to include the consideration and just settlement of the Palestinian question. Connected with this question is that of the tranquillity  independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon within the formula that has made it an example of peaceful and mutually fruitful coexistence between distinct communities  a formula that I hope will  in the common interest  be maintained  with the adjustments required by the developments of the situation. I also hope for a special statute that  under international guaranteesâas my predecessor Paul VI indicatedâ would respect the particular nature of Jerusalem  a heritage sacred to the veneration of millions of believers of the three great monotheistic religions  Judaism  Christianity and Islam.25.	We are troubled also by reports of the development of weaponry exceeding in quality and size the means of war and destruction ever known before. In this field also we applaud the decisions and agreements aimed at reducing the arms race. Nevertheless  the life of humanity today is seriously endangered by the threat of destruction and by the risk arising even from accepting certain ""tranquillizing"" reports. The continual preparations for war demonstrated by the production of ever more numerous  powerful and sophisticated weapons in various countries show that there is a desire to be ready for war  and being ready means being able to start it; it also means taking the risk that sometime  somewhere  somehow  someone can set in motion the terrible mechanism of general destruction.26.	It is therefore necessary to make a continuing and even more energetic effort to do away with the very possibility of provoking war  and to make such catastrophes impossible by influencing the attitudes and convictions  the very intentions and aspirations of Governments and peoples. This task is certainly served by initiatives aimed at international co-operation for the fostering of development. As Paul VI said at the end of his encyclical Populorum Progressio  ""... if the new name for peace is development  who would not wish to labour for it with all his powers?""  However  this task must also be served by constant reflection and activity aimed at discovering the very roots of hatred  destructiveness and contemptâthe roots of everything that produces the temptation to war  not so much in the hearts of nations as in the inner determination of the systems that decide the history of whole societies. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has struck a real blow against the many deep roots of war  since the spirit of war  in its basic primordial meaning  springs up and grows to maturity where the inalienable rights of man are violated.27.	This is a new and deeply relevant vision of the cause of peace  one that goes deeper and is more radical. It is a vision that sees the genesis  and in a sense the substance  of war in the more complex forms emanating from injustice viewed in all its various aspects: this injustice first attacks human rights and thereby destroys the organic unity of the social order  and it then affects the whole system of international relations.28.	By applying this criterion  we must diligently ex-amine which principal tensions in connexion with the inalienable rights of man can weaken the construction of this peace which we all desire so ardently and which is the essential goal of the efforts of the United Nations.29.	Man lives at the same time both in the world of material values and in that of spiritual values. For the individual living and hoping man  his needs  freedoms and relationships with others never concern one sphere of values alone  but belong to both. Material and spiritual realities may be viewed separately in order to understand better that in the concrete human being they are inseparable and to see that any threat to human rights   whether in the field of material realities or in that of spiritual realities  is equally dangerous for peace  since in every instance it concerns man in his entirety. Permit me to recall a constant rule of the history of humanity  a rule that is implicitly contained in all that I have already stated with regard to integral development and human rights. The rule is based on the relationship between spiritual values and material or economic values. In this relationship  it is the spiritual values that are pre-eminent  both on account of the nature of these values and also for reasons concerning the good of man. It is easy to see that material goods do not have unlimited capacity for satisfying the needs of man: they are not in themselves easily distributed and  in the relationship between those who possess and enjoy them and those who are without them  they give rise to tension  dissension and division that will often even turn into open conflict. Spiritual goods  on the other hand  are open to unlimited enjoyment by many at the same time  without diminution of the goods themselves.30.	A critical analysis of our modern civilization shows that in the last 100 years it has contributed as never before to the development of material goods  but that it has also given rise  both in theory and still more in practice  to a series of attitudes in which sensitivity to the spiritual dimension of human existence is diminished to a greater or lesser extent  as a result of certain premises which reduce the meaning of human life chiefly to the many different material and economic factorsâI mean to the demands of production  the market  consumption  the accumulation of riches or of the growing bureaucracy with which an attempt is made to regulate these very processes. Is this not the result of having subordinated man to one single conception and sphere of values?31.	What is the link between these reflections and the cause of peace and war? Since  as I have already stated  material goods by their very nature provoke conditionings and divisions  the struggle to obtain these goods becomes inevitable in the history of humanity. If we cultivate this one-sided subordination of man to material goods alone  we shall be incapable of overcoming this state of need. We shall be able to attenuate it and to avoid it in particular cases  but we shall not succeed in eliminating it systematically and radically  unless we emphasize more and pay greater honour before everyone's eyes  in the sight of every society  to the second dimension of the goods of man: the dimension that does not divide people but puts them into communication with each other  associates them and unites them.32.	I consider that the famous opening words of the Charter of the United Nations in which ""the peoples of the United Nations  determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" solemnly reaffirmed ""faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small""  are meant to stress this dimension.33.	An analysis of the history of mankind  especially at its present stage  shows how important is the duty of revealing more fully the range of the goods that are linked with the spiritual dimension of human existence. It shows how important this task is for building peace and how serious is any threat to human rights. Any violation of them  even in a ""peace situation""  is a form of warfare against humanity.34.	It seems that in the modern world there are two main threats. Both concern human rights in the field of international relations and human rights within the individual States or societies.35.	The first of these systematic threats against human rights is linked in an over-all sense with the distribution of material goods. This distribution is frequently unjust both within individual societies and on the planet as a whole. Everyone knows that these goods are given to man not only as nature's bounty: they are enjoyed by him chiefly as the fruit of his many activities  ranging from the simplest manual and physical labour to the most complicated forms of industrial production  and to highly qualified and specialized research and study. Various forms of inequality in the possession of material goods  and in the enjoyment of them  can often be explained by different historical and cultural causes and circumstances. But  while these circumstances can diminish the moral responsibility of people today  they do not prevent the situations of inequality from being marked by injustice and social injury.36.	People must become aware that economic tensions within countries and in the relationships between States and even between entire continents contain within themselves substantial elements that restrict or violate human rights. Such elements are the exploitation of labour and many other abuses that affect the dignity of the human person. It follows that the fundamental criterion for comparing social  economic and political systems is not  and cannot be  the criterion of hegemony and imperialism: it can be  and indeed it must be  the humanistic criterion  namely  the measure in which each system is really capable of reducing  restraining and eliminating as far as possible the various forms of exploitation of man and of ensuring for him  through work  not only the just distribution of the indispensable material goods  but also a participation  in keeping with his dignity  in the whole process of production and in the social life that grows up around that process.37.	Disturbing factors are frequently present in the form of the frightful disparities between excessively rich individuals and groups  on the one hand  and  on the other hand  the majority made up of the poor or indeed of the destitute  who lack food and opportunities for work and education and are in great numbers condemned to hunger and disease. And concern is also caused at times by the radical separation of work from property  by man's indifference to the production enterprise to which he is linked only by a work obligation  without feeling that he is working for a good that will be his or for himself.38.	It is no secret that the abyss separating the minority of the excessively rich from the multitude of the destitute is a very grave symptom in the life of any society. This must also be said with even greater insistence with regard to the abyss separating countries and regions of the earth. Surely the only way to overcome this serious disparity between areas of satiety and areas of hunger and depression is through co-ordinated cooperation by all countries. This requires above all else a unity inspired by an authentic perspective of peace. Everything will depend on whether these differences and contrasts in the sphere of the ""possession"" of goods will be systematically reduced through truly effective means  on whether the belts of hunger  malnutrition  destitution  under-development  disease and illiteracy will disappear from the economic map of the earth  and on whether peaceful co-operation will avoid imposing conditions of exploitation and economic or political dependence  which would only be a form of neo-colonialism.39.	I would now like to draw attention to a second systematic threat to man in his inalienable rights in the modern world  a threat which constitutes no less a danger than the first to the cause of peace. I refer to the various forms of injustice in the field of the spirit.40.	Man can indeed be wounded in his inner relation-ship with truth  in his conscience  in his most personal belief  in his view of the world  in his religious faith  and in the sphere of what are known as civil liberties. Decisive for these last is equality of rights without discrimination on grounds of origin  race  sex  nationality  religion  political convictions and the like. For centuries the thrust of civilization has been in one direction: that of giving the life of individual political societies a form in which there can be fully safeguarded the objective rights of the spirit  of human conscience and of human creativity  including man's relationship with God. Yet in spite of this we still see in this field recurring threats and violations  often with no possibility of appealing to a higher authority or of obtaining an effective remedy.41.	Besides the acceptance of legal formulas safe-guarding the principle of the freedom of the human spirit  such as freedom of thought and expression  religious freedom  and freedom of conscience  structures of social life often exist in which the practical exercise of these freedoms condemns man  in fact if not formally  to become a second-class or third-class citizen.42.	It is a question of the highest importance that in internal social life  as well as in international life  all human beings in every nation and country should be able to enjoy effectively their full rights under any political regime or system.43.	Only the safeguarding of this real completeness of rights for every human being without discrimination can ensure peace at its very roots.44.	With regard to religious freedom  which I  as Pope  am bound to have particularly at heart  precisely with a view to safeguarding peace  I would like to repeat here  as a contribution to respect for man's spiritual dimension  some principles contained in the Second Vatican Council's Declaration Dignitatis Humanae:""It is in accordance with their dignity that all men  because they are persons  that is  beings endowed with reason and free will and therefore bearing personal responsibility  are both impelled by their nature and bound by a moral obligation to seek the truth  especially religious truth. They are also bound to adhere to the truth once they come to know it and to direct their whole lives in accordance with the demands of truth."" "" . . .the practice of religion of its very nature consists primarily of those voluntary and free internal acts by which a man directs himself to God. Acts of this kind cannot be commanded or forbidden by any merely human authority. But his own social nature requires that man give external expression to these internal acts of religion  that he communicate with others on religious matters  and profess his religion in community."" These words touch the very substance of the question. They also show how even the confrontation between the religious view of the world and the agnostic or even atheistic view  which is one of the ""signs of the times"" of the present age  could preserve honest and respectful human dimensions without violating the essential rights of conscience of any man or woman living on earth.45.	Respect for the dignity of the human person would seem to demand that  when the exact tenor of the exercise of religious freedom is being discussed or determined with a view to national laws or international conventions  the institutions that are by their nature at the service of religion should also be brought in. If this participation is omitted  there is a danger of imposing  in so intimate a field of man's life  rules or restrictions that are opposed to his true religious needs.46.	The United Nations has proclaimed 1979 the International Year of the Child  In this perspective we must ask ourselves whether there will continue to ac-cumulate over the heads of this new generation of children the threat of common extermination for which the means are in the hands of the modem States  especially the major world Powers. Are the children to receive the arms race from us as a necessary inheritance? How are we to explain this unbridled race?47.	The ancients said: Si vis pacem  para bellum. But can our age still really believe that the breath-taking spiral of armaments is at the service of world peace? In alleging the threat of a potential enemy  is it really not rather the intention to keep for oneself a means of threat  in order to get the upper hand with the aid of one's own arsenal of destruction? Here  too  it is the human dimension of peace that tends to vanish in favour of ever new  possible forms of imperialism.48.	It must be our solemn wish here for our children  for the children of all the nations on earth  that this point will never be reached. And for that reason I do not cease to pray to God each day so that in His mercy He may save us from so terrible a day.49.	At the close of this address  I wish to express once more before all the high representatives of the States who are present a word of esteem and deep love for all the peoples  all the nations of the earth  for all human communities. Each one has its own history and culture. I hope that they will live and grow in the freedom and truth of their own history. For that is the measure of the common good of each one of them. I hope that each person will live and grow strong with the moral force of the community that forms its members as citizens. I hope that the State authorities  while respecting the just rights of each citizen  will enjoy the confidence of all for the common good. I hope that all the nations  even the smallest  even those that do not yet enjoy full sovereignty  and those that have been forcibly robbed of it  will meet  in full equality with the others in the United Nations. I hope that the United Nations will ever remain the supreme forum of peace and justice  the authentic seat of the freedom of peoples and individuals in their longing for a better future."
"138",7347,"VEN",34,1979,"ï»¿On behalf of my Government  I extend to the President my most sincere congratulations on the high honour conferred upon him on his election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His personal endowments  his experience  and his important contribution  as head of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  to the policy of decolonization  constitute a guarantee of what we are certain will be his effective contribution in presiding over this session. In action taken for decolonization  Venezuela and the United Republic of Tanzaniaârepresented by the President of the Assemblyâhave made a constant effort  which causes us to welcome Mr. Salim with great pleasure as leader of this Assembly session.60.	At the outset  I should also like to greet the President of the last session  our distinguished friend  Indalecio Lievano Aguirre  whom I congratulate for his brilliant performance during the previous session.61.	We congratulate the Secretary-General  who has excelled in his devotion to the solution of the problems affecting the maintenance of international peace and security.62.	We also greet the new Members of the United Nations and  in particular  the young Republic of Saint Lucia  to which we are united by geographical and historical ties which are destined to become closer in the future.63.	I bring sincere greetings from Venezuela to all the peoples of the world represented here.64.	The Government of President Luis Herrera Campins is formulating its international actions on the basis of a realistic policy founded on principles.65.	We know  from our own history  the political vicissitudes of the peoples of developing countries. We are striving intensely to set up in our country a participatory democracy  where political freedom  social justice and economic progress will find full expression.66.	To this end  President Herrera Campins is carrying out a vigorous programme designed to realize in Venezuela the principles of an active State which  in a democratic setting  will promote the pluralistic expression of all the creative forces of mankind's freedom. We also zealously promote respect for human dignity and the institutionalization of spiritual  political and economic freedoms in both internal and external policy. The defence and advancement of these principles are essential corner-stones of a democratic State and are the basic objectives of our international policy; they are already deeply rooted in the way our people feel.67.	My Government is striving to achieve the ideal of human freedom  of men free from fear and poverty  by creating conditions which will enable each person fully to enjoy all rights in all fields.68.	I hope to outline this afternoon in specific detail Venezuela's point of view on some of the problems of concern to the international community.69.	I think it would be appropriate to take up  in the first place  questions pertaining to our region  essentially the Caribbean and Andean region. I shall also refer to matters jeopardizing peace and world security  such as the situation in southern Africa  human rights and the new international economic order. I shall pay particular attention to subjects linked with development and international co-operation.70.	This international Organization is the expression of social and political forces. Its reality and vigour are obvious. Between the level of the international Organization and that of the Member States there are also regional subsystems and organizations which have become very important and a means for co-operation and for controlling conflicts. The strength of these regional organizations and subsystems contributes in turn to the vitality and strength of the United Nations.71.	Venezuela  at the regional level  has proposed consistent and outward-looking diplomacy and is prepared to do the same at the world level. Co-operation and the prevention and control of conflicts should be the objectives of this outward-looking diplomacy in an interdependent world.72.	Latin America must perform the role which traditionally belongs to it in the concert of nations. By seeking a Latin American consensus  without a trace of intolerance or exclusiveness  we shall contribute to the strengthening of the United Nations.73.	Within a realistic perspective  we cannot overlook the specific and peculiar situation of Central America and the Caribbean  of the Andes region and of the north and the south of the continent.74.	In Central America and the Caribbean a new vitality has been gathering strength  the evolution of which should guarantee for all the world to see the right of every country  no matter how small or weak  freely to choose its own path to prosperity  free from pressures or attempts to establish hegemony or spheres of influence.75.	In the area  we wish to see the establishment of regimes which are the true expression of the will of the people and which will advance the social and economic progress of the countries there. For us  the means to the institutionalization of freedom is representative democracy  and we believe that no effort should be spared to permit the necessary transformation to proceed by non-military and peaceful means.76.	It is our conviction that  for a representative democracy to function  it is necessary to delve into the field of social reforms which will lead to real popular participation. These objectives are shared by the Andean group of countries and by others in the area  we have begun our concerted action and we are determined to develop it with them. With those who do not entirely share these objectives  we wish to seek areas where we are on common ground and to prevent those matters on which we differ from generating tensions or difficulties.77.	Venezuela is an essentially Caribbean country. We are not indifferent to anything that happens in that area  because therein lies our political and economic security. We have made and shall continue to make major economic efforts to co-operate with the countries of that area. Our financial assistance  in the Caribbean alone  already is in excess of $360 million a year  particularly in the financing of the oil supply to these countries. These figures do not include our contribution to the special fund of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]  whose replenishment and subsequent consolidation and expansion Venezuela will seek at the meeting of that organization next December in Caracas.78.	Venezuela is aware of the role which history expects it to play in the geopolitical sector where it lies  as a consequence of the stability of its democratic regime  its status as an oil-exporting country and its participation in the Andean group.79.	In the Caribbean  muffled sounds are being heard which seem to augur the emergence of other ideologies that might make sister nations pawns in strategic power-plays  against their will. Venezuela is prepared to promote measures conducive to the political normalization of the area. As already stated  we are convinced that in our foreign policy we must proceed with the utmost realism and must develop with all nations constructive relations on the basis of sincerity  reciprocity and tangible demonstrations of goodwill.80.	We welcome and support the decolonization process in the Caribbean. We wish to emphasize that our objective is to develop the best relations with the new countries.81.	For us to have a fruitful dialogue  in our opinion  we must necessarily first achieve Latin American integration. We have left behind us the rather naive illusions which ruled our first attempts at integration  which we imagined could be immediate and general. Nevertheless  today Venezuela is convinced that Latin American integration is feasible provided we act with realism  with respect for the magnitude and complexity of the problems to be surmounted for integration to be achieved; provided that we realize that our people will need to make an effective mental and psychological effort; and provided that this process is approached  in the light of experience  as a concentration of efforts at integration by the various sub regions which make up Latin America.82	A start has been made on a new phase which I feel is important and beneficial for the Latin American community and for the inter-American system. I am referring to the concerted action by the Andean countries with regard to foreign policy  which was agreed upon by the Presidents of Bolivia  Colombia  Ecuador  Peru arid Venezuela at Cartagena  Colombia  on 28 May of this year. This initiative was taken on a purely experimental basis Having noted the solid progress we had made in our economic integration  we decided to explore the possibilities of acting jointly in the political field  without any formal obligations or commitments.83	At first sight  it seems surprising that consensus among us should have been reached so easily and naturally on all the matters we have taken up But if we stop to think about it  we shall realize that there is nothing surprising in our coming to the same conclusions  we who share a deep-rooted and sincere faith in the principles which are the foundations of the regional system: Latin American solidarity; our vocation for the effective application of democracy; and our conviction that the primary responsibility of every State is to promote social justice and well-being for all its citizens in freedom and with their participation.84.	I believe that the initiative I have mentioned contributed to clearing the way for the solution of the conflict in Nicaragua.85.	I do not claim to draw conclusions from a process which has only just begun; yet I cannot help thinking that  since we have been able to prove that the united voice of five Republics carries far more weight than the sum of those voices  then how much more weight would a united Latin American voice carry. I hope the day is near when that voice will resound within these wails.86.	Time and again we have witnessed an almost reflex reaction  namely  invoking the principle of non-intervention by way of exorcism to silence any mention of the principles of the Charter. I would not wish to leave the slightest doubt as to the paramount importance of the principle of non-intervention  which Venezuela recognizes  since it is the essential basis for the civilized coexistence of States and the defence of the weak when confronted with the whims of the powerful. It is our firm conviction that no country  nor any group of countries  has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of others or to try to impose ideologies or forms of government on another. But we cannot assent to this principle being falsely bandied about in an attempt  by silence or ambiguity  to make us accomplices to the suppression of freedom or the trampling of human rights or to prevent this Organization  with all its authority  from supporting the historical processes and the social forces which are moving towards the attainment of the principles proclaimed in their own fundamental instruments  towards democracy  equality and economic and social justice.87.	Only a few days ago Venezuela  as an observer country  attended the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries. There  in Havana  I had occasion to express the hope of my Government that the non-aligned movement would continue to preserve its unique features which have been characteristic of it since the African-Asian Conference  held at Bandung in 1955  and the first non-aligned Conference  held in Belgrade in 1961.88.	As the spokesman of a people that prides itself on having no race  because we are of all races  I then pledgedâand I confirm it hereâthe unrestricted and unqualified support of Venezuela for all actions designed to eradicate the abominable aberration of racism. I therefore consider that our repudiation and condemnation of racism in all its forms must be expressed with added vigour and more categorically than ever  especially against that crime which adds insult to injury by presuming to institutionalize racism as a system  as is happening in South Africa with apartheid.89.	This is also an appropriate occasion to confirm Venezuela's absolute support for the aspirations to freedom and dignity of the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabwe.90.	History has shown us that freedom is rarely a gift; it almost always comes after a constant battle to win it and defend it. In that battle there can be no respite for us who  because we are not super-Powers  can ensure our freedom only by our joint effort and with our resolute opposition to the predominance of hegemonies  imperialisms or blocs  which would attempt to suppress our sovereignty and our national identity  as well as our solidarity with and support for all peoples that are striving to acquire  preserve or retrieve their right to freedom  independence and self-determination. Only on this basis will it be possible to solve the conflicts and tensions which in the Middle East  South-East Asia  Africa and anywhere else in the world bar the way for mankind to advance in its quest for peace and the well-being of all.91.	We think that a human being cannot be coldly considered in terms of the antagonistic systems which brought about the crystallization of the policy of blocs.92.	We know that political freedom is illusory when there is economic exploitation. So far  regrettably  the efforts we have made as third-world countries to attain a more just situation in our economic relations with the industrialized countries have been frustrated by their short-sightedness and intransigence. They are seemingly determined to demonstrate to the developing countries a truth of which Venezuela is already convinced: that significant concessions can be won only from positions of power and that the only form of power in the hands of countries that are producers of raw materials and consumers of industrial products is concerted action and solidarity  as the experience of the oil-producing countries has shown.93.	Such action inspired by solidarity is more forceful and proves to be more effective when the request of justice from the outside world is borne out by a climate of genuine social justice at home.94.	As regards the subject of energy  it is reassuring to observe that there is an increasingly better understanding of the difficult situation in which the international community finds itself. Airy and even irresponsible accusations against OPEC have lost credibility. The Governments of industrialized countries are beginning to concentrate their attention on measures to reduce excessive consumption  thereby being able to act on the demand for oil. As a country member of OPEC  Venezuela views this as a highly positive evolution and as the best point of departure to devise instruments for effective conservation policies which will allow for an extension of the transition period to alternate sources of energy which are renewable and non-polluting and also to speed up scientific research for their swift use.95.	The Government of Venezuela realizes that many developing countries are undergoing a particularly difficult situation in the present circumstances. It has acted and is prepared to act so as to contribute  in keeping with the requirements of the moment  to ensure oil supplies for those countries and lessen the financial burden due to its higher cost. This is a fundamental premise of the foreign policy of my country  one which as always had the widest national consensus. On the other hand  it is evident that the problems of those countries are essentially the results of structural imbalances which affect the world economy. Compliance with the doctrine of international social justice carries with it an obligation to support the less fortunate developing countries in the improvement of their international bargaining position. The individual weakness of the developing countries vis-a-vis the industrialized nations causes us to take a firm stand in the collective struggle of our countries to secure a just participation in the world economic system.96.	Venezuela has reiterated in various forums its support for the idea of holding within the United Nations a new round of international economic negotiations including the subject of energy. This new dialogue must avoid the pitfalls along the way. The ability to do that will depend on the extent to which the industrialized countries show a positive political will to achieve concrete and meaningful results in the improvement of international economic relations.97.	The deep-seated economic disarray that affects the international economy provides us with an opportunity to build a new international economic order in which the legitimate claims of the developing countries will be fully met. We must face our common problems with courage  seeking just and rational solutions. The gravity of the present crisis and economic interdependence make this necessary. The alternative is that we shall be forced into accelerated and irreversible deterioration with unforeseeable consequences.98.	Some of the negotiations under way  such as those concerning the Common Fund for the Integrated Programme on Commodities6 and those on science and technology  have produced results that  unfortunately  still appear on the whole to be very slim and almost imperceptible in terms of the establishment of the new international economic order 99.	At the recent session of the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174  there was again evidence of a lack of the political will that could have enabled us to reach genuine agreements on the issues included in its programme of work. In this context  the proposal of the Group of 77-based on a resolution of the Sixth Conference of Non-Aligned Countriesâacquires particular significance in the new global North-South negotiations.100.	Present circumstances demand that we establish an atmosphere of mutual trust and proceed with a sense of urgency. The 1980 special session of the General Assembly must achieve a break-through in the North-South negotiations by bringing about substantive results for the start of the new international economic order. While such results would provide real opportunities to the developing countries by establishing interdependence based on justice and equity  the entire community of nations would also unquestionably stand to gain from the new impetus given the world economy  as has been fully recognized.101.	We of the developing countries are prepared to assume our responsibilities. We trust that the developed countries will also assume theirs. We are determined to intensify our co-operation on the basis of collective self-reliance. Efforts we have made among ourselves  particularly in Mexico City  Buenos Aires  Arusha  Manila  Havana and now here in New York  have been given a vigorous and growing impetus to produce meaningful and concrete results without delay. This does not exempt the wealthy countries from their obligations to the developing countries; on the contrary  it emphasizes them. South-South co-operation is an indispensable complement to North-South cooperation and must help the latter acquire effectiveness and innovative strength.102.	As the President of my country Luis Herrera Campins said when he addressed a recent meeting of the Latin American Economic System  at the very beginning of his term of office:""Despite its difficult economic situation  its precarious social stability and its slow democratic progress  Latin America today is in fact the part of the developing world where there is the widest agreement on goals  more convergence towards them and the greatest probability of success in achieving those ends  at least in part. In spite of the distances that separate us from the industrialized world  there is a kind of premonition that the tide of progress of Western civilization  which at one time had begun to flow in a circle from the Mediterranean to the West  is today bearing in a clear southerly direction  towards Latin America ""103.	The menace of the crisis that occurred in 1914  which Churchill with keen perspicacity called a ""world crisis'  continues to threaten us. Hope for its disappearance is deep-rooted in the thinking of all mankind  of men of every rank and condition  seeking ways for peaceful and useful coexistence.104.	Between the two World Wars  mankind  far from realizing the dream of peace  witnessed the emergence of the two most powerful dictatorships the world had ever known  dictatorships that made their influence felt on men's bodies and on their souls.105.	Despite the fact that nearly half a century has elapsed since the 1945 peace and the foundation of the United Nations  we are still hoping for the establishment of a just and necessary new order.106.	The conflict did not end in 1945  nor did it begin in 1914. Its causes and tensions came from the past. They did not end when the guns were silenced  nor were they resolved. A new consciousness prevailed  foretelling a new political and social objective. Already then there was an obvious need to replace the old world order with a new order that would be more sincere and stable  more just and provident.107.	Recent times have witnessed continuous commotions  ruptures  violence and wars  blatantly revealing just how precarious the situation was and how stubborn the basic facts  tensions and divergencies.108.	After undergoing two terrible periods of global war  mankind knows therefore that it is not possible to secure peace by means of mere military  political and economic might; it knows that international order cannot be guaranteed by the hegemonies of the superpowers. There are no perpetual hegemonies in the history of man. Predominant Powers come and go; they have been and are the products of their times. The new international order can be built only on just relations among peoples. As long as the nations that benefit from the present international order because of their might fail to realize that such a situation Is not eternal  the world will continue to live under the burden of the threat of war.109.	This Organization  it is often said  came into being because of the grief of a world devastated by war and as a response to the universal aspiration for peace.110.	It is a contradiction in terms to seek a genuinely new international order while maintaining the existence of hegemonies.111.	International social justice must be the foundation of the new order. Basically this implies two things: first  a realization that greater power does not confer greater rights  but rather increasing duties that entail the correction of existing imbalances in the present international order  secondly  a larger share for the developing countries in the decision-making process in international affairs.112.	Venezuelan policy  as I said at the outset  is inspired by a profound respect for human beings and peoples. The essential characteristic of human dignity is freedomâthe greatest gift of the Creator to human beings in the natural order of things. Freedom is realized by means of the social organization of people and by democracy which guarantees and secures the most varied participation as is necessary. The essential characteristic of the dignity of nations is independence  which  in the international order  means that peoples are not there to be made into instruments but to be respected  regardless of their military or economic power  because sovereignty is not divisible  nor does it depend on the size or wealth of nations  but on the courage which in any part of the world is used with honest sincerity to defend justice.113.	Venezuela was the cradle of the emancipation of Latin America. Our continent has been and is the continent of hope. To all the peoples represented here and to grieving mankind anxiously yearning for freedom  peace and justice  I leave the brotherly solidarity of Bolivar's country."
"139",7386,"VNM",34,1979,"ï»¿May I first convey to you  Mr. President  our warmest congratulations on your brilliant election to the high office of President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.159.	May I also pay a deserved tribute to Mr. Indalecio Lie'vano  the President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly. We wish particularly to express our sincere thanks to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  and to his colleagues for the devotion and wisdom shown in their fruitful activities in the service of the interests of the international community.160.	The Vietnamese delegation extends its best wishes and welcome to Saint Lucia on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations.161.	It is with profound sadness and boundless grief that we learned of the premature death of the beloved leader of the Angolan people  a worthy son of Africa  a great friend of our people  the President of the People's Republic of Angola  Agostinho Neto  whose image is forever engraved in the heart of every Angolan and of every Vietnamese.162.	The delegation of the Socialist Republic of VietNam warmly welcomes the great victories registered by the forces of national independence  peace and social progress throughout the world during the period following the thirty-third session of the General Assembly up to now. These resounding victories contribute to the downfall of a series of seemingly impregnable forts of imperialism and international reaction in vital positions  eliminating dangerous hotbeds of war and strengthening the potential for defending peace and the security of the peoples.163.	In Latin America  the glorious victory of the Sandinist fighters and the heroic people of Nicaragua over the Somoza dictatorship has opened up a new page in the history of that nation. The heroic people of Grenada have overthrown the dictatorial Eric Gairy regime and continue their resolute struggle to safeguard their national independence and build their beautiful country.164.	The Latin American countries  including those of the Caribbean region  are waging a tenacious struggle to consolidate their political and economic independence  to recover and preserve their natural resources and to promote their multifaceted co-operation. Joining the fraternal Cuban people  we demand an immediate and unconditional end to the encirclement and blockade of Cuba  compensation for the damages it has caused and the restoration of the Guantanamo naval base to that country. We support the rights of Panama to its absolute sovereignty over the Canal Zone.165.	We reaffirm our active solidarity with the Chilean people  who are waging a valiant struggle against the Fascist clique in power. Likewise we energetically support the struggle of the peoples of Puerto Rico and Belize and other peoples still living under colonial domination for their right to self-determination and independence.166.	We are elated by the excellent results of the visit by our Prime Minister  Pham Van Dong  to Cuba  Mexico  Nicaragua  Panama and Jamaica. This visit to several countries in Latin America has opened up new prospects for relations of friendship and fruitful cooperation between Viet Nam and the countries of that region.167.	In southern Africa  neither the ferocity of the racist and apartheid regimes nor their collusion with imperialism to impose so-called ""internal settlements"" can check the persistent struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa  under the leadership of the Patriotic Front  SWAPO and the African National Congress of South Africa  respectively  for their independence  freedom and dignity.168.	The agreement on cessation of hostilities between the Frente POLISARIO and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania constitutes an important victory for the Saharan people in their struggle for the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence.169.	The separate arrangements in the Middle East only further strengthen the solidarity of the Arab peoples and international support for the struggle of the Palestinian people  whose sole authentic representative is the PLO  for the respect of their inalienable national rights. We join the international community in condemning the Camp David agreements and the so-called Treaty of Peace between Egypt and Israel and we reaffirm our unreserved support for the just claims of the Palestinian people in demanding the return to the Arab countries of their territories illegally occupied by Israel  including the Holy City of Jerusalem.170.	In Asia  imperialism and international reactionaries have sustained the heaviest defeats at the very places where their collusion is closest and their efforts most intense. The revolutionary impetus of the Iranian people has put an end to the tyrannical regime of the Shah  thereby causing the collapse of the Central Treaty Organization. The people of Afghanistan have foiled all attempts at foreign intervention and subversion  thereby consolidating the gains of the April 1978 Revolution.171.	In the region of the Indian Ocean the struggle of the peoples of the littoral countries has been stepped up with a view to turning that ocean into a zone of peace and demanding the withdrawal of imperialist military bases  in particular those on Diego Garcia  while in east Asia the presence of foreign troops in South Korea is sternly condemned by the international community. In South-East Asia  the peoples of Kampuchea  Laos and Viet Nam  overcoming countless difficulties  have scored resounding victories in the field of reconstruction as well as in that of national defence. The events of the past year have shown once again that the friendship and solidarity among the three countries of Indo-China constitute a vital question for them and at the same time a factor for peace and security in that region.172.	The Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries  which has just ended successfully in Havana  represents one of the most eloquent expressions of the determination of the peoples of non-aligned countries to strengthen their solidarity and develop their co-operation with other democratic and progressive forces in the common struggle against imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism  hegemonism and expansionism  racism  including zionism and apartheid  and for the people's independence and freedom  for world peace and international security and for the establishment of a new international economic order.173.	Together with peace-loving forces the world over  we warmly hail the signing of the SALT Treaty  which we consider an important contribution to international detente that would create favourable conditions for future negotiations on general and complete disarmament. We sternly condemn those who are stepping up the arms race and accelerating war preparations  thereby endangering world peace and international security. We support the consistent policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in favour of peace  detente  the strengthening of the security of the peoples and international co-operation. In this connexion  we welcome the initiative of Czechoslovakia in requesting the inclusion on the agenda of the present session of an item entitled  ""Adoption of a declaration on international co-operation for disarmament"".174.	The peoples' struggle for their complete economic independence  for the recovery of their natural resources and for the establishment of a new  just and equitable economic order has developed unceasingly. However  it is a hard fact of life that in many developing countries the economic situation continues to deteriorate. The maintenance of an unjust international economic order has increasingly widened the gap between the exploiting developed countries and the developing countries. The deadlock in the North-South negotiations and the failure of the fifth session of UNCT AD confirm that the exploiting countries are trying by every means to perpetuate their selfish interests  while blaming the developing countries for the consequences of the world economic crisis  the energy crisis  inflation and so on.175.	My delegation is glad to note that in this year of 1979 we have witnessed many great successes achieved in all regions of the world by the forces of peace  national independence  democracy and social progress. This is the essential direction for the development of the world situation at present. Nevertheless  imperialists  in collusion with international reactionaries  seek by every means to obstruct the advance of mankind  to try to regain their lost positions and to prepare new interventions and aggressions against the peoples that refuse to submit to their dictates.176.	After more than three decades of undaunted struggle full of sacrifices to regain their independence and freedom  the Vietnamese people in the spring of 1975 won complete victory and achieved the reunification of their country. They thought that from then on they could devote themselves fully to the work of re-construction in peace.177.	However  our independence was once again threatened and peace jeopardized  and this time the aggressors were precisely those who had in the past vociferously condemned United States aggression in Viet Nam and repeatedly pledged their fidelity to the cause of Viet Nam  namely  the Peking [Beijing] authorities.178.	One may wonder then why Peking hurled 600 000 troops against Viet Nam when a deep friendship existed between those two neighbouring peoples; why  overnight  Peking treated a friendly neighbouring country as its worst enemy. It is indeed difficult to understand this  unless one knows that for a long time Peking has been hatching a global plan to bring Viet Nam under its heel and turn it into a tool of its hegemonistic and expansionist policy in South-East Asia and in the world. Those in power in Peking have always considered South-East Asia as their zone of natural expansion. In comparison with a big  over- populated China with a ""superior cultureââ  these are but small countries  under-developed but rich in resources. They looked especially to those countries where there are strong Chinese communities and Maoist subversive groups that provide two choice means of expansion for Peking. Because of its strategic position  Viet Nam constitutes for China the natural door through which to penetrate South-East Asia. Therefore  China scrupulously prepared plans to bend Viet Nam to its will.179.	That plan comprised all kinds of manoeuvres  from giving assistance to Vietnamese resistance  to the use of that assistance as a means of control and pressure to make Viet Nam give up its policy of independence and toe the Peking line; from using the gains won by the Vietnamese people in their struggle as bargaining chips in bartering with imperialism  to committing aggression by proxy  and finally ending up with direct aggression. It is a matter of common knowledge that in the early 1970s  when the victory of Vietnamese resistance was certain  the Chinese leaders made a deal with their new allies with a view to perpetuating the division of Viet Nam and sharing zones of influence in that part of the world. The occupation by Chinese forces in 1974 of the Hoang Saâor Paracelâislands of VietNam is clear evidence of this  among other proof.180.	The total liberation of South Viet Nam in 1975 completely upset Peking's plans. Since then  the reactionary Chinese authorities have intensified their preparations for aggression against Viet Nam. They have thought they could exploit to the full the multiple difficulties that Viet Nam faces after 30 years of war. The prospect of an independent  unified and prosperous Viet Nam enjoying friendly relations with all countries seemed unacceptable to them. In their eyes  Viet Nam  which fiercely defends its independence and sovereign policy  constitutes a ""bad example"" for the South-East Asian countries and thus becomes a major obstacle to their expansionist and hegemonistic designs. Therefore  Peking had to eliminate this obstacle at any cost.181.	Being more sophisticated and more cruel than their predecessors  the Chinese expansionists have chosen a new strategyâthat of launching a two- pronged attack against Viet Nam on its south-western and its northern border  while seeking to foment disorder inside the country with the so-called Hoa problem  concerning persons of Chinese origin living in Viet Nam. They thus decided to utilize Kampuchea  which they totally controlled with the help of their henchmen  Pol Pot and Ieng Sary  as a base for their attacks against the south-western part of Viet Nam  thus striking at it from the rear and on its flank  choosing a place they thought was the weakest point in Viet Nam  namely  the newly liberated region in the southern part of our country.182.	It is therefore not surprising that as early as 1965  taking advantage of the fact that Kampuchea was the weakest link of the three countries in this region and acting through its henchmen and using subversive methods  Peking was able to turn that country into a base for expansion in the region. After the liberation of Kampuchea that brought Pol Pot and Ieng Sary to power in that country  Peking brought in tens of thousands of Chinese military advisers and a huge amount of weapons and ammunition in order hastily to set up there an army 23 divisions strong.183.	On the border of Northern Viet Nam  Peking massed hundreds of thousands of troops which carried out daily provocations and incidents  creating permanent tension  and stood ready to invade North Viet Nam.184.	As the preparations were completed  the time for these two almost simultaneous attacks was set for the end of 1978 and the beginning of 1979. However  the aggressors  blinded by their ambitions of conquest  committed a grave strategic mistake in underestimating the Vietnamese forces and thus concentrating the bulk of their combat forcesâ19 out of their total of 23 divisionsâin the border zone to launch an attack in the direction of Ho Chi Minh City. Faced with the rapid defeat of the Pol Pot army and the solidarity of the three peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  as well as with the firm support extended to Viet Nam by the socialist countries and peoples of the world  the Chinese authorities  before themselves plunging into the adventure  had to seek some blessing from their new friends across the ocean who are quite ready to play ""the China card"".185.	The short time that elapsed between 23 December 1978  when the Pol Pot forces attacked Tay Ninh in the direction of Ho Chi Minh City  and 17 February 1979  when 600 000 Chinese troops were marched into North Viet Nam  clearly showed that Peking's two-pronged plan of aggression was carefully prepared long in advance. So it is clear that late in 1978 the Vietnamese people were faced with an extremely serious  life-or-death situationâtheir territory was threatened with invasion  their national rights trampled underfoot and the freshly-won peace suddenly lost. Endowed with a time-honoured tradition of a nation for which nothing is more precious than independence and freedom  the Vietnamese people once again took up arms to defend their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.186.	Exercising their right to self-defence  our people responded vigorously  smashing the Pol Pot forces that invaded Tay Ninh late in 1978  thus avoiding being caught in Peking's two-pronged attack and creating favourable conditions to repel victoriously the open aggression of 17 February 1979 launched by the Chinese expansionists.187.	Had our people not acted thus and held firm  what would have become of the situation in the region? A conflagration would have broken out  possibly drawing into the flames many other countries and destroying peace and stability in the whole South-East Asian region.188.	These developments have unveiled the aggressor's fallacious allegations about Viet Nam ""daring"" to provoke China by which it tried to justify its purpose of ""giving Viet Nam a lesson"". Those allegations are by no means different from those made by Hitler  who arrogated to himself the ""right"" to punish other nations.189.	Was it because the Peking rulers take pride in having a human force of a billion inhabitants and having nuclear weapons at their disposal that they dare claim the arbitrary right to teach a lesson to another country?190.	Whatever the real motivation of the hegemonistic Peking authorities may be  their behaviour is nothing but a revival of the concept of former Chinese emperors  who considered the people of countries around their ""Celestial Empire"" as barbarians or  at best  as vassals who had to be placed under feudal domination.191.	One may wonder how in our era  in which the principle of relations between sovereign States is well established  and in which the principle of the equal sovereignty of States and the equal rights of people are enshrined in the United Nations Charter as basic tenets  a countryâin this case Chinaâcan have acted in so arrogant  if not insolent  a manner  arrogating to itself the ""right"" to punish another country and to ""teach it a lesson"". Does Peking  in so doing  wish to set mankind back thousands of years? Can ethics and justice be discarded with impunity from international relations?192.	We the Vietnamese people  victims of Chinese aggression  are entitled to ask the international community if it can tolerate such a thing. We appeal to it to condemn strenuously the Peking expansionists and not to let them arrogate to themselves the arbitrary ' 'right'' to ""teach a lesson"" to other countries  in defiance of the entire international community.193.	We also demand that the Peking authorities halt immediately all their preparations for further aggression against Viet Nam  evacuate the points they still illegally occupy on our border  return to us the Hoang Saâor ParacelâIslands and compensate us for the material losses they caused in their recent war of aggression in our six border provinces.194.	During that aggression  Chinese troops brutally massacred civilians  destroyed all their means of livelihood  systematically razing to the ground commercial establishments  hospitals and schools. Those monstrous crimes not only caused immense suffering to the population of the six border provinces of Viet Nam but  what is worse  have cruelly impaired the economic reconstruction of Viet Nam  which still has to overcome the dire consequences of 30 years of war. The criminals must be punished for their crimes.195.	After being defeated in its aggression against Viet Nam  China agreed to enter into negotiations with Viet Nam beginning on 18 April 1979. Yet  after more than five months and in the course of 12 negotiating sessions in Hanoi as well as in Peking  the Chinese side has consistently refused to respond positively to the logical and reasonable proposals put forward by the Vietnamese side on such urgent measures as the separation of armed forces and the creation of a demilitarized zone  so as to prevent a resumption of hostilities  preserve peace and thereby create conditions conducive to the solution of other issues and the normalization of relations between our two countries.196.	On the contrary  Peking has  during this time  been feverishly engaged in war preparations and has created a most grave and explosive situation apt at any moment to turn into a major war in the Indo-China/ South-East Asia region. Peking is continuing to mass 12 divisions of its troops on the Viet Nam/China border; moreover  it has been stationing more than five army corps in the military regions adjacent to Viet Nam. Recently  it has been concentrating additional troops in the region of Hai Nan Island. Those Chinese armed forces have been engaged in daily provocations and in attacks on Vietnamese territory  causing us losses in human lives and property. In addition  Vietnamese air space and territorial waters are being repeatedly violated. At the same time  Peking has intensified its hostile acts against the Lao People's Democratic Republic  massing many divisions of Chinese troops on the borders of that country  and engaging in subversive activities and war preparations against Laos. In Kampuchea  Peking persists in its attempts to revive the last vestiges of the Pol Pot army  driving them to sabotage the peaceful reconstruction of that country. To top it all off  the men in power in Peking have been constantly threatening ""to teach Viet Nam another lesson"".197.	These facts amply prove that China is feverishly hatching new aggression against Viet Namâaggression which could be launched at any moment. No man of conscience can have any doubt about this. One may well wonder what country will be Peking's next victim after Viet Nam.198.	Along with all those war preparations  in order to cover up their dark designs  the Peking authorities have mounted a campaign of slander against Viet Nam with the vociferous support of certain Western circles.199.	This propaganda daily harks back to the allegation that Viet Nam ""invaded"" Kampuchea  that Viet Nam is ""responsible"" for the refugee problem that Viet Nam has become ""an instrument of the Soviet Union"".200.	Through this slanderous campaign to sully the image of Viet Nam and to isolate it internationally  Peking is aiming precisely at preparing world opinion' before launching new act of armed aggression against our country.201.	In the interest of peace and in the name of justice  we urgently call on the international community and on world public opinion to be vigilant  because behind all these Peking intrigues lurks a grave danger to peace and stability in South-East Asia and the world.202.	In the face of this confusion created by Peking  we deem it necessary to shed light on the whole truth.203.	Since the days when the Pol Pot regime committed genocide against its own people  it has become a renegade  and the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea  which rose up to overthrow it and to save the Kampuchean people  represents revolutionary legality. Hence it is fully in keeping with international law and the United Nations Charter for Viet Nam to lend its support to this just struggle.204.	In December 1978  while Pol Pot was massing 19 of his 23 divisions on the border ready to invade Viet Nam  leaving the rear unprotected  the United Front for the National Salvation of Kampuchea  taking advantage of that military blunder  as well as of the favourable strategic moment created by the rapid col-lapse of the Pol Pot fighting force in the face of the Vietnamese riposte  launched a general insurrection culminating in the overthrow of the Pol Pot regime  and thus put an end to the almost four years of nightmare for the Kampuchean people. That is the triumph of the revolution of the Kampuchean people in exercise of its right to self-determination. The world has witnessed the resurrection of a people that has  by upholding justice  escaped total annihilation. This resurrection contributes to wiping out one of the greatest shames of mankind  unprecedented in history  the abominable Pol Pot regime  and paves the way for the Kampuchean people ""to go in search of light  to go in search of life""  as said by the great Angolan poet Agostinho Neto. Let the valiant people of Kampuchea be allowed to rebuild its life in peace and to settle its own affairs as sovereign master of its own destiny.205.	The situation in Kampuchea is stabilizing and settling down to normal. It is irreversible. As was indicated m the statement made on 26 September 1979 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Kampuchea  the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea is ready to accept  without political conditions  assistance given by all countries and international organizations which would be delivered directly to it as the only authentic and legal representative of the Kampuchean people. It denounces:"". . .the perfidious manoeuvre of the imperialists and of international reaction  which  exploiting the humanitarian aspect  poses the so-called problem of 'aid to both sides' or 'provision of relief to the inhabitants.' In fact  this manoeuvre is aimed at legalizing the provision of supplies to the remnants of the Pol Pot-Ieng Sary troops in their opposition to the Kampuchean people  at deceiving public opinion as to the existence of this overthrown genocidal administration  and at laying foundations for a so-called 'political solution to the Kampuchean problem'. In this way they are interfering in the internal affairs of Â£he Kampuchean people.""206.	No reason whatever is to be found for talking about solutions. What should be denounced is the Chinese intervention in Kampuchea  the Chinese responsibility for the genocide committed by the Pol Pot- Ieng Sary clique against 3 million inhabitants of Kampuchea. Any manoeuvre aimed at reviving the Pol Pot- Ieng Sary clique  any manoeuvre aimed at creating ""two Kampucheas""  constitutes an intolerable interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea and a gross violation of the Kampuchean people's right to self-determination and it only prolongs the sufferings of a nation which has already suffered too much. No  there exists only one Kampuchea: the People's Re-public of Kampuchea. There exists only one Government of Kampuchea: the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea  the sole legal and authentic representative of the Kampuchean people.207.	For their part  the Vietnamese people  together with all justice-loving people throughout the world  greet the martyred fraternal people of a resuscitated Kampuchea. We pledge to extend all necessary assistance and support for the reconstruction of their country.208.	At the request of the People's Revolutionary Council of Kampuchea and on the basis of the Treaty of Peace  Friendship and Co-operation signed between the two countries  Vietnamese troops are in Kampuchea both to help the Kampuchean people oppose Peking's attempts to reimpose the Pol Pot regime and to ensure peace and security. This stems from the spirit of traditional solidarity between the three peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampucheaâa solidarity which dates not merely from yesterday  but which has been tempered in each country by a century of struggle for independence and which is one of the determining factors in their successive victories over much stronger enemies.209.	On the refugee problem  we have said and now repeat that this is the consequence of the long years of wars of aggression which our people have undergone; the responsibility lies with those who invaded Viet Nam. At this moment Peking is seeking to exploit this question for political blackmail  and to prepare for a new war. At the Geneva conference on refugees as well as in co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  Viet Nam has shown its good will and has taken humanitarian steps aimed at making a contribution to the settlement of this question. The Secretary-General of the United Nations  the High Commissioner and world opinion have greatly appreciated our co-operation. It is deplorable that Washingtonâby sending warships of its Seventh Fleet to the vicinity of Vietnamese watersâand Peking continue to instigate the illegal departure of Vietnamese people from their country. No one can doubt that this is deliberate sabotage of the results of the Geneva Conference.210.	Viet Nam is an independent and sovereign country. Its relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are relations of friendship and cooperation based on mutual respect for independence and sovereignty. The Soviet Union and the socialist countries effectively helped us during our national resistance and they co-operate fraternally with Viet Nam in the reconstruction of the country; therefore it is normal that we have excellent relations. The Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation between Viet Nam and the Soviet Union contributes to the cause of peace and international co-operation and is not intended to oppose any third country. What is abnormal and unacceptable is that Peking has arrogated to itself the right to dictate to Viet Nam the conduct of its international relations  to impose on Viet Nam the choice of such and such a country with which Viet Nam should maintain relations. Peking must remember that the Vietnamese people have amply shown their spirit of independence not only in our era but for millennia.211.	The recent painful ordeals of Viet Nam  Laos and Kampuchea  like other peoples' own experiences throughout the world  show quite clearly that a new danger is threatening the international community: Peking hegemonism  in collusion with imperialism  is challenging the peoples of the world. We must increase our vigilance and we must act in time to halt their dark designs. Mankind's fight has not ended against these scourges: imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism  racism  apartheid  Zionism and now the hegemonism of Peking which has been added to this list of ills. But we are convinced that the joint forces of peace  independence and freedom all over the world will be capable of taking up the challenge and winning.212.	We welcome the initiative of the Soviet Union in requesting the inclusion on the agenda of this session of the item entitled ""inadmissibility of the policy of hegemonism in international relations"". We unreservedly support the draft resolution submitted by Comrade Andrei Gromyko  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  for adoption by the United Nations.213.	We warmly welcome the resounding victories scored by the Lao people in their work of reconstruction as well as in their defence of their national independence  foiling all manoeuvres of the Peking authorities aimed at fomenting troubles in the country and at preparing a large-scale attack against it. If the Peking authorities try to teach Viet Nam a ""second lesson"" by invading Lao territory  the consequences for them will be extremely serious. The people and Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will spare no effort to tighten the ties of friendship and militant solidarity with the fraternal people and the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.214.	Viet Nam and China are neighbouring countries with historical  cultural and other ties which date back thousands of years. The two peoplesâVietnamese and Chineseâhave lived the same past  and supported each other in their struggle against feudalism  colonialism and imperialism. In the course of this struggle an indestructible friendship and solidarity was forged. The Vietnamese people will never forget the fraternal sentiments and valuable assistance of the great Chinese people during the Vietnamese struggle for national salvation. That is why we cherish even more our friendship and solidarity with the Chinese people and why we are all the more determined to oppose the hegemonist and expansionist policy of the present Peking rulers  for it constitutes an offence to the sentiments of our two peoples and aims at destroying what we were trying so hard to build together.215.	To the leaders in Peking we make a pressing appeal: if they stop their hostile policy against Viet Nam  peace will be restored  relations will be normalized  and the two countries will live in harmony for the good of our respective peoples and in the interests of stability and prosperity in the whole region. We should like to proclaim our firm and unshakable will to defend our independence  national heritage and territorial integrity. Nevertheless  we wish to settle all disputes between our two countries by means of peaceful negotiations. We have proved our good will. Let the Chinese leaders do the same. Only in that way will negotiations progress and achieve the results so deeply hoped for by our two peoples and by all peace-loving peoples in the world.216.	The South-East Asian countries  including Viet Nam  have gone through the same painful past under colonialism. They have been victims of the same policy of ""divide and rule"" of the oppressors. Yet  in spite of the vicissitudes of contemporary history  our countries are called upon to live in good neighbourliness. As for the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  it is determined to forget the past  to look forward to the future and to do its best to write jointly with other countries a new page in the history of the region. It is in this spirit that during recent years my country has taken the initiative to increase direct contacts at various levels with the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations with a view to establishing together a zone of peace  independence  freedom and neutrality  a zone of stability and prosperity  in conformity with the legitimate interests of each country and with those of world peace and international security.217.	In our relations with the countries of South-East Asia  we advocate the following principles which we scrupulously observe: mutual respect for independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  non- aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  the non-use or threat of use of force  refrain from all forms of subversionâdirect or indirect  equality  mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence.218.	However  it is regrettable that certain countries of South-East Asia which  during the years of our national resistance  had involved themselves more or less closely with imperialist aggression against our country have  at this moment  willy-nilly  allowed themselves to be drawn along in the wake of Peking against the peoples of Viet Nam and other countries of the Indo- Chinese peninsula. It is our sincere hope that those countries will pull themselves together in time  first of all in their own national interests but also in the interests of peace  stability and co-operation in the region.219.	Have not we countries of South-East Asia come to an understanding that it is desirable to consult with one another on problems of mutual interest? As far as Viet Nam is concerned  we have always favoured contacts and we want to maintain dialogue in order to achieve further mutual comprehension  avoid misunderstandings  narrow differences and increase similarities. Undoubtedly  that is the most appropriate way to establish a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia. In this spirit Viet Nam is prepared to sign treaties of peace and non-aggression with the other countries of South-East Asia.220.	We firmly believe that  by signing such treaties  the peoples of South-East Asia will show the international community that they are willing to contribute actively to the cause of peace and stability in the region and in the world at large.221.	Viet Nam has never harmed the interests of any country. In turn  it will not tolerate any violation of its independence and sovereignty. The more the Vietnamese people cherish their independence and freedom  the more they respect the independence and freedom of other peoples.222.	While fighting for its own salvation against Peking hegemonism  Viet Nam is contributing to the defence of the independence of peoples and the peace and stability of the region. The foreign policy of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is a policy of independence  sovereignty  peace  friendship  solidarity and international co-operation.223.	The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam advocates the development of normal relations and a diversified co-operation with all countries  regardless of political systems  on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.224.	The Vietnamese people fully realize that the struggle which they waged in the past  like the one they are now carrying out for their national interests  is an integral part of the common struggle of the peoples of the world for peace  national independence  democracy and social progress  a policy which corresponds perfectly with the objectives of the non-aligned movement and with those of the United Nations as well.225.	On this occasion I should like  on behalf of the people and Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  to express our sincere gratitude to our friends and brothers all over the world for the sympathy and support which they gave us in the reconstruction of our country and in the defence of our national independence.226. At present the United Nations has 152 Member States. The non-aligned movement  for its part  has 95 nations in its ranks. The forces which stand for the defence of peace and national independence against aggression have experienced a new development. They also stand for foiling the designs of Peking hegemonism in collusion with imperialism  and for the establishment of a lasting peace for all nations. The Vietnamese people are more determined than ever to contribute with all their strength to this great cause of mankind."
"140",7457,"WSM",34,1979,"ï»¿Mr. President  your accomplishments are well known to the world body  and your personal competence as a diplomat has been so amply demonstrated that there is no need for me to elaborate further. I would merely wish to congratulate you and to express my delegation's deep satisfaction at your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. The honour is not only personally deserved  but it is highly appropriate that it should fall to your country  the United Republic of Tanzania.277.	I should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the leadership given the last session of the General Assembly by your predecessor  Ambassador Lievano  and to extend our good wishes to our Secretary-General as he continues to serve this Organization and its objectives with the dedication and integrity that we know so well.278.	We are extremely pleased to welcome Saint Lucia  a fellow Commonwealth country  as our new neighbour in this Assembly. We were honoured to be present at its recent independence celebrations  and we are now delighted to be sitting beside its delegation here.279.	Samoa is in a very tranquil part of the world. Tranquillity is so much a part of our life that we view with deep sympathy the situation of those who live under conditions that do not afford them the opportunity to do so in peace and dignity. From this viewpoint  also we find it not only reprehensible but often even difficult to comprehend the actions and attitudes of those who stand in the way of peace or who fail to embrace opportunities to fashion peace.280.	Consummate selfishness  whatever the causeâ be it greed  prejudice  arrogance or the personal ambition of individuals in positions of influenceâhas no place in this one globe we all share  and ought not be condoned or given sustenance  either directly or indirectly. We deplore oppression of people against their wishes  be it of one people by another or of a people by their leaders beyond the limits dictated by the legitimate needs of national security  harmony and progress.281.	The international community has been wrestling with the problem of Rhodesia for a long time. The people of that unfortunate country have suffered far too long. My country was heartened at the recent Lusaka Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries by the obvious desire of those closest to this issue to work for a lasting solution  once and for all. There must be genuine majority rule in Zimbabwe. We sincerely hope that the London talks that flowed from the Lusaka meeting will pave the way for a just and free Zimbabwe wherein an atmosphere of confidence and security will prevail for all its citizens.282.	Namibia has also been on the agenda of this world body for far too long. It is a blot on the record of the United Nations that South Africa has been able to defy not only the basic principles of human decency in its affairs  but also the clearly expressed views of the international community  by continuing its illegal occupation of Namibia. It is the obligation of the international community to use every means in its powerâbe it dialogue or  if that fails  then fully effective sanctionsâto convince that country of the folly of its intransigence and isolationism and to persuade it to emancipate the Namibians  to dismantle its institutionalized and abhorrent practices and policies and to return to the community of nations to play the constructive role it is capable of fulfilling in regional and world development.283.	The Middle East region continues to remain a trouble-spot in the world. We open this session of the General Assembly at a time of difficult ongoing dialogue following the signing of the Middle East peace treaty. Samoa is pleased with the positive elements in this major breakthrough and with other initiatives to urge the parties towards a solution. Samoa's position on the Middle East question is clear. Just as our support for Israel's right to exist as a sovereign State within secure and recognized boundaries is fundamental to our approach to the dispute  so  too  is our conviction that the Palestinian people have a right to a homeland and to whatever national status they desire through the exercise of self-determination.284.	The Israelis and the Palestinians  through their legitimate representatives  must recognize these basic principles and must face them squarely. They must no longer keep each other at arm's length  but both must refrain from terrorism and violence  for such atrocities only serve to keep peace out of reach and to prolong the agony and suffering of the people of the region. The only justification for any national action or any political stand is the extent to which it achieves the welfare of the people involved. The people of the region deserve peace and an end to antagonism.285.	The courage shown by the leaders of Egypt and Israel in recent months deserves praise and support. It is disappointing  however  to see the continuing establishment of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories at a time when the fragile peace process needs encouragement rather than obstacles if it is to gain the wider support and success it deserves. Similarly  continued violation of Lebanese territory endangers this aim.286.	The situation in Indochina gives my country cause for deep concern. We feel for the innocent victims. The desperate actions that they have had to take  the risks to life  and the hardships they have had to endure are fortunately receiving sympathetic response and assistance from the world community. We also feel for the neighbouring countries in the region.287.	It is difficult enough for developing countries to build up their economies and improve the well-being of their people without having to cope with the problems imposed by the troubles in Viet Nam and Kampuchea- troubles that are not of their own making but which threaten their security and distract them from the pursuit of the legitimate goals of prosperity and harmony in South-East Asia. Those in and outside the region who are causing or contributing to tension and uncertainty in South-East Asia must refrain from policies and actions which prevent the people of the area from living together in peace and harmony and which violate the basic principles of this Organization.288.	I cannot pass on without expressing our horror at the unspeakable atrocities inflicted on the Kampuchean people by the Pol Pot regime. We hope that it will not be long before the people of Kampuchea and  indeed  the entire region will be free from abuse and harassment.289.	A satisfactory resolution of the situation in Cyprus is still not within sight. The intercommunal talks provide the soundest opportunity for the achievement of a mutually acceptable solution and must be given every encouragement. The Secretary-General's role in reconvening those talks is to be applauded  and we urge all concerned both Cypriot and non-Cypriot  to respect above all the right of both elements of the Cypriot population to devise together a solution that will guarantee the rights and freedom of all.290.	My Government has become increasingly alarmed at the seemingly endless reports of gross  even grotesque  violations of human rights from many areas of the world. These practices not only subject people to intolerable indignities but also  as we have seen  upset the peace and stability of the regions where they occur. In the United Nations we have procedures and institutions to assist in the promotion of human rights  but we feel that these must be strengthened. The United Nations must be in a position to take actionâand take it speedilyâso that these blots on the record of the human race do not continue unchecked. We therefore support the proposal to establish an office of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. No countryâunless it has something to hideâshould fear such a proposal. But if the world body is not yet ready for such an office  then we would support the proposal made by Canada that a person widely accepted by the United Nations membership might be installed as under-secretary-general for human rights. A person of recognized prominence in the area of humanitarian causes could help give the priority to human rights that we feel is essential to the maintenance and protection of the dignity of mankind.291.	Economic issues are assuming an increasingly important dimension in international relations. The concept of an economic order based on justice and equality has already been widely accepted by the world community as both desirable and inevitable. We are of the view that there can be no genuine and lasting peace as long as inequalities and imbalances prevail.292.	It is of great concern to Samoa that  despite all the rhetoric  very little has been achieved in the negotiations of the serious economic issues confronting the world as a whole. The North-South dialogue has met neither the aspirations of the developing countries nor even the expectations of the developed countries.293.	The state of the world economy today has reached crisis proportions. This crisis stems in part from the deterioration in the terms of trade  mounting protectionism  soaring inflation  recession  the failure of some developed countries to meet the agreed target for official development assistance  the energy crisis and  most unfortunately  the lack of genuine political will on the part of some developed countries to make the necessary concessions and to engage in meaningful negotiations. The admittedly grim economic experience of the developed countries seems to have so paralysed political will in those countries that the demands of those whose circumstances are a great deal more desperate for basic reforms are not even considered but merely parried with recitations of the economic difficulties of the times. The over-all situation  however  demands courage and boldness of action by the developed countries.294.	The world economic crisis has its severest effect on the developing countries  and particularly the poorest or least developed among them. The need for a just and rational economic system is more urgent now than ever before in view of the ever-growing disparities between the economies of the developed and developing countries. In the face of those adverse economic trends  the international community must address and find urgent solutions to remedy the situation  because in the final analysis the ultimate guarantee for international security and lasting peace and prosperity is the economic well-being of all nations.295.	We are now on the threshold of the third United Nations development decade covering the 1980s and of the special session of the United Nations which will be held next year. We must strive to break the present impasse and seek new initiatives and approaches in order to achieve concrete results on the fundamental issues relating to economic reform. We should like to see emerge out of the special session an innovative and bold response to the challenges of the 1980s. That response must be realistic  practical and effective.296.	We see the new international development strategy for the next decade as an undertaking involving the entire international community  with the specific aim of achieving step by step the objectives of the new international economic order. We are heartened by the positive response so far shown by some developed countries to the proposal by the Group of 77 to launch a round of global and sustained negotiations on international co-operation for development. We hope other developed countries genuinely interested in improving the lot of the developing countries and  indeed  the world will readily support this proposal.297.	It is our sincere hope that the North-South dialogue will not degenerate into an exercise in rhetoric and confrontation between the ""haves"" and ""have- nots"" instead of a framework for constructive discussion aimed at facilitating decisions on the specific measures and innovations required to build confidence in individual countries and promote world-wide growth.298.	Discussion of the so-called new economic order in its entirety as a concept  and in an atmosphere of confrontation  too readily conjures up visions of abrupt  wide-scale changes and tends to create more apprehension and frustration than co-operation. The developing countries are seen to demand these changes in their totality with undisguised impatience. The developed countries  on the other hand  feel threatened by this zealous onslaught and tend to resist instinctively.299.	The continued growth of the developed economies is vital to the economic health of the world  but the growth of developing countries and the utilization of untapped potential in their economies are also vital and  in the long term  quite essential for the sustained growth of the developed economies. Interdependence  which is a reality of economic existence today  must be utilized to achieve dynamism in economic relations and thereby global expansion.300.	To bring the discussion of these matters within the framework of the United Nations need not mean abandoning attempts already started in other forums to tackle aspects of the problem. The challenge facing the international community is so important and so urgent that every avenue should be explored to find solutions and agreement.301.	I began this statement with a reference to the peacefulness of our rather remote region of the world and the good fortune we generally share in being able to follow the way of life we choose. We have seen in recent years steady progress in the decolonization of the Pacific region. The past 12 months have seen new additions to the ranks of independent countries in the South Pacific. Last year we welcomed the Solomon Islands to this body and noted the newly achieved independence of Tuvalu. This year has seen the attainment of independence by Kiribati  formerly the Gilbert Islands. It is enormously pleasing to us  with our special ties of kinship and experience with our Pacific neighbours  to witness those developments and  through long-established mutual co-operation  to have participated in them.302.	The process of evolution towards independence in our region is  of course  far from complete. We continue to watch with interest  for example  political developments in the New Hebrides. Our sympathy for the people of the New Hebrides is deep and we continue to look forward to the day when full independence will be theirs. In the words of our regional body  the South Pacific Forum  at its meeting this year  we welcome the progress being made towards independence  and express the hope that all major political groups there will work closely together in preparing for their independence.303.	As a member of the South Pacific Forum  and as an independent nation  we also reaffirm our belief in the application of the principle of self-determination and independence to all Pacific island peoples  in accordance with their freely expressed wishes. We would call on all parties concerned to work towards this end. The future of the Pacific peoples in New Caledonia and French Polynesia is of abiding concern to us. They must be permitted to work out their own future in a way which is fully consonant with their own wishes. The issues are  as we know  complex. We have been through many of them ourselves in the course of obtaining our own independence. These issues are in our minds linked with many of the other matters which come before this body and which have their foundation in the struggle against colonialism. The thread is an unbroken one as far as we are concerned. We oppose colonialism and its consequences  wherever they manifest themselves  because we cannot accept the notion that one group  whether on a racial  cultural or economic basis  should dominate another.304.	Our geographical isolation does not lessen our anxieties over issues which are of concern to this world body. Indeed  some of the gravest issues seem to hit us hardest because of our remoteness. For instance  not only do we get a generous measure of general global inflation  which is automatically imported into our small economies  but in addition  transport costs over the vast distances involved ensure that we get a double dose of inflation directly attributable to soaring oil prices. Nuclear testing was brought to our doorstep because of our remoteness and isolation. Nuclear weapons testing continues to cause alarm to the Pacific region. The atmospheric tests carried out in the past in the South Pacific brought loud objection from the Pacific peoples. The few who had voices in this Organization at that time called for a cessation to the pollution of our atmosphere by nuclear experiments. The others appealed and expressed their protests through whatever means were open to them; to no avail.305.	Nuclear-weapons testing  though no longer carried out in the atmosphere  continues in the South Pacific. We regret that the international community has not yet reached agreement on banning all nuclear weapons testing. We urge the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Mankind should be concerned about how it could best survive  not about how it could most efficiently destroy itself.306.	Like many other nations we welcome the treaty concluded as a result of the second round of SALT between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and we look forward to its ratification. We hold out the hope that these agreements and the experience gained during their implementation  will serve to create an atmosphere conducive to even bolder agreements in the future  not only on nuclear  but also on conventional weapons disarmament.307.	The liberation of our world from conflict and its terrible consequences  as well as from tension inherent in the stockpiling of arms  should be the aim of all nations. Samoa  despite the seemingly intractable problems and obstacles the world community faces  is still hopeful that people everywhere will eventually heed the appeal voiced by Pope John Paul II last week to respect the rights of our fellow men so that we can all share this world in harmony.â"
"141",7495,"YEM",34,1979,"ï»¿41.	On behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic and on my own behalf  I wish to express our gratification at the confidence that has been shown in Mr. Salim by the General Assembly in electing him unanimously to preside over the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His election is further evidence that this Assembly fully recognizes his political competence and his experience as a diplomat  which will guarantee the success of this session. He may be assured that my delegation will fully co-operate with him in the carrying out of his great responsibilities  so that we shall be able to achieve our common goals of finding acceptable solutions to the problems before the present session.42.	My delegation wishes to express its admiration of Mr. Lievano  the head of the delegation of Colombia  for the extraordinary skill with which he presided over the last session of the Assembly.43.	We are very happy to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the efforts he has made and the devotion he has shown in the service of the cause of strengthening peace and stability in the world. We particularly appreciate the role he has played and the initiatives he has taken for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East based on the reaffirmation of the national rights of the Palestinian people.44.	My delegation warmly welcomes the admission of Saint Lucia to our Organization. We are convinced that the admission of that newly independent State will further strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations in all its efforts to encourage justice  peace and progress.45.	The yearly sessions of the General Assembly prove to us the continuity of the struggle against war and the factors of under-development and oppression. They reflect man's innate attachment to peace  freedom  and progress. We feel that this session of the General Assembly  too  will enable us to assess the work being done by the United Nationsâwith its successes and its failuresâsince its creation at the end of the Second World War.46.	The Charter of the United Nations reflects the desire of the peoples of the world to see peace and progress reign in the world. Thus  we are convinced that the General Assembly must go beyond the stage of discussion in accordance with the parliamentary procedure governing the items before it and adopt an attitude based on positive and constructive criticism and the commitment of all Member States to implement the resolutions and recommendations of the General Assembly and the Security Council. Only thus shall we be able to strengthen the role and the effectiveness of the Organization as an instrument for peace  save mankind from the horrors of war and destruction  and ensure the triumph of the purposes and principles of the Charter.47.	The existence of the United Nations is a unique experience in the world of today  because  to the extent that its existence has contributed to preventing the tragedy of a third world war  it has undoubtedly created in the minds of all peoples the conviction that the United Nations is the natural and most appropriate framework for the structuring of international relations on democratic bases  with a view to enshrining the principle of coexistence and co-operation in a better world  where prosperity and stability will prevail  a world freed from the state of under-development inherited from the colonial era. So we believe that continued assistance to national liberation movements must be at the forefront of the efforts that the United Nations must deploy in order to achieve the purposes of the Charter.48.	The United Nations has before it one basic subject which has been of concern to the international community for 32 yearsânamely  the cause of the Arab people of Palestine  who have continued to experience an unprecedented tragedy because of the Zionist conspiracy with imperialist circles to expel them from their homeland and occupy their lands. The Arab people of Palestine submit their cause again today to this international gathering  confident of the justice of that cause and convinced that the United Nations as an organization embodying international legitimacy is the international forum that can best examine all the aspects of the problem with the participation of the PLO  the only legitimate representative of the embattled Arab people of Palestine  on a footing of equality with the other parties concerned. In that way  a just and lasting peace must be achieved  and it must include the following elements: first  the complete withdrawal of the Israeli forces of aggression from all the occupied Arab territories  and above all from Jerusalem; secondly  the guaranteeing of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination  sovereignty and national independence on the territory of Palestine  under the leadership of the PLO  the only representative of that people; thirdly  the cessation of the establishment of Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories and in Jerusalem  since those settlements are an obstacle to a just peace and violate international law and the United Nations Charter  as well as the many relevant United Nations resolutions; and  fourthly  the dismantling of all the Israeli settlements that have been established in the occupied Arab territories  and the cessation of archaeological excavations and of construction designed to change the cultural  religious and demographic features of the occupied Arab territories.49.	The international community unanimously recognizes that a just and lasting peace cannot be achieved if it does not include the basic elements that we have just set forth. But the Zionist entity  which professes to want peace  arrogantly and obstinately opposes this unanimous will of the international community and continues its aggression and its occupation of Palestine and other independent and sovereign Arab countries neighbouring Palestine. Moreover  the decision taken on 16 September last by the Council of Ministers of Israel  under which Israelis will be allowed to acquire Arab lands and property on the West Bank and in Jerusalem  again confirms Israel's determination to pursue its policy of Occupation and aggression and to undermine the chances for a just and lasting peace in the area.50.	The bombings  the air raids  the land and sea attacks by the Zionist enemy against southern Lebanon and the Palestinian refugee camps are further proof that Israel is challenging the international community and intends to pursue its aggression and terrorism in order to perpetuate its occupation of Palestine and neighbouring Arab territories and its conspiracy against the independence and sovereignty of the Arab nation.51.	Israel  born of aggression and terrorism  has opposed every sincere effort to establish a just and lasting peace  based on the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland and to set up an independent State in Palestine  a peace guaranteeing the total and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli forces of aggression from the occupied Arab territories and the city of Jerusalem.52.	The separate peace treaty that resulted from the Camp David agreements signed by the Egyptian regime and the Zionist enemy has encouraged Israel to pursue its expansionist policy of settlement and has strengthened its hold on the occupied territories  by means of every method of terrorism and repression. Israel's repeated acts of aggression against the civilian population in southern Lebanon and the Palestinian refugee camps  since the signature of the Camp David agreements  prove to international public opinion how incompatible those agreements are with the sincere international efforts to establish a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. They confirm the connexion between the separate peace treaty and the plans to annex southern Lebanon and liquidate Palestinian resistance  thereby enabling the aggressive Zionist authorities to put into effect their expansionist policy  to the detriment of the Arab territories and Palestinian Arab rights.53.	The resolutions of the Ninth Arab Summit Conference   held in Baghdad in November 1978  and of the Tenth Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers  held in Fez in May  as well as the Final Declaration of the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Havana in September  unanimously condemned the Camp David agreements because they deny Arab rights  and particularly the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the establishment of a State on their national land. That condemnation is a clear and resounding reply to the manoeuvres and misleading campaigns engaged in by Zionism and its new allies to legitimize these unacceptable agreements.54.	The delegation of my country wishes to warn the Assembly that Israel's policy  based on expansionist settlements  and the annexation of territories by force and terrorism will lead our region to the brink of total war  the consequences of which will not be limited to the Middle East but will inevitably engulf the Mediterranean basin  thus posing a grave threat to international peace and security. Our warning is based on our understanding of the responsibility that the United Nations has in the maintenance of peace and security  and particularly the responsibility of the Security Council  which must fulfil its task of establishing peace by taking strict measures against Israel to oblige it to bow to the will of the international community  in conformity with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter and in the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.55.	The maintenance of colonialist regimes in southern Africa is a blemish on the human conscience. The policy of apartheid practised by the Government of South Africa is one of the most hateful aspects of persecution and exploitation; it is contrary to the principles on which the United Nations is based.56.	The occupation of Namibia by the racist South African regime and the maintenance of the illegal racist regime in Rhodesia are other elements in the struggle between the imperialist forces and the national forces struggling for their freedom and their right to self- determination  and to shape their future in conformity with their free will.57.	Just as my delegation  last year  welcomed the initiative of the five Western countries towards a just settlement of the problem of the occupation of Namibia by South Africa  we now fear that that initiative will fail because of the colonialist and racist attitude of the Pretoria authorities  who refuse to respond to the efforts of the United Nations to ensure Namibia's attainment of independence and territorial integrity.58.	It has therefore become all the more imperative that we adopt binding sanctions against the Pretoria regime in accordance with the terms of Chapter VII of the Charter. My delegation would appeal to all Western States that still have contacts with the racist Government of South Africa to implement the resolution on sanctions and thus help the United Nations in its efforts to grant the Namibian people the right to self- determination  national independence and territorial integrity under the leadership of SWAPO the sole legitimate representative of the people. This would be in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.59.	On the question of Rhodesia  my delegation welcomes the Rhodesia Constitutional Conference  convened in London by the United Kingdom Government and attended by all the parties concerned in accordance with the agreement reached at the Meeting of Heads of Government of Commonwealth Countries  held in Lusaka. My delegation reiterates its support for the legitimate claims of the Patriotic Front of Zimbabwe that the white minority racist regime be ended and that a new constitution be drafted providing for free and democratic elections and guaranteeing the rights of the indigenous majority of the population.60.	We wish here to reaffirm that for such efforts to succeed the following elements must be taken into account: first  recognition of the Zimbabwe Patriotic Front as the sole legitimate representative of Rhodesia  and of its programme for the independence of the Territory; and secondly  the organization of free and fair elections on the basis of the new constitution guaranteeing majority government. This will defeat any attempt to maintain domination by the white minority based on a spurious internal settlement rejected by the Zimbabwe people and its leadership  represented by the Patriotic Front.61.	As a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean entrusted with its preservation as a zone of peace  my country wishes to reaffirm its opposition to any military presence or to the signing of any pact in the area of the Indian Ocean and its natural prolongations like the Red Sea. At the last meeting of that Committee in March  in which the littoral and hinterland countries of the Indian Ocean participated  we reiterated the need to keep the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea free of all foreign military bases. My country advocated cooperation by all members of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean in drafting a convention by which the signatories would commit themselves fully to respect and implement General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) containing the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace.62.	In many international forums  and most recently at the Sixth Conference of non-aligned countries at Havana  my country has defined its position on the question of Cyprus. We fully support the initiative taken by the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  embodied in the 10 points he suggested.  We stand by the United Nations in its efforts to promote a dialogue between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities aimed at a solution to the problem that would put an end to the suffering of the friendly Cypriot people within a framework of the unity  independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-alignment of the island of Cyprus. Such a solution would guarantee in full equality the political  civil and religious rights of the two communities constituting the people of Cyprus.63.	With regard to the Korean question  my delegation reiterates its firm position that the Korean people must be entirely free to unite North and South Korea without any foreign interference or pressure  in accordance with the three principles set forth in the joint Declaration of the two parties of 4 July 1972   namely independence  peaceful reunification and great national unity.64.	The arms race and the stockpiling of conventional and nuclear weapons  their development and production  continue to threaten international peace and security all over the world. It is an important factor contributing to increased tension in international relations. Disarmament has become a matter to which the international community  represented by the United Nations  attaches the greatest importance. Consequently  specific and serious measures must be adopted in order to achieve that aim  ensure general and complete disarmament  and divert the manpower and funds spent on armaments  their stockpiling  development and manufacture  to solving the economic crises besetting the world  and more particularly the developing countries. My country welcomed the signing of the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States of America reached as a result of the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks [SALT].  We consider it to be a first step  to be followed by other more positive steps that would lead to disarmament and spare mankind the risk of a third world war and of a nuclear confrontation which would destroy all man's great achievements in the field of culture  civilization and construction. That is why we renew our sincere appeal to the great Powers  particularly the super-Powers  to place the enormous resources being devoted to arms and instruments of destruction at the service of the peoples  particularly those of the developing countries  in order to help them raise their standards of living and thus strengthen the chances of peace and security in the world.65.	We have  since its first session  followed very closely the discussions in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and participated in the work of its resumed eighth session  held in New York from 19 July to 24 August 1979. We also took part in the meetings held by the negotiating groups 6 and 7âset up by the Second Committee  We wish  in this connexion  to make the following comments. First  the resumed eighth session of the Conference  despite the difficulties that had accumulated from previous sessions  did chalk up certain successes with regard to the rewording of the composite text and formalizing it to ensure its adoption as the final text of the Convention. Secondly  the Arab delegations  in the course of the sixth session  held in New York  submitted a proposal that the continental shelf be limited to 200 nautical miles. Our delegation and the Arab group were disappointed that the proposal was not included in the revised composite text. Thirdly  the shabby attempt by some delegations to cast doubt on the legal claim of liberation movements to sign and ratify the convention is contrary to the tenets of international law reaffirming the sovereign rights of non-independent territories over their natural resources. This principle has been endorsed by the United Nations in its resolutions on the subject  particularly the resolution on the right of peoples to permanent sovereignty over their natural resources.66.	The present state of international economic relations is a reflection of the unhealthy economic structure. This has had negative repercussions on the rates of economic growth in the developing countries. It has led to a constant widening of the gap between the developing and the developed countries. This situation has had repercussions also on the negotiations for the restructuring of international economic relations on the bases of equality and justice. Our delegation wishes to state again that the industrialized countries that continue to export the problems of inflation and unemployment to the developing countries must exercise maximum control over those problems and must be receptive to the sincere appeal for co-operation made by the developing countries  particularly the constructive proposals they submitted during the fifth session of UNC- TAD for the establishment of a new international economic order on the bases of justice and equality.67.	In regard to the invitation extended to the General Assembly to hold a special session in 1980 on the question of international development and then to declare the beginning of the third development decade  my country believes that there must be intense and sincere efforts by Member States  and particularly by the developed countries  to achieve the aims of a third development decade. In that respect  we would point out that the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174 has not yet made any significant progress because of the negative attitude of some industrialized countries. In our opinion  that is an obstacle to the efforts to declare the year 1980 the beginning of the third development decade; it will ensure that there will be no end to the stifling economic crisis from which the international community is suffering.68.	We have noted with some satisfaction that there is a consensus on the fact that the new international development strategy must form a common framework for all the national efforts made by the developing and the developed countries and must serve as a field for international co-operation. In our opinion  the new strategy should include the elements contained in General Assembly resolution 33/193. In particular  stress must be placed on the methods for the economic restructuring of the developing countries  in conformity with the principles of the new international economic order. The new strategy must also be designed to achieve the aims of that new order.69.	We wish to state the following once again. First  economic relations must be reorganized on the bases of justice and equality. Secondly  the developing countries must be given the opportunity to participate effectively in the drafting and application of resolutions concerning development and financial and technical co-operation. Thirdly  there must be respect for the principle of the right of States to exercise complete control over their natural resources. Fourthly  there must be a reaffirmation of the principle of collective participation and of the promotion of the role of women and youth in the process of local and regional development. Fifthly  the price of manufactured products exported by the developed countries must be stabilized  and some equality must be established in trade relations  through the abolition of protectionist policies. Sixthly  a study must be made of practical methods for settling the debt problem of the developing countries. Seventhly  the international monetary situation must be corrected through a review of the special agreements  special drawing rights  and so forth.70.	My delegation believes that the use by the developing countries of their resources  and co-operation among them  must form the basis of the establishment of a new international economic order  to complement co-operation with the developed countries. The least developed countries must have priority in the assistance to developing countries  through the drawing up of a plan of action and practical measures to  improve the economy of those countries and help them to develop their own resources. Thus they will be assured of at least a minimum standard of living and of assistance in overcoming the problems of inflation and mounting prices.71.	Before concluding this statement  I wish to draw attention to what the political leadership in my country has been doing to ensure stability and guarantee a free and dignified life for every citizen. In co-operation with the southern part of the Yemeni homeland  my country is making efforts to achieve the unity of Yemen  through the creation of economic bodies and a democratic atmosphere propitious to such unity. That was one of the objectives of the 26 September revolution in my country. From 2 to 4 October this year  the Presidents of the two Yemens met at San'a and reaffirmed the determination of the two parts of the country to spare no effort to put into effect the Cairo agreement of 28 October 1972  the Tripoli communiquÃ© of November 1972 and the Kuwait communiquÃ© of 30 March 1979 concerning the methods to achieve the peaceful unity of Yemen on sound democratic bases. We seek to intensify our common efforts to achieve economic integration  to ensure co-ordination and the harmonization of our development plans  and to encourage Arab and foreign investment  in conformity with our development plans  which are in the interests of Yemen and are designed to increase the well-being of our people.72.	I would stress here that the joint commission set up in accordance with the Cairo agreement and the Tripoli communiquÃ© is continuing its intensive efforts and is making considerable progress towards the achievement of our noble national objective and the establishment of conditions that can lead to the unity of the two Yemens: an aspiration of the masses of Yemeni people in the two sections of the country.73.	In the Yemen Arab Republic  our political leadership is convinced that our brothers and friends throughout the world will co-operate with us to ensure the success of the efforts being made by the Yemeni people and their national leaders to achieve this desired unity  which will serve as an element of stability and peace in the region and thereby contribute to the struggle of the Arab nation for its unity and for the recovery of all the occupied territories in Palestine and in other Arab countries now under the control of zionism and settler- colonialism.74.	The Yemen Arab Republic is devoting all its attention to the improvement of its economy and the living conditions of the people  but at the same time it recognizes that it has responsibilities in regard to the questions before the international community. For we have faith in the Charter and we hope to see the role and effectiveness of the United Nations strengthened so that all the problems may be solved and the cause of all the peoples may triumph  and so that those peoples may be enabled to exercise their rights to self-determination and national independence."
"142",7542,"YUG",34,1979,"ï»¿I should like to begin by paying homage to the memory of the late President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  Houari Boumediene  and the late President of the People's Republic of Angola  Agostinho Neto  with whose demise the world has lost two great leaders and champions of non-alignment  independence and the equality of peoples. These two men made an outstanding contribution to the realization of the ideals of the United Nations and of non-alignment.89.	It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you cordially  Mr. President  on your election as President of this session of the Assembly. All of us who know you appreciate your wisdom  your sound judgement and your dedication to the principles of the Charter. Because of this  we are convinced that your contribution to the success of our common endeavours will be a significant one. Our satisfaction is all the greater in that you represent the non-aligned United Republic of Tanzania  with which my country maintains very friendly relations and shares the same objectives and values.90.	I wish also to avail myself of this opportunity to pay a tribute to the President of the thirty-third session of the General Assembly  Mr. Indalecio Lie'vano  the representative of friendly Colombia  for his dedicated discharge of his responsible duty.91.	Allow me also to pay due credit to the distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his tireless work in promoting the aims of our Organization and in strengthening its role in world affairs. Many positive achievements over the past years will remain linked to his name. It is a special honour for all of us to have had the privilege of collaborating with him.92.	This Assembly is faced with very important issues. Once again  we have an opportunity to demonstrate our readiness to work for the advancement of mutual respect and better understanding among us  and this is a prerequisite for the success of our endeavours at this session.93.	May I emphasize  as have many previous speakers  that I see particular importance in this General Assembly. The current session offers us the opportunity to deal not only with the affairs of a single year  but to review in retrospect our achievements and our failures over the past decade.94.	At the moment of transition of this decade to the next  our world presents a motley picture indeed.95.	We can say  however  that our Organization has dealt honourably with the many challenges it has faced. In this period  our Organization has become almost universal. This is demonstrated not only by the continually increasing number of Members  but also by the fact that it more faithfully reflects the world in which we live today.96.	We can frankly say that this is primarily the merit of the non-aligned movement  which considers that it is in its own vital interest to ensure greater respect for the United Nations  to strengthen its role and to enable it to work more effectively. Owing to this  many significant results were achieved over the past decade. Many questions of crucial importance to the life of the world community have been broached. All of this shows that the world is changing.97.	The aspirations of nations to freedom and independence  to equality and active participation in international affairs  have increased enormously. This growth  moreover  has not been limited to aspirations. It has given rise to the increased readiness of peoples and countries to fight in order to take their fate and the world's destiny into their own hands.98.	No people will submit to domination. The liberation struggle against all forms of dependence and subjugation is gaining momentum throughout the world. This is attested to by the successes achieved by the peoples of Palestine  southern Africa  Nicaragua  Iran  Panama and others in their struggles for independence  national identity and sovereignty.99.	This general process of abolishing privileged relationships and of emancipating peoples is most clearly expressed in  and most powerfully supported by  the strengthening of the policy and the movement of non- alignment.100.	The hopes and expectations of mankind have not  however  been entirely fulfilled. We still find ourselves in the midst of a difficult battle with the proponents of acquired privileges  various forms of interference and domination.101.	The world is still torn by many contradictions and burdened with many dangers. Bloc division tends to become a general and permanent state of world relations. The arms race has taken on the character of uncontrolled madness. A deep chasm separates those who enjoy the blessings of the greatest achievements of industrial and technological development  whose wealth multiplies from year to year  and those to whom poverty  disease  hunger and ignorance are a way of life. 102.	Old and new forms of imperialism  colonialism and other forms of foreign domination and hegemony are persistently trying to maintain themselves. The policy of spheres of interest  great-Power rivalry  various forms of interference and the use of force in international relations threaten the independence of many peoples.103.	Acute world crises fraught with constant danger to world peace are not being solved. The consequences are evident. The fragile peace and stability in the world depend on a balance of power and fear; detente is still stagnating; the North-South dialogue on the new international economic order has not yet emerged from the phase of confrontation; conflicts between the East and the West are being spread to non-aligned areas of the world.104.	The inheritance of a difficult past dangerously burdens our present. The gap between ideals and reality is often disappointingly great. We have now reached the dividing line between two decades. Rarely in history has a single decade brought so many uncertainties and at the same time offered so many possibilities for true progress.105.	The course that we follow from this cross-roads depends on us alone  on our readiness to change what we have inherited from the past and to bear responsibility for what will be tomorrow. That is what mankind expects of us. If we did not do this  history would not be able to pardon our failure.106.	None but the United Nations is called upon to offer hope and support to those who rightly expect them of us.107.	I believe that one of the most urgent questions on which we should reach full agreement is the elimination of the remnants of colonialism  particularly in Africa. From the moral and human standpoint  we can say the worst about that abhorrent anachronism of our time. However  this is not only a moral or human question; it is  essentially  a political one. What must we do to bring this shame to an end?108.	The answer is clear. We must decisively espouse the cause of the peoples of southern Africa and help them by all possible means to achieve  at the earliest possible moment  their sovereign right to freedom  independence and social progress.109.	The non-aligned movement has devoted great attention to the liquidation of colonialism on African soil. Important decisions were taken at the recent meetings in Maputo  Colombo and Havana. Under your able guidance  Mr. President  the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples reached conclusions along the same lines at its recent meeting in Belgrade. 110.	At all those meetings there was a unanimous feeling that  if it wishes to preserve its self-respect  the world community can no longer afford to delay tearing out from the annals of human history the shameful page of colonialism  racism and apartheid.111.	We do  of course  believe that every political possibility of arriving at a peaceful solution should be given a chance. It would  however  be unforgivable if we were to allow this to be misused for the purpose of thwarting the struggle of peoplesâin this case the peoples of Namibia and Zimbabweâfor their national liberation. Let us spell this out clearly.112.	We should commit ourselves to supporting the legitimate right of those peoplesâincluding full support to SWAPO and the Patriotic Frontâin their efforts to achieve their freedom through armed struggle. We must express our solidarity with and support for the frontline States in their resistance to the constant aggression perpetrated by the racist regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury. We are in duty bound to take all necessary measures  including the use of peace-keeping forces or the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter. We have to emphasize the responsibility of those who for selfish reasons continue to co-operate with the racist regimes and thereby prolong their existence and encourage their obstinacy.113.	In my view  it is not necessary to enumerate here the concrete measures to be taken in this connexion since they are known to us all. It seems to me more important to point out the essence of the problem  the substance of our option and the thrust of our action.114.	Another global crisis is the one in the Middle East. There we are faced with tolerance of brutal aggression and the impermissible denial of the legitimate sovereign right of a people to self-determination and independence.115.	I wish to point out that it is the consistent position of my country that no aggression and occupation can be condoned or rewarded. That is why we are consistently demanding that the international community and our Organization take energetic measures for the elimination of Israeli aggression and its grave consequences.116.	We must be aware of our responsibility not only towards the peoples that are the immediate victims but also towards mankind  whose interests are threatened by the continuation of this aggression.117.	Let me reiterate our well-known positions. First  Israel must withdraw from all the Arab territories occupied in the 1967 war. Secondly  the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people to self- determination  to return to their homeland  to independence and to their own State must be recognized. This includes recognition and acceptance of the PLO as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Thirdly  only a lasting  just and comprehensive settlement can ensure peace and security for all the countries of that area  including Israel  as well as the inviolability of their borders.118.	Experience has taught us that separate roads and agreements do not lead to this goal. On the contrary  Israel makes use of them to deny totally the rights of the Palestinian people  to commit new acts of aggression against the neighbouring Arab States and to usurp Arab land.119.	It is high time to reverse the course of events. We believe that that is possible if we demonstrate greater determination and a higher degree of political realism in our approach to this crisis. There are certain positive signs  primarily those which indicate the readiness of a growing number of European countries to recognize the national rights of the Palestinian people and to accept the PLO as the legitimate negotiator on an equal footing.120.	If we were to add those new elements to the existing resolutions and decisions of the world Organization  I am convinced that that would be a way out of the blind alley in which we still find ourselves.121.	I should also like to address myself to another problem that has the elements of a global crisis. That is the crisis in South-East Asia  where  regrettably  military interventions have taken place  transforming the entire area into a new focal-point of instability. This has brought about unforeseeable dangers to peace and security not only in the area but also in the world at large.122.	It seems to me that  at this moment  the most important thing is to reaffirm the principles that can lead to the solution of this crisis and  at the same time  guarantee to all countries of the region an equal right to peace  security and internal development of their own.123.	This is possible only if intervention and the use of force are brought to an end; if foreign occupation is ended and foreign troops withdrawn; if the independence and sovereignty of the peoples are respected; and if the peoples involved are accorded the exclusive right to choose their own system of government and way of life without outside interference.124.	It would be very dangerous if we were to endorse the thesis of good or bad  justified or unjustified  foreign military intervention. In that case we would bring in question not only justice but the very basis on which the stability of international relations rests.125.	We are profoundly convinced that the full and inviolable sovereignty of nations is the supreme law of international relations. No one has the right to call it in question in any way or on any ground whatsoever.126.	I am convinced that only within the framework of such a peaceful  just and comprehensive settlement of the crisis in South-East Asia would it be also possible to do away with foreign interference and the imposition of alien interests upon the peoples of the area.127.	Within this context  we could also solve other difficult problems confronting the peoples of that region  such as the question of refugees  hunger and other Forms of suffering and deprivation.128.	The principles that I have set out in respect of the aforementioned global crises also inspire Yugoslavia's attitude towards so-called regional and local crises.129.	The right to self-determination  to independence and sovereignty without foreign interference must be consistently applied in the case of Cyprus  Korea  Western Sahara and wherever the same problems and the same values are involved.130.	The perpetuation of the Cyprus crisis deprives an independent and non-aligned country of its sovereign rights and has negative repercussions on stability in the Mediterranean. We firmly believe that a just and durable solution of this crisis can only be found through peaceful means  by implementing the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. This calls for agreement between the two communities leading to the safeguarding of the independence  sovereignty  unity  territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of Cyprus and ensuring the equality and well-being of those two communities and the harmony of their life together.131.	We also support the constructive and positive efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at achieving the peaceful unification of the Korean people and strengthening the independent and non-aligned position of that country.132.	The. question of Western Sahara is one of decolonization which must be solved on the basis of self- determination in accordance with the principles and resolutions of the United Nations and the decisions of the Organization of African Unity and of the non- aligned movement.133.	Peace and stability in the world do not depend only on the solution of the most acute crises. But the settlement of those crises would be facilitated by a more profound and comprehensive process of relaxation of tensions. 134.	Speaking of detente  we are primarily concerned with matters affecting peace and general security in the world. This is vital not only because peace forestalls devastations caused by war  but because it provides an environment for the successful struggle of peoples for independence  equality and progress.135.	If detente did not serve this end  it would become either a vehicle for preserving the existing privileges and injustices of the old international order  or else it would enable the strongest Powers  and their respective bloc groupings  to settle their relations to the detriment of the rest of the world.136.	We view the relaxation of tensions as a universal process demanding from all of us special efforts. It makes it incumbent upon the United Nations to engage in continual action aimed at consolidating peaceful coexistence as a basis for friendly relations among countries; it requires efforts in the field of disarmament and the establishment of the new international economic order.137.	Within this context  I should like to make some observations regarding Europe  a continent which used to be the stage of world confrontations and the source of world wars in the past.138.	On the one hand  it is in Europe that bloc alignments confront each other most directly  with their sophisticated military hardware. On the other  the process of relaxation of tensions in Europe has achieved tangible results  in the wake of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The non- aligned and neutral countries of Europe also have greatly contributed to this positive trend.139.	It would be difficult  however  to conceive of stable and positive trends in Europe unless they encompassed  in the same way  the other regions of the world.140.	Yugoslavia  as a non-aligned country  consistently applies the principles of non-alignment in its European policy and in relations with its neighbours as well. The assertion of these principles on the European continent  which is becoming increasingly evident  also demonstrates the universal character of the policy of non-alignment.141.	Disarmament and the new economic relations are among the pressing issues confronting the contemporary world. However  it is significant that conditions have already become ripe for a quest for a meaningful solution of these problems. This is one of the major achievements of the persistent struggle that the non-aligned movement has waged toward this end.142.	The tenth special session of the General Assembly  which was devoted to disarmament  was an important event of our time. Notwithstanding certain important initial achievements concerned primarily with the involvement of the United Nations in disarmament  the other results have not been too encouraging.143.	I believe that we should continue with a resolute political action to accelerate the process leading toward genuine disarmament. This applies to all means of mass destruction; both to nuclear strategic and tactical weapons and to biochemical  radiological and conventional weapons  whose destructive power has been increased tremendously since the Second World War. In this respect  I should like to mention the second round of SALT as a good sign.144.	In the coming phase we should  in my opinion  pay greater attention to the substantive work of the Disarmament Commission and to the removal of the obstacles which  as a consequence of big-Power rivalry  obstruct the work of the Committee on Disarmament.145.	Our priorities should also encompass full guarantees to countries which do not produce nuclear weapons  the prohibition of the use of these weapons and the initiation of genuine nuclear disarmament. Otherwise  there is a danger that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will be transformed into the monopoly of those who possess nuclear weaponry or be misused as a monopoly for developing and using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This would lead to a new form of technological colonialism.146.	The issue of the liquidation of foreign military bases and military presence from other countries remains unresolved  as does that of confidence-building measures. Closely related to these are the issues of zones of peace  and co-operation  which we consider to be of exceptional importance. We therefore strongly support the establishment of such zones in the Mediterranean  in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere. The slow progress towards the genuine security and well-being of all mankind is also demonstrated by the absurdity of the aggravation of the economic crisis seen in relation to the enormous increase of expenditure on armaments.147.	The disquieting state of the world economy  the profound crisis of the international economic system and the persistent deterioration of the position of developing countries threaten to become a constant source of instability and new political tensions  with unpredictable consequences. The world has become so interdependent  especially in the economic field  that long-term solutions of common interest can be found only through equitable dialogue and over-all cooperation.148.	It is essential that the industrially and technologically most developed countries  which possess the greatest economic and financial potential  should desist from seeking partial solutions to their specific problems within closed economic groupings. It is also essential to realize that the true problem does not consist in finding culprits responsible for the inherited state of affairs  but that the new system of international economic relations should be accepted as a common need and a shared commitment of all.149.	Regrettably  even today we find ourselves at the point which we had reached five years ago when we adopted the Declaration and the Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. We can break this stalemate only through a persistent search for common solutions  which must encompass all the vital elements of the New International Economic Orderâranging from trade  commodities  manufacture and energy to finance  prices  transfer of technology and the elimination of all forms of discrimination.150.	This calls for greater activity by the Committee of the Whole Established under General Assembly Resolution 32/174; for a new round of global negotiations  which were initiated by the Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries; and for the elaboration of the strategy for the forthcoming development decade.151.	Human rights is one of the topics which has engaged the attention of this Assembly. We all know that this question has quite often been the subject of political confrontation. We have noted that the political aspect of human rights is fortunately ever more frequently linked with its economic and social aspects  which we consider to be a correct approach.152.	We should like  however  to go even further and to sound a warning that it is very difficult to promote human rights unless those rights are treated within the context of the right of nations to independence  sovereignty  free national development and the right to lead their own life without outside interference; unless those rights are treated within the context of racial equality; unless they are linked to the rights of national minorities  ethnic  religious and other groups; and unless they enable the individual to determine the conditions of his life and to be a free person without being exposed to any system of discrimination.153.	My country attaches exceptional importance to the role of the United Nations in solving the major problems which beset our world  in removing focal- points of crisis  in strengthening peace  security and equitable co-operation among peoples  and in democratizing international relations. 154.	In our view  the United Nations has an irreplaceable role to play in the new system of international political and economic relations. We must therefore continue to oppose the tendency of withdrawing vital global issues from the United Nations and of bypassing our Organization in solving them. Today  the United Nations is a genuinely universal Organization which faithfully reflects the situation in the world.155.	We do not wish to see the United Nations being used as a place for propaganda confrontation. We believe it is essential that this Assembly should be inspired by our common aspirations and readiness to create a climate of tolerance and confidence; that we should not conceal differences  but exert maximum goodwill so as to contribute to the full affirmation of the principles enshrined in the Charter when dealing with any specific issue that we have to consider.156.	The non-aligned movement has made its greatest contribution precisely to such a role for the United Nations. I am confident that the decisions adopted at the recently concluded Sixth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries will also contribute to the success of the present session of the General Assembly. We consider that the results of the summit meeting are positive. First and foremost  the Conference reaffirmed the authentic principles and objectives of the policy and movement of non- alignment as an independent  non-bloc factor which plays a significant and irreplaceable role in international relations. The non-aligned countries have thereby strengthened the basis on which they can continue to build their solidarity and unity.157.	We rightly entertain great hopes and hold the firm belief that genuine progress is possible. Let us persevere in our quest for peace and security in the world. Let us exert maximum efforts so that the world of tomorrow may be a world of justice  independence  equality and progress for all."
"143",7608,"ZMB",34,1979,"ï»¿I wish at the outset to pay a tribute to the late President Agostinho Neto of the People's Republic of Angola  whose untimely death has robbed Africa and the world of an eminent statesman and a gallant freedom fighter. The late Dr. Neto and the MPLA Workersâ Party  which he led  had worked very closely with our party  the United National Independence Party  during the long struggle for the independence of Angola. The close co-operation between the two parties and Governments of Angola and Zambia continues to this day. The late Angolan leader was a selfless and tireless revolutionary who fought side by side with the rank and file of MPLA fighters. His approach should be an inspiration to us all. Indeed Dr. Neto was a man of principle who practised what he believed in. The party  Government and people of Zambia  who were represented at the funeral by His Excellency President Kaunda  join our brothers and sisters in mourning the loss of that truly great man.322.	On behalf of the Zambian delegation  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your most deserved election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. Africa is proud of you. You are a distinguished son of that continent. You have established your place in international forums through diplomatic skill  humility  political candour and acumen. I need not refer here to the well-known brotherly relations between your country  the United Republic of Tanzania  and my own country  Zambia  and indeed to our efforts together with the other front-line States in the struggle for the liberation of our oppressed brothers and sisters in southern Africa.323.	I also wish to take this opportunity to pay a deserved tribute to your predecessor  Indalecio Lievano  who presided over the thirty-third session of the General Assembly with dedication and competence.324.	The Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has continued to carry out his functions with characteristic determination and diplomatic skill. My delegation wishes him well in his efforts aimed at bringing about understanding and peace among the nations of the world.325.	Let me take this opportunity to welcome Saint Lucia  a fellow Commonwealth country  on its admission to membership in the United Nations. With the admission of its one hundred and fifty-second Member  the United Nations has moved closer to the realization of the goal of universality.326.	Your presidency  Sir  has come on the threshold of a new eraâthe dawning of the 1980s. During the decade ending this year  the United Nations has continued to grapple with the manifold issues for which it was founded. Some of these were inherited by the United Nations at its inception  while others have been brought before it in recent years.327.	Undoubtedly there has been significant progress in some areas  but a number of issues are being carried over into the agenda of the next decade. The challenge for the United Nations in that next decade is to bring success to the manifold issues which have been perennial issues on our agenda.328.	In addressing the age-old problems there is a need for innovation and institutional adaptation  be it in the political  economic  social  cultural or humanitarian spheres. In the absence of the necessary will to act  only pessimism will prevail. Let us all resolve to make the next decade an era of greater co-operation and understanding in the search for solutions to problems afflicting mankind.329.	This session of the General Assembly takes place barely three weeks after the historic Sixth Conference of the non-aligned countries  held in Havana. We can all be justly inspired by the proven determination of the non-aligned countries to continue making a positive and decisive contribution to the search for a new world order  based on principles of equity and justice. The declarations adopted by the non-aligned Conference accurately reflect the contemporary global situation. Zambia is proud to belong to the non-aligned movement  which we are convinced will remain a dynamic and indispensable force in international relations. The rapid increase in the membership of the movement is a reflection of a universal recognition of the validity of its principles and objectives.330.	Mr President  in your opening statement you gave a clear message about the present economic situation facing the world. The world economic situation is still characterized by the prevalence of poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy for most of the developing countries on the one hand  and a sense of uncertainty in the developed world on the other. Furthermore  there is a trend towards increasing inequality which continues to characterize existing international economic relations. My delegation shares fully the sense of disappointment with the continuing deterioration of the international economic situation. A new chapter must be opened in transforming the unfinished major issues on the agenda of the new international economic order into reality.331.	The international community is at the crossroads in the fields of development and international economic relations. It is evident that in spite of previous efforts  virtually every item on the agenda of economic relations is a problem area. These items include terms of trade  prices of primary or basic commodities  the flow of resources and debt-servicing  transactions in technology  the industrialization of developing countries  food and energy  a code of conduct for transnational corporations and the issue of collective self-reliance. In addition  high inflation  unemployment and high energy costs continue to menace our economies  thereby retarding development.332.	The North-South dialogue  which began some five years ago  is hardly achieving any discernible results. So far  several major world conferences have been held with the sole objective of working out a more appropriate mechanism on which new international relations will be based. Regrettably  progress in this regard has been disappointing.333.	We in Zambia realize that in order to achieve the goal of economic development we require collective effort. All nations have to contribute meaningfully if this common effort is to be achieved. The goal of eliminating poverty and other economic injustices is a moral issue which concerns all nations regardless of the history of the root-cause of the evils in question.334.	Certain States such as the industrialized nations enjoy a dominant position in international trade  finance and industrial production. These countries have the obligation to be more forthcoming in negotiations on specific issues related to the new economic order.335.	What I have stated should be the basis for negotiations  whether they are in the Committee of the Whole  UNCTAD  the United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development or in the Preparatory Committee for the New International Development Strategy. While some progress has been registered on such items as the Common Fund and the conversion of UNIDO into a specialized agency  it is regrettable that there is a stalemate on several issues in the North-South negotiations.336.	For our part we accord high priority to those programmes and projects designed to achieve self- reliant development and to forge mutual co-operation with other developing countries in various fields of common interest  including the critical areas of trade  transport and communications.337.	I wish to point out that our efforts to realize our economic potential are being hampered  inter alia  by adverse external forces. These include the war situation and conflict in southern Africa  our geographical position as a land-locked country and the decline in the relative prices of basic commodities in addition to the precarious world economic situation. The Secretary- General's report on assistance to Zambia  to be considered at this session  is a catalogue of our formidable challenges.338.	The question of human rights is a matter to which we in Zambia have always attached great importance. We have not hesitated to make our voice heard where- ever and whenever there has been evidence of violations of human rights. This is in accord with our national philosophy of humanism  which stands for respect for the worth of man and the sanctity of human life. In this regard  we are gratified at the growing universal concern for human rights.339.	Zambia continues to be seriously concerned at the situation in the Middle East. The situation in that volatile region is as serious as it is explosive. It has been established beyond any doubt that the obnoxious policy of settlements in occupied Arab territories is synonymous with colonization  imperialist aggrandizement and expansionism. Israel has no right whatsoever to occupy Arab lands on the West Bank  Gaza and the Golan Heights.340.	As we have always stated  the core of the Middle East conflict is the continued denial of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. That Palestinians are entitled both to a State of their own and to the full realization of self-determination and independence is an indisputable fact. It is indeed ironic that Jews  who were victims of the holocaust in Europe during the Second World War  should today be unleashing a holocaust against Palestinians. In addition  Israel is in league with the racist minority regimes of southern Africa and has emerged as one of the sources of military equipment for them  which they use in their oppression of the black majority and in committing acts of aggression against front-line States  including my own country  Zambia.341.	In the interest of peace in the Middle East  Israel should withdraw forthwith from all the Arab lands which it has occupied by force since 1967. The seizure of foreign lands by force is not admissible in international law. Israel must co-operate with the United Nations in the implementation of the relevant resolutions of this Assembly and the Security Council which provide a realistic framework for bringing about a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Israel should also  as a matter of urgency  dismantle all the Jewish settlements which it has established on Arab lands.342.	Furthermore  the situation in the Middle East cannot be resolved if the people of Palestine  through the PLO  their sole and legitimate representative  are excluded from any peace process. To do so would be to engage in self-deception.343.	In May of this year all peace-loving countries were gratified by a trend towards positive developments in Cyprus. There was hope when we learned that the intercommunal talks  which were presided over by the United Nations Secretary-General  had resulted in a plan to deal with the problem. However  the lack of progress in resolving the outstanding issues has been a retrogressive step. In a situation of incessant conflict  lack of progress leads to deterioration. In the case of Cyprus  the deterioration of the already tense situation could have grave consequences for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the island.344.	Zambia urges the parties to the dispute to redouble their efforts to resolve the problem of Cyprus. The independence of Cyprus and its non-alignment should not be compromised. Moreover  the problem of Cyprus has implications which go far beyond the borders of that island. I wish to appeal for strict adherence to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus.345.	My Government is equally concerned at the developments in South-East Asia. The people of that region have been victims of wars of aggression for far too long. We have stated our wish that after decades of war the nations and peoples of South-East Asia should live in peace. As a result of fighting in the area  the toll of human lives and the extent of suffering have been astounding and they continue unabated. The international community has a duty to attend to the plight of human beings who have been displaced as a result of conflicts in that region and elsewhere.346.	We express the hope that the countries of the region will dedicate their efforts to finding a just and durable solution to the problem. We also appeal to all States to refrain from exacerbating the conflict and uphold the principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other States  in the interest of peace and security in the region.347.	With regard to Korea  I wish to reiterate my Government's strong support for the efforts towards the peaceful reunification of that peninsula. It is Zambia's view that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from South Korea  because their presence is not conducive to a search for a just and lasting settlement.348.	My Government has continued to follow closely developments in connexion with Western Sahara. We have done our best to encourage the efforts of the Organization of African Unity to find a just settlement. We warmly congratulate the Government of Mauritania for the wise decision it has taken to renounce all claims to Western Sahara and to withdraw its military forces from the Territory. We maintain the view that the people of Western Sahara have the right to genuine self-determination and independence.349.	In recent years the international community has directed its efforts at combating racism and other forms of prejudice which are inimical to the lives of the oppressed people and to the promotion of harmonious relations among them. It is for this reason that all forms of institutionalized racism and oppression that are epitomized in the South African policy of apartheid have been called a crime against humanity.350.	All the principles of civilized conduct that are enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in the norms of international law are being violated daily in South Africa  Namibia and Rhodesia. The majority in those countries are being denied their basic rights. The root-cause of the problem is the continuing existence of racist white minority regimes.351.	The ancestors of the present-day racist minority rulers settled in southern Africa by force of arms and deceit. They have ruled over the majority of African people through terrorism and violence. They continue to maintain their reign of terror in South Africa  Namibia and Rhodesia by force. While holding the African people in bondage  the racists and their fellow conspirators and supporters are pillaging and exploiting the abundant natural and human resources of the countries under their occupation.352.	As a result the indigenous people are wallowing in abject poverty and degradation. Africans are used by southern African racist regimes as a source of cheap labour. The racist minority regimes are also concocting so-called internal settlements in the hope of using Africans as a front in the service of the white racists. This shows the stubborn determination of the racist regimes to perpetuate themselves in power at the expense of the black majority. This is repugnant and untenable. It is for that reason that the oppressed people are fighting to overthrow the system of oppression and to regain their' dignity and inalienable rights.353.	The racist rulers  in addition to oppressing Africans inside the countries which they occupy  are also seeking to make southern Africa safe for racist oppression and exploitation by committing wanton and murderous acts of aggression against the front-line States of Angola  Mozambique  Botswana and Zambia.354.	In these heinous attacks  the Rhodesian and South African forces have murdered innocent nationals of our countries. They have also killed thousands of refugees who have fled from tyranny and whom we allow to live in our countries on humanitarian grounds. Children  women and old men and the sick in refugee centres have been the victims of those sadistic and callous racist soldiers. It is even more tragic that these refugees are still being pursued under the pretext of self-defence or pre-emptive attacks on the part of the racists.355.	By attacking the front-line States  the racist regimes are in fact violating our sovereignty and territorial integrity. Their attacks have been premeditated acts of unprovoked aggression. We are aware that their aim is to trigger an international war which would engulf the entire region.356.	We have stated all alongâand let me repeat this hereâthat apartheid-ruled South Africa is at the core of the problems of decolonizing Namibia and Rhodesia. There is no doubt that the maintenance of the apartheid system is a challenge both to the United Nations and to civilized mankind. Until the South African ruling clique agrees to live in the present rather than in the past  the oppressed people there will continue to fight for their inalienable rights. But South Africa continues to remain both intransigent and aggressive. The Pretoria regime is arming itself at an unprecedented pace in history.357.	Regrettably  some States Members of our Organization continue to provide the Pretoria regime with arms and ammunition and to collaborate with it in the nuclear field. My delegation strongly condemns such collaboration  which is not only immoral but also contrary to numerous United Nations resolutions. We call upon all States to desist forthwith from any form of collaboration with the Pretoria regime since such collaboration is inimical to the welfare of the oppressed people and indeed encourages South Africa in its aggressive policies against sovereign  independent African States.358.	Within South Africa itself  the Pretoria regime is widening and hatching even more obnoxious schemes for consolidating apartheid. In defiance of the international community  South Africa only last month granted bogus independence to the Venda Bantustan. This follows the pattern of so-called Bophuthatswana and Transkei. The independence of Bantustans exists only as a figment of the imagination of the Afrikaner rulers in Pretoria. To all sane people  these Bantustans remain an integral part of South African territory because South Africa is one and indivisible. As if the repression of the African were not repugnant enough  the Pretoria racists have also intensified their scheme of uprooting Africans from the lands which are designated as ""white areas"". There is a new war of eviction in South Africa. Internally  South Africa is also perfecting itself as a police state in which there is no rule of law.359.	With the dawn of the 1980s  the international community must devise new strategies as to how to end apartheid. All concerted efforts must be made to end all forms of collaboration with the apartheid regime in the interest of peace. I wish to reaffirm Zambia's support for the struggle of the oppressed people of South Africa under the leadership of their national liberation movement. I urge this Assembly and the international community as a whole to demonstrate its abhorrence of the system of apartheid in South Africa through concrete forms of support for the liberation struggle. In this regard  it is urgent that we give effect to the numerous United Nations resolutions on apartheid. The situation in South Africa calls for concrete action rather than words.360.	As we know  the Pretoria regime not only maintains a policy of apartheid in South Africa itself  but is also responsible for the crisis which emanates from its occupation and militarization of Namibia in utter defiance of the United Nations.361.	The question of resolving the independence of Namibia is urgent. In the last two and a half years  there have been intensive and extensive negotiations and consultations which were aimed at bringing about a settlement in Namibia through free and fair elections under United Nations supervision and control. The efforts in this regard emanated from Security Council resolution 385 (1976)  which resulted in a concrete proposal for the settlement of the Namibian question  Both the proposal and the report by the Secretary- General of the United Nations on its implementation were endorsed by the Security Council in its resolution 435 (1978). Namibia would today be on the threshold of independence if the proposal based on the report of the Secretary-General had been implemented. Had it not been for the intransigence of South Africa  the United Nations Transition Assistance Group would today be at work in Namibia.362.	The state of paralysis that now exists on the issue is due to the refusal by the South African regime to accept the report of the Secretary-General and to cooperate in its implementation. Once again  South Africa is intransigent and is seeking to defy the United Nations on Namibia as it has done for decades. Indeed  South Africa has acted deceitfully.363.	What is equally disturbing is that South Africa is intent on confronting the international community with a situation of fait accompli by imposing its puppets of the so-called Democratic Turnhalle Alliance on Namibia. In this regard  South Africa has set up an illegal National Assembly.364.	In its frantic attempts to impose a so-called internal settlement in Namibia  South Africa has intensified its brutal repression against members of SWAPO  who are harassed  detained  imprisoned and tortured on a continuing basis. Scores of SWAPO leaders have been jailed in an attempt to destroy it because of its steadfast opposition to the machinations of South Africa and the Pretoria regime.365.	The significance of the diplomatic initiative of the last two and a half years is that it involved five major Western countries which have traditionally collaborated with South Africa. Those of us who repeatedly called upon the West to desist from their policies of collaboration with and support for South Africa welcomed this initiative as a positive and hopeful development. We fully co-operated with the five Western countries and the Secretary-General to ensure the success of the initiative. SWAPO  which is universally recognized as the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people  was exemplary in its conduct during the lengthy period of the negotiations. SWAPO pursued the negotiations and made significant compromises in spite of repeated provocations by South Africa  such as the Kassinga massacre in Angola and several unilateral actions by the Pretoria regime  notably the appointment of the so-called Administrator- General  the registration of voters and the holding of sham elections in December of last year.366.	In our view  the phase of negotiations is over. What remains is the implementation of the report of the Secretary-General. Those who have initiated the plan for the independence of Namibia have  above all  the responsibility to ensure its implementation. They have the duty to ensure South Africa's compliance. They have the responsibility to deliver South Africa. They have always advocated negotiations to resolve the problems of southern Africa. Now let them prove the efficacy of negotiations. They must make their approach work.367.	We have never been against negotiations. The racist minority regimes of southern Africa have always frustrated negotiations. The challenge to the West now is either to get South Africa to co-operate in the implementation of their proposal or to join with the other members of the international community in ostracizing the Pretoria regime and compelling it to comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions.368.	Let me also take this opportunity to stress the need for the international community to increase its material support for SWAPO  which is the only liberation movement in Namibia. The intransigence of the Pretoria regime surely leaves the people of Namibia  under the leadership of SWAPO  with no option but to intensify their armed struggle for national liberation. South Africa must not be allowed to destroy the people of Namibia and SWAPO. The vicious system of illegal South African occupation of Namibia must be eradicated. I wish  on this occasion  to reaffirm Zambia's full support for General Assembly resolution 33/206  which was adopted at the resumed thirty-third session in May of this year. If freedom cannot come to Namibia by peaceful means  it must come through the armed struggle of its people  supported by the international community in concrete and generous material terms.369.	The fundamental problem of how to decolonize and transform Rhodesia into Zimbabwe is still with us. As each hour passes the deteriorating situation in Rhodesia brings more concern. The casualty rate in the war of independence is increasing by the hour. This is in addition to the scores of hundreds of Zimbabweans who have been murdered by Rhodesian forces in refugee centres in the neighbouring front-line States of Angola  Botswana  Mozambique and my own country  Zambia. Surely  if human life is still sacrosanct  if human suffering is to be mitigated and ameliorated  then the hour is at hand for resolving the Rhodesian problem.370.	Rhodesia is Zimbabwe to be. Detractors of the cause of Zimbabwe have had the audacity to give a nickname or surname to Zimbabwe. But this is not the issue. What is at stake is how to bring legal independence under genuine majority rule to Zimbabwe. Present-day Rhodesia remains a British colony ruled by settlers who happen to be die-hard racists.371.	Developments in Rhodesia since the last session of this Assembly have only worsened the situation. This was so because no meaningful attempts were made to resolve the root-cause of the problem of decolonizing Rhodesia. Debates shifted in the international forums  which focused mainly on irrelevant experiments  such as the so-called elections of April  which culminated in thrusting forward a black man as a front for the Salisbury racists. The fundamental structure of racist oppression was left intact.372.	In spite of the political gimmicks of the Muzorewa-Smith regime  no Government in the world has accorded them any recognition. To be sure  Muzorewa and Smith did pander to the conservative lobbies of this world. But reason and wisdom still prevailed.373.	Concerted efforts were also made to have sanctions against Rhodesia lifted unilaterally by some Western countries. This trick has also not paid off. Here again  we hope that reason will prevail to ensure that sanctions imposed by the Security Council against Rhodesia will be maintained until genuine independence is achieved.374.	Mr. President  as the Assembly may be aware  the Rhodesian regime has persisted in committing acts of aggression against the front-line States. The Rhodesians have launched repeated  premeditated attacks and raids against us which have resulted in heavy casualties. Their crude tactics have been acts of outright provocation against us. They are in themselves acts of desperation by the white racists who know that they cannot and will not win the war  in spite of the overt and covert support they enjoy from imperialist forces as evidenced by the involvement in the Rhodesian army of thousands of mercenaries and  indeed  the continued acquisition by the rebel forces of large quantities of sophisticated military equipment.375.	The people of Zimbabwe have remained un-daunted on their determination to overthrow the oppressive regime in their country. Thousands upon thousands of them have swelled the ranks of the liberation movement  the Patriotic Front. They are dealing heavy blows on the demoralized Rhodesian military forces on a daily basis. The impact of the war of liberation has sent thousands of whites fleeing from Rhodesia.376.	Mr. President  the Commonwealth Heads of Government recognized the gravity of the Rhodesian situation at their recent meeting in Lusaka. Confronted with the realities of the situation  they felt motivated to do their utmost urgently to seek a negotiated settlement in Zimbabwe  the basis of which can only be the transfer of power to the people of Zimbabwe through genuine black majority rule and independence. Those who had advocated the lifting of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia and the recognition of the puppet regime realized that they were treading on dangerous ground. It dawned on them that such a course of action would not contribute at all to the solution of the Rhodesian problem. On the contrary  it would aggravate the situation  with serious consequences for international peace and security.377.	The United Kingdom  the colonial Power in Southern Rhodesia  accepted at the Lusaka Conference the need to exercise its constitutional responsibility. In accordance with the Commonwealth agreement on Zimbabwe  a Constitutional Conference involving all sides in the Rhodesian conflict  including the Patriotic Front  is now in progress in London under the chairmanship of the British Foreign Secretary. It is the hope of all the Commonwealth Governments that the Conference will succeed. If it succeeds  Southern Rhodesia will be ushered into a new era which could see it emerge into a genuinely independent State of Zimbabwe  acceptable to the international community.378.	The London Constitutional Conference could not have been possible without the effective armed struggle waged by the people of Zimbabwe under the leadership of the Patriotic Front. That Conference is unquestionably the direct product of the sacrifices of the Patriotic Front forces on the battlefield. It is the armed struggle that has generated and created the necessary conditions for the Conference to take place. What is now happening proves that armed struggle and negotiations are not mutually exclusive. If the Conference should fail  the war of liberation in Zimbabwe will be intensified by the Patriotic Front. I urge the international community not to relax its support for the Patriotic Front.379.	In conclusion  I wish to reiterate Zambia's commitment to the noble goals for which this Organization was established. We believe that the United Nations offers a unique framework for addressing the multiple challenges of our time  as well as creating opportunities for the future.380.	Let us move forward into the next decade with confidence. Let us proceed into a world that is safe and prosperous for all. Our generation should not fail future generations."
