"1",4,"AFG",29,1974,"Mr. President  permit me to convey to you the sincere congratulations of the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan on your election to the presidency of this twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly. It is a fitting tribute to your qualities as a statesman who has rendered distinguished service not only to your own country but also to the international community. Your election is also a well-deserved honor for your country  the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  with which our country enjoys the most cordial relations  and which has shown consistent support for the cause of the Movement of Non-aligned Countries and for the principles and aims of the Charter of the United Nations. We are confident that under your guidance this session of the General Assembly will be directed with distinction. We assure you of our full co-operation.46.	I also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express my delegation's deep gratitude to Mr. Leo-poldo Benites for the skillful and objective manner in which he guided the proceedings of both the twenty-eighth and the sixth special sessions. We wish to pay a warm tribute to him for the statesmanship and wisdom which he demonstrated.47.	I should like to extend to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  our deep appreciation of his untiring efforts to explore the possibilities for solutions to current crises.48.	On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan  I take this opportunity to welcome into our midst the new Members  namely  the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. The emergence of these independent countries and their entry into the United Nations  which we hail  is a direct outcome of the continued struggle waged by oppressed people  backed by the support of this world body . We wish these new Members a successful future and look forward to constructive collaboration with them in the Organization. We are confident that their contribution will enrich our efforts towards world peace and progress.49.	It is a particular pleasure for my delegation to see our neighbor in the region  the People's Re-public of Bangladesh  take its rightful place in this international body. The people of Afghanistan have strong ties of cordial friendship and brotherhood with the heroic people of Bangladesh. The emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation reflects the long-expected recognition of the inherent rights of its people and the realities prevailing in the region.50.	My Government wishes to express its sympathy with the Government of Honduras  whose people have suffered so recently in the wake of the natural disaster which has struck that country. We laud efforts by the international community to aid the victims of the hurricane.51.	The cardinal duty of this world Organization is the maintenance of international peace and security. Twenty-nine years have elapsed since the end of the Second World War. Thus far  another global war has been avoided  although on a number of occasions calamity has been checked only at the last hour. None the less  fear of the outbreak of violence and world conflagration should be shared by us all as long as the basic requirements for lasting peace and security throughout the world have not been achieved. Moreover  the inalienable rights of peoples to independence and self-determination  to freedom from alien domination  foreign occupation and exploitation have not been fully realized. Therefore  international peace and security remain only an ideal towards which this Organization shall continue to strive in vain.52.	We had hoped that in the 1970s a new era of realization would dawn  but we have observed that  when the possibility of peace enters in one region  conflict erupts in another.53.	In the Middle East  despite some success achieved in the disengagement of the Egyptian  Syrian and Israeli troops  lasting peace has yet to be attained. We believe that objective of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East can be reached only with the total withdrawal of Israel from Arab territories  the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  and the return of the Holy City of Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty. The Arab cause has the support of all those who adhere to the principles of human rights and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The international community bears a grave responsibility to undo the wrongs done in the 1947 partition of Palestine. With regard to that unfortunate event  we all shoulder the same responsibility. We earnestly hope that diplomatic efforts  due to recommence in the near future  will produce solutions leading to a lasting peace in the Middle East. However  the restoration of the lawful rights of the Palestinian people  in any circumstances  is a prerequisite for the establishment of a just and durable peace in the Middle East.54.	The lawful and legitimate struggle of the courageous Palestinian people to regain their usurped homeland constitutes an integral part of the world-wide effort  by all peoples  against alien domination. The Afghan delegation has fully endorsed the inclusion of a new item in our agenda  ""The question of Palestine"" [item 108]  and we thus whole-heartedly support the view that the representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) should participate fully in the deliberations on this item in the plenary Assembly.55.	As a consequence of the military intervention of the former military regime of Greece in the internal affairs of Cyprus  we have seen the eruption of a major crisis in the area. The independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of Cyprus have been imperiled. The Government of the Republic of Afghanistan hopes that the problem of Cyprus will be resolved with due respect for the rights of the Turkish community and the preservation of the sovereignty of Cyprus. The Afghan delegation expresses the hope that  as a result of negotiations  a just and permanent solution  based on Security Council resolution 353 (1974)  will be found.56.	The gradual improvement that has been taking place in relations between some big Powers has maintained its momentum. We welcome the process of detente which we hope will lead to the reduction of tension. However  this spirit of understanding and co-operation should not be limited merely to relations between the major Powers. We believe that the success of detente requires the participation of all States  big or small  in order to ensure their equal interests.57.	The foreign policy of Afghanistan is founded on our traditional policy of non-alignment  non-participation in military blocs  peaceful coexistence with mutual respect and  further  promotion of friendly relations with all countries regardless of different economic and social systems. Within our region  the good neighborly relations which we enjoy with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are unshakable. The atmosphere of cordial and warm relations has led to fruitful economic ties for our mutual benefit. We share a fraternal relationship with the Government of Iran. The friendly relations between the two countries have recently been further strengthened as a result of bilateral contacts which we are confident will lead to benefits for both countries and will serve the cause of regional peace and security.58.	Our relations with our other great neighbor  the People's Republic of China  are  as far as we are concerned  to continue in a normal and very friendly manner.59.	Afghanistan's relations with India have always been very cordial and friendly and we will continue to maintain and expand the co-operation which has marked  our long-standing friendly relations.60.	With reference to the statement delivered on 27 September 1974 [2247th meeting] by Mr. Aziz Ahmed  the Minister of State for Defense and Foreign Affairs of Pakistan  regarding the strained relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan  it should be said that although he referred to the unsatisfactory relations between our two countries  he refrained from stating the reason for this. I am sure that in the minds of all the representatives gathered here  the question arises as to what it the real cause for the tense and strained relations. I should like to take this opportunity merely to clarify for the members of the General Assembly the factual cause of the problem and also the search for a possible solution for this  the only political difference existing between the two countries.61.	During the course of the past century  the colonial Power not only gradually occupied the subcontinent of India  but also  on various pretexts such as creating secure boundaries for its colonial territories  began to occupy our land. At various periods  the colonial Power separated portions of our land and people from the fatherland. It was this issue which  for almost a century  kept relations between Afghanistan and the British Indian Government strained. Today  it is the same issue -an unfortunate remnant of the colonial era -which has so regrettably strained relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan  both of which  I believe  are desirous of having friendly relations.62.	After this brief explanation  the members of this Assembly will understand that  with the termination of the colonial rule on the Indian subcontinent  Afghanistan had the right to reclaim its usurped land. But Afghanistan refrained from doing so because  following the promulgation of the Charter of the United Nations and the recognition of the principle that peoples under colonial rule have the right to exercise freely their lawful and legitimate rights  Afghanistan thought it better that the problem be solved by peaceful means and in accordance with the will of the Pakhtun and Baluchi people. Therefore  since the creation of Pakistan  Afghanistan has always endeavored  and will continue to endeavor  to resolve this single political difference in a just and honorable manner through negotiations  peaceful understanding  and mutual goodwill  according to the wishes of the national leaders of the Pakhtun and Baluchi peoples.63.	Afghanistan strongly believes that the use of force  the oppression and imprisonment of those who demand their human rights will   produce only pessimism and disaffection and will lead to further resistance. Furthermore  this course of action will adversely affect the maintenance of peace and stability in our region  which we so earnestly desire.64.	While I confirm the reference made by Mr. Aziz Ahmed in which he stated that his Government wished ""the best possible relationship with Afghanistan""  as we have already expressed our readiness for negotiations on numerous occasions  I would like once again to state now that we are sincerely desirous  without any condition  anywhere and at any time  to negotiate in order to find a peaceful solution to the only political dispute which exists between Afghanistan and Pakistan and to enhance the atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence.65.	I am certain that the representatives assembled here will share our view and agree with this proposal by Afghanistan  which reflects our real desire for peace and for a solution of this issue according to the principles established by the Charter of the United Nations.66.	If we really desire peace  co-operation  understanding and living together  let us leave aside resentment and pride. As responsible human beings  we should have the courage to acknowledge and assess issues and events with foresight  and bear in mind that our actions will be judged by history and by future generations. In facing and solving problems  we need foresight and courage. In our present world  where we live in a close  interrelated community  we must face the grave issues before us responsibly and realistically. Realism is essential to success in the search for the necessary solutions.67.	In the field of disarmament  the policy of the Republic of Afghanistan is well known. We have supported and will continue to support any measure aimed at the achievement of general and complete disarmament. We have supported the ban on nuclear tests in all environments. According to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex 1  all nuclear-power States are obliged to carry out the necessary consultations in order to reach agreement on the halting of all tests in all environments.68.	Though this item  as a matter of priority  has been under consideration by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  no final agreement  unfortunately  has been reached to date. We believe that as a collateral measure of disarmament  an agreement should be reached extending the present nuclear test ban to all environments.69.	Disarmament has been the subject of much debate within and without the United Nations. How-ever  the race for nuclear and conventional arms has not abated but has expanded to the point where it is a clear danger to world peace and security. Progress in the field of disarmament has been modest  while expenditures for arms are ever rising.70.	Success in the field of disarmament depends on the political will of the members of the international community and in particular on the big Powers. Therefore  it is necessary that the United Nations be involved in all endeavors aiming at the achievement of general and complete disarmament. For these reasons  the Government of Afghanistan  as that of a non- aligned country  has  both at the non-aligned conferences which initiated this idea and in the United Nations  always supported the convening of a world disarmament conference. We are confident that with adequate preparation such a conference would serve the very useful purposes of reviewing the growth of the arms race and the moves towards disarmament.In a conference of this nature  the participation of all nuclear Powers is an inevitable prerequisite.71.	This year  the Government of Iran has proposed [A19693 and Add.I and 2] a new item entitled ""Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East"". We welcome this timely initiative of the Government of Iran and believe that the proposal will further strengthen peace and security in the area  and that its acceptance and implementation will be a positive step towards nuclear disarmament. We earnestly hope that the General Assembly's debate on various aspects of this item will lead to the adoption of adequate measures for its speedy implementation.72.	Regarding the elimination of colonialism and alien domination in all their forms and manifestations  the policy of the Government of Afghanistan remains as before. Although the United Nations has achieved significant success in this field over the past 29 years  vestiges of colonialism and alien domination nevertheless persist in certain parts of the world  where they present an immense barrier to the right of self-determination and impede development and progress.73.	As may be observed  in Southern Rhodesia the situation has deteriorated over the past year  mainly because of the intensely repressive measures taken by the illegal racist minority regime of Ian Smith against the indigenous people of Zimbabwe. The situation has been aggravated by the violation by some States  particularly South Africa  of the mandatory sanctions imposed by the Security Council. In view of the prevailing situation in Southern Rhodesia  my delegation fully supports the idea of widening the scope of the sanctions.74.	In the case of Namibia  South Africa has continued its flagrant defiance of the United Nations decisions and has violated its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations with respect to the Territory. South Africa has increasingly resorted to violence  torture and intimidation of the people of Namibia in order to advance its inhuman policies of ""bantustanization"" and apartheid.75.	My delegation appreciates the measures adopted by the United Nations Council for Namibia in the discharge of its mandate from the General Assembly. We hope that all Members of the United Nations will find it possible to co-operate fully with the Council as the de jure authority for Namibia and to comply with its decisions.76.	The Afghan delegation welcomes the statement by the distinguished Foreign Minister of Portugal in the general debate  in which he reaffirmed the policy of his Government in favor of decolonization. It is indeed a source of satisfaction to us that the new leadership in Portugal has acknowledged the inalienable rights of the people of the Portuguese colonies to self-determination and independence. We are encouraged by the agreement reached between FRELIMO and Portugal providing for the granting of independence to Mozambique in 1975. We earnestly hope that similar agreement is reached in the near future with regard to Angola  so that the people of that country  too  can attain their long-cherished and legitimate aspirations.77.	As a land-locked country  Afghanistan attaches great importance to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The conclusion of a just and comprehensive legal order of the sea which can ensure the rights and interests of all States  whether coastal or land-locked  developed or developing  large or small  is an urgent international necessity.78.	A future convention on the law of the sea must ensure the right of free access to and from the sea for the land-locked countries and be based on the firmly established and legally binding principles of international law. The right of free transit for land-locked countries and their participation in the exploration and exploitation of both the living and non-living resources of the sea beyond the internationally agreed limits of the territorial seas of States must be reaffirmed and ensured.79.	The inadequacies of the world economic order and the existing economic machinery to deal with the problems of development in the developing countries and the need for the achievement of an even and balanced development for the members of the inter-national community were amply revealed and dis-cussed for the first time at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  convened for the study of the problems of raw materials and development. The value of the special session lies in the dialog it initiated based on understanding and consideration for the priorities of all countries at various levels of development. The session underscored the fact that the interests and the welfare of the developed and the developing countries can no longer be isolated from each other. Its decisions constituted a turning-point in the international economic relations of countries with differing levels of economic progress. We trust that they will lead to an era of interdependence  justice  progress and peace.80.	As all the members of this Assembly realize  Afghanistan is a land-locked developing country as well as one of the least developed among the developing countries. The problems and the urgent needs of such countries were comprehensively covered in the course of the special session. As a result  those countries were included among the countries most seriously affected by the international economic crisis. The implementation of urgent measures to mitigate their needs and problems were envisaged in the resolution adopted by the Assembly at the sixth special session [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)].81.	To our regret  the measures contained in the decisions of the Assembly at that session have not been implemented by the members of the international community thus far. The Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI)  envisaging emergency measures to ameliorate the urgent problems of landlocked  least developed and other countries most seriously affected by the recent economic crisis  has not been effectively carried out. This failure is largely due to the lack of interest and understanding on the part of the developed countries  despite the decisions taken at the special session. My delegation does  however  wish to express its appreciation to the developed countries as well as to the potential contributors among the developing countries which have offered to extend assistance for the implementation of the resolution.82.	Since the implementation of the decisions taken at the special session and other economic items of special interest to us will be discussed thoroughly in the Second Committee of the General Assembly  my delegation feels it sufficient to express its views in broad terms at this stage.83.	In conclusion  the delegation of the Republic of Afghanistan pledges its full co-operation with you  Mr. President  and with our fellow Members of the United Nations to exert every effort to bring about a new era of common action aimed at investigating all channels in order to improve the political  economic and social situation and conditions of people every-where. We are confident that  with the display and exercise of the necessary goodwill  this session will be marked by success."
"2",90,"ALB",29,1974,"Mr. President  I wish first of all  on behalf of the Albanian delegation  to congratulate you whole-heartedly upon your unanimous election to the post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. It gives us especial satisfaction to see the work of this session presided over by the representative of Algeria  a country with which the People's Republic of Albania has such close and friendly relations.115.	It is the second time that the General Assembly has met this year. This session is being held at a time when throughout the world many new events have taken place and continue to take place  giving rise to a number of grave problems. The Albanian delegation  imbued as always with the desire to make its modest contribution to positive progress in the work of the General Assembly  would like to express the views of the People's Republic of Albania and its Government on a series of questions which  in our opinion  deserve special attention.116.	The events of this year have shown still more clearly the fact that the world is going through a process of swift and dynamic development. The fundamental contradictions of our times are continually worsening and the many contrasts which exist in the various parts of the globe are increasing also. Freedom  independence and the sovereignty of freedom-loving States and peoples  their development and progress are constantly threatened and endangered. The policy of aggression and expansion  of oppression and violence  of exploitation by imperialism and social imperialism has acquired even greater proportions. The unbridled arms race  the growth of military budgets and the preparations for war are continuing without interruption. Aggressive fleets and military bases fill the seas and oceans.117.	The aggravation of the economic and financial crisis which has shaken the capitalist world has increased the difficulties of the world economy and international economic relations. The efforts of industrialized countries to make the developing countries bear the brunt of this crisis have further worsened the present international situation. The confrontation between peoples the exploited working masses of the countries that want to live in freedom and independence  on the one hand  and the imperialist forces  first and foremost the United States and the Soviet Union  on the other continues to worsen.118.	The imperialist and colonialist Powers  particularly the two super-Powers  call on all people to open their doors to them  to allow their economic and political interference  because this allegedly will help to create harmony among nations and to further the progress of mankind. But they wish to keep privileged positions for themselves  and ask that independent States give up their right to equality and sovereignty in international relations. The two super-Powers are  in fact  attacking national sovereignty by identifying it with a narrow nationalism. In short  they want others to admit that the world can find peace only if it is dominated by them.119.	The United States of America and the Soviet Union speculate a great deal about watchwords such as ""peace""  the ""inevitable interdependence of States""  ""the need to avoid upheavals in the world balance of peaceful coexistence"" or ""general Nowadays they spread the idea that peaceful peoples and States  the developing countries  cannot do without them  without their aid  without their loan  without their cadres or their technology; that these countries will not able so develop their own natural resource  freely or independently. They go so for as to threaten cut off this ""aid""  these ""loans""  to stop supplying machinery. They threaten them with famine and poverty.120.	As the leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Hoxha  has said: ""The two super-Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  who are engaged in the preparation of the hot war  try by their allegedly generous aid to enslave others  to place them in their economic and political claws  to bring them into their sphere of influence and to colonize them.""121.	The peoples are beginning to understand better and better the hegemonic designs of these superPowers and they resolutely oppose their neo-colonialist practices. They are determined to strengthen and protect their sovereign rights; day by day they oppose more courageously the pressures and blackmail that are being brought to bear on them and continue their independent development.122.	The security and safeguarding of independence and full national sovereignty are indispensable factors in the progress of each nation and each State and the establishment of true peace and stability in the world. Events show that in present conditions everyone is affected to a greater or lesser degree by the aggressive hegemonic policies of the two superPowers. There is no country or region in the world which is not affected by the threats  the blackmail  and the interference of the United States and the Soviet Union  their conflicts and the bargaining carried on between them. The existence of aggressive military alliances and closed economic blocs  participation in those alliances and those blocs  the establishment of military bases and foreign troops on territories of other countries  military maneuvers near the borders of other States  agreements in which certain parties take the lion's share  and so on  greatly undermine the sovereignty of many States. Thus  the struggle for the defense and strengthening of national sovereignty acquires primordial importance. It has today become the common cause of all freedom-loving countries and peoples.123.	The successes which many countries have obtained in the achievement of their rights  in their struggle against imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and hegemony show that each nation  even the smallest  when it is resolved to defend its national interests  can face the enemies of its freedom  however mighty or powerful they may be  and overcome them.124.	The people of IndoChina are still resolutely engaged in their just struggle against the American imperialist aggressors. The Arab peoples have shown on the battlefield that they can triumph over the Zionist imperialist aggression and that they have the forces and other means necessary to regain their rights. The struggle of the African peoples against colonialism  neo-colonialism and racial discrimination has taken on renewed vigor. The developing countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America have become an important force on the international scene and are playing an active role there. In Europe too and in other parts of the world  a number of countries have risen up with increased strength against the policy of diktat and intervention in their internal affairs.125.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly  on the problems of raw materials and development  the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Caracas  and the work of the World Population Conference held at Bucharest were a further expression of the determined efforts of a number of countries  particularly developing countries  to defend their sovereign rights  to affirm their legitimate rights over the seas and oceans  and to become the real masters of their natural resources in order to place them at the service of their own development and progress and to solve by themselves the problems involved in increasing the material and cultural well-being of their peoples.126.	We greatly appreciate the firm support which the People's Republic of China  that powerful socialist State  is giving to the struggle for liberation waged by the peoples against colonialism and neocolonialism; we appreciate  too  the support that country is giving to the efforts of various countries to defend and strengthen their national independence and its valuable contribution to the cause of the peace and stability of Asia and of the rest of the world. Pursuing a foreign policy based on principle  the great People's Republic of China has become an important positive factor in the present evolution of the world and a determined opponent of the policies of hegemony of the two super-Powers.127.	The events of this year show that there are many obstacles and difficulties in the way of the achievement of the rights and aspirations of the peoples. Not only do past conflicts and disagreements remain unresolved  but new hotbeds of tension and war have been created  as can be seen by the recent events in Cyprus.128.	The United States and the Soviet Union  by simultaneously competing and co-operating with each other  are trying to maintain the status quo in the areas which they have already divided into zones of influence; to establish a balance acceptable to them in the areas where they have not yet been able to do that; and to extend their political  economic  military and ideological sway.129.	Those two super-Powers base their policy of hegemony on the force of arms  on pressure  on interference in internal affairs  on intrigues and plots. They often talk about not resorting to force in international relations  and they have made that phrase the leitmotiv of many official agreements and acts; they speak of disarmament but in fact they continue the arms race; they constantly engage in military maneuvers and displays of force near the borders and coasts of other countries; they strengthen their aggressive blocs and try to take military bases and ports away from other States. Like monsters  their fleets plough the Mediterranean  the Indian Ocean and other seas and oceans  seriously threatening the freedom and independence of independent coastal countries.130.	The two super-Powers cynically try to arrogate to themselves the right to do what they please and to establish their presence everywhere in the world  to move about freely wherever and whenever they please. The United States ruling circles and the heads of the Pentagon openly state that the United States cannot accept any reductions in its defense budget because it must remain a first-rank military Power and its military potential must remain greater than that of all the others.131.	On the other hand  the Soviet leaders and their marshals and admirals  with their slogans of ""defense of the national interests of the Soviet Union"" and ""the Soviet Union's political role as a world Power""  do not hide the fact that their country must increase its military power and use it as a diplomatic means of intimidation and dissuasion.132.	The two super-Powers have made a system out of secret diplomacy. The summit meetings between the United States and the Soviet Union and the secret agreements concluded between them  including those concluded in July this year  continue to cast a sinister shadow over the world. Side by side with the deep contradictions that divide them  their hegemonic collaboration has been further strengthened.133.	Despite the noise they are making in an attempt to create the impression that Europe is about to become a region of peace and tranquility  the truth is that real tension and many contradictions exist in that continent and that a large number of its problems remain unsolved. And there the interests and aims of the two super-Powers intersect  for they wish at any cost to make Europe accept a complete division into spheres of influence.134.	Recently  the United StL  s has been openly exerting pressure on its Western European allies to stop their attempts to take action without the guidance and control of the United States. The Washington Conference on energy problems  the meetings convened to approve the Ottawa Declaration  and so forth  are typical examples of the ojbstinacy and arrogance of the United States in its efforts to make its partners obey and accept United States hegemony. The Soviet Union  for its part  through the Warsaw Treaty and the Mutual Economic Aid Council  has doubled its efforts to achieve the complete economic  political and military integration of the countries within its sphere of influence. Its aim is to limit even more their independence and sovereignty and to turn them gradually   one after another  into kinds of federate republics.135.	For a long time now the Soviet Union and the United States have been boasting about the ""benefits"" that the carrying out of their plans for so-called European security would bring to the peoples ofEurope. But behind these plans are concealed the designs of the two super-Powers to legalize the status quo and strengthen their spheres of influence in Europe  which is contrary to the true interests of the European peoples and of peace on that continent. The People's Republic of Albania is firmly opposed to that kind of security because it would merely increase the insecurity of Europe.136.	In order to achieve the foregoing objectives the two super-Powers  with a great clamor and all kinds of promises  organized the Conference on so- called European security. But it is already clear that the maneuvers and pressures to which the super-Powers have resorted have not achieved the expected results. The length of the sessions of that Conference and the constant interruptions of its work show that there are many contradictions. A large number of Governments have even felt great disappointment  and they are now much less interested in the Geneva negotiations.137.	In the Vienna negotiations on the so-called reduction of military forces and arms in Central Europe  the two super-Powers have tried to reach agreement on the number of troops and of armaments that they must maintain in Europe to support their policy of hegemony. The peoples of Europe are not at all interested in a symbolic reduction of American and Soviet forces; they want all those forces to be withdrawn from the countries where they are stationed. Experience has shown that such negotiations are a hoax. On the one hand there is talk about peace and stability in Europe and the reduction of forces and weapons  and on the other the Soviet Union and the United States are intensifying their arms race and building up their military arsenals in Europe  constantly brandishing their weapons and exerting pressure on certain European countries to let them use the territory and air space of those countries for their military forces; finally  under the cover of ""friendly"" visits they seek to establish their war fleets in the ports of those countries. While discussions go on in Geneva and in Vienna  the Soviet Union keeps sending division after division to eastern Europe and constantly engages in troop maneuvers and movements  creates new military posts and so on.138.	Why is all this happening? Could it be because the European countries cannot live without American and Soviet protection? No  the peoples of Europe want to be free and sovereign. Thus it is important for them to be increasingly vigilant and to harbor no illusions as to the policies -of the two superPowers. The European people cannot expect their security from the two super-Powers. They will obtain it only through constant struggle against the enemies of peace and security in Europe.139.	This year the expansionist policy of the two super-Powers has created thorny situations in different parts of the region of the Balkans and the Mediterranean. This has brought a further increase in tension in that region and in Europe .140.	The painful events that have recently occurred close to the Balkans  on the island of Cyprus  as well as the dangerous and regrettable consequences and complications that accompanied them  show the evils that can come to the Balkan peoples from the hegemonic policy of the United States and the Soviet Union  which engage in intrigue  intentionally create problems  and .arouse hostility among peoples and States and fan its flames  in order to achieve their own designs. They give the best proof of the justice of the words of the leader of the Albanian people  Comrade Enver Hoxha:""The Balkans have never by themselves constituted a powder keg. If they were so in the past  it was the fault of foreigners who held all the means of detonating the explosion. And it is they who want it to be so again. It is the duty of the peoples of the Balkans to take their swords and cut through all the fuses  so that peace and security may truly be established in the Balkans.""141.	'We believe that peace and stability in the Balkans can be served and national interests defended by developing friendly links among the peoples of the Balkans  by creating an atmosphere of good neighborliness between the States in that region of the world  and by firmly opposing the attempts of the two super-Powers to penetrate as deeply as possible into that area both politically and economically and to establish military bases and free passage for their troops. The ""friendship"" which either one of the super-Powers offers to any country of the Balkans has many dangerous consequences for its freedom and independence and for peace in the Balkans.142.	The events in Cyprus today cannot be dissociated from the greed of the imperialist Powers and first of all of the United States and the Soviet Union. American imperialists have organized the bloody events in Cyprus. They have thrown those people into fratricidal war in order to turn that country into a North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] base. They have always sought to use the island of Cyprus as a spring-board for their policies of aggression and expansion in the Mediterranean  in the Middle East and in other areas.143.	Soviet social-imperialists  who have hegemonic designs in the Mediterranean and the near East  have hastened to take immediate advantage of the troubled situation in Cyprus and have warmed their hands at the fire that has been lit there. If we listen to the declarations 6f the Soviet Government  we might think that Government is the most ardent and sincere defender of the interests of the people Of Cyprus and of peace and tranquility on that island. But the Soviet social-imperialists cannot conceal their real designs and their hypocritical role in the events in Cyprus. The Soviet Union is encouraging quarrels and dissension  Its main concern is to take advantage of the situation to create bases for its warships  to penetrate further into the Mediterranean  the Adriatic and other regions of the world  and thus to fulfill an old dream of Tsarist Russia. This is the aim of its efforts to arrogate to itself the full powers of a State guarantor of the independence of Cyprus and to convene an international conference On Cyprus  efforts which are as dangerous for the just solution of the problem and for peace and stability in Cyprus as the various maneuvers and Offers made by the United States.144.	The Albanian people  who nourish sentiments of friendship for the peoples of Cyprus  Greece and Turkey  and who are sincerely concerned to achieve true peace and security in the Balkans and the Mediterranean  is opposed to any foreign interference in the internal affairs of the Cypriot people  and to any action which would further complicate the situation in that country. The interests of the Cypriot people require first and foremost that an end be put to the interference of the United States of America and the Soviet Union in. the internal affairs of that country  as well as to their attempts to take advantage of the situation created there to carry out their aggressive plans in the eastern Mediterranean.145.	Cyprus must be free and independent. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus must be respected. The Greek and Turkish communities must solve their problems' themselves  without foreign interference  on the basis of a guarantee .of coexistence with equal rights  iti perfect harmony and understanding  as is required by their common interests.146.	The events in Cyprus show even more clearly the grave danger of the presence of American and Soviet military bases and fleets in the Mediterranean for all the peoples and States of that region. Today more than ever it is urgently necessary for the peoples and countries of that area to act resolutely to compel the United States and the Soviet Union to withdraw their war fleets from the Mediterranean.147.	We hail the efforts and resolution of the Arab people to achieve their lofty national aspirations. In the October 'war against the Israeli Zionist aggressors  they have scored an important victory. During that war the heroic vitality of the Arab people  their strength and unity in combat stood out more clearly than ever before; proof was given us that the Arab people are able to vanquish the aggressor on the battlefield and that the key to the achievement of their legitimate claims is truly in their hands.148.	The United States and the Soviet Union strive to give the impression that great changes have taken place in that area and that  under their patronage  the problems of the Middle East will soon find a solution. But facts disprove these allegations. None of the causes of the explosive and tense situation in the Near East has been eliminated. The danger of new aggression on the part of Israel against the Arabs is still a reality. Israeli Zionists who live in occupied Arab territories once again state their aggressive claims for annexation; they threaten the Arab people and constantly renew their provocations. All the events that have taken place since the October war the intensification of rivalry and of Soviet-American collaboration in that part of the world  and the new tactics and machinations on the part of the Washington and Moscow diplomats- show that the two super-Powers want at all costs to achieve their former objectives in the Middle East  to transform partial solutions into a permanent status quo  to divide the Arabs and to refuse the Palestinian people their national and legitimate rights.149.	Given this situation  it appears clearly that the problem of the Middle feast has not been brought closer to a true solution. We cannot build peace in that part of the world by sacrificing the rights of the Arab people. One cannot resolve the problems of the Middle East by sacrificing an entire people  the Palestinian people. We must restore to the Palestinian people  who have been fighting heroically for so many years  all the national rights that were snatched from them. The People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian people continue most strongly to support the just struggle of their brothers the Arab peoples and of the Palestinian people against the imperialist-Zionist aggressor for the restoration of their sovereign rights.150.	The situation in IndoChina is still very disturbing. The Albanian people and its Government firmly denounce the continued aggressive policy of the American imperialists against the VietNamese people  and their military engagement in South Viet Nam as well as the systematic provocations committed by the Saigon clique against the liberated areas and the barbaric crimes perpetrated against the population of South Viet Nam. We support the struggles of the VietNamese people for the full realization of their lofty national aspirations and the just positions and demands of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam that the Agreement on the cessation of war and the restoration of peace in Viet Nam be strictly respected. The Provisional Revolutionary Government is the sole genuine representative of the will and interest of the people of South Viet Nam. It alone has the right to speak on their behalf. The discriminatory attitude vis-a-vis that Government which the United States has imposed upon certain international bodies must be rejected and come to an end. The United States must cease all interference in the internal affairs of the VietNamese people.151.	In Cambodia  the United States  with its economic and military assistance  tries to keep alive the Lon Nol clique  which has gone into hiding in Phnom Penh and in some other villages hemmed in by the hatred of the Cambodian people fighting for its freedom.152.	The Cambodian people  firmly resolved to continue its armed struggle to the end  has rejected the deceitful offers of the Phnom Penh clique for a cease-fire as well as the schemes for ""peaceful negotiations"" thought up by the United States  for whose realization the Soviet Union is striving too. In order for peace to be brought to Cambodia  the United States must immediately put an end to its criminal aggression and interference in the internal affairs of the Cambodian people  it must cease its assistance to the puppet clique of Phnom Penh and must leave the Cambodian people free to manage its own affairs.153.	The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  with its Head of State  Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  is the only lawful Government of that country . It has been affirmed as such in that country and on the international level. It is the only Government vested with the right and necessary power to represent that country in foreign affairs and in international organizations. Albania and 32 other countries last year submitted a draft resolutions requesting that an end be put to the grave injustice being done to the Cambodian people  that the representatives of the Royal Government of National Union be invited to occupy their legitimate place in the United Nations and in the other United Nations bodies  and that the Phnom Penh clique be excluded from them since it represents nothing. We hope that most Member States  acting in conformity with the law and with the facts of. the case  will see to it that the General Assembly puts an end to this abnormal situation and that the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia will have its legitimate rights restored in the United Nations.154.	The General Assembly must also  without delay  adopt a decision on the evacuation of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations  thus putting an end to overt intervention in the internal affairs of the Korean people. The further maintenance of American troops in South Korea has increased tensions on the Korean peninsula. The United States has arbitrarily dictated the division of Korea into two parts. It continues to support and encourage the puppet regime in Seoul in its oppression of the people of South Korea* and in its constant provocation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Korean people has long asked that foreign troops leave its territory forthwith  and it is fighting to achieve a lofty national aspiration the reunification of its homeland.155.	We support the constructive efforts of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to find an independent solution to the Korean problem. The People's Republic of Albania rejects the continued presence of aggressive American troops in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations. Those troops must be evacuated from South Korea  and the Korean people must be free to settle its own affairs without any foreign interference. We denounce the conspiracy designed to perpetuate the division of Korea into two parts.156.	The Albanian delegation believes that the adoption of the draft resolution in document A/9703/ Add;3 at this session would put an end to the inadmissible attitude that the United Nations has held for many years now with regard to the Korean people. That would eliminate one of the main obstacles to the independent reunification of Korea  and would contribute to the reduction of tension on that peninsular . 157.	The Albanian people and Government will continue their 'solidarity with the just struggles of the peoples of Angola  Mozambique  Azania  Namibia  Puerto Rico  Northern Ireland and so on  to achieve freedom  independence and national liberation from colonialism  neo-colonialism  racial discrimination and apartheid. We warmly greet the people of Guinea-Bissau  which has crowned with victory its lengthy struggle against the Portuguese colonizers  which lasted for so many years. We welcome the Republic of Guinea-Bissau* a young  independent State  into the United Nations  and we hope that the peoples of Angola and Mozambique in their struggle for freedom will very soon achieve their aims. The victories they have won in that struggle once again show that the eradication of the odious system of colonialism is an inevitable historical process. Albania: will always strongly support the struggle of the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America against imperialism and hegemony  plundering and exploitation - by foreign capitalist monopolies  in order to win and to safeguard their rights  so as to strengthen the sovereignty of their States.158.	The Albanian people will soon celebrate the glorious thirtieth' anniversary of the liberation of their homeland and the triumph of our people's revolution. The liberation of Albania from the foreign  Nazi and Fascist yoke on 29 November 1944  which resulted from the heroic struggle of the Albanian people  is the greatest victory of our history:159.	During these three decades  despite our great lack of progress  a legacy of our past  and the very difficult conditions created by different imperialist and revisionist enemies^  our people  guided by our Labor Party and under the leadership of our beloved comrade Enver Hoxha  has been able to weather every storm and to overcome all kinds of obstacles and difficulties and has advanced resolutely and constantly along the path of socialism.160.	In the first place through its own strength  and thanks to its self-denying work  our people has achieved radical changes in all spheres of life and has completely changed the physiognomy of the country. Albania  which was a backward agricultural country  is rapidly becoming an industrial and agricultural nation. Global industrial production in Albania is today 86 times as great as it was in 1938  and 3.5 times greater than in 1960. In four days our industry now produces as much as it produced in a whole year in 1938. Our global agricultural production is approximately four times greater than it was in the days before liberation. Under popular leadership; the gross national product has increased eleven fold. Albania has achieved total electrification throughout the country. The old taxes of all kinds have been abolished  and health and medical services are now free of charge. Education  science and culture have made great advances on the past and one out of every three persons now goes to school.161.	The People's Republic of Albania has unceasingly and resolutely pursued a foreign policy based on high principles. The foreign policy of socialist Albania has been in the past and continues to be quite clear; it is a defense of liberty and national independence. It has always been and remains at the service of the cause of peoples struggling to defend their national sovereignty and independence  and in favor of self-determination and the establishment of- international co-operation truly based on equality . Thanks to this just policy the international position of Albania has constantly grown stronger. We have today sincere friends and many sympathizers on all continents. The relations of steadfast militant friendship and close brotherly co-operatiOn between the People's Republic of Albania and the People's Republic of China grow stronger and more firmly consolidated day by day. The People's Republic of Albania has friendly relations with a large number of countries  and has normal diplomatic relations with 66 States and is ready to establish such relations with other peace- and freedom-loving countries-on the basis of the well-known principles of mutual respect  sovereign equality and non-interference in anyone's internal affairs and of mutual benefit.162.	The People's Republic of Albania  in. future also  will be a resolute fighter against imperialism and social imperialism and will remain an element of peace and stability in the Balkans and in Europe  and it will make its contribution to the defense of the cause of the peoples  of peace and of general security."
"3",158,"ARE",29,1974,"We have learned with great sorrow of the passing of Mr. Paul Hoffman  the former Managing Director of the Special Fund and Administrator of UNDP. A man of international fame and stature  Mr. Hoffman rendered great services to the United Nations  and I wish  on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates  to extend our condolences to his family and to the delegation of the United States.188.	Mr. President  it is with great pleasure that I extend to you  on behalf of the Government of the United Arab Emirates  our congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly reflects the confidence placed in you and the recognition by the international community of your proven abilities. We share the pride in your election  which we consider as an expression of appreciation of the important role played by Algeria in defense of the interests and rights of the third world.189.	We wish also to convey our gratitude to Mr. Benites  who presided over the previous session with great ability and wisdom.190.	We also thank the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts to strengthen the United Nations and to increase its efficacy for the preservation of international peace and security.191.	It gives us the utmost pleasure to welcome the three States that joined the Organization at the current session  namely  Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. We are confident that the admission of these new Members will strengthen and increase the effectiveness of the United Nations. We are ready to co-operate with them  both bilaterally and within the United Nations and its specialized agencies.192.	We consider the inclusion of the question of Palestine as a separate item in the agenda of the current session as an event of great importance. The question of Palestine will now be considered in all its basic and immutable elements. Implicit in this inclusion of the item is a realization by the United Nations that its previous consideration of only certain aspects and consequences of that question were inconclusive and could not lead to a just and lasting solution which would preserve peace in the Middle East and save it from any further tragedies of war and destruction.193.	The United Nations has in the past considered in different organs some of the aspects and consequences of the problem of Palestine and has adopted a number of resolutions and recommendations. This  however  did not prevent the aggravation of the problem by Israel's continued aggression against the people of Palestine and the denial of their rights in their ancestral homeland. It did not prevent Israel from attacking the Arab States adjacent to Palestine  prolonging the exile and dispersal of its people and preventing it from the free exercise of its inalienable rights  including the right to self-determination.194.	Important developments and events have taken place in our area in recent years. One of the most significant of these has been the assumption of full responsibility by the people of Palestine for the liberation of its land and the restoration of its rights. It was incumbent  therefore  upon the United Nations to respond and adjust to these new developments and events by considering the question of Palestine in all its fundamental aspects. That was achieved by the decision of the General Assembly with one dissenting voice  that of Israel to include the item in the agenda and allocate it to the plenary Assembly.195.	We view the allocation of the item to the plenary Assembly as another proof of the recognition by the United Nations of the importance of this question. We fully support the proposal of inviting the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to participate in the deliberation of the item in the plenary Assembly. No objective or realistic consideration of this item can take place without the participation of the principal party the people of Palestine through its sole and legitimate representative  the PLO. Accordingly  we shall fully support the invitation extended to the PLO to participate in the deliberation of the plenary Assembly on this item.196.	We believe that any resolution that may be adopted at the end of the debate on this item should include the following principles: first  a reaffirmation of the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine; secondly  a reaffirmation of the right of the people of Palestine to self-determination  without external interference  and the guaranteeing of its national independence; thirdly  a reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinians who were expelled to return to their homes and lands; and fourthly  a reaffirmation of the right of the people of Palestine to use all means to attain its rights  including the right to self-determination..197.	In calling for the reaffirmation of these rights  we are in fact reiterating a position of principle which we have always taken in supporting the people of Palestine  a position inspired by the fact that these rights are based upon the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and are fully in conformity with the rules of international law.198.	Our position on the question of Palestine is known to all. We have often stated our views regarding the aggressive nature of Zionism and denounced Israel's aggression and occupation of Arab territories. We shall  nevertheless  state in greater detail our views during the discussion of the question of Palestine and other relevant items. We should like  however  to reiterate now our demand for Israel's withdrawal from all occupied territories. We shall continue to extend every possible assistance for the achievement of that goal .199.	The United Arab Emirates supports the decision of Mauritania and Morocco to bring the case of AlSakya Al Hamra and Wadi Al Thahab or the so- called Spanish Sahara to the International Court of Justice. We appeal to Spain to act in a manner that will preserve ArabSpanish friendship  a friendship which we  for our part  endeavor to develop and strengthen.200.	We were gravely concerned at the unfortunate events in Cyprus this year and were grieved at the tragic loss of innocent lives which further exacerbated the state of tension and instability prevailing in our area. We earnestly hope that all outstanding problems will be resolved in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and on the basis of justice and equity.201.	I wish to add my voice to that of my colleagues who preceded me in welcoming the policy of the new Portuguese Government which is based on the recognition of the right to self-determination and the granting of independence to its former colonies. We appreciate the resolve of the Government of Portugal to pursue that policy and  to end  once and for all  the last vestiges of colonial rule. The way has now been opened for the establishment of friendly and cordial relations between the Arab world and Portugal.202.	Since the founding of our State  the policies of the United Arab Emirates have been based on the principle of support for all peoples in their struggle to attain their freedom  to exercise their right of self- determination  and to preserve their territorial integrity. This is why we have supported  and will continue to support  without reservation  the African liberation movements  and will extend all possible financial and moral assistance to them.203.	We are gravely concerned at the inhuman treatment  by the Government of South Africa  of the indigenous population of that country  and the continued denial by the racist regime in Salisbury of the rights of the African majority in Zimbabwe. The policies of apartheid and the oppressive rule of minority racist regimes are an intolerable affront to human dignity and a challenge to world opinion. All previous United Nations resolutions dealing with the problem have remained unimplemented. This failure is mainly due to th^ continued co-operation of certain States with South Africa and the racist regime in Rhodesia and their refusal to implement the United Nations resolutions calling for sanctions against them. We have imposed a total embargo on the shipment of oil and are strictly applying this policy. We renew our appeal to the States which still have extensive dealings with the two racist regimes to cease forthwith their co-operation with them and to participate in the efforts of the African States and the United Nations to deal effectively with this problem.204.	We welcome the initiative taken by Egypt and Iran to include the item entitled ""Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East"" in the agenda of the current session. We earnestly hope that the discussion of this item will lead to the adoption of a positive resolution for the establishment of such a zone.205.	As a major oil producer and exporter  my country is interested in the current debate on the world economic situation. To understand and appreciate the point of view of the petroleum-exporting countries  it is necessary to go back a little in history. Oil  a precious  exhaustible and irreplaceable mineral  has been exported in great quantities to meet the ever- increasing demands of the developed countries. The companies which controlled the international flow of this vital commodity have utilized wasteful methods of production  which resulted in the rapid depletion of the oil reserves of the producing countries. While keeping the price of crude oil artificially low  these companies made huge profits on the down-stream operations related to oil trade  that is  shipping  refining and distribution  from which the producing countries were totally excluded.206.	Low prices of crude oil made it difficult for the producing countries adequately to meet the rising costs of their development requirements. This inevitably stultified their growth and seriously retarded their progress. In addition to providing huge profits for the foreign companies  cheap and plentiful energy gave substantial tax revenues to the governments of the consuming countries. It also enabled the industrialized nations to achieve a rate of economic growth which far outstripped that of the developing countries. As a result of all this  the developed countries entered into a period of mass consumption and unrestrained material indulgence  at a time when most of he countries of the third world were barely managing to stay above mere subsistence levels.207.	As far as the oil-exporting countries were concerned  any benefits which they may have derived from increased production were wiped out by the sharp rise in the prices of manufactured goods in the developed countries. Thus  the rapid growth in the industrialized countries had no corresponding beneficial results for the rest of the world. On the contrary  foreign aid lagged far behind the great increase in the gross national product of the developed countries. The gap between the developed and developing countries steadily widened. This widening gap  as we all know  had been the object of lengthy and futile discussions in the Organization and its specialized agencies for over two decades. The decision of the oil-exporting countries to extricate themselves from the vicious circle of over-production and low prices has ended an iniquitous situation and halted the exploitation and squandering of valuable resources that had been going on for decades. Now the oil-exporting Countries will be able to absorb the vast increase in the price of manufactured goods and to protect themselves against the consequences of the rampant inflation in the developed countries. We believe this new situation will be beneficial for the developing countries  and may have some indirect benefits  even for the developed countries.208.	For the developing countries  it means that some economic power and wealth will be in the hands of small countries like themselves; countries that have neither the desire nor the ability to carve up spheres of influence  countries with no imperialist ambitions and no wish for political and economic domination over others. We are confident that this shift in the balance of economic power will contribute to narrowing the gap between the developed and developing countries. Evidence of this can already be seen in the very high percentage of the gross national product of the oil-exporting countries presently allocated to assist the developing countries. Let us take the example of my own country. We have during 1974 given to developing countries in grants and soft loans no less than $700 million  which represent more than 15 per cent of our gross national product. In addition  we have increased the capital of the AbuDhabi Development Fund to $500 million to finance projects in the developing countries all over the world.209.	I am now happy to announce that my Government  in response to the appeal of the Secretary- General  has decided to contribute $10 million to the Special Program of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. We have also asked the Secretary-General to allocate $500 000 of this amount to the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator to be spent on relief work in Honduras.210.	Many of the exporting countries would have preferred to produce just enough to meet our development requirements and those of the other developing countries. Such a reduction of production would have helped us to conserve our precious and irreplaceable asset and would have eliminated the necessity of investing our surplus in uneconomic investments in the developed countries. But we realized that such a drastic and sudden reduction would have inflicted hardship on other countries  and might have caused a serious dislocation in the world economic order  which ultimately would have been detrimental to our interests. So we increased our production by nearly 20 per cent  in spite of the obvious economic disadvantages of such an increase.211.	Although the Arab countries were not the ones which initiated the rise in oil prices  we  as OPEC members  are bound by the decisions of our organization. In any event  the way to deal with the problem is not by threats and counter-threats  not by hostility and confrontation  but through understanding. It is not logical to deal with the price of oil in isolation from the prices of manufactured goods and other commodities. In other words  the problem of oil prices should be considered within the general framework of the world economic situation. We have already taken steps in this direction by instituting co-operation  based on mutual friendship and respect  with Western Europe. This example is worthy of emulation  because the interdependence of the world economy leaves us no alternative but that of co-operation and mutual accommodation. This fully conforms to the attitude of the Arab nation  of which my country is an integral part.212.	We are a small country and our people  who have lived for centuries in conditions of appalling poverty and privation  are at long last looking with some optimism to a future free from the scourges of poverty  ignorance and disease. Our people  long neglected and forgotten by the world  are now lending a hand to other developing countries to help them in their difficult task of providing a decent life for their people. We do this out of self-interest  as well as out of a sense of duty towards others. Most developing countries are potentially rich in human and material resources; we have great confidence in their future. Our modest capital investments in their development will yield rich rewards for us as well as for them and will help us to work together to create a new  world  free from poverty and want."
"4",205,"ARG",29,1974,"On behalf of the Government and the people of Argentina  I should like first of all solemnly to express in this august Assembly our most profound solidarity with our sister republic of Honduras and its people in these hours of trial and sorrow. The Government of Argentina has already taken the necessary steps to bring Honduras evidence of our moral support and of our specific material help in order to contribute with our means to the alleviation of so tragic a situation  which we all feel as if it were our own. On this very day  aircraft of our air force are leaving for that sister republic  carrying the first aid which we can offer in these hours of tribulation. We have also committed ourselves to delivering 5 000 tons of wheat  or its equivalent in flour  to meet the first needs of the population which has been the victim of the catastrophe.55.	The President of the Republic of Argentina  Mrs. Maria Estela Martinez de Peron  has called the Ambassador of Honduras to Argentina to her office  so as to make available to our sister republic all the assistance that it may need. I trust that all countries represented here will also be mobilized so as to help the Republic of Honduras.56.	It is a most happy coincidence that as I address this General Assembly  our debates are now being guided by an illustrious representative of the great nation of Mexico  with which my country maintains the most cordial and brotherly ties of friendship.57.	The election which has conferred on Mr. Bouteflika the lofty position of President of this session of the General Assembly not only implies recognition of his personal qualifications and his ability as a representative of the great nation of Algeria but is also a tribute to the vigorous policy which that country has been developing with the non-aligned countries.58.	Thus  a personality of the third world is today responsible for guiding an Assembly which faces problems of vital interest to mankind. Among them we emphasize in particular the quest for means that will make it possible from many directions to approach that international understanding and that meeting of minds that we all desire and advocate. To extend the area of peace  to lessen the gulf between the developed and the developing countries and to bring dignity to man constitute the main challenges that the world must answer in order to achieve its objectives of understanding and unity.59.	At last year's session [2139th meeting] I emphasized that I was representing a people which by an overwhelming electoral majority had just definitely identified itself with the ideals of social justice  economic independence and political sovereignty. Since then  Argentina has made substantial headway along this course  consolidating its successes and adopting a far more positive political personality in the community of nations. In faith and serenity Argentina has whole-heartedly and without reserve embraced the cause of mankind  which is the real cause of the twentieth century  devoting its greatest efforts to the individual and collective well-being of the people. At the same time  it has maintained its historical traditions  which allow it the rather exceptional privilege in the world today of granting equal rights to all men throughout the world who wish to live in our land  without distinction of race or nationality.60.	In the past year  the Republic of Argentina suffered the great loss of its leader  Juan Peron. Great statesmen live on beyond their lifetime because their principles and their objectives remain in force  and it is my duty to emphasize here that those we inherited from General Peron have been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of Argentina. His prophetic ideas transformed him into the precursor of universalism and of a ""third position"" which are today recognized as being essential means for inter-national coexistence. His death deeply moved the entire nation  but his thinking and his guidance constitute inalterable goals for the march of our Republic towards the future. And the people of Argentina firmly maintains the policy of international co-operation which he established and  in its relations with all the countries of the world  it ratifies his purpose of achieving a genuine international social justice. Among the ideas put forth in his message to the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  which met in Algiers from 5 to 9 September 1973  he expressed total support for the cause of the countries of the third world  indicating the imperative need for a ""change in social and productive structures  because incontinent luxury and waste cannot continue to be the basic motive force of any society.61.	These expressions and this ideology  of profound philosophical and humanist content  are the ones T wish to recall here with the utmost solemnity  reiterating the Argentine commitment of solidarity with the non-aligned countries. The future will see us still standing in their ranks and sympathizing with their aspirations  Nothing can better describe the attitudes of a numerous and outstanding group of countries -among which we are honored to be-than their desire for truth and justice  their complete respect for the dignity of man and their rapid and decided march towards the liberation of their people. I therefore reiterate our position as expressed at the Algiers Conference in regard to the Political Declaration   which recommends support for decolonization and the liberation of territories occupied by force  as well as in regard to the Economic Declaration which  together with the Action Program for Economic Co-operation  is intended to enable the members of the group to develop with equality of opportunity with regard to the terms of trade with other countries of the world so that there will be a better and more just distribution of resources that will in turn contribute to greater harmony in international coexistence62.	The destiny of my country is today in the hands of Mrs. Maria Estela Martinez de Peron  who has the massive support of the citizens and of all the power factors of the nation  and she is energetically proceeding along the course set by General Peron  implementing the same ideas and seeking the attainment of identical objectives. The community of ideas and ideals between both ensure the historical continuity of Peron's thinking and the lasting character of his great design for Latin American integration  the inalterable validity of which I am pleased to reaffirm now.63.	The delegation of Argentina attends this great meeting at times which are particularly crucial for the future of the world  The combination of factors of economic and monetary tension  of generalized inflation  of the multiplicity of international political crises in various continents and the shortage and waste of natural resources  together with disease and hunger  the reduction in food reserves and the growing wave of violence throughout the world  have meant that  as our President has said  the times in which we live must be described as ""the era of insecurity"".64.	This disquieting picture appears paradoxical when we consider the high degree of technical and scientific development achieved by mankind. There are space trips and the breaking down of the atom; and still hunger  poor health and ignorance remain  whereas they should have been distant memories of superseded stages.65.	One of the solutions is clear: to unite our most determined efforts so as to achieve an equitable and just distribution of goods. If that is not rapidly achieved  tensions between human beings will increase in an accelerated manner and will increasingly acquire the apocalyptic shape of armed conflict.66.	The future demands special efforts from the United Nations  which must adopt the decisions which are indispensable to contributing to understanding among peoples and nations  to seeking the well-being of all and to avoiding the harmful predominance of some over others.67.	On the one hand  we have to review the problem of ensuring equity in the treatment of human beings in the world: of those who suffer serious poverty while there is infinite wealth; of the man with great spiritual worth  with great ideals and purposes  which all the religions and philosophies have emphasized  and of the man who is subjected to the physical limitations of the material world in which he has to live  and where frequently he is humiliated and subjected to deprivations of all kinds. Thus  rebellions are born  and sometimes they break out at odd times so that it becomes difficult to correlate them with their genuine causes. This diagnosis of the dramatic circumstances in which the world is living is  I believe  part of the conscience of all representatives  thus constituting a problem of responsibility towards others and towards ourselves.68.	On the other hand  the speed of change is such that we observe that neither persons  nor States  nor international organizations manage to keep up with an evolution which  because of the multiplicity of new discoveries and the growing interdependence among nations  creates a very dangerous delay between the adoption of decisions and their implementation. This then is yet another challenge which the United Nations faces.69.	It was Peron who was a true precursor of this universality which has today become a fact and who anticipated by almost two decades the problems that we now confront. He then stated the ""third position"". He clearly foresaw that a merciless dispute between the mighty would only contribute to a mass impoverishment of the world and  in particular  of the peoples who are today united under the principles and ideals of the ""non-aligned"".70.	The leader of the Argentine people said in February 1972:""We believe that the time has come when all peoples and Governments of the world must become aware of the suicidal march of mankind through the pollution of the environment and the biosphere  and the waste of natural resources. It is no less serious that the social systems of waste of the technologically most advanced countries operate through the consumption of vast amounts of natural resources contributed by the third world.""And he added:""All these problems are indissolubly linked to the relaxation of international tension and the extension of international co-operation.""In the defense of their interests  countries must move towards regional integrations and action based on solidarity.""71.	It is to solve these problems that we are meeting today. No one can allege that he has not at this stage heard the anxious appeals of the dispossessed. The calls for help must be heeded  without verbal demagoguery; with just and realistic action  with respect for all and with magnanimity  particularly for the humble  and fundamentally by becoming aware of the fact that the time has come when the peoples of the world must go through life in understanding and solidarity toward a common destiny of greatness; otherwise  through selfishness and intolerance they will fall into the abyss of pain and poverty.72.	At the recent sixth special session  the General Assembly dealt with some of the underlying causes of the ills of mankind. But some of the objectives set were not achieved. Natural resources are still being wasted; it is maintained that industrialized products are unattainable for the majority; the price and wage race continues  causing inflation which shakes the general economy; and protectionist trade retains its pernicious rigidity for the socio-economic situation of the world.73.	It has been repeated insistently and it was proclaimed by the General Assembly at its sixth special session  in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-K/J]- that it is necessary to facilitate the access of the developing countries to the markets of the developed by the gradual elimination of tariff barriers and other restrictive practices which hamper trade.74.	Only if the developing countries have a substantially greater share in international trade will it be possible to bring about a profound structural change and arrive at a just and permanent solution to present problems  thus consolidating a genuine process of development of our economies 75.	Those objectives have been rendered null. In this respect  a most significant example is provided by the measures taken since April last by the European Communities to limit the importation of beef  measures which culminated last June with the total cessation of beef importation until I November 1974. That decision  taken without consultation  jeopardizes agreements that are linked to the economies of the developing countries which export meat to that market.76.	Obviously  it may be argued that those measures are caused by internal difficulties in the sector  but they arise from production and marketing policies and mechanisms that are highly protectionist  that have notoriously unfavorable repercussions upon international trade and are certainly not in accord with the repeated declarations of the European Communities in various international forums in favor of greater freedom in world exchanges.77.	Peace  freedom  co-operation and friendship: those are big words which have been heard thousands of times in this Hall. Let us not again make the mistake of repeating them when they are devoid of practical content.78.	Time and space are already too limited. We pride ourselves on the honorable  albeit demanding  title of plenipotentiaries of mankind  which desires order  well-being and justice. Were this Organization to prove unable to perfect itself as a sound instrument to bring about the common well-being of peoples  its authority would be seriously jeopardized and hopes for understanding among States would suffer a hard blow.79.	The interests of Argentina are not isolated; all peoples are with us in our ideals -in particular  the peoples of the third world. Our fundamental objective must be peace. Nevertheless  that peace does not depend solely on the silence of arms among nations. It depends also upon whether human beings are satisfied with the circumstances in which they happen to live. That depends on security of feelings and brotherly assistance  on the balance between needs and resources; it depends on the access of all to food  education and health. Thus peace  as has been said many times by His Holiness the Pope  cannot be based upon selfishness  poverty or moral degradation  be it internationally or at the level of the individual contact of human beings in each organized community.80.	May I quote a statesman? He said  ""If the strong try to impose their points of view  they will do so at the expense of justice and will bring about uprisings; if the weak resort to pressures  they will do so at the peril of world prosperity and bring about despair""  and  ""No nation or group of nations stands to gain anything by making claims in excess of the limits the economic growth of the world can bear.""81.	That is a wise formula. But where will we find the just balance to apply it? Can we avoid the pressure of the strong? Can we do away with the despair of the weak  who constitute ever-growing multitudes and are afflicted by all kinds of needs? Important are the rules of the game we shall set so as to encourage what is best in human nature. And so the Republic of Argentina comes here once again with the greatest willingness to co-operate in the search for equitable but urgent formulas  ideals and practices which will respect the dignity of mankind and lead it to prosperity and confidence. We do not wish to yield to the temptation to make rhetorical allegations removed from the raw realities of the daily existence of millions of human beings. Accordingly  it is necessary that the spirit of co-operation become part of every conscience. We must respect each other's rights and share our efforts to achieve the progress and prosperity of the world.82.	Taking into account that supreme aspiration and the constant and growing preoccupation of the vast majority of mankind  my delegation once again pronounces itself decisively and firmly against any policy of apartheid  and we state in advance that Argentina will support the resolutions this Assembly will adopt definitively to eradicate such practices  which degrade the inalienable dignity of the human person.83.	New practical procedures must be added to those already adopted by the United Nations. Such developments as greater communications  communications by satellite and the inevitable coming together of the world means that what is happening elsewhere is felt to be happening to oneself  Any event that affects one region or country has a palpable and almost immediate effect even in the most remote continents. More than ever  the world is one unit -one unit of events and thoughts  one social and economic unit. We face an irresistible force of cohesion.84.	Let us  therefore  increase the effectiveness of the United Nations  which has won so much praise and rendered so much service as the only wise and viable mechanism so far developed for an exchange of views and for joint efforts by mankind.85.	To that end a first  and very efficient  method would be the strengthening of bonds between similar geographical zones. Here I believe it desirable to emphasize the ideals we pursue. We are applying a policy of co-operation and complementarity with neighboring countries  because universality must logically start at the regional level.86.	It is fitting to emphasize here that ""universality-"" means a total plurality of subjects or objects  each part acquiring its consistency in reference to the whole but without losing its sovereign individuality. That is the philosophical interpretation of the concept  and thus also we clarify the significance -primarily national  although with world-wide repercussions- of the doctrines we profess.87.	As a doctrine  we believe that to build a world society it is necessary to pass through a stage of continentalism. Countries must unite progressively on the basis of geographical neighborhood. This is Argentina's vision for Latin America: one that is just  open  generous and above all sincere. At the national level  no one can find fulfillment in a country that has none. The same holds true at the continental level. We wish to work jointly so as to build Latin America within the concept of an organized community. Its triumph will be ours  and it will also be that of the brotherhood of the third world  and it will be the triumph of unity among all States.88.	The Republic of Argentina therefore wants to place its resources and its potential above all at the service of its sister republics of America  without in the least overlooking the brotherhood we profess towards all other nations and in particular towards the nations of the third world.89.	We must go on uniting our efforts so that the vast natural resources of our American continent may be exploited for the benefit of the peoples that inhabit that soil and also may contribute to alleviating the penury of food  commodities and industrial goods in other areas of the world.90.	In particular  Latin America is living through an era of integration sustained by great spiritual vigor. We have a common strength which comes to us from the beginning of our history rooted in our origins and our similarities of character. The Republic of Argentina takes pride in being part of a continent which has so many potentialities and whose peoples hold aloft the banner of their legitimate claims  claims which include such basic and natural rights as the right to be able to trade among themselves in accordance with complete national sovereignty  to keep their territories free from any intruder or invader and to apply their own laws to their own acts; a continent which affirms justice and respect for ideologies  a continent  finally  which shares heroes who are revered as a common heritage.91.	As Peron stated:""Latin America belongs to the Latin Americans. We have lived a history. The history of the future will not forgive us if we fail to be faithful to our past ... We Argentinians feel a strong Latin American conscience ... We are firm advocates of an effective spiritual closeness for the peoples of America and reciprocal co-operation at the economic level. It is unacceptable that in the name of the interests of the continent anyone should interfere in our internal economy and external policies ... In our Latin American continent many popular leaders are working for this brotherhood  and the results achieved so far are very rewarding.""92.	Thus it is undoubted that the exercise of political sovereignty  whatever the historical circumstances  is not negotiable. This guiding principle multiplied in the national conscience of every Latin American country creates a total regional conscience  which accordingly is not negotiable either.93.	The Republic of Argentina now as never before feels that its ties with its sister republics in Latin America are deep. We feel at one with the sufferings and the just claims of the peoples which constitute the third world  and we consider that we are thereby also serving the cause of all human beings who want union and not hatred  love and not division.94.	In referring to this need for understanding and justice  Argentina cannot fail to point out that without doubt the United Nations General Assembly expressed itself to that effect when it adopted resolution 3160 (XXVIII) urging that negotiations proceed without delay with the United Kingdom in regard to the Malvinas Islands.95.	Our country still has to bear the occupation of part of our territory by an extra-continental Power  a situation which is not in accordance with the direction and the ideals of the world today  and the Republic of Argentina considers that this continuing situation is inadmissible. It is true that  as my Government communicated to the Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  contacts do exist for resuming these negotiations. A solution  however  has not yet been reached  and I must accordingly reiterate here the unalterable sovereignty of Argentina over the territory of the Malvinas Islands and point out that this just claim will of necessity condition our international relations in any circumstances in which our right may be discussed 96.	As I said not long ago at the Atlanta Conference of the Organization of American States ""The decision to achieve the final eradication of this anachronistic colonial situation is one which is shared by all the people of Argentina  and their Government recognizes it as a mandate that cannot be renounced."" I reiterate my confidence that  in seeking a solution  we shall be able to count on the necessary understanding and political decision of the present Government of the United Kingdom so as to put an end to this problem.97.	As proof of our concern in regard to the matters involved  I declare once again that the Republic of Argentina will do everything in its power to protect the interests of the inhabitants of the Islands and to increase their well-being  thus enabling them to accede to the benefits and progress enjoyed by the people of Argentina. Therefore I am pleased to announce here that a few days ago I had the satisfaction of signing  together with the representative of the United Kingdom in Buenos Aires  separate notes in which an enlargement of the fuel plant installed by my Government on the Islands is envisaged as well as other measures intended to facilitate trade between the continental territory of Argentina and the Malvinas Islands.98.	We know that international policy is not a goal in itself but a means of contributing to the happiness of man and the greatness of States; but international policy is also a duty for Governments in order to fulfill the destiny of each people. From its very inception Argentina  in attaining political independence  placed everything it possessed at the service of the peoples of the continent. That has been our guideline. That is our objective for greatness  and under our present decisions both in the United Nations and in the inter-American system we shall continue to follow that historic mandate and achieve and strengthen hemispheric brotherhood.99.	I do not believe it would be idle to emphasize once again here the importance which the Republic of Argentina attaches to the principle of non-intervention. That principle  which has no limitations  must be applied without exception and must once and for all become a sacrosanct norm of the external policy of States. Only four years ago this very Assembly so decided in unequivocal provisions of resolutions 2625 (XXV) and 2627 (XXV).100.	As integral members of the Latin American community we are bound to express our satisfaction that a noble nation  albeit far removed from Latin America  has ensured the study by this Assembly of a legal political institution which was inherited from our own motherland  Spain  and which is typically Latin American. I refer to the item on diplomatic asylum  included in the agenda Of this session at Australia's request [see A19704]. Diplomatic asylum is but a humanitarian rule to give shelter to those who are persecuted for political and not criminal reasons. In Latin America asylum in diplomatic missions has been an unbroken tradition maintained by almost every Government at all times  even when there was no obligation to provide political asylum. Argentina signed the initial multilateral treaty at the Latin American level in Montevideo in 1880s and has had the opportunity of applying its generous principles not only in America but in other hemispheres.101.	The seventh special session to be held in September 1975 in the two weeks preceding the thirtieth session of the General Assembly acquires particular significance in the light of the results achieved since the sixth special session  on raw materials and development. Argentina shares the general feeling that the seventh special session must provide a unique opportunity for achieving the objectives incorporated in the Declaration [resolution 3201 (S-Vl)} and the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  since the sixth special session was but a transcendental point of departure in a particularly dynamic process  the goal of which is the establishment of a new international economic order which will be more just and equitable. Possibly one of the means of achieving more practical results in the deliberations might consist in some change in the administrative structure of the United Nations to adapt it better to quick changes  particularly in the economic and social fields  so that the developing countries could be better represented in executive posts in that administrative structure.102.	On the other hand  the Republic of Argentina is keenly interested  in accordance with its governmental and political philosophy  in everything relating to the quality of life  because that is tied to the very future of mankind. We therefore pay particular attention to problems relating to natural resources and the environment  and we consider it timely for the United Nations to continue to deal with those far-reaching items with special emphasis.103.	In particular  my country is interested in those and other aspects which deserve further study and solution in this General Assembly. I am referring to ""collective ecological security""  that is to say the cooperation which must exist between States in order to maintain an equitable balance in regard to certain elements which cover or involve more than one country and action in solidarity when the acts of one Government might run counter to that concept. Thus  in principle  we might consider as being in contradiction with the collective ecological security of nations such acts which  to an extent that is not normal  disturb health conditions  the climate  their own or shared natural resources or the purity of waters that flow from one nation to another  or such measures as might affect the natural existence of forests  rivers  the fauna and flora of land  seas or rivers or those which could contaminate the atmosphere.104.	My country reaffirms the inalienable right of peoples and nations to permanent sovereignty over their own natural resources and wealth  whether they be removable or non-removable  living or nonliving. That is a principle which we practice to the full  in particular as regards energy resources.105.	In accordance with the characteristics of shared natural resources for use and exploitation we seek the establishment of general and universal policies on the basis of recognition and reaffirmation of principles and practices which have been sanctioned by use  doctrine and international jurisprudence  Along that line of thinking the General Assembly established  in resolution 3129 (XXVIII)  a mechanism for prior consultation and the exchange of information  so that the exploration  exploitation and development of shared natural resources might be carried out in close co-operation between the parties concerned and in a rational manner so as to obtain optimum yields.106.	With regard to the results of the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  my Government deems them to have been positive  Undoubtedly  the international community has lent broad support to the maritime claims of the Latin American countries.107.	It is the hope of Argentina that agreement will be reached on a convention which will finally provide adequate political solutions to the difficult maritime and oceanic problems. In the first place  with the establishment of a territorial sea of 12 miles and an adjacent exclusive economic zone up to a distance of 200 miles  within which there would be freedom of navigation and overflight and freedom to place submarine cables  the coastal State would exercise sovereign rights in regard to fishing  the regulation and control of scientific research and the preservation of the marine environment 108.	That position prevailed at the Caracas session. We hope it will be strengthened in Geneva and finally enshrined in the future convention. And yet we believe it is fitting to warn of the dangers of some proposals which apparently recognize the 200-mile zone  but with so many conditions attached as to distort its essence. This claim by some great Powers  which cannot resign themselves to losing their privileges  is unacceptable to the developing countries 109.	Likewise  the Convention cannot affect the rights acquired by the coastal State over its continental shelf beyond the 200 miles since the continental shelf  in accordance with existing inter-national law  constitutes the natural prolongation of its territory under the sea. In other words  no acceptable political solution can affect the sovereignty of the coastal State over its submerged territory  which extends to the external lower edge of the continental margin  My country hopes that this position will be finally accepted at the next session of the Conference  since this mechanism will prevent the renewal of international injustices on the sea international injustices which have characterized the appropriation of natural resources on land.110.	It has been the purpose of the Government which I represent to intensify to the utmost the links of the Republic of Argentina with the other countries of the international community. The last decades have been witness to fundamental changes in the world community  with the inclusion of many nations which have emerged to independent life and the resurgence of others which  although having a glorious past  had been subject to long periods of subordination or isolation  To those States  which constitute a large part of the third world  the diplomatic activity of Argentina was specially directed so as to seek their presence when it had been absent and to strengthen it where it existed.111.	That policy was not due merely to a desire to create or to intensify relations. It was the response to a profound motivation  to a sincere and open feeling of solidarity with the peoples of the third world 112.	At this difficult and. complex stage of substantial and rapid alterations in relations among States  the need for close and frank co-operation is imperative for those who are not at the center of power. In this way we prevent the fundamental decisions of world policy being adopted in our absence or without taking into account the interests of those who represent two thirds of mankind.113.	This act of solidarity of the Republic of Argentina has been made manifest in various international forums and has led to the recognition of new States and the establishment of diplomatic relations with numerous countries in every latitude. This is eloquent testimony of our will to expand our international panorama to the utmost and to create a constructive dialog with all geographical and political entities  once and for all going beyond the ideological and partial schemes or omissions of the past.114.	The most recent event of this new approach of our foreign policy  which faithfully reflects the aspirations of the Argentine people  has been the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. We thus supplemented the first step which we took several months ago when the Government of Argentina recognized that new State in the midst of difficulties which still hampered its fully independent life. Today I am most happy to welcome among us that country whose struggle for emancipation evokes in our memory the emancipation battles of Latin American countries in different times and circumstances but with the inspiration of the same ideals of freedom and justice.115.	We sincerely hope that the process of liberation of the Portuguese colonies will continue at an accelerated rate. The policy implemented by the new Government of Portugal deserves our respect and we express the hope that other events will rapidly take place which will assist in ending once and for all vestiges of a colonialism which history has superseded.116.	Because of our proven anti-colonialist vocation  we add the voice of the Republic of Argentina to that of the Secretary-General  who  in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al960IIAdd.I]  emphasizes the positive and valuable aspects of the new policy of Portugal in regard to its former colonies. The change has a transcendental projection within the framework of the United Nations  whose constant struggle to eradicate those chronic situations of injustice had the active support of my country. Now our Organization must be the main channel whereby opinions and actions of the international community will be guided in this question 117.	We also welcome the other two new Members of the United Nations  Bangladesh and Grenada. With regard to the latter country  may I in particular mention the special satisfaction of the Government and people of Argentina at its admission; the Latin American group has gained a valuable representative which  together with the other English-speaking countries in the hemisphere  will help in increasing their over-all contribution to the important questions that are before the Assembly at this session.118.	My words are a message of brotherhood towards all nations and they express in brief the feeling of the people of Argentina which  with its willingness to serve  endeavors to contribute with what is best in itself so that by achieving spiritual and material progress for every human being we will give effect to our aspiration to build a better world."
"5",310,"AUS",29,1974,"Mr. President  in this year in which Australia has established diplomatic relations with Algeria  it gives me particular pleasure  as head of the Australian Government  to congratulate you upon your election as President of this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The Algerian experience has encompassed many of the greatest problems facing the world and the Organization today. Sir  your nation's experience—and your own—ensure distinction and significance to your occupancy of this high post.3.	As head of the first Australian social democratic Government since Australia helped to found the United Nations and to frame its Charter more than a quarter of a century ago  I reaffirm our loyalty to both. Such pledges are easily enough given; yet no nation makes them more sincerely  more earnestly today  than Australia.4.	No country more than Australia needs the fulfilment of the international objectives of the United Nations to reach the fulfilment of her own national objectives. There are few countries in which the paradox is demonstrated with such force that true national independence depends upon international interdependence. There are few nations to which the mirage of national self-sufficiency can be made so tempting; yet there are few nations for which that mirage can be so easily dispelled. Australia  fortunate in possession of great resources  confident in the ability of its own people to develop those re-sources  is nevertheless not ashamed to admit its interdependence with its neighbours and its partners across the world and its dependence upon them. We are a people without illusions; we Australians neither falsely exaggerate our strengths nor fearfully exaggerate our weaknesses. It is precisely because we make a rational assessment of our strengths and weaknesses that we recognize that we depend upon a better international order to preserve those things we most value about our national independence/In seeking a better international order  we give primacy to the United Nations.5.	It is therefore with growing concern that we witness what can only be called a drift away from international order and international co-operation at present occurring in world affairs. Australia's concern springs not just from the real difficulties created by recent events but  even more  from the feeling that there has been a weakening of will  a loss of momentum  in international determination to meet and overcome those difficulties.6.	Great hopes were born two years ago. The Australian Government whole-heartedly endorsed the movement towards detente between the United States and the Soviet Union. We whole-heartedly supported China's return to her true place in the family of nations—in the Organization and in the world. We whole-heartedly .endorsed the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam  signed in Paris on 27 January 1973. We therefore ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]  moved our China Embassy from Taipei to Peking  and ended our own military involvement in Indo-China.7.	Above all  we have been determined to do all we can to ensure that our region and the world should not for a second time lose the opportunity for a new settlement  a new step towards peace and progress  in the way that the chance was thrown away after the war in Korea and after the Geneva meetings in 1954. Yet we have to acknowledge that the hopes springing from the remarkable events of 1971 and 1972 are beginning to sour. There is increasingly a sense of drift  a sense of events out of control. The task of this Assembly should be to help to stop that drift. Our natural preoccupation with our national problems —and for most of us they are very great indeed—must not lead to a loss of international concern and involvement.8.	We cannot turn inwards. Even the most immediate problems of domestic worry—such as inflation  which so many of us share  the strongest  the most highly developed along with the weakest and the least developed—are in essence international problems for which there can be no ultimate  no complete national solution without an international solution. No nation  no group of nations  no bloc  no alliance  can live alone  can live entirely to itself in this new world. We are all internationalists now—by necessity. Australia is internationalist by necessity and by choice.. Each of us has our bilateral arrangements and our regional arrangements. Many  like Australia  through treaty or trade or tradition  have honourable alignments and valuable associations.9.	It is  however  through this Organization  its Assembly and its councils and through the specialized agencies that the enduring international settlements must ultimately be sought and the drift away from international co-operation must be arrested. So there must be no loss of nerve  no loss of will here. If we here lose our nerve  if we here allow that drift to continue unchecked  we face the break-down of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty   the break-down of world economic order  the break-down of all our high hopes and high words about closing the gap between the developed and the developing nations and the breakdown of any claims of the United Nations to be an effective peace-keeper and peace-maker. We should all stand guilty of betrayal of our peoples if we did not act now to stop the drift in these matters.10.	The special obligations which the might of the super-Powers imposes upon them should not be made an excuse for indifference or indecision on the part of the rest of us. We continue to urge upon the superPowers the need for them both to maintain the utmost mutual restraint in their relations between themselves and towards us. They can  of course  easily destroy each other; they can also destroy all of us. We are entitled to ask them to move forward to a stage of complete detente where their tremendous power can be used jointly for the betterment of the whole civilization. We are entitled to insist upon restraint in their deployment of forces overseas  in areas such as the Indian Ocean. Australia is strongly opposed to the Indian Ocean becoming a ground for competition  much less confrontation  between the great Powers.11.	Mutual restraint is also essential to prevent the excesses and the dangers of the nuclear arms race. Let me recall that those of us who are so far parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have given the nuclear Powers certain rights; they in turn have accepted certain responsibilities and given guarantees  as part of a two-way process. We undertook not to develop nuclear weapons in return for guarantees of protection and assistance in the development of nuclear knowledge for peace. Above all  the sponsoring Powers undertook to promote and maintain a world order based upon comprehensive disarmament. Unless these obligations are sincerely fulfilled  the incentive abroad and the pressure at home for more and more nations to get nuclear weapons will increase. A co-operative effort by all leaders must find effective means of halting the arms race and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. There is nothing more urgent facing any of us today.12.	Australia therefore sees with deepest anxiety the continuing and new testing of nuclear devices  the prospect of an ever-increasing number of nations possessing nuclear weapons and an even greater number possessing the capability of exploding nuclear devices. Where it has been open to Australia we have expressed our concern   in action before the International Court of Justice.13.	All of us face a nightmare world in which as many as 15 or 20 nations may possess nuclear weapons by the early 1980s. There is time to prevent it. We have perhaps about a year  two years at the most  in which to prevent it. Now is the time; it may be our last chance. For our part  the Australian Government pledges that it will neither develop nor acquire nuclear weapons.14.	Our first aim must be to strengthen the non-proliferation Treaty and to work for its acceptance everywhere. Real and rapid progress can best be made through that Treaty. We should build on what we have. We have not time to start all over again. Six years after it was concluded and more than four years after it came into force  some States have still to ratify the Treaty or to make clear their renunciation of nuclear weapons development. Certainly we understand the difficulties the Treaty presents to some nations. We understand their reservations. We acknowledge the discriminatory aspects of the Treaty as it now stands. We would hope that the forthcoming conference to review the Treaty will remove some of these difficulties  but the conference will be more successful and meaningful if more nations ratify the Treaty and work within its framework to improve it and to apply it.15.	Secondly  we should make a comprehensive treaty to ban nuclear-weapons testing an urgent priority. The treaties which have been concluded and the resolutions which have been adopted are important achievements  but they have not gone far enough towards stopping the nuclear arms race. They are only steps towards universal and comprehensive agreement on nuclear-weapons testing. We must complete the journey .16.	Thirdly  we need effective international arrangements to govern and to control nuclear experiments for peaceful purposes. We all recognize the promise which scientific collaboration on the peaceful uses Of nuclear energy holds for economic development in the interests of all mankind. But the world cannot afford the risks which lie in the prospects of increasing numbers of countries possessing nuclear devices—even if they profess to have them for peaceful purposes only. We cannot shrug off nuclear explosions which present us with such a threat  particularly explosions conducted outside existing safeguards and without international inspection. Australia seeks support for an international arrangement by which all States could gain access to nuclear explosive services for peaceful purposes under agreed and secure international controls. We urge all nuclear States to co-operate in establishing such a service  preferably under the auspices of IAEA. I join with the Foreign Minister of Canada in this call [2242nd meeting].17.	Another approach to the goal of disarmament worth serious exploration is the concept of peace zones. Such zones are of course no substitute for comprehensive disarmament and no substitute for an effective non-proliferation Treaty. Australia  however  takes a particular interest in the agreements and proposals embodying this concept  because most of them directly affect our continent and our region. The Antarctic Treaty 1 the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 {XXVI)}  the ASEAN Declaration 2 the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)3 and the proposal by Iran for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East [AI9693] all move in the right direction. They command Australia's broad support since they assert the dangers inherent in an uncontrolled  unregulated use of our planet for the deployment of nuclear weapons; they seek to limit the development  emplacement and use of nuclear weapons in the: areas and environments they cover; they all express growing anxiety about the spread of nuclear weapons; they all seek paths towards reducing tensions among the nuclear Powers. For the Australian Government  these initiatives not only represent ends in themselves but  we believe  they serve to stimulate progress on other important measures intended to bring to fulfilment the hopes of mankind to live in security  free from the threat of nuclear war.18.	Let me say that Australia's anxiety about the nuclear arms race does not blind us to the risks to international peace and security from localized conflicts using conventional weapons. We  the members of the international community  stand condemned for our failure so far to find the sense of responsibility and the means of authority to stop regional disputes being settled by force. It is equally bad that some members of the international community have made possible —for profit—massive recourse to arms and to the means of waging* wars about to start or wars already begun. A world order that permits  or that by default sanctions  the large-scale transfer of weapons from one country to another where the risk of conflict is high  is gravely at fault and very foolish. This short-circuits the process of peaceful negotiation and gives first place to the settlement of disputes by war  by bloodshed and  as always happens—and must always happen in modern wars—by the bloodshed of the innocent.19.	Clearly   we still have far to go before the international community will agree collectively to forsake the short-term gains on arms sales abroad in return for the longer-term but less tangible benefits that such a self-denying ordinance would confer on the weapons producers. Nevertheless  we now ask that the major weapons-producing countries should set an example by imposing the strictest restrictions on the export of arms abroad to areas where there is a clear risk of conflict.20.	Recent events have shown that the preservation of peace is more than a matter of arms control; it is also a matter of keeping the peace When violence threatens or occur?. It is not enough for Members of the United Nations to pay lip-service to the United Nations peace-keeping role. Individual Members have the duty to provide the material and financial resources to allow the United Nations to deal with threats to security  breaches of the peace and acts of aggression.	21.	Australia stands ready to participate in peacekeeping operations in whatever way would be most useful. Australia is  of course  allied by treaty with the United States  and we make no apologies for that. There is  however  no area of actual or potential conflict anywhere in the world where loyalties  ideology or interests should make an Australian involvementin peace-keeping unacceptable or unwelcome. We wish Australia to be always among the first nations of which the United Nations would ask peace-keeping forces. We shall be among the first to respond. We undertake to keep the Secretary-General regularly informed of the nature and size of the contributions we are able to provide over a given period.22.	Australia further believes that the importance of preventive diplomacy must come to be more widely recognized and accepted  and that the ample provisions offered by this Organization for peace-keeping and good offices should be reinvigorated  explored more thoroughly and exploited more thoroughly. It is time  therefore  to look again at the hitherto untapped provisions of the United Nations Charter and to make all that we can of its capacity to provide useful contributions to such activities as fact-finding  conciliation  mediation and negotiation.23.	We here should particularly devote increased attention to the role of the International Court of Justice. Not enough nations use the Court. Members of the international community cannot be compelled to take their cases before the Court  but we should strive to build confidence in the Court's worth  its wisdom and its workability as one way of rationalizing and harmonizing international relations. If the. rule of international law and justice is to prevail  then an international tribunal is indispensable. The Court's jurisdiction should be widened. Jurisdiction should become compulsory and universal. New multilateral treaty arrangements  like that which will emerge from the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  should enforce compulsory settlement of disputes  with the International Court as the final court of appeal. By such steps the rule of law can be established and strengthened in a better world order.24.	In this difficult  complicated  crowded world we are all creating for ourselves  the causes of conflict multiply. Nuclear brinkmanship  ideology  border disputes  race hatred  religious bigotry  national ambitions  foreign exploitation—all provide actual or potential sources of tension  conflict  bloodshed and war. Yet there remains for the future one of the oldest of all causes of war-—the threat of war for the possession of resources. Huge population increases  the revolution of rising expectations  the enormous and often wasteful demands our technological civilization makes upon the world's resources —all have increased the pressures on our world civilization to the very limit of the tolerable.25.	For countries which lack resources  the situation has become critical. The developing countries have been grossly disadvantaged; Last year's oil crisis brought that sharply home to all of us  developed and developing alike.26.	It is proper that in this world forum I should state the Australian Government's attitude to the use and development of Australia's own very considerable resources. There is no place in our thinking for economic nationalism in its crudest sense. We do  of course  wish to ensure steady markets at fair prices for what we produce. We recognize the great scope for increased co-operation between producers of raw materials and for groups of exporting countries to associate to build a better framework for orderly and rational development of production and trade. As a relatively developed and thriving nation whose production of many resources is also shared by developing and poorer nations  Australia recognizes its duty to co-operate with such nations in obtaining a fair and reasonable return for our products  and we are co-operating.' Equally  however  we in Australia accept our responsibility to reassure countries which depend upon our resources that they shall have steady  secure access to those resources at fair prices. We must protect our interests  and we shall  but Australia is not in the business of resources blackmail. That is the way to international disaster  for producers and users alike.27.	Let us accept the plain fact that war for resources or food or markets carried on by any nation or group of nations would in modern times represent the supreme folly. There is no war  nuclear or conventional  by which the victor  so called—assuming there is one—could conceivably win back by war the resources used and destroyed in waging it. If we choose not to listen to the voice of humanity against war  we might at least listen to the voice of common sense and  indeed  ordinary  rational self-interest.28.	As a major food producer  Australia is. particularly interested in the proposals on food which President Ford [2234th meeting] and Secretary of State Kissinger [2238th meeting] made at this session. Australia undertakes to work constructively and cooperatively towards the implementation of those proposals. Suggestions such as the establishment of an international system of grain reserves are thoroughly commendable  and they deserve our most serious attention.29.	Of all the changes that have occurred in the international community since the Second World War  none has more profoundly altered the face of the world than the accession to independence by those peoples and States formerly under colonial rule; The process is not yet complete  but we look to a time in the near future when no territory will be controlled against its choice by a metropolitan Power with which it has no geographical  social  racial or cultural affinity. In that regard  we particularly welcome decisions by Portugal about its colonies.30.	Australia has acted with determination and vigour to apply the relevant Articles of the Charter. Papua New Guinea became self-governing on 1 December 1973. It will become fully independent as soon as the House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea decides. We expect that decision soon: Let me emphasize that the decision we await is that of the House of Assembly. The Australian Government made its own decision long ago: we utterly reject a colonial role for Australia. Meanwhile  the Australian Government deals with the Government of Papua New Guinea in all significant respects as that of a nation already independent.31.	There is to me  I must say  a most satisfying symmetry in the march of events by which Portugal  the West  and Australia  the newest of the colonial Powers  are acting at the same time towards the liquidation of colonialism. Across the distance of more than four centuries the new world in Australia clasps hands with the old in ending a false  demeaning  unworthy power over others. 32.	The dramatic and welcome progress made towards the dissolution of the oldest and last of the colonial empires now enables the United Nations to direct even more concentrated attention Upon its twin evil  that of racisms particularly in its post-colonial manifestations in southern Africa. We must be unremitting in the efforts sanctioned by the Assembly to break the illegal regime in Rhodesia—Zimbabwe— to end South Africa's unlawful control over Namibia and to end apartheid. We should all make determined efforts to see that the momentum which launched the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination is not lost. <;My Government  conscious that Australia's own record is seriously flawed  is determined to remove all forms of racial discrimination within our own shores—notably now as notoriously in the past  against our own aboriginals.33.	While racism remains as cruel as any example of man's inhumanity to man  we should not  however  overlook the existence of other forms of discrimination which rob men and women of their right to live in dignity and peace of mind. Throughout the world  political prisoners languish in gaols or are otherwise deprived of their civil liberties. There are thoroughly unacceptable constraints on the right of political asylum. Religious and ethnic minorities are persecuted  workers are denied the protection of conventions of ILO and women are denied equal opportunities. Even in the General Assembly women are scarcely equally represented. The Australian Foreign Minister  Senator Willesee  will during the discussion be submitting Australia's views and proposals on these matters.34.	There has never been a time in human history when the truth of the oneness  the indivisibility  of humanity has been so manifest. It is no longer only a philosophical or religious proposition  but an assertion of sheer reason and commanding common sense. All the momentous recent developments have profound implications for the future conduct of international relations  since they have one common theme: the interdependence of us all. That interdependence is now almost total.35.	An attempt by any State to bring about political or economic change in another through unconstitutional  clandestine  corrupt methods  by assassination or terrorism  undermines the rule of international law  encourages adventurism and anarchy  endangers world peace  and turns quite quickly against even the most powerful nations that would seek to advance their cause by such methods.	36.	Unwilful erection of trade barriers by one State or group of States without regard to the hardship caused to others can create economic dislocation around the world by curtailing or closing export markets to which their industries have become geared and on which their foreign exchange earnings depend.37.	A refusal to recognize the inalienable rights of all peoples to freedom and independence produces tension and conflict  not only between the oppressed and the oppressors  but between them and other nations which become associated or involved in these just and legitimate struggles.38.	Now more than ever we look to the United Nations. It has the experience  the stature and the capacity to help us identify the sources of tension between nations  to prescribe collective measures to mitigate and eventually to remove* the causes of conflict  and to anticipate and prevent situations developing that have the potential for disturbing world peace.39.	It is claimed that the world is now short of leadership. It is truer to say that the nature  complexity and universality of the problems rushing in upon us render irrelevant and obsolete that concept of world leadership whereby a handful of powerful men in charge of the most powerful nations can chart the course for the rest of us to follow. So the challenge for the United Nations to provide a genuine and continuing source of leadership  of hope and purpose for the world is more urgent  the opportunity more real  than at any time in the history of the Organization. In the response we make here to that challenge  we shall be judged —as nations  as representatives of our nations  and as men and women—not by our power or size or wealth but by the honesty of our efforts to promote and to practise the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."
"6",357,"AUT",29,1974,"Sir  it is more than a mere custom  and for me it is more than an agreeable task it is a real pleasure to request you to transmit to the President of the General Assembly  on behalf of the delegation of Austria  our most sincere congratulations on his election as President Of the twenty-ninth session 6f the General Assembly. In him we welcome the representative of a country with which Austria maintains cordial relations.71.	Just as the new Algeria understands the permanent neutrality of Austria  which is the foundation of its foreign policy  so Austria understands the policy of non-alignment which is characteristic of the foreign policy of modern Algeria.72.	Allow me  too  to join to the congratulations I extend to the President of the Assembly our expression of gratitude towards his predecessor  Mr. Leo- poldo Benites of Ecuador  who  guided by the wealth of his experience in the work of international organizations  was able to direct the work of the twenty- eighth session with so much perspicacity  skill and  indeed  devotion.73.	One of the first acts of this General Assembly was to admit to membership in our Organization three States from three great continents  Asia  Africa and Latin America  namely: Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. The entry to the United Nations of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau as an independent State symbolizes ""in a particularly striking manner the new progress being made in the decolonization process in Africa  which Austria has always supported. I cannot fail to rejoice at the opportunity given me to welcome these three new Member States and to assure them that we are looking forward to close and friendly co-operation.74.	I should also like to avail myself of this opportunity to express the most heartfelt condolences of Austria to the people of Honduras who have been struck so hard by a severe catastrophe.75.	In this month of September it is more difficult than it was on the eve of the last General Assembly to have a clear-cut view of international developments because of the events of the last year.76.	We have in fact lived through two crises that had global repercussions  and on two occasions our Organization has had to make every endeavor to stop these crises from expanding  to control their potential consequences and  above all  to prevent them from evolving into even greater catastrophes.77.	In October 1973 there was a new outbreak of war in the Middle East  which was more violent than any of the previous military confrontations in that region. On both sides the number of victims was larger  human suffering more harsh.78.	The peace efforts made at that time finally enabled Egypt and Israel  on the one hand  and Syria and Israel  on the other  to reach agreements on the disengagement of their forces and on the reduction of their military potential in the strategically significant zones. Because of the goodwill and the tireless efforts of all  and also because of the diplomatic skill patience and tenacity of the negotiators  these agreements came into being. These are facts which history will take into account.79.	Allow me to say that my country  as a non- permanent member of the Security Council  feels a very special satisfaction at having been able to contribute to the first successes achieved in this struggle for peace in the Middle East  in particular  by sending contingents within the framework of the United Nations peace-keeping operations. Nevertheless  a long stretch of road lies ahead on the way to peace and understanding in the Middle East.80.	In the spirit of friendship that links us here with all the peoples and States in that region  my country profoundly hopes that this struggle for peace in the Middle East will no longer be hampered  in the future  by insurmountable obstacles. However  no satisfactory solution to this difficult problem can be found without taking into account the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people  and without the existence of all States in the region receiving a firm guarantee.81.	Quite recently another crisis has upset the inter-national order  and this in a particularly sensitive area.82.	The Cyprus crisis has aroused grave concern in my country  first  because the Republic of Cyprus is  like Austria  a European country  and secondly  again like Austria  it is a small country that is not a member of any military alliance. Our concern  our uneasiness which are shared by so many other countries are also due to the fact that  by both the coup d'etat of 15 July and the military invasion that followed it  a small State  a Member of the United Nations  has been the victim of a recourse to force from abroad for the purpose of bringing about changes in its internal situation.83.	Given these events  which seem to reflect a dangerous erosion oi international morality  Austria has never ceased to affirm the principles of independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity for the Republic of Cyprus  and the non-use of force in international relations.84.	Faithful to these principles  Austria has likewise held to the point of view that the problem of Cyprus must be settled  first and foremost  by the Cypriots themselves  and that only a dialog between the two communities on the island assisted  of course  by all those who bear special responsibilities in this regard  and by the United Nations can lead to the restoration of peace in Cyprus.85.	In this connexion  we hope that the dialog that has been started between representatives of the two communities thanks to the good offices of the Secretary-General will progress and will succeed in laying the basis for a settlement of the crisis. We wish to insist on the importance of such a settlement's being reached as soon as possible  for what is at stake is the credibility of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.86.	The United Nations  when faced with these two great crises that have erupted in the last year the scope and intensity of which constituted a threat to the process of detente was able  through its competent organs  to discharge the role assigned to it under the Charter.87.	In this context  the peace-keeping operations decided upon by the Security Council are of particular importance. Scrupulous respect for such peacekeeping operations  in particular the obligation of not hindering the members in the execution of their mandate  constitutes an essential condition for their success. Such respect is likewise indispensable for safeguarding the authority of the United Nations.88.	In the economic and social fields  too  the inter-national community has been gravely put to the test. Recent manifestations of economic crisis  particularly the persistence of inflationary pressures and the gravity of the situation as regards energy and food  have made us even more aware of the need for concerted action among all countries.89.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and development  drew attention to the vastness of these problems and  accordingly  advocated the establishment of a new international economic order. Now  the main characteristic of such a new economic order must be its capacity to place sound economic growth at the service of universally accepted objectives  that is to say  the elimination of the hunger and destitution and poverty that exist in many regions of the world; the struggle against pollution and the preservation of the environment rightly regarded as preconditions for the existence in human dignity of any people; a general rise in standards of living; and acceleration of the process of industrialization in the developing countries Such a new economic order must  however; also seek to avoid all forms of waste: in the field of energy  in that of raw materials and  above all  in that of armaments.90.	It is therefore to be hoped that all efforts directed at slowing down the arms race will soon produce positive and tangible results. On the basis of the latest estimates  more than $207 000 million were spent last year for armaments purposes. This sum represents more than 6 per cent of the world total of gross national products. A reduction in this enormous expenditure could assist in rendering more effective the aid given to the developing countries.91.	Assistance to the developing countries that are most afflicted by economic difficulties is a paramount obligation. Austria has not failed to support the efforts of the United Nations for the benefit of those countries. We earnestly hope that the measures provided for within the framework of that program will enjoy the support of all those States which  because of their economic situation  are in a position to manifest their solidarity with the countries hardest hit.92.	Nevertheless  however great the speed and energy with which assistance is brought to the countries most affected  it cannot in the long run prove effective unless the causes of their destitution are likewise eliminated. In this connexion  the delegation of Austria considers that the initiatives taken within the United Nations system to convene a series of major international conferences have made it possible to analyze the problems faced by all States and to find solutions with a view to creating a better balance in the world economy. Yet ascertaining all the facts and adopting all kinds of resolutions  if not followed by effective action on the part of all members of the international community  will not be enough to improve a situation which runs the risk of becoming chaotic.93. The draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States prepared by UNCTAD on the initiative of the President of Mexico  Mr. Echeverria  could serve as a guideline and point the way towards a renewal in international economic co-operation. It is our earnest hope that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly may be able to reach a consensus on that Charter. Thus we shall have placed an essential corner-stone in building a system of collective economic security. However  this system can be achieved only in so  far as we are prepared to assume collective economic  responsibility. In this context  the delegation of Austria is very pleased with the suggestion made by the Foreign Minister of Norway the day before yesterday in this Assembly [2241st meeting] to transform the Economic and Social Council into a body in permanent session  and we consider that this idea deserves to be adopted.94.	Economic and social justice cannot be attained without respect for the dignity and freedom of man. It follows that all forms of racial or religious oppression must be abolished in the world of today. Colonial domination has no future. The evolution in Portugal and the efforts of -the Portuguese Government towards a solution of the complex problems of its African colonies deserve special attention in this regard. We hope that the arduous struggle waged at the cost of great sacrifices by the liberation movements in southern Africa will  in the near future  and by peaceful means  lead to the attainment of the objectives of freedom and independence.95.	The Austrian delegation notes  furthermore  not without grave anxiety  that the policy of apartheid persists in South Africa. No sign of change is to be seen in the South African policy towards Namibia either  despite the unequivocal opinion of the International Court of Justice and the clear stand repeatedly taken by competent United Nations organs.96.	My country has. consistently affirmed its respect for human rights and firmly supported any action intended to promote them  particularly within the United Nations framework. Austria has once again demonstrated its convictions on this matter  by signing the International Covenants on Human Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)  annexJ on the twenty- fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.97.	It is deeply disquieting to have to note that even today there are numerous flagrant cases of violations of human rights. Torture and every kind of penalty employed with the aim of degrading a human being are the most abject treatments one can inflict on man  very particularly when these methods are used against political prisoners. Austria lends its firmest support to all efforts undertaken within the United Nations for the purpose of eliminating torture.98.	Allow me also to speak of another major humanitarian problem which  unhappily  has been on our agenda for years and has never ceased to preoccupy international opinion: the problem of refugees.99.	Every new crisis  every upheaval in the international order  has resulted in an increase in the number of those who find themselves homeless and are plunged into the greatest misery. The events in Cyprus provide us with a painfully eloquent example  since we know that at present one-third of the population of the island have the status of refugees. It is  therefore  urgent to intensify international action for. the benefit of refugees throughout the world and to strive to do away with the underlying  mostly political  causes of their deplorable state.100.	Austria has consistently supported and contributed to the process of detente. The Federal Government has concentrated its efforts in particular in the framework of Europe  by participating actively in the consultations of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at Geneva. We hope that the second stage of the Conference will soon arrive at satisfactory solutions which will enable it to set up the final stage at the highest level.101.	It is with very special satisfaction that I can report to this General Assembly on the positive developments regarding the question of South Tyrol  which was the subject of General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI).102.	Four years ago at the twenty-fifth session  my predecessor was able to inform the General Assembly [1855th meeting] that Austria and Italy had agreed on a proposal which made provision for an extension of the autonomy of South Tyrol according to a timetable agreed to by both States.103.	I am happy to be able to inform you today that further progress has been achieved in that matter since the last General Assembly session and that most of the measures for broadening the autonomy of South Tyrol have been expressed in corresponding laws and administrative arrangements. However  a certain number of measures remain to be taken. I wish to express the hope that the settlement of this question will proceed satisfactorily and that it will be completed in the near future.104.	The desire of my country to contribute to the work of the United Nations  not only politically but also materially  is evidenced by the building of new headquarters for IAEA and UNIDO in Vienna. The ""United Nations City""  construction of which is well under way and will be completed in 1978  according to estimates  is financed entirely by Austria. We hope that this tangible contribution will be. recognized internationally by integrating the city of Vienna in the ""pattern of conferences"" of the United Nations. We hope also that our offer to welcome to Vienna other units of the United Nations Secretariat and other organizations will be favorably received.105.	The attainment of the purposes and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations requires an extraordinary effort from all Members. Naturally  the contribution expected from each Member State must be in accordance with the reality of its specific situation and its material means. Yet we cannot expect to move forward on the course we have set ourselves unless each Member of the Organization is prepared to shoulder the responsibilities incumbent on it  and unless the distribution of such responsibilities and burdens is equitable and consonant with the possibilities of each Member.106.	Austria  for its part  is prepared to assume its share of responsibility and  as in the past  to contribute to fulfilling the tasks defined in the Charter."
"7",428,"BDI",29,1974,"The pride and military superiority of some nations have led them not only to the conquest and domination of others  but also to the shameful exploitation of apparently defenseless people. But  in a resurgence of dignity and with a thirst for justice for all time  the peoples of the world  whatever their degree of development or their color  have said no to the colonial yoke  and to injustice in all its forms.157.	From its very beginnings  mankind has known deadly wars because of men who place their selfish interests above those of the international community and who invent systems or regimes intended to perpetuate injustice in the world. Against those anachronistic regimes  people who love peace  justice and freedom must wage a relentless war so that man will be reconciled with man and all the peoples of the world be free and finally emerge from the nightmare of war  so as to devote themselves to the task of building a new society based on freedom and justice  in a world rid of colonialism and imperialism  the ill deeds of which weigh on international relations throughout the world.158.	In Africa  a large part of that continent  full of vitality and hope  is still plunged in a sombre reign of violence and exploitation of millions of human beings who are persecuted solely because of the color of their skin. Under our eyes  and with our complicity or our complacence  the most elementary rights are trampled under foot by an illegitimate regime based on racism  apartheid and colonialism. 159.	Not far from Africa  and with the blessing of certain Powers  signatories of the Charter of the United Nations  which declare themselves to be the defenders of freedom and dignity in the world  an entire peaceful people has been expelled from its homeland and lives without shelter. The Palestinian people  ever since the artificial creation of the State of Israel  has been living a tragedy which does not seem to prick the conscience of mankind at all. Some people even deny them the right to come out in the open and to appeal to international solidarity. Yet oil causes a great deal of ink to flow and  it seems  deprives some of the great men of this world of some hours of sleep. The Middle East  the Mediterranean and Indochina are still the scenes of wars created by the antagonisms of world hegemonies  which are responsible for much human suffering.160.	The military arsenals of the great Powers are competing in the stockpiling of weapons  while the States of the third world live in the fear of war; while they suffer shameful economic exploitation or live in the devastation caused by natural calamities  other countries toss into the sea the surpluses of their opulence.161.	The political and economic situation of the present world presents a spectrum which reflects broad and profound changes  the rays of which give rise to concerns but also to horizons of hope.162.	Despite the complexity of contemporary history  man intends to guide his course towards the total liberation of peoples which are called upon to act in concert in this era of interdependence. It is for this purpose that every year heads of State and Government  ministers  those responsible for administration  scientists  men of letters as well as other eminent personalities travel long distances and personally come to this most distinguished rostrum to denounce the current injustices in the world and to propose remedies to the present situation which bears the seeds of destruction but which also offers hope and survival because of certain victories at which we must rejoice.163.	The General Assembly  at.its twenty-ninth session  is called upon to deal with these various problems which I have mentioned above all  decolonization  the war in the Middle East and in Indochina  the economic crisis of which our States are all victims and  finally  the need for international co-operation to remedy present problems.164.	The international community is at an important turning-point not only because of the breadth and number of the issues to be dealt with but also because of the revolutionary determination of the peoples  who are prepared to fight and even to shed their blood to attain their independence and achieve their happiness by developing their own riches. To attain these objectives  the peoples represented in this forum needed a statesman who represented these ideals and who could guide and lead our work successfully. Aware of its responsibilities  the Assembly  at its present session  chose for its President a person who  because he is an undoubted international figure  has become the candidate of us all. The unanimous election of Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria for more than 10 years  is of the highest significance. It represents a tribute paid to the enlightened policy of Mr. Houari Boumediene  President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria and current President of the non-aligned countries. This happy choice is a victory for Africa and for the Arab world  for the non-aligned movement and for all the countries which love peace  justice and freedom: It is an endorsement by the international community of the brilliant qualities and the great competence which have always distinguished Algerian statesmen  and of their great experience  superior intelligence and diplomatic skill in the conduct of international affairs. By the wise choice of this great personality  we have not only reflected the importance of the problems before this session  but we also wished to hail the highly positive record of the Organization  which has benefited from valuable co-operation from Algeria.165.	Allow me  therefore  to acknowledge the successes achieved by the Organization due to the fore- sightedness and contribution of our Algerian brothers and the enlightened direction of its leaders.166.	My country has inscribed in the annals of the history of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries the important decisions of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers in 1973 8 which gave the non- aligned countries an economic and social charter which is at the basis of the declaration and the establishment of a new international economic order adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly  on the problems of raw materials and development.167.	The fact that the international community has become aware mangers for mankind of Israel's policy of aggression and annexation is  in our view  another important event in international relations.168.	It was with great satisfaction too that the Re-public of Burundi welcomed the victories of the peoples of Indochina  to which the non-aligned countries give unshakable support against imperialist aggression and occupation.169.	How can we fail to mention the success just won by the people ^f Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  Angola and even of Portugal against the Fascist  retrograde and colonialist regimes of Salazar and Caetano?170.	It is for all these reasons that in Burundi we consider Algeria not only a country which welcomes revolutionary ideas and men but also a symbol of the irreversible and final liberation of countries that wish to rid themselves of retrograde  Fascist  colonialist and imperialist systems. This is the sense which  Mr. President  we endeavored to reflect in a previous message when we expressed our optimism concerning the success of the present session  as well as our unflagging support for your initiatives  and which the delegation of the Republic of Burundi has received instructions to bring to you  on behalf of Lieutenant- General Michel Micombero  the Secretary-General of the UPRONA Party  Head of State and Government and liberator of the people of Burundi  who  with his colleague and friend  President Houari Boumediene  has consolidated friendship and solidarity between Algeria and Burundi.171.	After such an eventful year  I shall acquit myself of a very pleasant duty by expressing my appreciation to the outgoing President  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who guided the debates of the sixth special session with remarkable skill and whose activities were crowned with success.172.	I also have the privilege of paying tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his eminent qualities of a great statesman with a heart sensitive to human distress. On behalf of the President of the Republic and his Government  I wish to express to the Secretary-General our admiration for his great competence  his diplomatic skill and his devotion  his deep sense of international responsibility and his unshakable faith in a better world where justice and not force will prevail. Africa will always be grateful for the efforts he unceasingly deploys to free the continent from the scourges which still plague it in southern Africa. We should also like to express our warm congratulations to him on the positive results of the Organization  whose prestige grows because of the personal action of the Secretary- General.173.	On 17 September 1974  the United Nations family welcomed the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  whose admission we welcome as an important event in the Organization  in its progress in the emancipation of peoples and in the consecration  of its universality.174.	The Republic of Burundi most warmly congratulates the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Grenada and hopes that they will consolidate their independence in peace and friendship with the other States of the regions and will be prepared to co-operate. We declare ourselves ready to co-operate with these new States.175.	At present we wish to pay a particular tribute to the people of Guinea-Bissau  which  under the guidance of the great revolutionary party  the PAIGC  has  in the most striking and glorious manner  consolidated its past victories over colonialism. Burundi expresses its brotherly and most cordial congratulations to this avant-garde people  who  because of the revolutionary spirit instilled in them by the eternal hero  Amflcar Cabral  father of the free and independent country of Guinea-Bissau  accomplished a gigantic task which evoked the admiration of the enemy.176.	The first anniversary of the sovereignty of Guinea-Bissau  which we celebrated this year  was welcomed in my country as a reaffirmation of the principle whereby the revolutionary determination of a people does away with sterile negotiation so as to conquer by defiance that which was refused by selfishness and scorn.177.	I bow before the flag of Guinea-Bissau  which has been raised at the United Nations and which represents the glory of the freedom fighters of Guinea- Bissau. It flies to the honor of the Guinean people and arouses the warranted hopes of the other fighters in Mozambique  Angola  the Cape Verde Islands and southern Africa. We hope that the Government of this new State will find understanding and generosity in the international community so as to benefit from substantial aid and rapidly to rebuild that country  which was devastated by the war imposed upon it by colonialism. Thus  it will be able to consolidate its political independence and devote itself to the pro-gramme of economic liberation  together with the other revolutionary peoples of the world.178.	In Mozambique  we welcome the victories of the Mozambican people  under the leadership of FRELIMO  after centuries of implacable struggle against abject colonialism which caused so much innocent blood to flow. We also congratulate the FRELIMO leaders  who succeeded  to the astonishment of the world  in preserving the unity of their people in the revolutionary action which has just been crowned with success by the signing of the agreements of Lusaka between FRELIMO and the Portuguese Government. We emphasize the clear sightedness and political maturity of the FRELIMO leaders and of the new leaders of Portugal  who have succeeded in doing away with the barriers to the application of the Lusaka agreements. However  we wish to share with our brothers in Mozambique the experience of the Burundi people  which for years fought to safeguard its independence and the achievements of its great November revolution. Imperialism and colonialism are always hatching plots against revolutionary regimes and peoples  because they never admit defeat. That is what peoples must always be vigilant. We also hope ""that no Power will obstruct the rapid accession to independence of that country  which is called upon to play an important role within the concert of nations  particularly on the African continent.179.	We are pleased with the assurances given by the Portuguese Government. The new Portuguese regime has given rise to hope that the people of Portugal are finally moving towards co-operation with the other peoples of the world  since it has committed itself totally and radically to do away with Fascist and colonialist regimes which have dominated the political life of that nation for centuries and alienated from it the friendship of the peoples of the world that love peace and democracy.180.	The people of Burundi assures the people of Portugal of its friendship  and the Government of the Republic of Burundi promises its full co-operation with the Government of Portugal as soon as the latter has proceeded to the transfer of the attributes of its sovereignty to Mozambique and Angola without any malice intended to undermine internal unity or promote civil war after the granting of independence.181.	In Angola  we welcome the victories won by that great people  which will reconquer its freedom as soon as possible so as to become the master of its destiny. The existence of several liberation movements in that country cannot in any way justify the creation of obstacles that would bar the way to the total liberation of Angola  which is committed to an irreversible process of liberation. Trusting in the wisdom of its leaders  the people of Angola will achieve its unity  which will enable it to continue its triumphal march towards the final victory of total independence for which so many sons and daughters of Angola fell on the battlefield of honor.182.	The international community must warn the multinational corporations which are greedy for the immense riches of that country and would not hesitate to think of the formula of Balkanization. All the peoples of the world who love peace and justice must destroy that Machiavellian plan  which is a genuine conspiracy against the unity of the Angolan people and the territorial integrity of that vast country.183.	We hope that Portugal  consistent with the commitments solemnly formulated from this very rostrum  will assume its responsibilities to eliminate such maneuvers and transfer as soon as possible the attributes of sovereignty to all the territories still under its colonial domination.184.	While it is regrettable to have to recognize that incomplete decolonization leaves in the world strangle-holds on freedom  it is still more painful to note that in southern Africa millions of human beings are maintained in the chains of slavery; the peoples of Azania  Namibia and Zimbabwe suffer treatment that is wounding to the dignity of man  and the most elementary rights are trampled underfoot  because in that region those who are called colored people are victims of the most barbaric crimes.185.	South African racism is not directed only against black Africans. It does not spare any category. Coloreds  Indians and other Asians are equally victims of racial discrimination. This means that it is a problem which concerns all mankind and not only the African continent. This scourge of apartheid  the philosophy which feeds the ideologies of Pretoria and Salisbury  is the shame of our century.186.	In order to bring Pretoria to reason  international authorities have used persuasion  dialog any other diplomatic procedures. These approaches should have led South Africa to reconsider  but it paid no attention  encouraged as it is in its criminal obstinacy by certain Western Powers which not only maintain economic  trade and diplomatic relations with the Pretoria regime but also support its war industries by means of massive investments.187.	States Members of the United Nations which condemn the apartheid regime should practice a consistent policy and refrain from any direct or indirect support of the Pretoria regime. The Republic of Burundi  for its part  is pleased to say that it has no commercial  economic or diplomatic relations with Pretoria or Salisbury. Although it is land-locked  Burundi refused to sigh the air agreements which could have permitted aircraft to fly over our country en route to or from South Africa and Rhodesia. All merchandise produced in those countries is prohibited from Burundi territory. This policy may lead to sacrifice in many respects  but it is in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and the OAU which condemn the regimes of racism and apartheid.188.	If Burundi unreservedly applies the relevant provisions of resolutions in regard to southern Africa  a fortiori the great industrial Powers  and particularly the permanent members of the Security Council  should take appropriate measures to put an end to these anachronistic regimes which  unfortunately  spread to other regions of southern Africa and  in particular  to Namibia  which should be directly under the authority of the United Nations after the revocation of the Mandate of South Africa  which has been  guilty of the crimes of apartheid perpetrated in that territory. We condemn the policy of bantustanization practiced by South Africa in Namibia  intended to dislocate the Namibian nation.189.	If South Africa practices a policy contrary to the principles of the United Nations  then why have a dialog with Pretoria or even maintain its status as a Member of the United Nations? It is high time we learned the lesson of the permanent violation by South Africa of the Charter of the United Nations and pronounced its expulsion from the Organization. Burundi is gratified at the General Assembly's decision not to allow the representatives of Vorster to speak  and hopes that that decision will be endorsed by other United Nations bodies  especially the Security Council.190.	If it is difficult to understand the behavior and final aim of the Salisbury regime  it is no easier to understand the attitude of the United Kingdom towards the rebellion of one of its colonies. London is no longer disturbed about the Salisbury regime; indeed  it sympathizes with that regime  despite the fact that it still has the task of leading the people of Zimbabwe to self- determination and independence.191.	The United Kingdom has not hesitated to put down rebellions when faced with similar situations in the past. In the case of Rhodesia  London's attitude can be interpreted only as complicity  which the people of Zimbabwe cannot tolerate any longer  for they are aware of their strength  which is being asserted more and more alongside that of the other revolutionary peoples of the world.192.	Salisbury and Pretoria should  while there is still time  review their policy and follow the example of Lisbon  which has just renounced its political and economic exploitation of African States and has become their privileged friend.193.	On this same subject of decolonization  we hope that Spain will grant independence to so-called Spanish Sahara.194.	We welcome the agreement between Morocco and Mauritania to request an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice. That will enable all the parties concerned to reach agreement  before the granting of independence  on the future juridical status of the Sahara.195.	In another region of the world  there is a tragic situation in the Middle East. The Zionist State of Israel has gone so far as to annex by force territories belonging to the Arab States of Palestine  Egypt  Syria and Jordan. That Zionist policy of annexation has deprived the Palestinian people of all its territory.196.	It is inadmissible in our times that a State should annex by force of arms the territory of another in-dependent State  and thus remove that State from the international political scene. If there is one monstrous injustice in the world that the Organization cannot accept  it is the case of Palestine  for an entire people has been deprived of its home and thereby condemned to a condition of despair.197.	The most recent war  that of October 1973  while it had the advantage of destroying the myth of Israel's invincibility  did not however lead the Zionist State to seize the opportunity for negotiations to put an end to the Israeli-Arab conflict. If the Palestinian people and the other Arab States of Egypt  Syria and Jordan cannot recover their territory usurped by Zionist imperialism  there is a real danger that a new war  even more deadly than the preceding ones  will break out.198.	My delegation ventures to remind the Assembly that any solution of the Middle East problem that does not call for the restoration to the Palestinian people of its legitimate right to regain its homeland  with all the powers of sovereignty  is doomed to a total impasse.199.	My delegation is gratified at the inclusion in this session's agenda of the question of Palestine [item 108]  to be discussed separately; that will allow us to examine the problem in more depth. In order to be able to discuss the Palestine question with a full awareness of the facts  the Assembly should invite the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  the sole legitimate and unchallenged representative of the Palestinian people. Indeed  it would be a paradox to try to settle the problem of the Palestinian people without having heard the party mainly concerned.200.	If the present chances for a settlement of the Middle East crisis fade  Israel will have to bear the responsibility.201.	The delegation of the Republic of Burundi wishes at this stage to express once again its unflagging support of its brother Arab States  and especially of the Palestinian people  which can count on us for fraternal and militant solidarity. My delegation proposes that the United Nations should take appropriate measures to compel Israel to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions  and to impose sanctions against the Zionist State if it refuses to do so.202.	The States Members of the United Nations should  individually or collectively  take concrete measures to make Israel respect the territorial integrity of the Arab States of the region  the freedom and self-determination of the Palestinian people  the Holy Places of Jerusalem  the Charter of the United Nations and the Organization's decisions. If the State of Israel does not yield to those imperative necessities  peace and security will remain seriously threatened and the present climate propitious to the search for a settlement of the conflict will  regrettably  be dissipated.203.	As I said earlier in this statement in reference to disarmament  the world is going through a period of great upheaval resulting from the wars of national liberation  particularly in IndoChina. Viet Nam and Cambodia are at present the most acute anti-imperialist fronts.204.	With regard to Viet Nam  my delegation would first wish to express its warm congratulations to the heroic people of Viet Nam on the striking victory which it has won and continues to win against imperialism and its puppets. The victories of that great people have proved to the world  and above all to imperialism itself  that a committed and determined people is invincible. We ask the international community to use its prestige and its influence to ensure that finally  after almost half a century  the people of Viet Nam may regain its lost peace and bind up the deep wounds left by the various wars imposed on it by imperialism.205.	My delegation urgently appeals to the signatory parties of the Agreement on ending the war and re-storing peace in Viet Nam  signed in Paris on 27 January 1973  to respect all its provisions scrupulously. We demand that all foreign troops still stationed in Viet Nam  under whatever label  be withdrawn without delay  in conformity with the Paris Agreement. We condemn the Saigon administration  which obstinately continues its encroachment operations  in violation of the Paris Agreement.206.	Since the Paris Agreement recognizes three administrations in Viet Nam and since the United Nations has admitted the Saigon Administration as an observer  my delegation demands the admission of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam as an observer  particularly since that Government is the valid representative of the South Vietnamese people.207.	There is another anti-imperialist front in the Indochinese region: Cambodia. Following the plot hatched against Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  the people of Cambodia  weapons in hand  began an all-out war for the national liberation of Cambodia  and in four years they have liberated almost the entire country. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  led by the the head of State  Norodom Sihanouk  has been recognized by more than 60 countries and continues to enjoy the support and assistance of all the peoples of the workhwho love peace and freedom. Last year  the Head of State of Cambodia  Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  received a warm and enthusiastic welcome at Algiers from the non-aligned family. Recently  the Deputy Prime Minister  Khieu Samphan  visited several countries in Asia  Africa and Europe  and had great success everywhere.208.	The Lon Nol clique has dared in recent days to put forward some fallacious proposals for ""peace negotiations"". Those maneuvers fool no one; indeed  they only confirm the precarious position of that puppet regime  which in no way represents the Cambodian people any longer.209.	Consistent with its policy  the Government of the Republic of Burundi once again states its support for the restoration to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia of its legitimate seat in the United Nations  and hence for the expulsion of the Lon Nol representatives.210.	There is another problem on the same continent which should be of concern to the Organization and on which we should take a decision.211.	At its last session  the General Assembly took a very important decision to dissolve UNCURK. At the same time  it confirmed the will of the United Nations to see Korea reunified peacefully and without outside interference.212.	My delegation believes that we must continue to go forward in the search for peace in the Korean peninsula. The two parties have begun a dialog  and the only obstacle to constructive results remains the stationing of United Nations troops in the southern part of the country. My delegation demands the total  immediate and final withdrawal of all the troops stationed in Korea under the United Nations flag. The Government of the Republic of Burundi regards that withdrawal as an indispensable prerequisite to the reunification of Korea and  in our opinion  any attempt to admit the two parties to the United Nations separately is a plot to prevent the peaceful and independent reunification of Korea.213.	We have referred to the violence which prevails throughout the world  and particularly in the countries of the third world. We believe that the Organization should not only take note of all its manifestations  but also draw up a plan of peace for the world which would go to the roots of the evil.214.	The great Powers of the world should first of all renounce their policy of domination and hegemony  which is at the basis of the incessant arms race  whose aim is to eliminate the weaker States. It is no mere chance that all the conflicts and hotbeds of tension are located not within the spheres of the super-Powers or of the industrialized countries  but in the developing countries. It therefore appears clear that the true victims of the arms race are indeed the countries of the third world hence their interest in total and complete disarmament  because they would become the main theater of operations should another world conflict occur.215.	The present approach of entrusting the question of disarmament only to the nuclear Powers  more accurately to the two super-Powers  must be rejected  because this question interests all mankind and must be dealt with by all countries  whatever their geographical size or whatever their power hence the need to hold the World Disarmament Conference  the content and definition of which must be clear to all.216.	In fact  a certain confusion has been created by the two super-Powers. They intend  above all  to achieve a limitation of strategic nuclear weapons and a ban on the proliferation of atomic weapons. As we see it  this partial disarmament means maintaining the status quo while adopting minor arrangements among the super-Powers and continuing the arms race at a uniformly accelerated speed. The international community is being asked to confirm the monopoly of nuclear weapons held by the two super-Powers. Without questioning the good faith of statements made on the subject  we are nevertheless compelled to note with bitterness that at the very time when one hand offers us treaties banning the proliferation of atomic weapons  another hand is offering plutonium and factories for the separation of isotopes to Israel and to South Africa  although those countries are known for their policies of aggression and of violation of the Charter of the United Nations.217.	How can this be taken seriously? My delegation considers that the objective of disarmament is the total destruction of nuclear weapons. All nuclear Powers should first of all solemnly undertake never to use that nuclear arsenal against any non-nuclear country  to respect the denuclearized zones  and never to use those arms to commit aggression against other countries. In the next phase  the two super-Powers should carry out effective and controlled disarmament  because they are not threatened by the other Powers. At a third stage  disarmament should be generalized and complete and all countries should be called upon to join this process of disarmament and reduction of military budgets  which would preclude any further nuclear tests.218.	The Government of the Republic of Burundi is also in favour of dismantling all military bases on the soil of third-world countries  because they constitute a permanent threat to the stability and security of the States of the region.219.	Finally  the Government of Burundi is against the hegemony of the great Powers  whose military navies travel the seas and oceans  thus constituting a permanent threat to the coastal States and seriously hampering world peace and international co-operation.220.	According to the experts  the world spends $250 000 million on the arms race  a sum which is larger than all the national incomes of the developing countries of Asia and Africa. This vast sum could relieve multitudes of poverty-stricken human beings if it were devoted-to development purposes.221.	Since the last session of the Assembly  we have witnessed events of considerable importance and scope in international economic relations. All petroleum- exporting countries have adopted historic decisions and initiatives intended to ensure a rapid development for their respective economies and a constant improvement in the standard of living and well-being of their peoples  by a revision of their policy on the exporting and exploitation of their natural resources. The prices of certain other raw materials have also risen substantially. In the main developed capitalist countries  inflation and monetary erosion have become more acute  and there is no reason to expect an improvement in the situation unless leaders in those countries decide to take energetic measures to remedy the functioning of the mechanism of their respective economic systems.222.	This situation has gravely affected many countries of the world which have not yet started producing their own raw materials and whose means are scant because their economic development is slow. Thus  the overwhelming majority of the world's inhabitants view the future with a largely justified concern. It is the duty of the entire international community diligently to meet its responsibilities by seeking the most favorable  effective and just solutions to the grave problems of our time. Otherwise  peace  entente and concord among the peoples and nations which we represent here will be seriously jeopardized.223.	If we wish to establish  once and for all  balanced and harmonious international economic relations among all the partners  if we wish to solve the present economic crisis  we must first and foremost seek to identify its origins and roots. To that end  courage and clear thinking will be needed. There must be a real spirit of dialog and tolerance. Above all  the rich countries must rid themselves of their complex of power and superiority and take up the discussion in a spirit of equality.224.	The sixth special session  which was convened on the happy initiative of Mr. Houari Boumediene  President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  to whom we renew the expressions of our deep gratitude  was in fact intended  as we all know  to arrive at solutions acceptable to all and capable of overcoming the threatened breakdown of our respective economies. Today we find that  despite the goodwill and the spirit of concession Of the developing countries at that session  we have not yet reached the end of our sufferings.225.	The cold  if not hostile  welcome among the developed countries to the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New Inter-national Economic Order augurs no good for the future.226.	Worse than that  certain rich countries  having failed to impose their views and solutions on the rest of the world  are now trying to find scapegoats for their problems  to reject their own responsibilities in the present crisis by laying them at the door of the countries that are producers of raw materials  to provoke and encourage the breakup of the ""front"" of developing countries. They even threaten to restore by force the old economic order which was characterized by the exploitation  pillage and shameless waste of the natural resources of the poor countries.Such conduct is fraught with dangers for international peace and security.227.	My country believes that the industrialized countries  with the so-called market economies  should accept a major part of the responsibility for the present economic disorders. The editorial writer of a major newspaper recently wrote that if the present economic situation was out of control it was in the first place because the Western countries had long refused to control their currencies.228.	Contrary to what some would make us believe  everyone knows that inflation appeared in the developed countries in the second half of the 1960s. It therefore did not follow the rise in the prices of raw materials; it provoked it. As for the impact of the prices of raw materials on the acceleration in the rate of inflation in developed countries  I should like to recall that  according to a study undertaken in November 1973 by experts of a large Western Power  the doubling of the prices of all primary products could not at that time give rise to more than 4 per cent of the inflation. Since then  the prices of only an insignificant number of primary products have risen considerably. Under the circumstances  how can inflation rates of 15 per cent and more in the main industrialized countries be justified?229.	It is true that the quadrupling of the price of oil and its derivatives in the space of three months did create serious problems of adaptation for each of our economies  particularly the most fragile. It is also true that we are where we are because the developed countries have always received with indifference and con-tempt the many appeals addressed to them by the countries of the third world within the framework of UNCTAD and in this Assembly to improve the terms of trade of the poorer countries.230.	The cause of the generalized inflation from which we are suffering is to be sought in the very functioning of the economies of the developed countries. The world will never know a sound international economy as long as the rich 'countries refuse to face their responsibilities. The economic system whose merits and performance they have too often boasted of has been able to survive and prosper only because of the pitiless exploitation of the weakest by the rich and the unmitigated pillage of the wealth of the third world. It must be reviewed and adjusted to the needs  ideals and requirements of our times.231.	Although Burundi has seriously suffered from recent developments in the field of international economic relations  my country fully recognizes that the oil-producing countries were quite right to revalue their resources  and we support their struggle to improve the purchasing power of the products they export. Let us denounce maneuvers of blackmail  intimidation and threats directed against them by certain-of the wealthy countries. Through the countries members of OPEC  those threats are addressed also to other commodity-producing countries which might be tempted to follow a rational policy for the development of their resources in accordance with the general well-being and legitimate interest^ of the peoples for whom they are responsible  232.	Having said that  there is no doubt that a certain number of the countries of the third world need a great demonstration of solidarity from the international community to guarantee for their peoples a standard of living that accords with the requirements of human dignity. In that regard  my country notes with satisfaction that certain oil-exporting countries have shown a great deal of understanding and a spirit of generosity in regard to the countries most gravely affected by the latest economic events. We hope the developed countries will soon reflect in concrete gestures the present attitude of compassion in regard to the disinherited peoples of the planet. However  the conditions some developed countries have placed upon contributions to the Special Fund established by resolution 3202 (S-VI) lead us seriously to doubt their good faith and sincerity. The show of solidarity of which I have spoken must be spontaneous. It must not be bargained  nor can it depend on the attitude of a group of third countries  when the need and urgency are recognized by all because of the conditions of despair under which millions of human beings live.233.	To conclude this economic chapter  I should like to make one point clear. Rumors have been spread according to which the African States have severed diplomatic relations with Israel to ensure their supply of oil. It was further alleged that this was the only reason for their support of the Arab States. My delegation protests against such calumny  intended to break Arab-African solidarity.234.	Though it is among the States whose economies have been most affected by the rise in the price of oil  the Republic of Burundi wishes to make it clear that we severed diplomatic and other relations with Israel for no such reason. Militant and brotherly solidarity with the Arab peoples was decided upon by the Government of Burundi quite independently and in all sovereignty  without any bargaining. Burundi therefore considers that those divisive maneuvers are devoid of any logic and should be ended so as not to lend substance to the slanderous attempts at blackmail to sow discord between the African countries and our Arab brothers.235.	Since the Organization came into being  eminent statesmen and distinguished diplomats have come to this rostrum to proclaim their faith in the ideals of peace  freedom and progress. The brilliant wars of national liberation against colonialism and for independence that have been waged almost everywhere throughout the world for nearly 30 years and continue in southern Africa  in the Middle East and in IndoChina demonstrate  should that still be necessary  that international peace will be precarious as long as a single people or a single nation is subject to domination  humiliation  exploitation and racism.236.	Today  because of the rapid development of mass communications media  the world has become smaller than ever  and each of its inhabitants is better informed on the conditions of life of his fellow men. International peace and security will always be threatened as long as millions of human beings suffer from hunger  malnutrition  disease and other scourges of mankind while a privileged minority wallows in abundance  waste and indifference.237.	All peoples aspire to live in dignity  freedom and pride. Every effort must be made  all energies and all resources must be mobilized so that all the peoples of the earth  and above all the most disinherited  may lead a decent life  so that they may simply live with the hope of a better future. To that end  international solidarity and co-operation  of which we have said so much  must be reflected in concrete action.238.	In that context  we urgently appeal to the developed countries to honor the commitments they entered into freely and solemnly vis-a-vis the developing countries within the framework of the Second United Nations Development Decade. We also invite them to withdraw the reservations they have expressed regarding the results of the sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and development.239.	International relations must become democratic through the taking up of problems in equality and mutual understanding. International relations must be based upon concerted action  dialog and a spirit of compromise  and no longer on force or diktat. While not losing sight of our own preoccupations and priorities  let us justly appreciate those of our partners. By acting thus  every country represented here will make a valuable contribution to the building of a more human world of greater solidarity and brotherhood in which we shall forever banish injustice  poverty  frustration and humiliation  to the greater glory and well-being of mankind."
"8",475,"BEL",29,1974,"Allow me to congratulate Mr. Bouteflika on the occasion of his election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His election to this high office is a tribute that is paid both to Africa and to the Arab world.2.	I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General on his excellent report on the work of the Organization [A/9601 and Add.I]  in which he very rightly emphasizes the concern  which we share  at seeing the present economic troubles and tensions jeopardizing the progress made in the sphere of international political relations.3.	As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France [2238th meeting] has done in his capacity as current President of the European Economic Community and on behalf of the nine States of which it is composed  I should like to welcome the admission to the United Nations  with the unanimous sponsorship of those nine States  of three gallant and peace- loving new countries. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau has just acceded to independence in complete accord and friendship with Portugal. I shall have the opportunity in the course of this address to refer once more to that event. As the result of a friendly negotiation with a Member State of the European Community  Grenada has joined us to add its voice   to those  each year more numerous and always heard with respect  of the Caribbean region. It was with deep emotion that I heard yesterday [2243rd meeting] the noble voice of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman  the Prime Minister of Bangladesh  raised in this forum. His presence here bears witness to the successful working out of a difficult problem. The spirit of moderation and conciliation shown in this matter by all the countries of the subcontinent a spirit that should set an example for all of us has been at the basis of this solution.4.	I cannot fail to mention here the grave catastrophes that have repeatedly befallen Bangladesh and many other developing countries  the most recent being that of Honduras  so severely stricken last Friday. My Government has done its utmost to be of assistance on every occasion  both by using its own means and by joining with our partners in the European Community. I can give my assurance here to the Governments of Bangladesh and Honduras that now too we will  to the extent of our means  help them to overcome the present crisis.5.	Owing to tragic circumstances  our general debate last year was dominated by the new outbreak of violence and human tragedy caused by the Middle East war. As in so many of our previous discussions  the political confrontation of the nations was once more by the force of circumstances at the very center of our anxieties. As a result  the disruptions of the world's economic organization did not appear to us as clearly as they do today.6.	Today each State wonders what its future and its development will be and what degree of security its nationals will be entitled to expect. We must work out the answers to these questions jointly. Indeed  only international co-operation will make it possible to overcome the tensions that  otherwise  would be aroused by the confrontation of national egoisms and the excesses of a competition based solely on the concept of profit.7.	We must realize that the energy crisis has altered the basic factors of the economic situation. The cost of the increased price of oil products is in the order of $100 000 million a year; we are far from having seen all its after-effects. The States of the European Community should react to this state of affairs by increasing their solidarity  strengthening their union and lessening their dependence on imported oil. Working together with other countries faced with the same problems  they should create the conditions for co-operation with the oil-producing countries. It is in everyone's interest to find an equitable solution; the consequences of inflation and monetary instability threaten all States in varying degrees.8.	We cannot bring ourselves to believe that the oil-producing countries still hesitate to join in the dialog that is proposed to them. How can a confrontation be prevented if all the parties are not willing to make co-operation the focus of their concern? The countries of the European Community are already facing serious difficulties and must agree to make sacrifices in order to solve their own problems. This severely handicaps their ability to come to the assistance of those who are even more severely tried. In spite of that  we once more confirm our basic options  even without waiting for the States that have suddenly acceded to an extraordinary level of wealth to take their legitimate share in the task of bringing about international solidarity.9.	In this respect  my country attaches the greatest importance to the Conference of Ministers which met in Kingston  Jamaica  on 25 and 26 July last  attended by the representatives of 44 countries of Africa  the Caribbean  the Pacific [ACP] and the European Community. The subject of the Conference was the search for a new type of relationship between industrialized and developing countries. That Conference made it possible to adopt a series of texts that will serve as guidelines for later work between the Community and the ACP countries.10.	We note in particular the positive results obtained by the establishment of a system of stabilization of the export revenues.from basic commodities exported by the ACP countries to the Community. What is being contemplated here is a system designed to mitigate the harmful effects of a decrease in prices or in the amounts of the major products exported. The practical implementation of the system will be negotiated between the ACP countries and the Community.11.	The Kingston Conference also recognized the crucial importance of industrial co-operation. The Community was in .agreement with the general guide-lines given in a memorandum submitted on the subject by the ACP States. As for the terms of trade  these will include  as an essential element  free access by the ACP countries to the Community market  the former not being bound to reciprocate. Also acknowledged  on the one hand  was the need to ensure the stability of these terms and  on the other hand  the lack of balance in the relationships between the developing countries and those of the Community. Finally  the Conference made remarkable progress as regards financial co-operation.12.	My Government is deeply gratified at the fact that there is a common determination that the work of the Conference should succeed. A vigorous political impetus has been given to the negotiations  which augurs well for their final outcome. But while we are particularly pleased to see more stable and better-balanced relations taking shape among the nine countries of the European Economic Community and their present or future associated partners of Africa  the Pacific and the Caribbean  we are deeply concerned about the fate of the countries most seriously affected by the crisis in international prices and  more particularly  by the increase in the price of oil. The General Assembly at its sixth special session entrusted the Secretary-General with the task of launching an emergency operation  for a limited period of 12 months  to provide relief to the countries most seriously affected by the economic crisis resulting* in particular  from the increase in the prices of energy products  designed to maintain unimpaired during that 12-month period the essential imports of the most seriously affected countries {resolution 3202 (S-VI)  para. X 2].13.	On 1 May 1974 the spokesman for the European Community stated that the Community was ready to contribute substantially to that special effort  on condition that the other members of the international community did so also. That proposal was confirmed on 25 June by the then President of the Community Council  Minister Genscher of the Federal Republic of Germany.14.	On the basis of global resources of $3 000 million  the Community is ready to make a special contribution of $500 million  provided that the other industrialized countries contribute two sixths of the total amount and the oil-exporting countries half. It is also obvious that an agreement has to be reached on the methods of allocating 'the emergency assistance and the criteria to be used in choosing the beneficiary countries.15.	On the basis of the results of the Ministerial Meeting of Potential Contributors to the United Nations Emergency Operation  to be convened on 27 September  in New York  the Community will very shortly make known its views on how it will participate in the emergency operation. As far as we are concerned  we sincerely hope in particular that that meeting will clearly show the breakdown of the contributors' commitments and how much multilateral assistance they intend to provide. We should also like to have a clear definition and comparison of the conditions in which the contributions will be made and  more specifically  how generous they will be.16.	Our main concern is that the oil-producing and industrialized countries should take action to come to the assistance of entire populations whose survival is at stake. But we are still faced by political problems.17.	It is only fair that Europe  which in the course of this century has so many times been the cause of senseless conflicts  should today set an example of stability. On the regional level  the progress of detente gives good grounds for hope that there will be true co-operation among the States of Europe. We have cast aside war and the threat of war; we hope that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe will result in concrete achievements likely to draw States and peoples closer together; and we hope that negotiations on the balanced and mutual reduction of armaments will enable all our peoples to enjoy the same kind of security  while lessening the oppressive burden of expenditures on armaments.18.	The Europe of the nine has a major contribution to make; Belgium is quite aware of that and for that very reason is looking forward to progress being made towards community integration; for  failing this  Europe will not be able to assume the responsibilities incumbent on it. More progress will have to be made before the end of this year. In many folds the nine European States already speak with r r? m- mon voice: they are getting ready  for instance  to initiate a dialogue with 20 members of the League of Arab States  and they have taken a stand on many of the problems that are on the agenda of this Assembly. I am therefore very pleased that the European Community  as a distinct entity  will soon receive the status of observer.19.	Belgium takes a stand on the problems with which we are faced after consulting with its European partners  for we can no longer dissociate our national identity from the European identity. In this context 1 would recall the Cyprus crisis  the Middle East conflict and the problems of decolonization.20.	The European position on Cyprus is well known. It is based on the territorial independence and integrity of the Republic. Two urgent problems  however  require our vigilant attention: the serious situation of the refugees  and the financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus.21.	My Government will continue  and is considering a substantial increase in  its payments for the maintenance of the. Force  to which I am pleased to pay a tribute for the services it has rendered in difficult circumstances. I also wish to pay a tribute to the memory of those who have given their lives so that peace may reign in that part of the world.22.	On the humanitarian level  we respond to the calls of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  and we will very shortly make larger contributions to assist the Cypriot people.23.	As to the Middle East  the negotiations have fortunately started again. The successive initiatives of United States Secretary of State Kissinger have already resulted in military disengagements which are the first step towards an easing of tension. I have no doubt that other steps in the same direction will follow shortly  and I hope they will bring about the conditions necessary to achieve a peace agreement based on the cessation of the occupation of territory  respect for the territorial sovereignty and integrity of each State and recognition of the legitimate rights of  the Palestinian people. The Belgian contribution to this peace undertaking is made on the European level and  as has been said by my German colleague  Mr. Genscher  the opening of a European-Arab dialog could lay the foundations for the vast task of reconstruction and development of the south-east Mediterranean [2239th meeting  para. 72].24.	Like all preceding speakers who have welcomed the admission to membership in this Organization of three new States among them Guinea-Bissau I share the hope that an irreversible step has been taken towards the disappearance of colonialism in Africa. In this respect I listened with attention to the statement made on 23 September by my colleague  Mr. Soares  on behalf of the ""new Portugal""  the birth of which  its present concerns and its ambitions for the future he movingly described for us.25.	Indeed  the attainment of independence by Guinea-Bissau demonstrated  above all  the fact that its people had a legitimate desire to find dignity in national independence. But  as Mr. Soares recalled  ""None of this ... . would be possible if the changes caused by the military and popular movement of 25 April had not occurred in Portugal."" [Ibid.  para. 105.] Since its installation in Lisbon  the new regime has received the full support of the Belgian Government. It was the return to the free interplay of democratic rules that enabled Portugal and Guinea- Bissau as well to free themselves.26.	At the present Stage  Belgium hopes that the speedy  orderly and peaceful decolonization process exemplified in the recent developments in Portugal and Guinea-Bissau will be carried out in theother Portuguese Territories of Africa  as envisaged in Security Council resolution 322 (1972). That hope is now a firm conviction because we heard Mr. Soares say on 23 September that:. . the rapid and reliable decolonization of the Territories under Portuguese administration  to be carried out in accord with the legitimate representatives of the will of the respective peoples and leading necessarily to independence.1' [Ibid.  para. 109. ]27.	In another connexion  it can be foreseen and hoped that the success of this methodical process of decolonization will come as a revelation to the rest of southern Africa and  in keeping with United Nations resolutions  will prompt Pretoria to put an end to the occupation of Namibia and encourage Salisbury to return to legality.28.	The success of African nationalism in the territories under Portuguese rule should be a serious warning to the regimes I have just mentioned. Especially in view of the results of the negotiations  both Pretoria and Salisbury could be led to reconsider their regimes from a more realistic point of view.29.	In this context  Belgium continues to be acutely concerned by the situation which prevails  particularly in Rhodesia and Namibia  where- there are no indications as yet of any improvement. In this connexion the policy of Belgium is perfectly clear. It consists in applying sanctions to Rhodesia  and as far as Namibia is concerned I would remind you that Belgium subscribed to the advisory opinion given by the International Court of Justice on 21 June 197 P and has taken a series of measures to implement the Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on the Namibia question.30.	We have just made significant progress in the field of decolonization: the Belgian Government sincerely hopes that the field of human rights will also be made part of this dynamic action.31.	We adhere firmly to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Belgium has always considered the United Nations  since its inception  as the surest if not the only guarantor of human rights. We have always expected the United Nations to set out and secure the observance of these rights  and we have always tried to make an active contribution in this respect.32.	Thus it is that Belgium is the only country which  in the matter of human rights  entrusts to a supranational organization powers that are within its sovereignty. It has indeed accepted since 1951 that on its territory the eligibility of refugees shall be decided not by Belgian officials but by the representative in Belgium of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Further  my country allows such refugees to obtain Belgian nationality after a stay of only three years.33.	Furthermore  Belgium is proud of having always been  since its independence  a haven for political refugees. Thus at the present time we grant refuge to nearly 30 000 political refugees while an average of 600 new refugees settle in our territory every year. 34.	I cannot fail to mention here the numerous stateless persons who come to us year after year seeking refuge and support. Often they are persons who have been deprived for too long of elementary * rights  and the international community has an obligation to them if it truly believes in the defense of human rights.35.	Finally  I should like to say that recently public opinion  like the Belgian Government  has been deeply disturbed by various reports showing the increase throughout the world of cases of torture and ill-treatment inflicted on persons who are held in detention. Such disregard of the human person is not only an outrage to all mankind but a degradation. That is why the Belgian delegation will firmly support all initiatives this Assembly may take in denouncing and proscribing such practices  which belong to another age. In this matter  too  no voice could carry further than the voice of the United Nations. That voice must be heard."
"9",521,"BEN",29,1974,"Mr. President  after listening to all the tributes addressed to your country  as well as to your own person  it would be tempting to refuse to follow the tradition for fear that  if I did  I might find myself uttering commonplaces and cliches. This temptation is all the more pressing since Dahomey considers that your election to preside over this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly is as if we ourselves had been elected  not only because your election is the election of Africa as a whole  but also because of the ties of deep friendship which bind our two peoples together.96.	In so doing it would be difficult for me  however  to fail to discharge the pleasant duty of saying to this brilliant audience how highly appreciative the Revolutionary Military Government of Dahomey is for the wise choice which resulted in your distinguished person being elected to preside over the Assembly and which  beyond question  will be an omen for the successful conduct of the work of this twenty-ninth regular session of the General Assembly.97.	Indeed  your lengthy experience in the workings of the United Nations  which you have more than once sparked with your dynamic participation  the authority and mastery which you have gained throughout your lengthy and brilliant career in the service of the Algerian diplomatic corps  your many and valuable contributions to the cause of the non-aligned countries and that of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  are just so many major trump cards which will not fail to bring their full influence to bear in the discharge of our tasks  above all at a time when the United Nations has entered upon a new historic phase of its existence.98.	And since at the present time we are living through a new era of decolonization  how could I fail to touch on the lengthy and difficult process of decolonization in Algeria  which was the result of a glorious revolution of which you are a member of the youngest and most dynamic cadre. The Algerian revolution did not only overthrow an entire system of domination and exploitation in northern Africa. It did more than that: thanks to that revolution it became possible to ensure self-determination and independence for most of our French-speaking countries. Since that time you have been engaged  side by side with your great leader President Houari Boumediene  with rare success in promoting in Algeria a foreign policy worthy of liberated Africa  divested of all forms of subordination between the parties.99.	Thus  in adding my voice to those very eloquent tones of representatives who have preceded me at the rostrum  I should like above all to welcome in you the worthy son of militant Africa  that Africa which  expunging the record of the severity with which determined colonization tried to smother legitimate aspirations  was able to show  once its objectives had been attained  that it knows how to forget and to pardon. This is our guarantee that throughout the entire session we will be guided by a man of high quality  dedicated to just causes and legitimate aspirations of the peoples which we represent here.100.	Last year  from this same rostrum  I welcomed our incoming President  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  a descendant of that Latin America which has beennourished on the patriotic traditions of Bolivar. The way in which the business of the twenty-eighth session was conducted under his high authority  his courtesy and his knowledge of the practices of the United Nations are evidence that I was not mistaken in my appraisal. Quiring the sixth special session  over which he also presided  Mr. Benites gave us lessons in courage and deyotion which proved—if proof were necessary—-how much he cherishes international peace and security .101.	Dahomey has followed with special interest the activities of our Secretary-General in the course of this year. The dynamism  the patience and the perseverance that he has displayed in confronting the difficult and very delicate problems that have been entrusted to him deserve our praise and make him an exemplary international civil servant  wholly devoted to international peace and security. To be convinced of this-one need only follow his accomplishments and actions throughout the year. There is everything to show that nothing can daunt this ardent defender of the cause of the Organization when it is a matter of bringing about the triumph of the purposes and principles contained in the Charter.102.	My country rejoices in the fact that we had the pleasure of receiving Mr. Waldheim last March in the course of his brief trip to western Africa  a trip which enabled him to observe for himself  on the spot  the damage caused by the natural disaster of drought. I personally  on the occasion of his sojourn in Dahomey  had an opportunity to witness the interest that he shows in African problems and his desire - which is markedly increasing -to act in such a way as to ensure that resolutions of the Organization on decolonization  racism  apartheid and racial discrimination are implemented in their entirety. For all of this  he deserves the congratulations and encouragement of the international community.103.	Mr. President  in your introductory statement [2233rd meeting] you very ably sketched the international problems confronting the Organization in the past and today  so there is no need for me to dwell on this. However  you will readily appreciate that the delegation which I am leading at this twenty-ninth session attaches special importance to certain items of capital importance to Africa in particular and for the countries of the Third World in general. These questions deal with the situation of the countries engaged in a struggle for their liberation from domination and foreign exploitation  problems of racism and apartheid  conflicts throughout the world and  of course  problems concerning development in the context of the new world economic order.104.	For several months now Africa has been the scene of one of the most striking events in its history: the beginning of the liquidation of the last bastions of colonialism. You are in a good position to realize this  Mr. President  because after secret negotiations carried out in London  the Partido Africano da Inde-pendencia da Guine e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) reached an agreement with its adversary that your country should be witness of the act whereby Portugal  finally awakened from its chimerical dreams  transferred powers it had usurped for more than 10 years  and more' particularly since last year  to Guinea-Bissau.105.	It will be recalled that on 24 September last  when the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly had barely begun its work  news reached us of the proclamation of the independence of the State of Guinea-Bissau. That historic act of an African people was welcomed by us with joy  because our sister State had finally won by struggle  with weapons in hand  and regained its dignity and international sovereignty. The valiant fighters of that sister State  by liberating at the price of unheard-of sacrifices almost all of its territory  by proclaiming the independence of Guinea-Bissau  thus took up the challenge which had been flung at fighting Africa and the peace-loving and justice-loving people of the whole world by the Fascist and anachronistic regime of Caetano and company. In doing so they had proved to the world that the course of history is irreversible and that just causes always triumph in the end  regardless of the obstacles placed in their path.106.	The striking and brilliant victory of progressive forces in Portugal a little later and the toppling of the Caetano clique in shame confirm our appraisal of this historic truth. But  one year ago  despite our legitimate and genuine joy  despite the striking manifestations of solidarity of peoples throughout the world who love peace and justice  our peoples in Africa were perplexed and pained at the hesitations and the shilly shallying of certain important Members of the Organization which still hesitated to look the truth in the face. Thank Heavens  we are able to recognize now that the wheel of history has turned more quickly than all the sordid calculations and highly selfish interests of those who had become accustomed to remaining insensitive to the sufferings and tribulations of oppressed peoples. That country which yesterday was refused de jure recognition is today sitting among us as a fully fledged member of the international community. Thus  it is with deep emotion that  on behalf of the Revolutionary Military Government and the people of Dahomey  I hail the representatives of this sister State which has suffered so much to gain its freedom.107.	Since I have been given the opportunity  I should also like to welcome the sister republics of Grenada and Bangladesh  which have just joined the great family of the United Nations. Their arrival in our midst is clear evidence that  despite all obstacles  the Organization is proceeding irresistibly towards universality ; To each of these sister countries  I should like to assure the friendship and co-operation of Dahomey.108.	Turning again to the African countries which are in the process of regaining their freedom  my delegation agrees that the task of our Assembly has been facilitated by the victory of the progressive forces in Portugal itself. The statement made by General Spinola on 27 July last  making public for the first time the firm determination of his Government to grant independence to its former Portuguese colonies  and the statements of Mr. Mario Soares  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the new Portugal  from this same rostrum [2239th meeting]  constitute commitments which my Government takes at their face value.109.	Yes  the Revolutionary Military Government of Dahomey notes with sympathy the courageous choice taken by the new regime in Portugal henceforth to take the place which is rightfully theirs in the Organization and we encourage that Government to continue along those lines. But my delegation is in duty bounded say that it will not go further for the time being  and Africa should still not lay down its weapons at this stage of the struggle  for if  generally speaking  the progressive world applauded the initiative of the new Portuguese authorities  one cannot help feeling some uncertainty as to the future of the colonies that are now promised their freedom.110.	.What is at stake is certainly complicated  and the imperialist and capitalist interests that are threatened are considerable. If in Portugal itself the progressive forces seem to have the upper hand for the moment  it is none the less true that the forces of evil in that country are still considerable and very active. Those who regret a past that is over and done with will not fail to cherish the illusion of new Portuguese Rhodesia. Certain great Powers will not wish to stand idly by while new nations emerge in strategic locations and endowed with a wealth of strategic resources. There is not the slightest shadow of a doubt that the racist minorities in South Africa and Rhodesia will not fail to take a negative view of the appearance of new black States on their doorsteps  and the active support they give the whites in Mozambique and Angola  who wish to sabotage the new policy of liberation embarked upon by Portugal  is in this connexion highly  significant.111.	That is why we in Dahomey think it is still too early to determine when the process of decolonization now being undertaken by the new Portuguese leaders will actually be completed. We cannot demobilize our troops yet; it is too early for us to cry victory while the threats hanging over our brothers are still so grave and their future still almost wholly uncertain. My country is grateful to the Portuguese authorities for their determination to liberate the colonized Territories  but we can do no more until Portugal has settled the political imbroglio and ended the suffering for which it is responsible in those countries. That is why we feel that now  more than ever before  the Organization should follow the development of the situation in southern Africa and hold itself in readiness to give material support to those countries  if their independence proves to be threatened.112.	I wish now to speak of the two cancers afflicting Africa  with which that whole continent  and the United Nations itself  must cope. I refer to Rhodesia and South Africa.113.	The first continues to defy the Organization - with  of course  the complicity of the administering Power  which  despite its Pontius Pilate -like reactions  nevertheless bears the (entire responsibility for the situation created in that country   where a white minority deliberately chose to rebel against  the British Crown  stifling the will of an overwhelming black majority. The Organization is today entitled to ask of the United Kingdom how long it means to go on perpetuating such a situation despite the conclusions of the Pearce Commission's report.7 Is it not time for the rebel minority regime to be brought to reason and for the administering Power to cease taking refuge behind fallacious pretexts?114.	The case of South Africa also deserves rather close at trillion. Since its creation  our Organization he. continuously been concerned with the situation in South Africa  where apartheid has been made into a political philosophy of government. Everyone knows the lot of black people there  who are not even recognized as human beings. This intolerable and inadmissible situation  created by a Member of the Organization  has been the subject of many resolutions which the Pretoria regime has constantly refused to implement. Thus South Africa has placed itself beyond the pale of the Organization  which now has no choice but to assume its responsibilities. What is more  since 1970  our Assembly has continuously rejected the credentials of representatives of the apartheid Government because that Government is not an expression of the aspirations of the entire South African population  white and black. Nevertheless  legal quibbles have always led to the argument that the decisions of our Assembly are serious warnings addressed to the apartheid regime that it should change its policies and act in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.115.	That complacent interpretation  far from giving the minority Government of South Africa pause  has merely strengthened it in its inhuman policies based upon denial of the human dignity of black people. In the circumstances  it is impossible for our Assembly to remain indifferent to the defiance that a Member of the Organization constantly flings in our face. If we can still take refuge behind legal quibbles -and for certain of us such a refuge is at any rate highly convenient nevertheless intellectual honesty should make us ask ourselves what this ""Member""  which systematically refuses to apply either its Charter or its resolutions  is doing among us. Honesty and common sense yes  honesty and common sense alone should long ago have made us expel this  to say the least  peculiar Member. It is high time the Organization at last applied Article 6 of the Charter to excise this gangrenous growth from its body.116.	My delegation feels the time has come for our Assembly to take energetic measures against that Government. It is all the more important to do so because that Government  in defying the decisions of the Assembly that took from it the Trusteeship of Namibia and the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice declaring illegal the presence of South Africa in Namibia  sees fit to carry into that Territory which is henceforth under the authority of the United Nations Council for Namibia its policies of apartheid and bantustanization.117.	Following the repeated efforts of the Secretary-General  under the instructions of the Security Council  to settle the problem amicably with the apartheid regime  and taking into account the obvious bad faith displayed by the South African Government  my delegation thinks that our Assembly Should Once again take up the problem of Namibia as a whole with a view to finding the urgent and immediate solution that is necessary. I need hardly emphasize that such a situation  should it long continue  might become a grave threat to international peace and security  if the Assembly does not give it all due attention in good time.118.	Everyone here knows that the General Assembly was able to complete the work of its twenty-eighth session on 16 September last only because of the conflict that shook the Organization as a result of the resumption of hostilities last October in the Middle East. Thanks to the wisdom of the parties concerned  and above all because the super-Powers understood the danger to the world of the perpetuation of such a situation  a disengagement agreement was concluded  first between Egypt and Israel and then between Syria and Israel  thus for the time being averting any resumption of hostilities. Although it is not yet possible to say that all danger of war has been eliminated  the maneuvering of the great Powers in the region has clearly shown their standing concern to prove to the world that the controls are still in their hands.119.	It is indeed painful to note that  despite the many resolutions of the Organization  relative peace has prevailed in the Middle East only when th? superPowers have decided it should  thus demonstrating that  when they see fit to cease their rivalry  areas of conflict in the world can disappear once and for all. In these circumstances  and in view of these facts  which speak for themselves  how could we fail to hold them responsible for all the wars that periodically flare up here and there?120.	In the Middle East  the guns are now temporarily silent  but there is no guarantee that the fighting will not start again. It is therefore urgently necessary  first of all  that Israel withdraw from all occupied Arab territories and  secondly  that  rather than freezing the situation  those principally responsible and those actually involved should find a formula that will make possible an early resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East with a view to restoring a just and lasting peace in the region. It is the interests of the peoples of that area that are at stake. It is the interests of the international community too that are at stake  to the extent that that Conference will help safeguard peace and security in the Middle East.121.	But if a just and lasting peace is to be restored to that part of the world  my delegation feels that it must not be at the expense of the aspirations of the Palestinian people; for that people  deprived of its land and reduced to a nomadic existence  and whose national identity has been completely flouted  also has the right to a homeland. That is why my country has supported the inclusion in the Assembly's agenda of the item entitled ""Question of Palestine"" [item 108}. Indeed  the time has come for us to stop deceiving ourselves; we must insist on speaking the language of truth. The parties concerned must come before us and tell us their thoughts so that the delegations here may determine their attitudes advisedly. It is at that price  and at that price alone  that the Geneva Peace Conference can be moved off dead-center and that the Organization can make a positive contribution that will help spare the Middle East a further flare-up of violence.122.	What I was saying a moment ago about the attitude of the super-Powers is further illustrated in the conflict that flared up between Iraq and Iran. One had only to listen to the statements of the representatives of the parties to the dispute before the Security Council and to recall the inability of that organ to any decision to realize that a situation had arisenfor which the two countries were not really responsible. And yet there were casualties on both sides. Thanks to the efforts of the mediator sent by the Secretary-General  a solution was found which  for the moment  appears to rule out any possibility of a resumption of hostilities  provided  of course  that lose truly responsible so wish and that the peoples of those countries understand that it is not in their interest to continue killing each other.123.	In Cyprus  the situation created by hot-heads remote-controlled from one knows not where was obviously intended to discredit the Organization  to the extent that it nearly shook its institutions. Those unfamiliar with international politics might find it at least incomprehensible  if not inadmissible  that right under the very nose of the United Nations force  whose mission was to watch over peace between the two communities and to protect constitutional legality  a coup d'etat should have taken place without that force being able to come to the assistance of the constitutionally elected head of government  Archbishop Makarios. But if one bears in mind ""the limits of the Organization and the more-or-less openly avowed determination of the super-Powers to demonstrate their hegemonic strength  one will easily understand the political and strategic motives that impelled the instigators of the coup to jeopardize the very existence of that sovereign State and Member of the Organization.124.	In acting so lightly  those remote-controlled foreign forces which have underlain the Cypriot tragedy since 15 July demonstrated a very shortsighted view  in that their acts have fostered the division of the island into two distinct communities and have seriously jeopardized constitutional law and the self-determination of the Cypriot people.125.	For the super-Powers this has been a fine opportunity for mutual outbidding. If they had at least taken the trouble to think first and foremost of the sufferings of the displaced populations before waging war  that would have been easier to understand. If they had left it to the competent authorities of the Organization in this particular case  the Security Council to settle the problem in fairness and justice  we would not be where we are today. But all that matters to them is their interests and their rivalries. My delegation feels  however  that despite the reservations raised by the interference of the great Powers in this matter  the proposal  supported by my Government  that there be an international conference attended by members of the Security Council  the parties concerned and the non-aligned States should be given close attention. This solution is not ideal but is nevertheless one way of seeking to restore peace and constitutionality to that tormented island.126.	In the IndoChina peninsula the situation remains tense; international peace and security continue to be sorely tried. Thus in Viet Nam  after the international community learned with relief of the conclusion of the Paris Agreement  which was supposed to lead that country towards peace by making possible the establishment of a democratic regime  war continues because a clique in foreign pay has been unwilling to respect the terms of that Agreement.127.	In Korea  the fact that the Truce Commission scuttled itself following contacts between South and North made it easier for the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to adopt a consensus text.9 By that consensus the Assembly invited the two parties to continue their dialog with a view to finding a solution enabling them to reach their objective of peaceful and democratic unification. Unfortunately  since the last session no progress has been made in the direction desired by the General Assembly. The main cause of this situation lies in the presence of foreign forces based on the territory of one of the parties. When we realize that that so-called United Nations force; which was once composed of troops from a number of countries  now consists solely of troops from one country  it can easily be understood that the decision of the Organization in setting up that force is no longer in effect and that the last bastion of the so-called United Nations force should also leave Korea. In any event  if a force is to take refuge under the United Nations flag  it can only be with the consent of the parties concerned. In other words  if one of the parties calls into question the existence of that force  the Assembly must take measures enabling the withdrawal of the so-called United Nations forces from Korea in order to ease contacts between the two parties. And we must do everything possible to avoid jeopardizing the reunification desired by the two parties.128.	In Cambodia  an intolerable situation continues  enabling a clique which actually represents nothing to continue to claim to speak on behalf of the Khmer people and to occupy Cambodia's seat in the General Assembly. It is now time for the Assembly to Clarify its position  which  in any event  must be one of seeking the restoration of the rights of the Royal Government of National Union  which is still headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk  whose forces still control almost all of Cambodian territory. The Assembly must render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and exclude the representatives of the Lon Nol clique.129.	One corollary of the persistence of zones of tension is the proliferation of weapons and the need of the industrialized countries to find outlets for their arms industries. My delegation thinks that we should denounce that competition in the sale of weapons which is taking place all over the world now following the energy crisis. If my country unreservedly supported the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  it nevertheless feels that if those weapons were not such as to endanger the very existence of the countries possessing them  the Organization would never have taken up the problem and sought to limit their scope. It is thus hypocritical frantically to seek for a limitation of weapons which can upset the tranquility and the development of the great Powers while doing nothing to reduce the manufacture of conventional weapons or the sale of those weapons to others  encouraging them to seek confrontation among themselves.130.	If the Assembly followed my train <of thought it will have noticed that everywhere international peace and security are sorely tried and that wherever this is the case one can see the hand of one or both super-Powers and that they stop at nothing when it comes to exercising their power and sabotaging the efforts of the Organization for international peace and security. The question therefore arises  if the situation continues  whether all the members constituting the Assembly will continue to allow the Organization to be weakened at the behest of the super-Powers.131.	My delegation thinks that times have changed since the San Francisco Conference  which was essentially concerned with dividing up the world into hegemonic zones. The best proof is that from the some 50 Members which then constituted the United Nations  the Assembly today is composed of 138 equal Members. This is a reality which cannot long remain ignored. The balance of forces has changed and the .text that governs the Organization must be adapted to this new situation. Accordingly  my delegation unreservedly will support any initiative to that effect which would seek to restore justice and equity in the Organization. A thorough-going revision of the Charter is necessary. Some interests will certainly be encroached upon. But the overwhelming majority of the Assembly will agree because it is in the interests of the United Nations and of its credibility.132.	While a double standard may have been understandable in 1946  it no longer reflects the reality of 1974  and it would be a grave mistake to go on perpetuating it.133.	Before concluding I cannot forbear to speak of a problem which is of the utmost concern to my country and to the international community: the economic crisis through which the world is now passing.134.	The international economic situation in recent years has been marked by a series of crises: a crisis of the international monetary system  with galloping inflation and rising prices  the food crisis  and the threat of famine in some parts of the world where food shortages are creating a critical situation. The picture would not be complete if we did not add to all the foregoing the ravages caused by the consequences of natural disasters such as drought  floods and cyclones.135.	The case of Honduras  where thousands of people have just die**  their homes destroyed and their fields laid waste  is an illustration of the scourges which are visited periodically on the world. I should like to take this opportunity of asking the delegation of Honduras to accept the expression of the deepest sympathy of the delegation of Dahomey.136.	Our community has addressed  itself with peculiar felicity to the problems raised by these various crises. The Committee of 20 40 despite the complexity of the question  is seeking solutions with a view to improving our international monetary system. Other specialized agencies  like FAO and WHO  are doing their best to counter the depredations of malnutrition  famine and disease.137.	Panic provoked by the difficulties of the world economy has led certain countries to seek ways and means of stemming the crisis  if necessary through protectionist and restrictive means  the consequence of which would be to block the expansion of international trade. For our part  in the developing countries  impoverished by the shameless exploitation of our national wealth by th<? colonial Powers and the great international trusts  our situation is unspeakably tragic. The economic crisis Which is raging all over the world strikes us doubly hard since it adds to the injustice we have always and everywhere denounced.138.	It is not really right that we should continue  without reacting  to be refused free access to the markets of the wealthy countries. It is not right that we should always be the only ones to pay the cost of the implacable law of supply and demand. It is not right that we should always have suffered and go on suffering from the perpetual worsening in the terms of trade. It is not right that our already fragile economies should always suffer the limitations of chronic under-equipment. It is not right that we should continue to support without any assistance the burden of external debt and debt-servicing which considerably reduces our capacity to finance development projects  whereas our creditors continue to extract the maximum exploitation from our resources. It is not right that we should continue to suffer so much injustice and so much discrimination in regard to freight  insurance and other matters at the hands of the big companies that govern the world markets.139.	The legitimate actions of the petroleum-producing countries in imposing fair prices for their product provoked the fiercest opposition from the industrialized countries  which were all too quick to speak of crisis while actually throwing on to the developing countries the weight of the effects of the rise in the price of energy and the cost of capital goods of which we had urgent need. Indeed  some of these industrialized Powers do not hesitate to make threats rather than seeking a solution in more realistic terms  namely  that of the economic interdependence of great and small and of the need for a just and equitable remuneration for the products and the labor of each and all.140.	Our international community  aware of the necessary interaction between politics and economics  and its role in the maintenance or non-maintenance of world peace  has convened various meetings attended by all countries with a view to finding ways of remedying so many injustices from which the poor countries suffer  and to harmonizing  for the greater good of mankind  economic relations between the various States in order to bridge or reduce the gap between rich and poor countries. But the failure of the first three sessions of UNCTAD and the near failure of the First United Nations Development Decade have shown the Third World countries clearly that it is the selfish interests which alone prevail in the wealthy countries.141.	As we approach the end of the first half of the Second United Nations Development Decade  the successive crises -monetary crisis  food crisis and so forth- and the imperialist measures of a protectionist and restrictive nature undertaken by the rich countries have deeply disturbed the pattern of international economic relations.142.	There can be no doubt that the position is very disturbing indeed for the 25 least developed countries  including Dahomey. Hence  it has seemed to us that if no measures are taken for their effective application  the recommendations of international conferences designed to improve our countries' prospects for development recommendations that often have had little effect will be no more than mere palliatives that will be quickly offset by the deleterious consequences of crises which upset international trading relations and of which we are the main victims.143.	That dramatic situation with which we are faced has further strengthened our bonds of co-operation and our faith in the policy of agreeing on a thorough study of the political  economic and social problems confronting us  having regard to the structure of international economic relations dominated by the industrialized countries. We are deeply convinced that no lasting solution to our difficulties can be found unless this structure of international economic relations based on a balance of force unfavorable to the development of the poor countries is called into question.144.	That situation  which certain industrialized countries had already -described as intolerable  was bound to give rise to tension and confrontation if the international community did not seriously tackle it in time. That was clearly understood  Mr. President  by your Head of State  President Houari Boumediene  when on behalf of the non-aligned countries he proposed the convening of the sixth special session of the Assembly  on raw materials and development. That special session  held here in April and May this year  drawing lessons from the various crises  particularly the petroleum crisis  that had strikingly demonstrated the interdependence of our economies  had the merit of clearly and precisely defining the roles that should henceforth govern economic relations between rich and poor countries  through the establishment of a Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.145.	For the first time in the history of international economic relations  the rich countries recognized the existence of a basic problem requiring immediate solution. No matter what reservations may be expressed  they detract in no way from the problem of substance  which requires an urgent response from our community in the clearly understood interests of all.146.	For our part  we in Dahomey believe that the main problem is henceforward as clear as day. What we must do is replace the old international economic order  which has been based on the balance of force and domination  by a new international economic order taking into account  among other things  the interdependence of our respective economies  respect for the sovereignty of every State  the necessary solidarity between the various nations of our international community   and assistance by the richer to the poorer  without any discrimination between the socio-economic systems freely chosen by the latter. For the development of the developing countries' resources to satisfy the needs of their masses and of the peoples of other countries adds to the wealth of the world and to the progress of mankind.147.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  whose second session has just finished at Caracas  has brought home the need to establish a new international legal order governing the ocean spaces. The new law of the sea now being drafted must take into account first and foremost the interests of the developing countries. It must therefore be a fundamental element in the creation of new forms of international co-operation.148.	Dahomey  aware of its interests in that sphere  agrees with many other countries that the requirements of economic growth and national security make it necessary that the coastal States have a nationaloceanic zone that is as broad as possible. That is why it firmly supports the logical and very coherent notion that a State's territorial waters should be extended to a maximum of 200 nautical miles  thus   assimilating the exclusive economic zone to the territorial sea. It goes without saying that in its national oceanic space the coastal State would exercise full jurisdiction and full sovereignty. However  in addition to accepting the traditional obligations  it would agree to guarantee to its landlocked neighbors the right of access to the sea and the right of free transit under bilateral or regional agreements.149. That idea  which offers the best protection for the interests of the underdeveloped countries with regard to the law of the sea  is based on the physical and legal unity of the zone in question  from the standpoint of its size  of the intermediate column of water  of the seabed and the subsoil  and of the corresponding resources.150. With regard to the regime for the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  the delegation of Dahomey believes that the international authority to be established should be endowed with extensivepowers in connexion with not only the exploitation and exploration but also the sale of the resources  in order to prevent a decline in the prices of the minerals from the deposits on dry land  and in particular of those produced by the developing countries. In any event  exploitation of the international zone must not be entrusted to multinational corporations on the unconvincing pretext that the international authority does not have the required technical and financial means a formula that would betray the concept of the common heritage of mankind. The industrialized countries that already have the means necessary to undertake the exploration and exploitation of the re-sources of the international zone can demonstrate their willingness to co-operate by placing themselves at the disposal of the authority until it is financiallycapable of acquiring those means itself. 151. Those were the various agenda items on which my delegation wished to .share its thoughts as the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly beginsits work. While the Organization can take some pride in the fortunate outcome of some of the burning problems that had been before it recently  we must note with some bitterness that most of those problems have been solved virtually outside the United Nations.The changes in Portugal and the progress achieved in colonial matters seem to have been less the result of positions we have taken or recommendations wehave adopted than the normal outcome of the struggles and sacrifices by the peoples concerned. 152. At the very most  our support-often very timid support-for the liberation movements may have helped to galvanize the energies of the freedom-fighters. Today more than ever before it has become essential that we should pause for thought  should seek the causes of the paralysis and impotence of the Organization in respect of the tragedies confronting mankind. We can no longer wait to see the dead bury their dead'.153. The same problems arise in connexion with economic relations among nations at different levels of development. Our endless recommendations for a more just balance in the distribution of the planet's goods and resources all too often remain dead letters. The wealthy nations will move only when their interests are threatened or when we confront them with the only weapon available to us: the price of our raw materials. In other words  the rule of might continues to be the supreme rule. But we must take care that poetic justice does not lead to a state of affairs in which those who are the strongest today become the weakest tomorrow and the law of the jungle turns out to be the only law suited to our ways and our thinking.154.	No  it seems to me that the raison d'etre of the Organization is precisely to avoid such a state of affairs. Let us therefore so act that this precious instrumentality of the United Nations may truly serve the cause of justice and peace in the world."
"10",566,"BFA",29,1974,"Taking the floor for the first time before this Assembly  I should like first of all to reaffirm unequivocally that the nation of Upper Volta has with determination  side by side with all nations represented here  assumed unfailingly the common responsibilities incumbent upon us all not only to free humanity from the specter of war  but also to ensure for future generations a universe of justice and prosperity.23.	But permit me first  Mr. President  to associate myself whole-heartedly with the extremely warm congratulations which have been extended to you already on the occasion of your election. The decision of the Assembly to entrust to you the conduct of our proceedings is a glowing tribute to your special qualities as a veteran diplomat  to all Africa and to the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  your own country. Your considerable experience with the United Nations and the authority which is undeniably yours qualify you particularly to preside over the important discussions at this twenty-ninth session.24.	We should also like to extend our warmest congratulations to the other officers. There is no doubt that the competence of the team which has been elected  together with its far-sightedness  wisdom and talent for conciliation  is for us a reassuring augury of success in our work.25.	Our warmest thanks also go to Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who  throughout the last session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly  was the perfect incarnation of the wisdom and skill which made it possible to bring our work to a successful conclusion. We would simply like to say to him that his vast competence won him the admiration and sympathy of us all.26.	My delegation would now like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose role in the search for peace among nations and whose earnest desire to find solutions to the problems of the under-privileged countries have won him our admiration. We have seen in the areas concerned  wherever the circumstances have required  particularly in Africa  which is suffering from hunger  colonialism  under-development and racial discrimination  the Secretary-General contributing actively to the search for remedies for all these ills..27. Our family has just grown by the addition of three new Members. I should like to convey to them my warmest congratulations.28.	My delegation also would like to mark enthusiastically the presence among us of the worthy representatives of the heroic people of Guinea-Bissau. The noble cause defended  at the cost of his life  with such intelligence  courage and perseverance by Amilcar Cabral  the work taken up by his brother Luis Cabral  have just been translated today into facts  to the great satisfaction of the whole of Africa and all freedom- and justice-loving nations. To our brothers from Guinea-Bissau  who have written  at the cost of their own blood  one of the most glorious pages in the history of African liberation  Upper Volta addresses here its warmest congratulations.29.	We should also like to welcome the delegation of Bangladesh  which represents a nation whose courage and wisdom have always compelled our admiration. We are sure that its presence among us will contribute greatly to the solution of the many problems facing our world.30.	Finally  I should like to express my warmest congratulations to the Prime Minister of Grenada and also to the important delegation he heads. We would ask him to be good enough to convey to the people of Grenada and to his Government our ardent wishes for peace and prosperity.31.	The importance of this twenty-ninth session is obvious to all  because it is taking place at a very decisive cross-roads in history: It is taking place at a time when humanity is becoming aware of the precariousness of its existence  which seems every day to be threatened by a shortage of food  the constant dangers constituted by the arms race and bloody confrontations between certain nations  and by the fact  too  that it is becoming aware of the limits of our world  whose interdependence among its members poses a crucial problem of coexistence and tolerance.32.	Moreover  this session is being held at a time when nations  great and small  are feeling the need to redefine the unequal relationships which have existed heretofore between them. In any case  the economic battle now being waged by the developing countries means that they are no longer prepared to remain the poor relations of development. The sixth special session of the General Assembly  the important resolutions on the new international economic order and the program of action which flowed from it  testify to the urgent need for such a change in international relations.33.	But we do not expect miracles from this redefinition of international relations  just as it would be illusory to base a policy of national development on international aid  which is always fluid. The example of the struggle against under-development which we have been waging since independence has taught us this. It is with this background in mind that Upper Volta is now planning its battle for development.34.	When at the time of independence young States had to gage for the first time the enormous responsibilities bequeathed them by the colonial Power  they found themselves coming to grips with problems which they had of course foreseen  but whose scope they had never been able to appreciate. At the same time  they were obliged  with extremely limited resources  to think out and resolve very complex problems such as the appropriate political and administrative organization  economic development education  and social structures.35.	Faced with these problems of unprecedented complexity  the new Members of the United Nations family had to display a great deal of realism and wisdom  particularly in view of the fact that they were under-developed countries. They had to base their ideal on the great truth that any lasting development requires enlightened administration which shall be both honest and devoted to the common weal  and had to organize all their energies to undertake the most urgent research to ensure the welfare of the people. Administrative corruption  unjustified and prolonged idleness  favoritism  waste  ostentation and discrimination; all crowned by ignorance  were the worst evils which threatened these societies. Thus  from the very dawn of their independence  the new sovereign States needed a healthy state of mind directed to their national construction; in short  they needed a solid development ethic.36.	But we must be honest and realistic  and recognize that  unfortunately  in such an important area as national development certain young States have not always been able to demonstrate that an ethical approach could bear the appropriate responsibilities and play its role in setting standards. The fault lay essentially with the new leaders  who then had to watch their countries suffer the consequences of their poor administration of public affairs.37.	What has come to be known as the wave of military coups d'etat can be explained by the need for changes following a deterioration in domestic situations and the resignation of certain political leaders. In Upper Volta  the revolution of 3 January 1966 obeyed the same rule. In the face of the lack of consistency and the corruption of the politicians of the time  a popular movement transferred power to the army  the only force which at that time could defend the people against omnipotent leaders. Of course  this change of regime was quickly classed with the whole group of military coups d'etats which occurred  without any realization that it resulted solely from a contract between the popular masses and the army; the army had to restore order in public affairs  which had been seriously disturbed  and was sustained by the people in this work of rehabilitation.38.	But whatever the resulting views and attitudes  nations of goodwill discovered with ever-growing satisfaction that on 3 January 1966 Upper Volta had gained a government and political leaders firmly resolved to prove that in the very important area of national development the ethical approach was to play its proper part to the full. The Government then undertook a vigorous effort to promote the harmonious development of the young Republic  involving the placing of the financial situation on a sound basis  the liquidation of the public debt  the restoration of confidence in the business world  the lowering of salaries  patriotic contributions and the reduction of State expenditures. In a short time the world witnessed with admiration the financial rehabilitation of Upper Volta.39.	It is on the basis of these political and economic achievements that we have given Upper Volta democratic and parliamentary institutions permitting all shades of opinion a voice  so as to build a politically mature nation capable of undertaking the battle for development. But as the old adage says  ""habit is second nature""  for very soon the objectives of the revolution of 3 January 1966 were overlooked by the new leaders who had emerged from this new experiment. The result was a serious political crisis to which those who were anxious about the political future of the young State could net remain indifferent.40.	At a time when our country was going through the most difficult period of its history  at a time when it had to face the terrible scourge of drought  and at a time when international public opinion was becoming aware of our tragedy and mobilizing resources in order to support our efforts  morally and materially  it was out of the question to allow Upper Volta to be labeled as irresponsible and to become enmeshed in useless internal dissension. The President of the Republic  the Chief of Staff of the Army  faced the following dilemma: either to allow the crisis to develop without hope of a short-term solution  with all the danger that this involved of dividing the country into two rival factions  and demobilizing energies meant for national development  or  taking seriously his role as arbiter  to intervene to save the institutions  to revive the confidence of the working people  and to recall the objectives of 3 January 1966.41.	At a time when every nation is wondering about its future  at a time when economic uncertainty  the inexorable process of inflation and monetary disorder are monopolizing the attention of States and preventing nations from constructive activity and making reasonable provision for the near future  the choice was not in doubt. Taking seriously his role of guardian of the national security  the President of the Republic  General Sangoule Lamizana  put an end to all political machinations on 8 February 1974 by taking the decision to suspend the Constitution  to dissolve the National Assembly and to dismiss the Government. In their place there was installed the Government of National Renewal  composed of young civilians and soldiers known for their probity and their industry  and the National Consultative Committee for Renewal  composed of members from all social strata  whose essential task was constantly to remind the Government of the needs of the people.42.	Of course  there are some who will regret that Upper Volta did not entirely meet the challenge of parliamentary democracy and a party system; others will take pleasure at seeing in these events a corroboration of their theses  which are based on simplistic premises. Be that as it may  we do not regret what we did. There was an urgent choice to be made  and in his statement of general policy the President of the Republic explained this choice as follows:""The Army  without wishing to undermine democratic freedoms  could nevertheless not permit itself to play the role of an indifferent spectator at the execution  as it were  of our country for the sake of unreasonable respect for certain formulas satisfying to the mind but with pernicious consequences for everyone  when the application of those formulas was a threat to national cohesion.""43.	But in Upper Volta citizens have enjoyed the benefits of democracy and they want to keep them. That is why it was the more necessary to guarantee  in the new institutions  all the democratic freedoms which were so dearly won on the morrow of the revolution of 3 January 1966. Thus  8 February 1974 marked a new stage in the awakening of the people of Upper Volta  because that was the historic date on which new institutions were established  designed not only to ensure the general mobilization of the working people but also  consequently  to make possible accelerated and more harmonious development: in other words  Upper Volta was entering the era of renewal.44.	But what is this renewal of Upper Volta? Renewal means the end of the epoch of politicians outbidding each other  when demagogy was the only weapon in the battle for power. It also means the end of collective resignations. Finally it means the establishment of a true national development policy in the political  economic and cultural fields  all aimed at remodeling the face of Upper Volta in a way designed to promote its identity. In the final analysis  renewal is as much an ethical approach as it is a program.45.	In a speech made on 23 February 1974 General Sangoule Lamizana laid down the major guidelines for this new program of action. He said:""We must do everything we can to shake off this apathy and to awaken the citizens of Upper Volta so that they may rediscover their vitality and all the forces of the richness of their spirit. It is on those terms that we shall be in a position to present a better front in the struggle to bring remedies to bear for the lack of technical and financial resources  within the limits of our possibilities  in order to pursue a policy of social promotion  which remains to be defined  to rethink our educational system  the in-adaptability of which leads more to failure than success and leaves on the street corners a potential for protest  to define a policy of industrialization in keeping with the interests of the nation  and to develop the cultural riches of our national heritage  which have hitherto been insufficiently developed -in a word  to conceive and undertake action designed to ensure economic development and the cultural and social promotion of the Upper Volta nation.""46.	Renewal is  therefore  first of all a policy of our whole means  a policy essentially based on unity  work and justice. However  we are very well aware that in spite of all our good will this threefold national policy is not enough. As the President of the Republic stated in his guidance speech of 23 February  ""However determined it is to succeed  Upper Volta cannot by itself overcome all the numerous difficulties it faces"".47.	That is why the foreign policy of our country is intended to be at the same time the indispensable complement to its development efforts. That foreign policy is based essentially on the following fundamental principles: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  as defined in the charter of the OAU and the Charter of the United Nations; non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States; non-alignment; and equality and reciprocity in international relations.48.	The assistance given to Upper Volta by friendly nations and international organizations is an indispensable adjunct to our plan of action. Let us therefore take this opportunity to pay ? tribute to all States and international organizations which have understood the encouraging meaning of friendship in the painful hours through which our country has been living  for  as is known  Upper Volta and the other countries of the Sahel are suffering from an unprecedented drought which has dealt a mortal blow not only to their economies but also to their peoples. From this very rostrum the President of the Republic  General Sangoule Lamizana  had occasion to refer to this matter in a previous session [2145th meeting]. Furthermore  the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  realized this when at Ouagadougou in February 1974 he made an appeal for assistance for the people of the Sahel  threatened with famine.49.	The upsurge of solidarity demonstrated on that occasion gives us grounds for believing that it is pos-sible to create a unitary world on condition that all States and the whole international community are now aware of the solidarity of a world the limits of which are becoming ever clearer each day. That co-operation and international solidarity are the fundamental options of our Government of National Renewal. That is why Upper Volta has absolutely undertaken to work for integration -national  regional  continental and world integration. A land-locked country  it stands only to gain by such a policy  and it is in that conviction that one must seek the reason for our membership of various regional and interregional organizations. It is our view that that was in the minds of the States that created the United Nations itself. In creating the United Nations and becoming Members of the Organization we have undertaken the solemn responsibility not only to coexist in peace and brotherhood but also to seek ways and means of achieving a rapprochement among nations and effective solidarity.50.	It is also in that sense that from the very beginning we were the active militants of African unity represented by the great organization which is known to all. We intend to remain in that attitude  for we have placed too much hope in that organization to be disappointed; but we are convinced that with imagination it will be possible to find ever more original solutions to the problems of Africa. The struggle for African independence  the battle for economic development  the sheltering of the continent from the bloody upheavals of the modern world  political and economic integration -those are the subjects that concern us. This is indeed a program  is it not?51.	It is  finally  in that sense that Upper Volta has adopted the ideas of non-alignment  the outlines and contours of which the distinguished President of this twenty-ninth session has so ably described to us at the outset of our debate [2233rd meeting]. By sup-porting non-alignment  Upper Volta intends to reject the system of blocs and spheres of influence  while committing itself to finding original solutions to the many problems that beset us.52.	Extraordinary and varied discoveries have made it possible to provide our world with thousands of amenities  commodities and comforts  and it seems to us that we need only to enjoy in peace all this storehouse of wealth in order to live a better and happier life. Unfortunately  for more than 30 years -and this is indeed strange logic -we have been fighting each other. More than 50 wars have shaken and still share the entire world.53.	Today  at Che opening of this session  we are compelled to note that the analysis of the state of affairs in the world does not allow us to take too optimistic a view  although there are some glimmerings of hope on the horizon.54.	True  the trend to dialog that has emerged over the past few years has continued. Bilateral con-tacts and multilateral meetings  even if they have not always produced the happy result's that we had expected  nonetheless are encouraging signs of detente and represent a lessening of tension in various regions of the world. True  in Europe the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin  the Geneva Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the Paris-Bonn rapprochement  and the normalization of Germano- Czech relations are on record to show us that with a bit of goodwill it is possible to cast down the barriers of centuries-long prejudice. True  agreements on the separation of the forces confronting each other in Sinai and on the Golan Heights have been signed  thus making it possible to take a step towards the settlement of the conflict of the Middle East. True  the Organization is tending increasingly towards universality through the admission to its midst of new States. But what is all this in comparison with the sombre background against which these events stand?55.	Throughout the world  tragedies are still being enacted  spreading suffering  mourning and ruin among innocent peoples. It is an irony of fate that it should be the peoples of the poorest regions who meet death so tragically. But can one really talk about fate when one knows that in this cruel game all the strings are in a few hands that manipulate them as they wish?56.	And above all  there is the tragedy of colonialism and apartheid.57.	It is with unparalleled delight that all peoples that love peace and freedom have welcomed the overthrow of the centuries-old dictatorship that ruled the Portuguese people. This delight turns to rightful pride when we recall that it was as a result of the combination of popular forces  both African and Portuguese  that the foundations of that dictatorship were shaken. In Africa as in Portugal  hope has been born. The most recent statements of the Portuguese Government  in any event  allow us be optimistic about the future. In his statement of 27 July 1974  did not General denola say that Portugal was ready to entertain all initiatives for the preparation and implementation of the process of decolonization in Africa  involving the immediate acceptance of the right to political independence?58.	The agreements of Algiers and of Lusaka  fortunately  confirmed this hope  thus making it possible for the people of Guinea-Bissau to accede to full and complete independence and for the hostilities in Mozambique to cease. The democratic course on which Portugal has now decided to embark is of a sort to defuse the political atmosphere and to make a considerable contribution to peace. Through the voice of my delegation  Upper Volta wishes to pay a special tribute to the fine understanding of the Portuguese people and to the political courage and foresight of its new leaders.59.	Moreover  we hope that the Portuguese people  having uprooted fascism in its country  will better understand the position of our brothers who live in South Africa and in Rhodesia  and that it will convince the Portuguese Government to change its attitude towards the policies of South Africa and Rhodesia  which it should oppose  as was decided by all the nations that love peace and freedom.60.	However  the international community must remain vigilant. We must not accept any solution in the newly independent Territories that represents only a poor and lopsided compromise. Full and complete independence should be granted to all African Territories under domination. Nor will we accept a Rhodesian-type solution whereby a minority of white settlers tries to confiscate power for their sole benefit  as has already occurred in certain attempts. 61.	As we know  indeed  in Rhodesia and South Africa a most abject and despicable lack of under-standing continues to be displayed; I refer to racism and the policy of apartheid. In this connexion  as we address the entire world from this rostrum  let us also remember that today  2 October  is the anniversary of a person who  throughout his life  was the incarnation of the soul of the movement for national independence in his country and who founded his actions on the principle of non-violence. I am referring  of course  to Mahatma Gandhi. It was he who was the first to rise up and rebel against the cruel practices of the South African Government. Let us recall that he led a movement to improve the lot of colored people in South Africa even before he launched the civil disobedience movement in India to obtain the freedom and independence of his country.62.	Moreover  ever since India raised this question in the United Nations in 1946  almost every Member of the Organization  including the allies of South Africa  has severely denounced the shameful and ignominious policy of apartheid. In the midst of this twentieth century it is inadmissible that peoples who call themselves civilized should support and nurture the folly of a concept of inequality among human beings. The hateful policy of apartheid practiced by the Fascist authorities of Pretoria  and by those who slowly but surely are imitating them  does honor neither to so-called civilized peoples nor to our age. My delegation hopes that this twenty-ninth session will not only condemn once again this policy of subjugation of man but will try to find the best means of putting into effect the decisions taken by the international community on this question.63.	In Namibia the United Nations has a special responsibility to the extent that legally this Territory should be administered by the Organization pending its accession to independence. Upper Volta will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia to discharge the task entrusted to it by the Assembly.64.	In any event  it should be known that if a satisfactory solution is not found to the problems of the African subcontinent within a few years  this region will be one of the hottest spots on the globe. A bitter struggle will be waged there and no one yet can know who will win and who will lose. What we can say is that the inhabitants of the region  be they black or white  will have to pay heavily for this. If it is true that might can prevail over right for a certain time  it is equally sure that this cannot go on indefinitely.65.	Our era is witnessing also the tragedies of brothers who are enemies. Thus the Middle East is still a serious source of concern to the international community  particularly at a time when a crisis has just erupted in Cyprus. If we are not careful  that tinder box will explode one day and endanger our entire world and its precarious balance.66.	The latent state of war between Israel and the neighboring Arab countries has commanded the world's attention for some time now. Despite individual and collective efforts  no final solution has yet been found. Despite all the resolutions that have been adopted  and particularly Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  a latent situation of war continues to exist.67.	We should like to state here once again  first  that all the States of the region have the right to exist and the right to their territorial integrity; secondly  that occupation or acquisition of territory by force is inadmissible; and thirdly  that the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people must be taken into consideration. Those are the three conditions for the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the region.68.	We are happy to note that during the past year a few glimmerings of hope have emerged that have rekindled our faith that a settlement can be found. Indeed  the international community's efforts have succeeded in achieving  in 1974  a cease-fire and a disengagement of forces between Israel on the one hand and Syria and Egypt on the other. Moreover  the Geneva Conference could be the appropriate framework in which to lay a basis for negotiations between the parties. We hope that that Conference will resume very soon  for if we take advantage of the chances for peace discernible on the horizon  there may be some grounds to hope for good results.69.	But so far the Middle East problem has seemed to concern only two parties: Israel and the neighboring Arab States. But there is a third party  which should be regarded as the most deeply concerned: the people of Palestine. It is not possible to imagine any solution to the Middle East problem that does not take into account those very people who are the essential issue. For its part  Upper Volta has always stated that a final solution to the Middle East problem must in one way or another proceed on the basis of a recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  rights that would enable them to inhabit their land and prosper there.70.	The inclusion of the Palestine question in the agenda is likely to enable us to discuss that problem seriously and not as a tangential issue  as has been done heretofore. We think that these discussions should lead to the emergence of a clear position which would make it possible to find a final solution.71.	Today a serious danger is also to be discerned in Cyprus  for the struggle being carried on in that island threatens not only its security but also that of the international community. The coup d'etat carried out there created a new source of tension in the Mediterranean area. As members well know  the consequences were not long in emerging: Greeks and Turks began to fight each other  and the confrontation between the two communities went far beyond the expectations of those who had been moving them around like pawns on a chess-board. Indeed  the implications of the Cyprus situation have become so numerous and so wide-ranging that  in view of the disruption caused by the coup d'etat  the forces involved could not but react  knowing full well that  unfortunately  in our world  a fait accompli can create rights.72.	Obviously the situation created in Cyprus has introduced a new factor that has not simplified the Middle East problem; it raises even more acutely the question that was already of serious concern that is  the security of the Mediterranean region. We appeal to all the parties concerned to abide by the Treaty of Guarantee  signed at Nicosia on 16 August 1960  which guaranteed the independence of the island  and we call upon them to work to normalize the situation  in accordance with the Security Council resolutions on the subject.73.	We find too that in Asia  Viet Nam  Cambodia and Korea continue to be dangerous areas of tension. Despite the 1973 Paris agreements  peace has still not come to Viet Nam. It is for us to ensure that all the parties fully and immediately abide by all the provisions of those agreements. But  we may ask  what kind of peace  when in Cambodia—Viet Nam's neighbor everything still remains to be done. That country  which formerly was peaceful under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk  who practiced a policy of non-alignment  today has suffered the fate that was meted out to Viet Nam. War has been brought to that country against the will of the people  who have undertaken to struggle in order clearly to show that if there is one course that their leaders should follow  it is that which they themselves have spelled out  and not one dictated from abroad. In any event  we can only note the rallying of the Khmer 'people around the person of Prince Sihanouk'. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  which he leads  is already administering the largest part of Cambodian territory. Hence  it goes without saying that it is the representatives of that Government who should represent Cambodia here. The choice that Upper Volta has made of recognizing that Government as the only legitimate one reflects our desire for peace and non-alignment and is also a clear condemnatory of foreign intervention in any country.74.	There is also  of course  the Korean problem. At the twenty-eighth session Upper Volta supported the consensus on the Korean question1 in the firm hope that the contacts that were beginning between the two parties  following the joint communique of 4 July 1972  would achieve tangible results.75.	The Organization has a mission in Korea: it is to create by peaceful means a unified  independent and democratic Korea. The United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea  whose terms of reference were to create conditions likely to promote that unification  has not accomplished the task assigned to it. What is e/en worse  it has always been opposed by one of the parties involved. The dissolution of that Commission  which we have always recommended  would encourage the two parties to meet. For we think that  in the final analysis  the solution of the Korean prob-lem must be a Korean solution*76.	Very fortunately  Upper Volta has relations with the two parties. We believe  and we wish to state this cldarly  tbit the Korean people  despite the many handicaps resulting from so many years of war and tension and political ups and downs  are sufficiently mature today to choose their own course.77.	While avoiding the dictating of a code of conduct to the two parties  our sacred duty is to help them to achieve the reunification they are both actively seeking. But if that reunification is to be effective and above any kind of suspicion  it must be carried out by the Koreans themselves  free from any foreign influence or intervention  and particularly through the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed there under the United Nations flag.78.	There is  finally  the tragedy of the arms race  whose principal participants are the super-Powers.79.	Every year the Assembly discusses the problem of disarmament; and this discussion clearly reflects a major and legitimate concern. But it must be recognized that in this issue some discouragement and lassitude have crept in in view of the paucity of the results achieved up to now. Meanwhile  some countries are continuing to develop and to perfect quantitatively and qualitatively the most formidable weapons  and the small States are entitled to ask themselves -and not without fear -for what ultimate use these weapons are intended.80.	At the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers in 1973  those countries worked out quite clear conditions for the solution of this problem: the dissolution of military alliances born of the cold war; the dismantling of all military bases throughout the world; the creation of zones of peace in the various regions of the world; and the convening as soon as possible of a world conference on disarmament with the participation of all States.81.	For we may be sure that in order to dissipate the threat which hangs over our world  we will have to have general and complete disarmament  which should be the object of serious discussions among all countries. Just so long as the problem remains the exclusive concern of certain great countries and at the level of club discussions  we fear that no serious solution can be found.82.	Moreover  what we are concerned about is collective security. Whatever precautions one may take  the catastrophic effects of a nuclear bomb will transcend all frontiers. Our planet at the present time is vacillating between fear and hope: the fear of one day seeing the world engulfed in flames  and the hope that millions of human beings place in the development of international solidarity. The central feature of the existence of our generation need not always be this perilous course along the narrow corridor which separates fear from hope. We should think about this carefully.83.	But the survival of our civilization is not only threatened by the arms race  it is also threatened  perhaps even more so  by disparities in economic development. In this area  the developing countries are chiefly responsible for making the necessary effort. Unfortunately  in many sectors their effort meets with failure because of external forces which are completely beyond their control.84.	The world's economy is still prey to convulsions which have been occurring now for nearly a year. These upheavals have already prompted the wise and timely initiative of President Boumediene that led to the convening of a special session of the General Assembly. In our opinion the sixth special session was crowned by brilliant success  the impact of which will be revealed over the years. Upper Volta considers that it is particularly appropriate to emphasize the emergence of new fundamental principles which  if accepted by the international community  will constitute a further milestone towards a new era of more equitable and more consistent partnerships. The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the related Program of Action recognize the right of each State to adopt the economic and social system that it deems the most appropriate for its own development  to establish full permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and all its economic activities  including the right to nationalize industries and to restore and fully compensate for the exploitation and depletion of natural resources. That is one step forward towards a world economy based on a balance between the interests of all parties. The political sense and understanding of all will be judged according to how realistic they are in their resolute commitment to the attainment of those new horizons that promotes greater justice for all.85.	All these new elements should have created a better economic climate on the international level. However  we are compelled to realize that our ills still beset us.86.	With respect to commodities  Upper volta has always most firmly supported the efforts of the developing countries to commercialize their raw materials; we have done this at all international economic conferences and we intend to continue  for the demands of the third world for remunerative prices are timely and will make a decisive contribution to the introduction of a new international economic order which should not remain a dead letter.87.	That is why Upper Volta was pleased at the perceptible improvement in the terms of trade for the exporters of a limited range of commodities. Unfortunately  the general picture still leaves much to be desired  in particular for the African countries whose exports encounter very little elasticity of demand.Serious efforts should be made to reach a new inter-national agreement on coffee. With respect to cocoa  we support the legitimate claims of the producers  who feel that the range of prices fixed by the 1972 Agreement should be readjusted; these prices should be raised  duly taking into account the facts of the present-day markets.88.	We are gratified at the progress achieved with regard to a certain number of other products exported by the developing countries  owing to a resumption of the demand for industrial raw materials and to the upsurge in the economy in the industrialized countries.89.	My country's position regarding oil cannot be different from that taken with respect to other commodities. We should remember that oil is a non-renewable resource. It is in terms of price of this commodity and its availability that the present producer countries can promote their economic and social development.90.	The impact of the rise in prices of petroleum products on the economies in the developing countries is a problem which cannot be solved by a readjustment of the level of prices as they stand now; this is neither realistic nor desirable. In our opinion the solution would lie in the direction clearly pointed out by the General Assembly at its sixth special session  namely  by the taking of special measures in favor of the countries most affected to enable them to maintain their imports at desired levels. But the measures envisaged will be doomed to failure if the developed countries do not take action against the new situation created by the price of industrial products; indeed  the increase in the price of these products is completely out of proportion with the increase in the price of petroleum.91.	The price escalation thus set off by the developed countries and their multinational companies is an argument in favor of an immediate definition of the relationship to be established between the prices. of raw materials  manufactured and sen i-manufactured goods exported by the developing countries and the prices of industrial products  means of production and equipment imported by the third world. The establishment of such a relationship would guarantee to the developing countries the equivalent of the true value of their raw materials.92.	Upper Volta wishes once again to express its gratitude to the international community  both countries and public and private organizations  whose moral and material support  given so generously  has made it possible to limit the consequences of the natural disaster that has so sorely tried all the peoples of African Sahel. In particular  we should like to thank the Secretary-General and all his colleagues for their tireless efforts to mobilize international public opinion and help for the people of the Sahelian region.93.	However  there is still much to be done to enable Africa's Sahelian region to regain the pace and level of production it enjoyed before the disaster. The restoration of productive capital requires that the countries of the Sahelian region and the international community make an increased effort  in keeping with the scope and range of the disaster that must be corrected. As we have already said  means of production must be repaired and improved in order to make it possible for them very quickly to reach a development level that will protect them from such calamities.94.	To that end  it is essential that international assistance should be reinforced and pursued in pro-grammes ranging over a number of years. We are bound to observe that nothing has been done so far in respect of financing medium- and long-term projects worked out by the countries victims of the drought. Those projects are lying in desk drawers for lack of resources. The hopes they aroused have not been fulfilled  since those projects have called for investments of the order of $1 000 million. It is hardly necessary to emphasize the incalculable consequences of such indifference in the face of the requirements of those countries in their efforts to bolster their economies.95.	My delegation believes it is time to draw to the attention of the international community the encroachment of the desert  which has caused lasting damage to the environment not only in Africa but also on other continents. This phenomenon calls for urgent and concrete action at the world level.96.	As the Secretary-General stated at his press conference in Ouagadougou in February 1974  ""In less than 50 years from today  perhaps by the end of this century  the encroachment of the desert threatens to wipe off the map three or four countries of Africa"".97.	The drought seems to have struck everywhere. According to some meteorologists  climatic conditions will continue to be bad for some lime to come. Apparently a band of dry areas is being formed  and is spreading from the southern Sahara to northern China. Deserts and shrublands are spreading in the southern hemisphere. As evidence  let us note that the drought has also affected Nigeria  the United Republic of Cameroon  the Central African Republic  Guinea  Zaire  Angola  Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania. The level of underground water shows a constant decline. Lakes are progressively drying up  and wells must be driven to depths as great as 200 metres. In Asia  regions that were formerly fertile have been struck by drought  and the monsoon rains have been falling into the sea.98.	In our opinion  it is urgent that the United Nations should convene an international conference in order to record and analyze available data in respect of scientific knowledge on the process of desert- encroachment and work out a world plan of action to fight against it through water-level research and tests on forest resources that may be adapted for this purpose  the regeneration of grazing land  and so on.99.	Such a conference could be preceded by regional and subregional meetings  Within that framework we could schedule an African regional conference  including all the countries bordering on the Sahara  which would bring together the countries of the Sahelian region as well as the Sudan  Ethiopia  Somalia  Nigeria  the Central African Republic  Algeria  Tunisia and Morocco. The preparatory work for such a conference could be entrusted to the United Nations Environment Program  which would report back to the General Assembly at its thirtieth session through the Economic and Social Council.100.	Without such an over-all approach  any solutions one might be tempted to prepare at the national level would be doomed to failure. Indeed  as the President of Mexico said in his statement at FAO Headquarters on 9 February 1974:""Soil erosion on a planet the limits of which are henceforth dramatically clear to us constitutes one of the major questions of our time which cannot be settled except within the framework of a supra-national organization. The investments required for this purpose are  without doubt  far beyond the means of most countries  which for that very reason should support programs of common interest. There is nothing impossible about that task. We know that armaments are now costing the scandalous sum of $22 000 million annually  whereas in 1972 the developing countries received  in the form of governmental assistance  only $8 600 million  or precisely half the amount that was decided upon as part of the United Nations Program.""101.	The difficulties encountered in these last two years make it essential for the entire international community to examine its conscience. That is essential if there is to be a fair solution to the problem of food production. Indeed  we are not proceeding towards famine  as Rene Dumont has said; we have already reached that point  and it remains to be seen whether the world wishes to cope with this problem before any possible solution is ruled out because appropriate action was not taken in time.102.	In the past six years the increase in world food output has been approximately 2.6 per cent. It will reach 3.7 per cent in the next decade. In 1972  the world output of cereals amounted to 1 200 million tons  the annual rate of increase ranging around 30 million tons.103.	From 1959 to 1969  food production per capita for all of the countries of the third world remained more or less stagnant  the progress of a few being offset by the lagging of others. From 1969 until today  the general trend has been backwards. Per capita output has not ceased decreasing in the Sahelian region  in Latin America and in Asia  where the ""green revolution"" has not achieved the goals hoped for it.104.	Grain production in Africa was on the order of 34 million tons  or 97 per cent of total consumption. Over the past 10 years  output has increased by 2.6 per cent per annum  and it is estimated that it will amount to 50 million tons in 1985. But let us be clear and realize that if the world is threatened with famine it is more because of squandering by the wealthy than overpopulation in the third world.105.	In North America grain consumption is 1.8 tons per capita per annum; in the Soviet Union 1.4 tons; one ton in the member countries of the European Economic Community; whereas in India it is only one ton for seven persons; and in the other developing countries one ton for five persons. Thus it is clear that the impact of population growth in the developed countries entail the consumption of the world's resources at about two and a half times the rate re suiting from the impact of population growth in the third world.106.	Hence the third world runs the risk of having to import 85 million tons of grain in 1985 -or close to the maximum of what the developed countries will be able to supply them with- if the latter do not agree to reduce their meat consumption. Indeed  as shown by Rene Dumont  the livestock of the developed countries in 1973 consumed 380 million tons of grain and fodder -or a thousand times more than the developed countries gave to the Sahelian region. Let us recall that the grain shortage in the Sahelian region amounted to 800 000 tons in 1973  and has reached 1 230 000 tons in 1974.107.	The Director-General of FAO has already repeatedly warned of the seriousness of the situation with regard to the world's stockpiles  which have fallen to 105 million tons  their lowest level in many years. We will of necessity have to double food production in the next generation  if only to maintain the present inadequate rate of per capita food supply.108.	The present shortage has led to a tripling in the cost of corn and other grains  thus placing them beyond the means of the least favored nations. Indeed  in 1973  the developing countries received only 5 million tons of grain from the developed countries  as against 10 million tons in 1972. Those same developing countries had to spend $10 billion in 1973 to import their grain  as compared with $4 billion in 1972.109.	The World Food Conference offers the desired framework for the search for appropriate solutions to cope with the shortage and the production slow-down.110.	The substantial increase in food production in the developing countries requires action in four fundamental directions: increased investment  the avail-ability of loans  research on adaptation to new conditions  and rural development. But it is the developed countries that must provide the extra measure of indispensable technical and financial assistance.111.	Experiments carried out in certain developing countries  particularly in Africa  have shown that it is possible to triple  and even quintuple  agricultural output in most developing countries by a rational use of phosphate and nitrate fertilizers  which are the most important elements in food production.112.	Unfortunately  with the demand for food-stuffs growing because of the growth in population and personal revenue  nitrate fertilizer producers have not been able to meet the demand. It is even expected that prices will remain high after supply has caught up with demand  because of the cost of the raw mate-rials involved in this process. Hence there is every reason to believe that fertilizer needs will reach extraordinary levels towards the end of this century.113.	For all these reasons  the developed countries should take immediate and positive action to heed the appeal for setting up a common fertilizer stockpile fund; they should make substantial contributions to that fund  while at the same time significantly in-creasing their exports of fertilizers and pesticides to the developing countries  and at prices duly reflecting the serious balance of payments deficits of the developing countries. The developed countries  moreover  should supply the developing countries with the necessary financial and technical assistance to enable them to make full use of their present productive capacity. The World Food Conference should similarly prepare a plan for the international management of stocks in order henceforth to avoid the tremendous fluctuations in prices and supplies which occurred  for example  in 1972-1973. The developed countries should undertake to make a serious contribution to the financing of strategic food reserves designed to offset shortages and the effects of natural disasters. Such stocks should be held in the developing countries to reduce maintenance and transportation costs. It is by such measures that development assistance can finally achieve its goal.114.	As you know  the general climate of development assistance has continued to deteriorate. Public assistance for the development of member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has shown a drop in real terms and as a percentage of the gross national product. Accordingly  for all those countries the percentage of the gross national product devoted to government assistance fell from 0.34 per cent in 1972 to 0.30 per cent in 1973  even though the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade had established a target of 0.7 per cent [see resolution 2626 (XXV)  para. 43]. Total contributions  including export credits  loans  private investments and donations from benevolent organizations  amounted to 0.78 per cent of the gross national product  the same percentage as in 1972.115.	In quantitative terms  the volume of government assistance for development rose 9 per cent in 1973  from $8 700 million to $9 400 million. However  allowing for exchange rate fluctuations and the effects of widespread inflation  aid from the developed countries dropped by approximately 6 per cent in real terms  representing a 30 per cent decline compared with 1963. It is worth noting that the element of aid generosity did rise from 84 per cent to 86.7 per cent between 1972 and 1973. On the other hand  the proportion of that government aid to the total net contribution of financial resources fell from 44 per cent in 1972 to 39 per cent in 1973.116.	In the face of the present economic situation  it is essential and indeed urgent for all developed countries to commit themselves resolutely to maintain the quantity and quality of their government assistance and to meet the goals set within the timetable established by the International Development Strategy  particularly with respect to assistance to those countries most affected by the present crisis. An appeal should be made to the developed countries to live up to their commitments and make a substantial contribution to restoring the resources of the AID Program and to UNDF  which plays a remarkable role in respect of technical assistance and pre-investment.117.	With respect to the international monetary system  we are obliged to note also that restoration of monetary stability does not seem to be in sight yet. It is essential that member States of IMF should consider all necessary measures to put an end to the activities of international speculators  whose manipulations condemn us to ever-increasing fluctuations that dangerously dislocate the fragile economies of the developing countries.118.	Inflation continues its corrosive effects and it is more necessary than ever to combine every effort to strangle inflation; if we do not do this  the export earnings of the developing countries will continue to be drained off towards the developed countries for the purchase of industrial products at exorbitant prices. In almost all of the developed countries the rate of increase in prices was between 9 and 15 per cent in 1974. Some of them have already reached the level of 20 per cent. The over-all rate of inflation in the developing countries must inevitably limit their payments capacity and possibilities of acquiring a public debt.119.	With respect to the reform of the monetary system  there are grounds for satisfaction in the modest progress accomplished by the IMF ad hoc Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues  and in particular its decision to define the ""unit"" of the future monetary system  in terms of special drawing rights  on the basis no longer of gold or the dollar but rather on a ""basket"" of several currencies  each with a given weight. The definition of this new world monetary unit will gradually lead us to give gold and the dollar their proper place in the future monetary system.120.	In any case  my delegation feels that the framework for discussion and negotiation should provide for greater participation by the developing countries through their specially appointed representatives. We think that the new system will be very short-lived if it does not draw the necessary lessons from the erosion and downfall of the old international monetary system. The new system should take due account of the needs and concerns of the developing countries  in particular through the long-awaited setting up of a link between the special drawing rights and additional financing for development.121.	The industrial growth of the developing countries has continued to be characterized by considerable fluctuations  and by the inability of these countries to achieve sustained and continued progress. The fundamental reason for this is the instability of world trade  with sharp rises in the prices of industrial raw materials  as well as intermediary products and capital goods imported from the developed countries.122.	The industrialization strategy founded on import substitution applied by many of the developing countries gave rise to an industrial structure dependent on imports from industrial countries  which has served only to perpetuate the subjugation of the third world.123.	The Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization [UNIDO] will provide an opportunity for an examination in detail of the substantive problems which are frustrating the efforts of the developing countries to provide themselves with an industrial infrastructure. That Conference will have to give due consideration to the measures in favor of the least developed of the developing countries. It would be well to implement the recommendations already formulated within the framework of the special measures  as recommended at the time of the second Conference of the African Ministers of Industry. As of now  we should adopt new industrial growth targets for the least developed countries  as recommended in the relevant provisions of the Strategy. In addition to the objective of a 6 per cent annual growth in gross domestic product and an 8 per cent growth in the manufacturing sector  the Strategy recommends a higher target of 7 per cent for gross domestic product and 10 per cent for the manufacturing sector of the least developed countries.124.	In the field of transport  Upper Volta has suffered seriously from the consequences of the almost continuing rise in the cost of transit and in maritime freight rates. In 1972  additional transport costs rose to almost 20 per cent of the value of our imports and 10 per cent of the value of our exports. The additional costs  due to our lack of a coastline  are estimated at one third of the assistance deceived in the form of gifts. Since the crises of 1973-1974  transport rates have increased between 15 and 30 per cent; thus one third of the cost of certain mass consumption goods reflects transport costs.125.	Upper Volta welcomes the adoption  on 6 April 1974  of the Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences. This Convention is very timely  and should put an end to methods of decision-making which have become absolutely intolerable for the developing countries: the absolute secrecy surrounding the establishment of freight rates; the arbitrary raising of the general level of freight rates without prior notice; and the inability of Governments or the competent authorities to intervene to safeguard their trade interests. For a country like our own  which is already beset by appalling difficulties  the transport problem gave an added dimension to those difficulties. That is why we would have hoped that the Convention would deal more explicitly with the granting of special freight rates favoring the exports and imports of the developing  land-locked countries.126.	However  at the present stage of developments in this area  Upper Volta is prepared to support the provisions contained in that Convention  in the firm hope that the specific concerns of the land-locked countries will be duly taken into account at the first conference to revise that Convention  and in the instruments of application or any other instruments that may be adopted in this field.127.	Upper Volta has devoted special attention to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held under the auspices of the United Nations at Caracas from 20 June to 29 August 1974. In this general effort to codify a new legal order  our position continues as always to be guided by General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) of 17 December 1970  declaring the sea ""the common heritage of mankind"". That is why we firmly support the principle of the establishment of an international authority representing all the States which would undertake the exploitation and direct management of the resources of this heritage on behalf of all mankind; the resulting benefits should be distributed equitably among States  with due regard for the needs of the developing countries  particularly the land-locked countries  which should be given special treatment. We must ensure that history does not repeat itself  and that we do not replace an unjust system by a new system that is even more unjust  where the costs would be paid only by the poor countries. For this reason  with a view to justice and equity  the land-locked countries should be given the greatest possible guarantees  based on the following minimum priorities: the right of access to the sea and the zone of the sea-bed; and the right to transit without restriction or discrimination on the part of the transit country.128.	The entire world is awaiting the forthcoming session in Geneva of a new conference on the law of the sea to enable all countries  large or small  land-locked or coastal States  to profit fully from the re-sources of the sea-bed.129.	Turning now to co-operation among the developing countries  recent studies in this field show quite clearly how important and useful it is for the international community actively to foster this type of co-operation  which offers a new dimension in co-operation for development. In our opinion  the recommendations of the Working Group on Technical Co-operation between Developing Countries provide a very creative and promising framework. Upper Volta will spare no effort to see these recommendations implemented  thus making it possible to strengthen further the ties of co-operation among all countries  and in particular among the developing countries. We hope that the United Nations system will be able to adapt itself to this new requirement which is in the short- and long-term interest of all.130.	The problems which beset our community and in particular its most vulnerable members cannot and must not cause us to lose hope. We have the necessary imagination and material resources: all that is needed is that we all arm ourselves with the indispensable political determination to solve these problems in order to advance resolutely towards the building of a moral and material world worthy of our generation. It was in this spirit that the United Nations was conceived: it is in this spirit that this session of the General Assembly must work for the dawning of a better world."
"11",609,"BGD",29,1974,"Today as I stand before this Assembly I share with you profound satisfaction that the 75 million people of Bangladesh are now represented in this Parliament of Man. For the Bangalee nation this is a historic moment  marking the consummation of the struggle to vindicate its right of self-determination. The Bangalee people have fought over the centuries so that they may secure for themselves the right to live in freedom and with dignity as free citizens of a free country. They have aspired to live in peace and friendship with all the nations of the world. The noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are the very ideals for which millions of our people have made the supreme sacrifice. I know that the souls of our martyrs join us in pledging that the Bangalee nation fully commits itself to the building of a world order in which the aspiration of all men for peace and justice will be realized.3.	It is particularly gratifying that Bangladesh has been admitted to this Assembly when its presidency has been assumed by one who has been active in the fight for freedom. I recall  Mr. President  the valuable contribution made by you to the success of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers in September of last year.4.	I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to salute all those whose sacrifices have earned for Bangladesh a place in the comity of nations. I express our deep sense of gratitude to all those nations and peoples that supported Bangladesh in its struggle. We should also like to thank all those who have been rendering valuable assistance to Bangladesh in consolidating our independence  in reconstructing our war-ravaged land and in meeting the formidable challenge of building a better future for our people. To all those who have welcomed us into the United Nations  I offer the most sincere thanks of the people of Bangladesh.5.	The very struggle of Bangladesh symbolized the universal struggle for peace and justice. It was  therefore  only natural that Bangladesh  from its very inception  should stand firmly by the side of the oppressed people of the world. The experience of a quarter of a century since the United Nations was established has shown how a relentless struggle in pursuit of these ideals has had to be waged against daunting odds. The right of self-determination which the Charter of the United Nations promised could be redeemed only through the supreme sacrifice of millions of valiant freedom fighters in Asia  Africa and Latin America. The struggle still continues against the illegal occupation of territory by aggression  against the use of force to negate the legitimate rights of peoples  and against the practice of racial discrimination and apartheid. Great victories have been won in Algeria  in Viet Nam  in Bangladesh and in Guinea-Bissau. Such victories prove that history is on the side of the people and that justice ultimately triumphs.6.	But injustice and oppression persist in many parts of the world. Our Arab brethren are still fighting for the complete liberation of all illegally occupied territories  and the legitimate national rights of the people of Palestine have yet to be restored. The process of decolonization  though greatly advanced  has yet to reach its ultimate goal. This is particularly true in Africa  where the heroic peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia are still engaged in a grim struggle for freedom and national liberation. Apartheid  which this Assembly has repeatedly declared to be a crime against humanity  continues to outrage the conscience of man.7.	While the legacy of injustice from the past has to be liquidated  we are confronted by the challenges of the future. Today the nations of the world are faced with critical choices. Upon the wisdom of our choice will depend whether we will move towards a world haunted by the fear of total destruction  threatened by nuclear war  faced with the aggravation of human suffering on a horrendous scale  and marked by mass starvation  unemployment and the wretchedness of deepening poverty  or whether we can look forward to a world where human creativity and the great achievements of our age in science and technology will be able lo shape a better future free from the threat of nuclear war and based upon a sharing of technology and resources on a global scale  so that men everywhere can begin to enjoy the minimal conditions of a decent life.8.	The great economic upheavals that have recently shaken the entire world should generate a sense of urgency for building a just international economic order. The sixth special session of the General Assembly earlier this year took note of the grave implications of the present international economic situation. Speaking for a country which heads the list of those described as being most severely affected by the current economic situation  I can only underline how grievous those effects are. Bangladesh  which was born on the ruins of a devastating war  has  ever since liberation  been plagued by a series of natural disasters  the latest one being the unprecedented floods we have experienced this year. We are grateful to the United Nations and its agencies and to the Secretary-General for their active interest in helping Bangladesh to meet the situation. President Boumediene and Foreign Minister Bouteflika of Algeria have appealed to the non- aligned countries to come forward to help Bangladesh. Friendly countries and humanitarian organizations all over the world have been responding positively. These natural calamities not only have impeded the march of Bangladesh towards economic progress  but have also left the country in a state of near-famine conditions. At the same time global inflation has meant  for a country such as ours  a balance-of-payments gap in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. Translated into terms of human suffering  this means that people with a meagre annual per capita income of less than $100 are now faced with the prospect of a severe reduction in even their current subsistence level of living. People who are consuming less than the minimum considered by WHO to be necessary for mere survival now face starvation. The forecast for the future of the poorer countries is even more gloomy. Food grains  of which the developed industrial nations are the main exporters  are gradually getting out of the reach of the poorer countries as a result of steadily increasing prices. Efforts to attain self-sufficiency in food production are also being severely affected because of rising costs and the growing scarcity of vital agricultural inputs. Side by side with this  as a result of the global inflation which not only has increased by many times the cost of development projects but has also adversely reduced their ability to mobilize their own resources  countries already faced with grinding poverty and massive unemployment are threatened with dire possibilities of cutbacks in their modest development plans envisaging growth rates of 5 to 6 per cent per annum 9.	Unless the nations of the world can concert their action to meet this situation  human misery will be aggravated on a scale unknown in history. Indeed  there would be no recorded parallel of such human misery having to be endured by so many side by side with such unprecedented levels of affluence and prosperity enjoyed by so few. Only a regeneration of the feeling of human solidarity and brotherhood and an acknowledgment of interdependence can bring about a rational solution and the urgent action needed to avoid this catastrophe.10.	No greater challenge has been faced by the United Nations than that of marshalling the forces of reason to bring about a just international economic order. That order not only must ensure the sovereignty of each State over its natural resources  but also should seek to establish a framework of international co-operation based upon recognition of the overriding common interest of the countries of the world in a stable and just economic system. This is the moment when we must reaffirm in unequivocal terms that there is an international responsibility to ensure that everyone everywhere should enjoy the economic  social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality  as guaranteed to him by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This responsibility  according to the Universal Declaration  should extend to ensuring to everyone the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of him-self and his family.11.	We are fully conscious that the current economic crisis can be dealt with only in an environment of peace  international amity and understanding. In this context  urgent measures to control the present arms race assume special importance not only for the creation of such an environment but also for releasing for the common good of mankind the massive resources currently being wasted on armaments.12.	Bangladesh  from its very inception  has adopted a non-aligned foreign policy based upon the principles of peaceful coexistence and of friendship towards all. Our total commitment to peace is born of the realization that only an environment of peace would enable us to enjoy the fruits of our hard-won national independence and to mobilize and concentrate all our energies and resources in combating the scourges of poverty  hunger  disease  illiteracy and unemployment.13.	We therefore welcome every effort aimed at advancing the process of detente  relaxation of tension  limitation of armaments and the promotion of peaceful coexistence in every part of the world  whether in Asia  Africa  Europe or Latin America. In pursuance of this policy we have consistently supported the concept of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean area  which has received the powerful endorsement of this Assembly [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We have also supported the concept of South-East Asia as a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality.14.	We believe that the nations of the emerging world assembled in the non-aligned conferences provide powerful support for the cause of peace. These nations have reaffirmed the common determination of the overwhelming majority of the people of the world to preserve national independence and to promote peace and justice.15.	Peace is an imperative for the survival of mankind; it represents the deepest aspirations of men and women throughout the world. Peace to endure must  however  be peace based upon justice.16.	Consistent with our own total commitment to peace  we have striven to promote the process of reconciliation in our own subcontinent. It was our firm belief that the emergence of Bangladesh would materially contribute towards the creation of a structure of peace and stability in our subcontinent and that the confrontation and strife of the past could be replaced by relations of friendship and co-opera- lion for the welfare of all our peoples. Not only have we developed good-neighbourly relations with our immediate neighbours  India  Burma and Nepal  but we have also striven to turn away from the past and to open a new chapter in our relations with Pakistan.17.	We have spared no effort to liquidate the legacies of the past  and made our ultimate contribution by granting clemency even to those 195 prisoners of war against whom there was overwhelming evidence of their having committed grave crimes  including crimes against humanity. This was our investment towards the opening of a new chapter and towards the building of a future of peace and stability in our tormented subcontinent. In doing this we insisted on no preconditions  nor did we seek to strike any bargain  for we were influenced only by the vision of a better future for all our peoples.18.	We look forward to the solution of other outstanding problems in a spirit of fair play and mutual accommodation. The plight of the 63 000 Pakistani families who have reaffirmed their allegiance to Pakistan and have registered themselves with the International Committee of the Red Cross for repatriation to their country remains a pressing humanitarian problem. Not only is their right to be repatriated to the country to which they retain allegiance based on the strongest foundations of law and inter-national agreement  but the dictates of humanity call for an urgent solution of their problem.19.	The just division of the assets of former Pakistan is the other problem which awaits urgent solution. Bangladesh for its part was  and remains  ready to move forward towards reconciliation. We expect that  in the overriding interest of the welfare of the peoples of the subcontinent  Pakistan will reciprocate by coming forward to solve these outstanding problems in a spirit of fair play and mutual accommodation so that the process of normalization can be carried to a successful conclusion.20.	Bangladesh will continue to strive for good-neighbourly relations with all of its neighbours on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  and non-interference in one another's internal affairs. We will continue to support every move that seeks to promote peace in our region and in the world.21.	In a world that is marked by strife and human misery  the United Nations remains the focus of man's hope for the future. Despite the many difficulties and obstacles placed in its way  the United Nations  during the more than quarter-century of its existence  has significantly contributed to human progress in the political  economic  social and cultural fields. There are few countries in the world that have a better realization than Bangladesh of the concrete achievements and potential for good of the Organization. It was under the inspired leadership of Mr  Kurt Waldheim and his able and dedicated colleagues that the United Nations mounted a major relief and reconstruction programme in our country to heal the wounds of war  to restore the productive capacity of our war-ravaged economy and to rehabilitate millions of returning refugees from India  who had had to take shelter there during our struggle for liberation. To the Secretary-General  the members of his staff and the various humanitarian agencies that contributed to the success of that gigantic operation  I should like to express the sincere gratitude of the Government and people of Bangladesh. We are confident that the same constructive leadership will be forthcoming from the United Nations in the solution of the remaining humanitarian problems in the subcontinent.22.	As I mentioned earlier  we are grateful to the United Nations for its efforts in mobilizing assistance in aid of the victims of the current catastrophic floods in Bangladesh. As a country which has repeatedly been exposed to the ravages of natural calamities  Bangladesh has a special stake in the creation of an institutional arrangement by which the international community can move effectively to meet and prevent such calamities. Indeed a beginning  though modest  has already been made in this respect by the establishment of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator. However  in order that it can effectively play the role assigned to it  there is an imperative need to strengthen the organization. The Members of the United Nations have a special responsibility to concert their efforts for the achievement of this objective.23.	I should like to conclude by reaffirming my faith in the indomitable spirit of man - in the capacity of the people to achieve the impossible and to overcome insurmountable odds. This is the faith that sustains nations like us that have emerged through struggle and sacrifice. Our nations may suffer  but they can never die. In facing the challenge of survival  the resilience and determination of the people is an ultimate strength  our goal is self-reliance; our chosen path is the united and collective efforts of our people. International co-operation and the sharing of resources and technology could  no doubt  make our task less onerous and reduce the cost in human suffering. But for us in the emerging world  ultimately we must have faith in ourselves and in our capacity  through the united and concerted efforts of our peoples  to fulfil our destiny and to build for ourselves a better future."
"12",655,"BGR",29,1974,"Mr. President  allow me  on behalf of the delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  to congratulate you on your election to the post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. We are pleased that the election to that high and responsible post has fallen to the representative of the friendly Algerian people  with whom the Bulgarian people have been closely linked since the years of their heroic struggle for freedom and national independence.39.	We cannot fail to note with satisfaction that in the period following the twenty-eighth session the process of detente has continued to develop and that the ice which gripped international relations has begun to thaw. The principles of independence  equality and peaceful coexistence are increasingly asserting themselves as a norm of international life. Arbitrariness and diktat in relations among States are being rejected by the peoples as a political anachronism. Political consultations between the leaders of States  international negotiations and meetings and conferences aimed at resolving urgent issues of our times are being used more widely and efficiently. There exist red possibilities for the world to enter a new era  one of a stable peace and the reconstruction of present-day international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.40.	In Europe the foundations of a promising system of security and co-operation are being laid down. Favorable conditions have been created for the successful completion of the work of the second stage of the Conference on Security and Coroperation in Europe and for the third  concluding  phase to be held at the highest level as soon possible. That Conference  which is in itself an unprecedented event in the history of the old continent  has been rendered possible thanks to the new political and moral-psychological atmosphere in Europe. There can be no doubt that the strengthening of security and the development of comprehensive co-operation in the region are among the main trends in the process of detente in the world.41.	The results of the third meeting between the leaders of the  Soviet Union and the United States represent a significant new contribution to the further improvement of the. international climate. The Bulgarian Government and people have welcomed with deep satisfaction the signature by those two States of agreements on a number of important contemporary matters. The agreements aimed at preventing a world thermonuclear catastrophe are of special significance. We are profoundly convinced that the positive changes in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union are in the interests of all States and peoples  as well as in the interest of universal peace.42.	The breaking of the so-called sanitary cordon around Cuba is yet another of the striking facts which characterize a turning away from cold war towards an ever wider affirmation of the principles of peaceful coexistence.43.	One of the first and last bastions of fascism and colonialism in Europe has collapsed. The long heroic struggle of the peoples of Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique and Angola and of the revolutionary and democratic forces in Portugal has been crowned with success.  Against the background of that victory  it is increasingly evident that the military junta in Chile  which is trying to prevent the social development of that country by Fascist methods condemned by history  is doomed. History has also condemned those reactionary circles which are trying today here and there  with the help of neo-fascism and neo-nazism  to stifle the struggle for freedom  democracy and social progress.44.	Events in Portugal have also shown that our planet is ridding itself of the last vestiges of centuries of colonial oppression. However  we have no right to forget that there are still peoples who are under the colonial yoke. Our organization can and must continue to play an active role in the final elimination of colonialism  racism and apartheid. The delegation Of the People's Republic of Bulgaria expresses the hope that the Assembly at its present session will not lose the opportunity to adopt appropriate measures to implement definitively and as early as possible the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  adopted at the fifteenth session of the General Assembly [resolution 1514 (XV)] on the initiative of the Soviet Union.45.	The relaxation of tension also provides favorable conditions for the further intensification of the struggle of the non-aligned countries against neo-colonialism and for their national and social development free from imperialist bondage. The countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America are no longer parts of the world which imperialism used. to consider as its own backyard. They now constitute  a world of independent sovereign States  representing a new dynamic factor in international relations. 46.	I have dwelt on these well-known facts in order to stress once more that the process of detente in the international political climate continues. However  in order that that process may be further strengthened and deepened and that it may be made all-embracing and irreversible  the efforts of all States are needed. Those efforts should be aimed first and foremost at eliminating the still-existing hotbeds of tension in various parts of the world.47.	The position of the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria with respect to the situation in the Middle East  in Viet Nam and in Korea is well known. I shall therefore confine myself to describing briefly how  in our opinion  the issues that are as yet unresolved should be settled.'48.	In the Middle East  it is necessary to put an end to the provocation by Israeli militaristic circles of the neighboring Arab countries and to resume without delay the work of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East. Israel must withdraw its troops from all Arab territories occupied in 1967. The legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine must be respected. The security  territorial integrity and sovereignty of all States in that part of the world must be guaranteed.49.	In Viet Nam  it is essential strictly to implement the Paris Agreement of 1973 on Viet Nam  to halt the provocative military actions of the Saigon regime  and to remove the discrimination against the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam.50.	In Korea  it is necessary to dissolve the so- called United Nations Command in Korea and to withdraw all foreign troops from South Korea. The General Assembly should adopt an appropriate resolution to that effect.51.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria  situated at the heart of the Balkan peninsula  has always attached and will continue to attach prime importance to the problems of peace  security and cooperation in that part of Europe. Our Government has made and is making a good many efforts to create an atmosphere of confidence and neighborly relations among the Balkan States and peoples. That is not a short-term policy. We have been pursuing that very policy consistently and unwaveringly for 30 years now. We are deeply convinced that it is in keeping with the interests and aspirations not only of the Bulgarian peQple but also of all the peoples living in the Balkan peninsula.52.	In this period a number of mutually advantageous agreements between Bulgaria and its neighbors have been signed  agreements aimed at closer cooperation in the fields of economy  trade  culture  science  sport and tourism. The prerequisites for a lasting political detente in the Balkans have gradually been created. However  a dangerous military conflict flared up in our region recently. The interference of certain NATO circles in Cyprus has created a situation which seriously threatens not only the territorial integrity and independence of that country but also peace and security in the Balkans and the world over. 53.	The People's Republic of Bulgaria is following with attention and alarm the development of events in Cyprus. In accordance with its peaceful policy  the Bulgarian Government  immediately after the coup against the legitimate Government of Cyprus  reaffirmed its position: it advocates the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the island  to preserve the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and to allow the people the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots the right to settle their problems by themselves.54.	That position of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has also determined our support for the resolutions of the Security Council calling for a cease-fire in Cyprus  the withdrawal of foreign troops  the preservation of the island's independence and territorial integrity  and the restoration of constitutional order in the Republic of Cyprus. As is known  however  tension still persists in Cyprus and in the surrounding area. The threat of new complications and military conflicts  of overt or covert partition of the island  has not been removed. The attempts to resolve the Cyprus question within the narrow framework of the existing ""system of guarantees"" provided under the London-Zurich Agreements have met with failure.55.	That is why we support the proposal of the Soviet Union for the convening of an international conference within the framework of the United Nations to discuss the Cyprus problem.1 That proposal is in keeping with the spirit of the goals and principles of the Organization. It is precisely such a conference  with the participation of Greece  Turkey  Cyprus and the members of the Security Council and possibly ( some other States as well  that can perhaps find a solution that will ensure  on a genuine and lasting basis  the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus  which could best be guaranteed by the permanent members of the Security Council.56.	Our position on the Cyprus question and also on relations among the Balkan States was again. stated clearly and unambiguously by the President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  Todor Zhivkov  in his report on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the victory of the socialist revolution in our country. He stated:""We insist that the sovereignty and independence of the friendly State of Cyprus be respected and most sincerely desire our neighbors Greece and Turkey to live in peace and understanding with each other and with independent Cyprus. More than once the peoples of the Balkan peninsula have served as cannon fodder for the interests of the imperialist States. Socialist Bulgaria is doing its best and will continue to do its best to achieve new relations in the Balkans and good-neighborly relations and co-operation in the interests of peace in the world.""57.	The efforts of the Bulgarian Government concerning the correct settlement of the Cyprus question are prompted also by our desire to establish a lasting peace in the region of the eastern Mediterranean. As a Black Sea country  Bulgaria is naturally linked with that region. That explains our interest in all that is happening there. We are concerned about the existing network of NATO bases in the eastern Mediterranean  the carrying out of naval maneuvers by the Western States in immediate proximity to our frontiers  the existence of nuclear ammunition and so on. In accordance with our consistently peaceful policy  we want to see the Mediterranean turned into a sea of peace and international co-operation. That is why we welcome the proposal of the Soviet Union for the withdrawal from the Mediterranean of all United States and Soviet vessels and submarines equipped with nuclear weapons. The adoption of that proposal would be in the interest of peace in that part of the* world.58.	It has become urgent to use political detente for the practical solution of the problems of disarmament. Both processes  detente and disarmament alike  can and should be mutually complementary.59.	Guided by that understanding  the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria attaches exclusive importance to the consideration of disarmament questions in all forums  particularly within the framework of the United Nations. The People's Republic of Bulgaria is prepared  within its means  to continue to contribute to their practical solution.60.	It is an indisputable fact that it is the Soviet Union which has been doing the most in this respect. The Soviet Government has introduced a number of proposals on the questions of disarmament in the United Nations. On its initiative a number of important international agreements have been worked out and concluded  such as the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex)  the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction mi the Sea-Bed and the .Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof [resolution 2660 (XXV)}  and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)  annex] 61.	On the proposal of the Soviet Union a new item  aimed at curbing the arms race  was included in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly  namely  the item entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human well-being and health"" [item 103]. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria supports this important initiative and considers that the conclusion of an international convention on this question will help to prevent the manufacturing of new means of warfare and will help to preserve the environment as well. 62.	It was also on the initiative of the Soviet Union that a number of resolutions on questions related to disarmament have been adopted at previous sessions of the General Assembly  such as those on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]  the convening of a World Disarmament Conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)]  the reduction of military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)]  and others. The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria unreservedly supports these initiatives and insists on their practical implementation as soon as possible.63.	The agreements signed between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States in the past three years have provided favorable conditions for reaching new concrete agreements within the United Nations in the field of disarmament. We are confident that  if efforts are made by all States in this direction  new and more significant successes can be achieved soon in the sphere of effective disarmament.64.	We are aware that the problems of disarmament are among the most complicated ones of the present day and that their practical solution runs into the stubborn resistance of the military-industrial complex and of other forces which are not interested in detente. But experience shows that if there is goodwill on the part of the Governments concerned  a solution of these problems also can be ""found. On the other hand  there can be no doubt that the lack of concrete results in the field of disarmament can undermine the advancing political detente and can lead to a new sharpening of the international situation  with many and more dangerous repercussions. That is why it is imperative for our Organization to keep these questions in the focus of its attention and to assist actively in the taking of steps aimed at curbing and halting the arms race and at achieving general and complete disarmament.65.	The positive changes in political relations among States create exclusively favorable conditions for expanding and furthering economic ties  for solving a number of economic problems of great importance to the whole world/ For its part  economic co-operation furnishes that material foundation which can strengthen confidence and understanding among peoples and can consolidate peace and security in the world. Life itself shows that raising and discussing the questions of development in isolation from the issues of ensuring lasting peace and co-operation is profitable only to those who try to preserve their privileged position in the present international division of labor.66.	One of the positive results of the sixth special session of the General Assembly is undoubtedly the recognition by the international community of the necessity to create a new structure of international economic relations which is to take into account the interests of all countries and particularly those of the developing countries. These problems affect the entire international community. Solving them cannot be the privilege of a group of States or of individual international organizations. That has to be done through - the equal participation of all countries.67.	Just two weeks ago our people celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the victory of the socialist revolution in Bulgaria. In the course of three decades our homeland  which before that had been a classical example of a backward country  has turned into an all-round developed  prosperous socialist State with a rapidly developing economy  scientific capacity  technology and culture. In the past thirty years radical structural changes have been carried out in the economy  such as an agrarian reform and collectivization of the land  and nationalization of the means of production and of all natural resources  as well as of foreign capital. The country's internal resources have been harnessed. The working class  co-operative farmers and the people's intelligentsia have worked self-denyingly to build the new life. The Bulgarian Communist Party  which is the leading force in our society  has carried out immense organizational and political activities. These achievements are also the result of fraternal mutual assistance and close co-operation with the other countries of the socialist community  and first of all with the Soviet Union.68.	The victory of the  socialist revolution radically changed both the placQ and the role of our country in international relations. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has established itself as an inseparable part of the socialist community. Its foreign policy is inspired by the ideas of peace and friendship among nations. Its task is to assist the development of all- round co-operation among all countries and nations.69.	The delegation of the People's Republic of Bulgaria notes with satisfaction that the United Nations is making its significant contribution to the development of positive changes in the world  that its prestige is growing and that the part which this Organization  and the Security Council in particular  can play in ensuring lasting peace and security is becoming a tangible one.70.	An analysis of the events of the past few years shows unequivocally that the efforts aimed at achieving a solution of the major problems of the present-day world can be successful and can lead to lasting results only when the search for a solution in conducted on the basis of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Any departure from these principles has always led to complications and has seriously hampered the efforts of peace-loving forces to achieve a just settlement of the disputes and conflicts that have arisen. All this eloquently shows once more the vital force of the principles of the Charter as well as the necessity to step up the efforts of the Organization to create conditions for their strict observance.71.	We are profoundly convinced that the present twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will be able to adopt such decisions on the main items of the agenda  decisions that will represent a new contribution to the strengthening and expansion of the positive changes that are now taking place in contemporary international life."
"13",700,"BHR",29,1974,"It is a pleasure for me to speak from this rostrum to welcome the Heads and members of the delegations of States represented in this august Assembly. It is my great hope that our meetings at the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will be fruitful and produce great results commensurate with our aspirations to create an atmosphere of permanent peace and security in our world for the good and welfare of man.91.	Permit me on this occasion to compliment my colleague and friend Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  the President of the General Assembly for this session  who has often been with us in most international assemblies and conferences. It gives me great pleasure  in the name of my country  to express to you  Sir  my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session. We have known you as a freedom fighter  a pioneer liberator and a statesman of the first caliber. As this session will see the liquidation of some of the last vestiges of colonialism; your election to the presidency is an indication of the direction the Assembly will be taking. I am quite confident that all sincere efforts and activities at this session will be crowned with success under your leadership.92.	I should not fail to express on this occasion my appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Leopoldo Benites  the President of the twenty-eighth session  under whose wise leadership and ceaseless efforts positive results were achieved and benefits were produced for humanity on more than one occasion and more than one place  despite all the obstacles and difficulties that arose at that session.93.	It gives me great pleasure also  in the name of the State of Bahrain  to congratulate and welcome the delegations of the new Member States of Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada  which are participating with us for the first time in the work of the General Assembly at this session.94.	At the beginning of my statement  I should like to refer to the Assembly's decision to introduce Arabic as the sixth official language of the United Nations [resolution 3191 (XXVIII)]. That decision is a source of gratification to us.95.	There can be no doubt that our world today is passing through an era of transition. The speed with which events and interrelations among States are developing has led us to a juncture where we have to choose between confrontation and co-operation and between local conflicts and co-ordination. We have to choose between order and sanity or emotion and violence  which lead to crises and catastrophes. Needless to say  we cannot resort to confrontation and conflict  on the one hand  and ask for mutual co-operation  on the other. We can no longer afford to pursue our self-interest without more world-wide co-operation. The solidarity and co-operation of the family of nations for the good and welfare of man is the only guarantee for the establishment of close and strong relations among nations in our world.96.	Since the last session of the General Assembly  important and consequential events have occurred that have had grave international repercussions. The most important of these was the war that broke out in the Middle East in October 1973 and that was about to lead to a grave international confrontation which would have undermined world peace and security. As a result of the continuation of Israeli aggression  Israel's refusal to implement the resolutions of the United Nations and its persistence in occupying lands by force  a war broke out that could have involved the whole area but for the wisdom of the United Nations  which  through the resolutions of the Security Council  hastened to put an end to Israeli aggression and to the massacre of innocent people.97.	I will now speak about the question of Palestine. The initial steps in the search for a just settlement of the cause of the  Palestinian people  who were ousted from their land and forced to live for more than 26 years in camps which  by twentieth-century standards  are unfit for habitation by any human being  are now being  taken. That people is still subjected to the most odious measures of oppression by Israel  measures directed either against those Palestinians who refused to leave their land  or against those who took shelter in camps in neighboring Arab countries. The latter group is daily facing a war of annihilation and destruction waged by Israel  which is arrogating to itself the role of watchman and aiming at the extermination of the original owners of the land  with the intention  in this twentieth century  of establishing a State on the soil  and at the expense  of the people whom it has dispersed.98.	I should emphasize that  despite the difficulties and obstacles which Israel tried to create  we see for the first time in more than 25 years that we are on the road to peace as a result of the awareness of the Members of our international Organization of the problems facing the world and their determination to solve them.99.	Security Council resolutions 338 (1973) and 340 (1973)  which were passed towards the end of the last October war  came as a natural result of the struggle and efforts of peace-loving nations for the establishment of a durable and just peace in the Middle East to safeguard the lawful rights of the Palestinian people in their homes and on their land. The forces of peace in the world  supported by the commendable efforts of non-aligned and peace- loving States and of the two great Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  succeeded in initiating an atmosphere favorable to a settlement and in maintaining confidence in the United Nations when such confidence was about to be lost in the area as a result of the inhuman Israeli aggression. On the eve of the convocation of the Geneva conference under the  auspices of the United Nations  represented by its Secretary-General  peace-loving nations are more than ever called upon to support and confirm the principles which have been laid down in United Nations resolutions ever since its inception.IM  The road to peace is arduous. At this stage the United Nations must confirm the principles previously proclaimed in its resolutions with regard to the Middle East. This  in our view  involves confirmation of the following: first  complete and unconditional withdrawal  which should commence immediately  from all Arab lands occupied by Israel during its aggression of June 1967  including the city of Jerusalem; secondly  assurance of the lawful rights of the people of Palestine in their home and land  and compensation for their losses.101.	I should point out here that what has been called for some time ""the Middle East question"" is in fact no more than the Palestine question. The attribution of the name ""Middle East"" to it is simply the result of the Israeli aggression  which extended to more than one State in the area. The heroic acts and sacrifices of the. Palestinian people have paved the way for it to establish its identity and assert its international personality. There can be no doubt that those who have the right to speak for the people of Palestine are their representatives.102.	I refer here with appreciation and gratitude to the decision taken by the 'Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which was held recently in the city of Caracas and which recognized that the Palestine liberation Organization [PLO] represented the people of Palestine. That decision was met with approval and appreciation by all peace- loving nations. That example deserves to be followed in order to reinstate justice and express disapproval of the policy of fait accompli based on suppression and force  contrary to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. As a first step on the way to a durable and just peace in the Middle East  we in this great Assembly should take a similar decision and invite the PLO to attend our meetings: we should listen to the voice of Palestine and the voice of the people of Palestine. If we do not take that step we shall remain far from the core of the problem and far from reaching a just and permanent solution.103.	Again  the question of Palestine is the case of a people whose land has been invaded and whose rights have been usurped. Surely the people of Palestine should have the same right as other peoples and States in the area to live in peace within recognized boundaries.104.	The initiative taken by President Boumediene  the teaser of the group of non-aligned States  in calling for the sixth special session of the General Assembly provided a new opportunity to enter into an informative  logical and calm dialog between the developing and the developed countries. That session provided an. early occasion seriously to discuss measures for development  prices  the problems of raw materials and basic materials  and the distribution of wealth in the world in order  to avoid Confrontation between developed and developing countries that is  between consuming and producing countries.105.	That session established one fact: namely  that the common interest of nations overlap and are interdependent. While-raw materials are used in advanced countries to develop their industries  the developing countries  which produce energy and raw materials  provide a vast market for the consumption of manufactured products.106.	The following are some of the important principles proclaimed in General Assembly resolution 3201 (S-VI): the sovereign equality of States; the right of self-determination of all peoples; the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force; territorial integrity; the right of every country to adopt the economic and social system it deems appropriate; and sovereignty over natural resources  including the right of nationalization. The resolution states further that the benefits of technological progress are not shared equitably by all members of the international community. The developing countries  which constitute 70 per cent of the world's population  account for only 30 per cent of the world's income. This makes the developed countries  in the course of time  grow richer and the developing countries grow poorer.107.	It is the great responsibility of the . United Nations to ensure the implementation of the principles of this new economic order which has been adopted by the vast majority of States. We understand the resolution to mean the following: first  financing economic and social development schemes in developing countries; and secondly  increasing investments in developing countries and providing them with expert knowledge and technical aid to improve their living standards and their economy.108.	I spoke here at the sixth special session [2219th meeting] almost six months ago about the importance of international co-operation within the United Nations for the solution of the problems of nations and States which may be exposed to risks. Our full realization that the individual interests of States are interconnected will confirm the importance of the effective role which our Organization can play in the political  economic or sociological sphere. Events have proved this fact. The move made by some advanced countries early this year with the aim of continuing to take advantage of the underdevelopment of raw-materials producing countries and exploiting the resources of developing countries for the benefit and well-being of their own peoples did not succeed  owing to the growth of awareness and solidarity among the producing countries and their determination to utilize the resources of the land for the good of humanity as a whole  as distinct from the individual selfish interests that prevailed in the past.	•109.	The developing and producing nations  which constitute the majority of the population of the world  need  more than others  to utilize their resources in order to raise the standards of living and promote the progress of human beings who have been dispossessed for many centuries past as a result of the rule and exploitation of foreign forces.110.	There are many countries  including my own  which depend essentially on one natural resource  namely oil  as do most countries in the Gulf. Since the early 1950s the natural resources of the third world have been exploited in an odious manner. The prices of raw materials were very low and the cost of manufactured goods was a great deal higher. The only beneficiaries were the industrialized countries. As I said at the sixth special session  the price of a barrel of oil was $US 2.10 in 1952  yet by 1971  nearly 20 years later  the price had come down to only $US 1.80. The exploiting companies started to increase production unreasonably  which brought about inflation in the exporting countries and an excess of currency liquidity.111.	To lay down a policy for the production of oil by producing countries means to us only one thing  irrespective of what others may say: it means that those countries have started to plan for the future and to lay the foundations for a self-sustained economy to support their development.112.	We have heard much during this session about the increase hi the price of oil. In fact  such increase has come as a natural result of the increase in the prices of basic materials. It is illogical to consider the prices of foodstuffs and basic raw materials without including the price of oil. When we speak about prices we should refer to the prices of all food and basic materials  including oil  and compare the increase in their prices as a whole. I would like  therefore  to refer again to the view which we expounded during the special session.113.	In order to stabilize world trade  oil and all other raw materials  as well as commodities and manufactures from the developed world  should be matched by an index reference  so that all items can have their intrinsic value relative to each other maintained. Prices of particular items of trade  such as oil  wheat  coffee  sugar  iron and copper  could then be adjusted by reference to the general level of prices in order to maintain the value of the particular item.114.	We therefore support the view calling for ""the initiation of a constructive dialog  within the United Nations  among countries which produce basic raw materials  for the purpose of laying down a clear policy to avert the danger that mankind may one day face an acute shortage of food and energy.115.	We should understand that the standards which existed until the early 1970s and which favored the industrialized countries and the monopolistic interests of the world are now changing to give the initiative to the countries which own the sources of energy and raw materials. Without realizing and accepting this fact  it will be difficult for a developed world and a poor and destitute world to coexist. Both worlds are of the same man and on the same planet  which belongs to us all and whose riches we should all equally share.116.. The United Nations will celebrate on 24 October this year World Development Information Day. Bahrain will participate in the celebration  as it attaches great importance to such an occasion for two reasons: first  because it is a developing country planning for the future through the development of its resources and the building up of its economy  and  secondly  because it is trying to follow up the process of development and to create a prosperous society in the country and for its people.117.	The development projects  which the State of Bahrain has started to implement are based on the principle of a free economy. This has encouraged many companies and international investors to operate and establish their business in the country. The State of Bahrain has provided many facilities as regards taxes and the establishment of an atmosphere of stability for Such companies. In pursuit of this policy  the State of Bahrain  which is now building its economy and developing its resources  has embarked on a scheme of industrialization as a first step towards achieving both commercial and industrial development and progress.118.	In addition  the State of Bahrain pays special attention to agricultural projects and the extension of the cultivable areas of land in the country. It has allocated large amounts of money to the installation of a big desalination plan and the increase of electric power. The State  in co-operation with the UNDP and its subregional Office in Bahrain  is proceeding quickly with various development activities in the agricultural  health and educational fields. Bahrain is very keen to develop and strengthen its economy in accordance with its plans to build a strong economy and to establish a proper standard of living for its people.119.	For us  as a developing country  our celebration of World Development Information Day this year is not a routine celebration. It is a celebration to probe the means to industrial and agricultural development and meet the many challenges that face small countries like ours. It is not the intention of such a celebration to harp on what we have achieved in this respect  but to find out what we have not achieved and what we should achieve to catch up with many countries of the world in this space age.120.	Our emphasis on the importance of industry and its development and the building of our national economy on a sound basis has led Us  in conjunction with sister Arab States  to open an Arab-European dialog through the Common Market to the benefit of all parties. We look forward to more aid arid expert knowledge from the United Nations  the specialized agencies and the advanced countries in this field. Our country is responsive to all efforts for the development of the world and the progress of the human race.121.	I am pleased to refer in this connexion to the decision taken by our Organization to establish the Economic Commission for Western Asia. It is an important and fruitful step  which reflects  at the same time  an understanding of the fact that some international standards and values are changing in favor of developing countries. The decisions and recommendations passed by the Committee are  in our view  the first step for such countries on a long journey towards catching up with the progress and development long since reached by many countries in the world.122.	The second session of the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea  held in Caracas  was the result of efforts made to regulate the exploitation of the resources of the high seas for the benefit of mankind as a whole and to eliminate the causes of friction between States arising from the exploitation of their natural sea resources. We look forward to a continuation of the efforts to solve the pressing problems in this field.123.	In the early days of the Conference  a spirit of compromise and understanding prevailed which enabled the Conference to formulate its rules of procedure by consensus within the prescribed time. During the general debate was almost a general consensus with regard to the main principles of some of the topics on the agenda of the Conference. Divergences of views and stands arose only later  when the details were discussed. This should not give rise to pessimism  considering the importance and complexities of the issues discussed and their effects on the economy of all States  particularly that of the developing countries. It is necessary for the success of the negotiations and the arrival at a fruitful and acceptable result at the forthcoming session of the Conference that such divergent views be reconsidered and that an attempt be made to narrow them down. It is not in the interest of anybody that the situation should remain as it is  as that may lead to conflicts and disputes over the resources of the sea and undermine the hopes we all entertain at present for the promotion of international economic co-operation.124.	The failure of the Conference to reach an agreement and formulate rules for the exploitation of the resources of the seas and oceans  and their utilization for the good of the human race as a while  is regrettable. It is hoped that such a failure will be transitory and that a universal and comprehensive agreement in this respect will be reached in the forthcoming session to be held in Geneva.125.	At the twenty-eighth session we supported the draft resolution concerning the declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace which became resolution 3080 (XXVIII). Such support arises primarily from our desire to protect the region from the devastation of a destructive war and to protect cur people from confrontations which are not in the interests of humanity or of the people of the region. This leads us to view with increasing concern some of the recent steps and developments in the area of the Middle East. I mean  particularly  the race for possession of nuclear weapons by some people in the area  with the assistance of the great nuclear Powers. Such steps are a threat to the peace and security of the area  which has been the victim of traditional wars during the current century and which still suffers them. The stockpiling  production and development of nuclear weapons is  first  a threat to the peace and security of the people of the area  and  second  a threat to world peace and a direct threat to human civilization and the aspirations of people for peace and for building their economy and civilization. Bahrain  therefore  supports the proposal submitted by Iran to declare the Middle East a nuclear-free area [A19693].126.	We view with great concern the occurrence of bloody events in Cyprus  which has suffered and still suffers from instability and the loss of innocent lives. The Middle East area  at the same time  is affected by what happens now in the island. We believe in the right of nations to self-determination and are concerned mainly to see that the freedom and independence of Cyprus is maintained. The threat of confrontation or \var in Cyprus  in our neighborhood  is a matter which deserves attention and quick action by the United Nations to contain these events. All interested parties should view the matter in a perspective that accords and fits in with the security and peace of the people of the area as a whole.127.	It is my pleasure in this respect to express my thanks to the Secretary-General for the constructive role he played in this crisis  and compliment him for the valuable efforts he has made in the service of the cause of peace in the world.128.	In conclusion  it is my hope that this session will succeed in attaining the goal we all seek -a world society in which peace  security and progress will prevail."
"14",810,"BLR",29,1974,"The delegation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic associates itself with the congratulations which have been addressed to the President of the twenty ninth session  Mr. Bouteflika  Foreign Minister of Algeria. We are sure he will conduct a well organized and effective session so that we can in due course take part in the adoption of important decisions to strengthen the cause of peace and cooperation on an equal footing among all States.43.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR has been following the general debate very closely. Now that it is drawing to a close  we can say with good reason that virtually all States highly appreciate the continuing process of international detente and ever increasing confirmation of the principle of peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems in the practice of international relations. The current year has brought new illustrations of the further strengthening of universal peace and international security and of the growth and cohesion of the forces of peace  socialism and progress and the deepening of their influence on the development of the international situation.44.	Detente is ever more confidently gaining ground  because powerful forces are working in its favor first of all  world socialism  which is exerting a decisive influence over the course of world events  and also the forces of national liberation and social progress  together with all peace-loving forces and public opinion that are actively working for the defense of the cause of peace. It should also be pointed out that Western leaders who are realistic in their thinking cannot fail to take into account the changed balance of forces in the world  and they acknowledge more and more that there can exist no other ground for relationships between States with different social systems than the principles of peaceful coexistence.45.	The developing countries approve of the relaxation of tension as the main trend in the development of events in the international arena. It is well known that the atmosphere of the cold war was a suitable source of nourishment for antidemocratic trends in international relations and for the suppression by imperialism of the interests and rights of the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America. The historic experience of those countries shows how important the fruitful and versatile activities of the socialist States are for them  those activities designed to put the relations between the opposing social systems on the road to peaceful coexistence and making detente irreversible. Detente creates the necessary prerequisites to the realization of the plans for building a new future.46.	The further improvement in the international climate is inseparably linked to the results of the third SovietAmerican summit meeting. The peoples of all countries without exception have every reason to experience satisfaction that the USSR and the United States have clearly confirmed their determination to continue the course envisaged by them in 1972 and 1973 and to do their best to diminish and ultimately to eliminate completely the risk of a military collision between the two countries which would be tantamount to a world nuclear war with catastrophic consequences for the whole of mankind. In addition to the treaties and agreements that have been concluded already  of which the agreement on the prevention of nuclear war is particularly important  the parties have agreed upon new practical measures with a view to limiting and curbing the arms race.47.	The fruitful development of bilateral relations between the States of the socialist community and France  the Federal Republic of Germany and other countries of the opposing social system and their joint quest for ways to settle important international problems have promoted the strengthening of international detente.48.	We stress with satisfaction the increasing role in international affairs of the nonaligned States and their anti-imperialist policy  their contribution to the struggle for detente  the struggle against war and aggression  the struggle for peace  national independence and social progress  their cooperation with the socialist States in the solution of important international problems. As experience has already shown  while deepening and expanding relations in a spirit of trust and solidarity  the socialist and developing States are able decisively to influence the development of the international situation in the interest of peace.49.	Some very important and welcome changes have occurred in Europe. A number of bilateral treaties and multilateral agreements concluded between the socialist and capitalist countries in recent years constitute a foundation for the political life of the continent in our era.50.	The successful completion of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe at the highest level is to play an immense role in bringing about a sharp turn for the better in relations between the European States and the strengthening of peace throughout Europe. For the Conference to be successful  it is first of all necessary that the basic principles of peaceful development of the continent should be clearly proclaimed and strengthened by the united will of all its participants  and that no one should try to slow down its work by submitting proposals incompatible with the principles of equality and noninterference in the domestic affairs of other countries.51.	Successful completion of the talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe on the basis of strict observance by all of the rule of undiminished security for each side would be a substantial contribution to the cause of political detente on the European continent and would supplement political detente by military detente.52.	The Byelorussian people ardently welcome efforts to strengthen European security. Thirty years ago  in July 1944  peace and freedom returned to Byelorussia. They were won at an unprecedently high cost  requiring unparalleled military feats and toil by the entire Soviet people. In the Byelorussian SSR alone  every fourth citizen perished; more than one half of the national wealth of the Republic was plundered or destroyed. While solemnly observing the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of the Byelorussian SSR from the German Nazi invaders  the working people of the Republic welcomed with satisfaction the award to our capital  the city of Minsk  of the glorious title of ""Heroic City"". They rejoiced at the results achieved in the construction of a communist society. In 1973  industrial production increased fold compared to the prewar period. This year  farmers have reaped 27.5 metric centers of grain for every hectare of grain crops. Science and culture have flourished  and the standard of living of the population has risen significantly.53.	We cherish the memory of the soldiers  partisans and underground workers who sacrificed their lives to secure freedom and independence for the Soviet Union and to save world civilization from the brown shirt plague; we are engaged in peaceful creative work  and we most emphatically insist that Europe should never in future be the source of a new world war or military conflict. We want a Europe that will be a continent of lasting peace and equitable cooperation.54.	The Byelorussian SSR feels that detente should not be limited to one part of the globe. It should extend to all areas of the world. The idea of creating collective security in Asia put forward by the Soviet Union is finding increasing favor. The putting into effect of that proposal is being promoted by new positive trends on the continent. It goes without saying that much still has to be done in this direction. It is necessary  first of ail  that problems arising between States should be settled by peaceful means  due account being taken of the legitimate rights and interests of all nations.55.	Adoption by the General Assembly without delay of a decision to withdraw all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations and cessation of interference in the domestic affairs of the Korean people would be an important contribution by the United Nations to the cause of relaxation of tension on the Asian continent.56.	There is no doubt that all I have said accords with the interests of those who truly want to strengthen peace and to work for peace. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States with different social systems for the solution of extremely important international questions is fully and entirely in accord with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and supplements its activities in implementing its main task: the strengthening of peace and international security.57.	As was shown by the general debate  it is no mere coincidence that such a trend of development in interState relations finds the widest support.and approval. Therefore no one in the United Nations takes seriously the wild theory about the so-called conspiracy of the two superPowers put forward by the opponents of the cause of peace  detente and equitable cooperation. The statement of the representative of China [2252nd meeting]  who since 1971 has repeated the same prefabricated cliches and utter inanities in the United Nations  reminds us of the situation of a blind man who has come up against a fence and cannot find his way round it.58.	Detente does not come of its own accord. It is a complicated process requiring constant and single minded political struggle  active joint endeavors of the peace-loving States and broad support for that course of action by the popular masses of all countries. ""We are firmly convinced""  said Comrade Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev  General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  several days ago  ""that the struggle for the strengthening of peace and for the enhancing and development of detente must never cease"". It is the untiring and consistent struggle for the strengthening of international security which the Soviet Union  in cooperation with other States of the socialist community  has been carrying out in implementing the program of peace put forward by the twenty fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  and which has become the banner of all peace loving forces.59.	In fighting for detente and developing relations with the capitalist countries on the basis of peaceful coexistence  the States of the socialist community at the same time consistently and firmly support the struggle of peoples for freedom and consolidation of national independence  against the forces of imperialism  reaction and aggression. Scores of African  Asian and Latin American States are experiencing the beneficial effect of the solidarity and support of the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist community in their struggle to consolidate their national independence.60.	The need to strengthen further the joint actions of all peace-loving States is all the more evident in that the reactionary and aggressive forces have not laid down their arms. The tragedy of the people of the Republic of Cyprus is an illustration of this. Who can remain indifferent when the military circles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] have embarked upon the materialization of plans hatched long in advance and directed against the Republic of Cyprus as a nonaligned State? It is inadmissible that Cyprus  a State Member of the United Nations  should lose its independence and territorial integrity  whether through foreign military interference or through the behind the scenes machinations of NATO.61.	Like other socialist States  the Byelorussian SSR has always been on the side of the people of Cyprus. Urgent and effective measures must be taken to safeguard the Republic of Cyprus from outside interference  to ensure the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory  to restore constitutional order in that country and to allow the Cypriots to decide their destiny by themselves. The Byelorussian SSR favors the realization of the proposal of the Soviet Union for the convening  within the framework of the United Nations  of an international conference to settle the problem of Cyprus. It is at such a conference that it will be possible to achieve an effective solution of the international aspects of this problem with the proper authoritative international guarantees. The Byelorussian SSR has resolutely advocated this fundamental position in the Security Council. The dispatch of a special mission of the Security Council to Cyprus would meet the policy of ensuring the existence of Cyprus as an independent  sovereign and territorially intact State.62.	For many years the self-sacrificing and heroic struggle against imperialist aggression by the peoples of IndoChina has benefited from constant and comprehensive assistance and support from the Soviet Union and other socialist.countries  and today we stand together with the peoples of Viet Nam  Laos and Cambodia.63.	The cessation of imperialist aggression in IndoChina and the conclusion of the Paris agreement on Viet Nam have created prerequisites for the consolidation of the turn away from war to peace  for the normalization of the situation in the IndoChinese peninsula and in SouthEast Asia as a whole. At the same time  we cannot but denounce resolutely the provocative activities of the Saigon Administration which  relying on the support of foreign forces  has been trying by every means possible to frustrate a political settlement in IndoChina. The Byelorussian SSR considers that the real way to strengthen peace and to normalize the situation in South Viet Nam lies in the strict and consistent fulfillment of the Paris agreements  a full ceasefire  the release of all detained military and civilian persons  the granting of full democratic rights to the population of South Viet Nam  the speedy conduct of negotiations between the two South VietNamese parties on the formation of a national council for reconciliation and concord with a view to creating favorable conditions for the holding of universal  genuinely free and democratic elections. This is the real way to strengthen peace and to normalize the situation in South Viet Nam.64.	The Byelorussian SSR favors the granting of the status of observer to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam.65.	More favorable conditions have been created for the struggle against imperialist aggression and the elimination of the hotbed of war in the Middle East  thanks to the active joint endeavors of the socialist States and nonaligned countries. Agreement on troop disengagement in the areas of the Sinai peninsula and the Golan Heights has been reached. However  these are only the first steps towards a settlement of the problem of the Middle East. It is not possible to permit the situation to be dealt with only by half measures  which is exactly what Israel and its protectors would like to see. Such a situation would be fraught with the dangers of a new military outbreak. The main issues of a political settlement in the Middle East are to be considered and solved at the Geneva Peace Conference which should resume its work as soon as possible. As is known  the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all occupied Arab territories and the elimination of the consequences of the Israeli aggression constitute the basis for a political settlement in the Middle East.66.	It goes without saying that the political settlement in the Middle East should guarantee the security and rights of all States and peoples in the area  including the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine  whose representatives must have a seat at the table of the Geneva negotiations as an independent party.67.	The Byelorussian SSR has supported the proposal of the Arab countries to consider the question of Palestine at the current' session of the General Assembly  and is a cosponsor of the draft resolution inviting the representatives of the PLO to participate in the discussion of this problem [AjL.736].68.	Today we are faced with a paradoxical situation in which real preparations for war continue while international tension is tangibly becoming relaxed. This is not only because of inertia but also because powerful imperialist forces are still active in the world  forces which for various economic and political reasons continue to speed up the flywheel of the arms race. These forces are trying to whip up the race of missiles and nuclear armaments which are most dangerous for mankind  trying to utilize the greatest achievements of the human mind for the creation of new and ever newer types of weapons.69.	The socialist countries have always fought against such a dangerous development  and we have every reason to pride ourselves on the fact that it is on the initiative of those countries that most disarmament questions have been considered or are being considered in the United Nations. The socialist countries have achieved positive results which are known to all  due to their consistent and resolute position and because they have proceeded in cooperation with the young independent States. This is in accord with the interests of all States  including the large group of developing countries which  in the solution of economic and social problems which they are 'facing  urgently need the release of funds being swallowed up by the arms race and the switching of those funds to the development of their national economies. For those countries peace is a primary and necessary prerequisite to save them from the colonial heritage and to give them a weapon to fight against neocolonialism. How pathetic is the attitude of one country which  in words  tries to present itself here as a friend of the third world and at the same time  by its deeds  opposes the cessation of the arms race and opposes disarmament.70.	The Soviet Union has submitted an important new item  entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human wellbeing and health"" [item 100]  for the consideration of the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session. In the opinion of the Byelorussian SSR  the drafting and conclusion of an appropriate international convention is most timely and indeed farsighted. It is imperative today that measures should be taken to save humanity from the danger of the use of new means of waging war which tomorrow may widely proliferate and which will then be much more difficult to curb. The conclusion of such a convention would be not only a step forward in the limitation of the scope of the arms race but also an important means of protecting the human environment.71.	We should do all we can at this session to implement the resolution adopted at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly on the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)]. That decision  which links together the problems of disarmament and those of development  may promote the cause of the strengthening of universal peace and socioeconomic development  provided there is good will on the part of all the permanent members of the Security Council.72.	The Byelorussian SSR will press for the adoption at this  session of a decision making it possible to start directly on the preparation of recommendations on the practical questions related to the convening of the World Disarmament Conference. We are confident that through the combined efforts of peace-loving countries the opposition of the enemies of the convening of such a conference will be overcome.73.	The world community continues to face the task of bringing about the prohibition and elimination of chemical weapons  the cessation by everyone  everywhere  of nuclear weapons testing  and the implementation of other measures towards complete and general disarmament.74.	We expect at this session of the General Assembly to consider anew and in a broad context the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]  which should result in additional specific steps for the strict implementation of the main provisions of that Declaration. It is essential that the discussion of this question should promote the strengthening and further development of the results already achieved in the general normalization of the international situation.75.	As a member of the Security Council  the Byelorussian SSR favors the adoption by the Council of appropriate measures to make mandatory the solemn resolution of the General Assembly on the non use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]. Such a decision by the Security Council will have a longterm favorable influence on international relations. It is high time for those permanent members of the Security Council that have been opposing the adoption of such a decision to cease their obstructionism.76.	The General Assembly must make the best use of the favorable opportunities available for a fruitful discussion of the problems of disarmament and the strengthening of international security. That in turn will serve the cause of the further extension and deepening of the process of detente and the solution of the tasks of economic development.77.	The admission to the United Nations at this session of three States  Bangladesh  Grenada and GuineaBissau—whose delegations we warmly welcome here is further proof of the continuing  powerful upsurge of the national liberation movement and of the emergence on the world arena on a broad scale of the independent developing countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America.78.	International support for those fighting for freedom  national independence  democracy and socialism has always been an integral part of the foreign policies of the socialist States. As members will recall  in 1960  on the initiative of the Soviet Union  the General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]  an event of historic importance. The results of the struggle of the people of GuineaBissau have convincingly shown that the liberation movement is invincible when the alliance between it and world socialism has become an objective reality. The colonialists  though armed to the teeth  were incapable of bringing the heroic people of Guinea Bissau to their knees.79.	The chauvinists  blinded by their greatPower aspirations to hegemony  ultimately proved to be incapable of preventing the people of Bangladesh  who had embarked on the road to freedom and independence  from seeing their country become a Member of the United Nations.80.	The circumstances of detente have made it possible for the developing countries to intensify their struggle to eliminate unequal economic relations between developed capitalist countries and developing countries. The Byelorussian SSR actively supports the attitude and demands of the developing countries. The Byelorussian SSR took that stand at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  at which the developing countries presented a fully justified historical bill to imperialism and colonialism for centuries of exploitation and appropriation of their wealth and demanded the cessation of the pernicious activities of transnational monopolies.81.	As was rightly pointed out by the Foreign Minister of Algeria at the sixth special session  the adoption of the anti imperialist decisions at that session was the result of natural alliances of the developing countries with the socialist States  alliances and here I would quote Mr. Bouteflika's words: ""which are profoundly motivated by the will of the international community to establish a new era based on justice  progress and peace"". [2230th meeting  para. 185] 82.	The support given by the socialist countries to the former colonial and dependent peoples has received a new and deeper meaning during the period in which a number of developing countries have embarked on and are carrying out broad socioeconomic transformations. That support and that assistance are rendered as a matter of principle and are devoid of any consideration of short term gain or aspirations to one sided benefits. We resolutely support the African fighters against colonialism  racism and apartheid  all democrats struggling for the freedom of their peoples and against Fascist tyranny.83.	We consider that the United Nations should increase its efforts to bring about the cessation of repression of democrats  the release of all political prisoners in Chile and the cessation of the arbitrary rule and lawlessness of the Fascist junta  which has sold itself down the river to foreign capital. And no matter how often an agent of the Fascist military regime of Chile runs up to this rostrum to spread slander  abusing the right of reply  honest people whether in Chile or in other countries will not stop their struggle against the crimes of the bloody dictatorship in Chile; they will constantly render support to the patriots and democrats of Chile in their just struggle  which is inseparably linked with the peoples* aspiration to lasting peace on earth.84.	During the general debate  a number of representatives have tried to criticize the Charter of the United Nations and have even called for its revision. The Charter has been subjected to attacks for a long time now. There have always been people and there evidently are such people around today who regard the Charter as an obstacle. On the other hand  a number of young independent States which sincerely seek the speedy implementation of the basic provisions of the Charter are inclined to yield to the temptation to revise it  to reorganize the United Nations  and so forth. We should like to draw their attention to the fact that it is precisely at the moment when the United Nations has begun to solve more effectively the tasks assigned to it in the'Charter  at the moment when the rote and influence of the nonaligned countries have grown immensely  that the rabid supporters of the revision of the Charter have become active.85.	We oppose any attempts to revise the Charter of the United Nations  for it fully reflects the existing balance of forces in the world and the presence of two social and political systems: socialism and capitalism; it ensures the vitality of the United Nations; it is in accordance with the interests of the maintenance and strengthening of peace. The whole history of the United Nations convincingly shows that it has been the strict observance of the Charter and the consistent implementation of the decisions of the Security Council and the positive recommendations of other United Nations bodies that have ensured the way to the success of the United Nations activities. Those who would strengthen the United Nations should vigorously and actively press for this  while unmasking and isolating those who try to undermine the Organization on the false pretext of perfecting its Charter.86.	The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR  like many other delegations that have spoken in the general debate  is convinced that in the discussion and solution of any questions in the United Nations problems related to the strengthening of peace and international security  disarmament  decolonization  the struggle against racism and apartheid  economic development  the working out and observance of the rules of international law it is always necessary to have unity and cohesion  a high degree of activity and consistency on the part of all the anti-imperialist forces  in the vanguard of which the States of the socialist community march on and cooperate on a fraternal basis with the nonaligned and developing countries."
"15",892,"BOL",29,1974,"I wish to state that it is a signal honor to address the Assembly from this rostrum the highest expression of world thinking where illustrious statesmen from the most distant corners of the world have come to carry out a dialogue  which is a means of understanding par excellence between peoples and between men. This is possible because of the growing universality of the United Nations  which at each session of the General Assembly enables us to greet new States that have joined the system.2.	On behalf of my Government and my people  in our language which is a language of peace  I greet all the nations represented here. We wish to practice friendship without reservations or exclusions. We are a developing country  a part of the earth which shares the limitations  hopes  disappointments and impatience of those countries which earnestly seek their progress in an atmosphere of stable peace  based on the broadest co-operation.3.	I wish to express to the President of the Assembly  Mr. Abdelaziz Boutefiika  the eminent statesman from Algeria  our most cordial greetings and our best wishes for his success. To the outgoing President  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  and to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  we express our appreciation of their unflagging work for world peace.4.	I also wish to extend a brotherly welcome to the new Members of the Organization  the States of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. As my country has from the outset maintained cordial relations with Bangladesh  we can only rejoice at its entry into the United Nations. The same holds true in respect of Grenada  a State which is also within theAmerican region  thereby making its presence in the United Nations a twofold source of very great satisfaction to the Latin American group of States. As regards Guinea-Bissau  we again have many grounds for satisfaction in view of all that its presence represents.5.	The General Assembly heard with deep consternation Mr. Cesar Batres  the Minister for. Foreign Affairs of Honduras [2242nd meeting]. His words brought to us the tragic confirmation of the gravity of the disaster which has struck his country. He made us feel as our own the pain and devastation which the Honduran people have been suffering. We know that there are tragedies in respect of which words are meaningless. But we know too that the ideas transmitted in this august Assembly are the expression of an international solidarity profoundly moved and stimulated by the marvelous sense of human brother-hood  a brotherhood which in the midst of pain  and perhaps because of it  will bring spiritual comfort  moral encouragement and material assistance to the sister State of Honduras  with which the Government and the people of Bolivia feel a deep sense of solidarity in these moments of sorrow and affliction.6.	As I was saying  every year we meet here - countries which are united and separated for many reasons quite apart from geographical distances. We come here seeking a pledge  bringing our concerns and our hopes. This is the most eloquent proof that our faith in the supreme world body has not faltered. We believe in the ideals and postulates of the San Francisco Charter  which was masterfully conceived 29 years ago.7.	These principles have not lost force with the pas-sage of time  and they are as valid today as they were then in promoting an international conduct designedto enable mankind 	1 so many ways  tofollow a road le^u. ^ ihe attainment of a destiny of happiness and prosperity.8.	The items to be debated in the Assembly are many and complex. Among them there is no order of priority with which to determine their importance. All  every one of them  are intimately connected with the lofty purposes of the United Nations; but it is quite true that some are of greater concern to us.9.	Accordingly  I shall refer only to some of the items which  in our opinion  require priority attention and immediate action by the States Members of this Organ-ization so that through adequate adjustments we may promote success in the great tasks which the inter-national community seeks to complete  A/PV.2259 and Corr.l10.	At this stage in our civilization  when man  through his inexhaustible ingenuity  has solved the mystery of outer space  mankind cannot consider wars to be inevitable. There is therefore no acceptable justification for mass destruction. 11.	For this reason  from this rostrum of peace  where we nobly endeavor to arrive at understanding and friendship among peoples  my delegation wishes to express its most earnest hope that the efforts of the Security Council will strengthen peace on Cyprus and that the international community will endorse the initiative of the Secretary-General to bring comfort to the populations affected by the conflict.12.	But the aims of peace cannot be secured except by political action designed to prevent possible confrontations. At present  the elimination of world tension must be sought  basically  in a frank and determined co-operation for development  which will make it possible to establish a just order in economic relations among States in the knowledge that external aid and co-operation have ceased to be an act of philanthropy and have become a duty which the most advanced countries can no longer shirk.13.	These motives gave impetus to the drafting and implementation of a major effort -the international development strategy for the First United Nations Development Decade. We recognize  in all its auspicious intention  the essential achievements of that program  even though it must be pointed out that they were not sufficient to solve the complex problem of underdevelopment. This circumstance led to a feeling of frustration which  with the useful lessons learned from the earlier attempt  we must try to dispel and overcome. The desire to achieve the advancement and prosperity of peoples is a goal which  despite frustrations  cannot be abandoned. The will of nations must persist in its purpose to achieve those aims. Were this not to be so  we would be committing a blunder with unforeseeable consequences for the future of mankind.14.	With these irrenunciable aims still in view  the Second United Nations Development Decade was started in a spirit of renewal. The responsibility shoul-dered by the international community is greater at this stage than in the past because new expectations and prospects are being nurtured. These must be satisfied lest our peoples become inevitably exposed to a crisis of confidence in the mechanisms of world co-operation and in the very system of international economic relations.15.	It is not our intention to encourage pessimistic prophecies  but if our peoples have to continue to bear fresh disappointments the consequences will doubtless be catastrophic. Faith will have been weakened  and we shall have further removed the goal of progress to which the most numerous part of mankind aspires for its complete fulfillment.16.	For these reasons  my delegation feels that it is both desirable and urgent that the industrialized countries  and the developing countries replace the present state of near-confrontation by a broad and constructive understanding so as to arrive at an economic alliance through the same channels which made it possible to reach a political detente  designed to create a sound and lasting world understanding.17.	My delegation wishes to reiterate its complete endorsement of the principles  objectives and policies contained in the basic documents adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly. We consider that they faithfully reflect the interests and aspirations of the economically backward countries.18.	Hence  we not only appeal for understanding from the industrialized nations but we also require their dynamic participation in this undertaking  through generous and concrete expressions of their political will  with a view to establishing a more balanced and just economic system.19.	There is clearly the threat of a world-wide economic dislocation. It is a time of trial and of urgent decisions. Joint action and solidarity must go beyond simple statements. Positive altitudes conceived of with imagination and executed with boldness are what is needed.20.	It is of the utmost importance that we obtain a progressive revaluation of the exports of the developing countries. But we believe that this will only be possible if we adopt an appropriate mechanism which will link and automatically adjust  starting with equitable levels  the evolution of prices of the exports of the least developed nations with the manufactures of the industrialized countries.21.	It is also of priority interest to strengthen the organs for these purposes so as to achieve a greater transfer of financial and technological resources for the benefit of States which seek to develop.22.	Another legitimate means to prevent any possible crisis might be found by the international community if  with a criterion of equity  it agrees to promote and facilitate the processing of natural resources in the regions where they are found  that is to say  for the benefit of the soil itself where nature placed these riches. It is also important to assist in the process of regional and subregional integration.23.	Another chapter which deserves our attention is the one regarding a draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.24.	We should like to make it possible  in brief  that through joint efforts  as the original element of the voluntary act  the intelligence of man may conceive of and apply a system whereby the growing prosperity of the richer nations does not become a threat of greater poverty for the small nations. The entire effort represented by the Second United Nations Development Decade would not be effective  however  unless we promote with like interest and will to act the Disarmament Decade. It is of the utmost importance that substantial resources previously intended for destruction now be used for work that will raise the well-being of all peoples.25.	On the other hand  we were justly alarmed to hear some expressions here in regard to the rising prices of raw materials and energy supplies  which augur an escalation of confrontation in world trade. We trust that  with the creative capacity of man and a predominantly just spirit  channels of understanding and balance will be found. Thus  we shall serve the aspirations to well-being and  above all  solidarity among nations.26.	Another item which is current in the common concern of mankind for maintaining peace refers to the quest for an adequate conciliatory formula so as to finally remove the violence of the convulsed regions of the Middle East. The Government of Bolivia is sensitive to the suffering of the Palestinian people. Therefore  we express our most whole-hearted hope that the negotiations started in Geneva will prosper and be consolidated. We believe that  in order to achieve genuine peace in the Middle East  the parties to the conflict must continue effective negotiations  covering the interests of all  without outside interference or impositions.27.	Let us encourage what is constructive. We believe that the quest for peace requires many sacrifices. The situation in the Middle East  therefore  calls for the most serene reflection and requires that we pave a smooth way for the negotiators.28.	My country  which traditionally has opposed colonialism in any form  wishes to greet with satisfaction the fundamental changes in attitude which are taking place in this field. These are not isolated successes but proof of the ability to adjust to the new molds of history. It is  in brief  a triumph of the international community.29.	In this way  the first step has been taken for new States to come into being and they  we are sure  will enter the international community to practice the principles advocated by the Charter of the United Nations  which places the ideals of peace above any resentments of the past.30.	This year has been a period of doubts and achievements. There have been frustration and also hope; and the hope for a new era more just and in accordance with the concerns of our peoples is shown precisely in the context of America. The widespread acceptance of dialog  resulting from understanding  has enabled us in America to break the lack of communication and has made it easier to seek joint formulas for an effective coming together on a basis of complete solidarity. Tlatelolco and Washington  and shortly Buenos Aires  are landmarks of a new policy and of an edifying example. Developing countries and one of the world Powers  on a footing of equality  decided to review their relations in every sphere so as to reconcile interests and  what is more important  to establish mechanisms Of co-operation which will give content to the ideals of solidarity.31.	We  the Latin Americans  believe that the roads are free and clear and that a future of happiness and understanding depends  then  on our ability and imagination and the vast scope of common objectives. Dialog is again a synonym for understanding.32.	America  too  looks for justice. America has taken a historical decision to apply solidarity. America is resolved that on its soil sterile confrontation should end  giving way to harmony and mutual co-operation among its peoples. Finally  America has united its will and launched the challenge in Atlanta  at the Fourth regular session of the Organization of American States (OAS): conflicts do not contribute to well- being  and their solution is an imperative of our times. To do away with suspicions  to defeat acceptance of injustice  it is recognized ""that hemispheric solidarity constitutes one of the essential foundations of the' inter- American system""  and we declare  with the unanimity of causes of noble origin  ""that it is of fundamental interest for the continent to solve the problems which disturb solidarity  lessen co-operation among the American nations or threaten peace  and represent barriers to their economic and social development"".33.	My Government has thus brought to Atlanta its words of peace for the solution of the injustice arising from the geographical enclosure to which my country is confined. In this world society I must reiterate it more broadly  together with our willingness for a constructive dialog. The solution of the landlocked status of Bolivia is a continental problem. It is a challenge to America which wounds the spirit of understanding of just men and peoples. The return of Bolivia to the sea is the most deep-rooted feeling among its citizens. We trust that we shall not witness the centennial of our enclosure  because we see the foreshadowing of fruitful understanding free from formalisms and with a profoundly practical sense. America has so decided.34.	With these same principles  full of the vocation for peace and progress  the Nationalist Government  under the presidency of General Hugo Banzer Suarez  has continued the task of national reconstruction. For the past three yea* s Bolivians have enjoyed the benefits of stability and order and have found that it is possible to build their own historic destiny  through the genuine national entity. The task has been an arduous one  and we still foresee a stage of work and sacrifice.35.	The Bolivian nation faces many problems -among them  strengthening its economy and its political system  which embraces both the nation and the people  and institutionalizing its republican life. But our will is strong. With the help of all Bolivians  we shall overcome and lay the foundations that will enable future generations to have a free country  a country that is just and full of opportunities.36.	I would not wish to end my statement without reiterating the faith of the people and Government of Bolivia in the United Nations. At this General Assembly session we again express our hope that mankind  here represented  will engage in a more vigorous quest for the happy future we must seek  as the result of the construction Of a truly integrated international society.37.	There are  to be sure  many problems facing the contemporary world. But I am convinced that if we exert all our efforts  and with the sincere purpose that guides our peoples  we shall find the right path that will lead us to universal brotherhood.38.	The very fact that more than 130 countries come together in this ecumenical gathering to express their hopes and aspirations and to reaffirm their faith in peace confirms our conviction that mankind is moving towards systems of loyal communication  solidarity and shared effort. That is faith in our destiny. That is support for harmonious coexistence. That is  finally  the certainty that in this changing world  where man himself is astonished by his accomplishments  ways to happiness can be found."
"16",939,"BRA",29,1974,"Mr. President  I would like  at the outset  to express my delegation's satisfaction and  in particular  my own  at seeing you directing the work of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I remember with special satisfaction the brotherly relationship we shared at Algiers  in 1967  when I had the pleasure of sitting beside you when you presided over the first ministerial meeting of the developing countries. On that occasion there were countless times when we found that our views converged regarding solutions for the most urgent and acute problems the developing countries were facing. No less numerous were the occasions on which I witnessed the demonstration of your exceptional qualities of leadership. For this reason  I am convinced that you will prove able to impress upon the deliberations of this General Assembly the objectivity  the firmness and the political acumen required by the complexity of the subjects under debate.3.	I also offer Mr. Leopoldo Benites the thanks of the Brazilian delegation for the able and sound way in which he presided over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Mr. Benites is not only an asset of this Organization  which he has served for so many years with unchanging dedication  but is also an asset of Latin America and of his valiant country—Ecuador—which has in him a respected spokesman in the service of its most authentic aspirations.4.	May I be allowed to address a very special word of greeting in our common language to the representatives of the Republic of GuineaBissau  present here today in their full right  to the great rejoicing of us all.5.	As Minister for External Affairs of Brazil and as a Brazilian  nothing could give me greater satisfaction than to salute the admission to this Organization of a new country of Africa and of Portuguese speech  to which we feel linked therefore by bonds of blood and culture. These links constitute the strongest guarantee for the close and fertile friendship which will certainly unite our two peoples.6.	Our greetings are also directed to the delegation of Bangladesh. We are sure that there will be many opportunities for us to extend within the scope of the United Nations the friendly relations we already entertain bilaterally.7.	I also address an equally warm expression of brotherly feelings to the delegation of Grenada  which has added its presence to our regional group.8.	An honored tradition  which goes back to the first session of the General Assembly  gives Brazil the privilege of opening this great dialog of sovereign nations each year. This tradition I take up today  speaking for the first time as my country's Minister for External Affairs in this forum. I do so with redoubled emotion  for I am conscious that I am addressing the community of nations at a particularly important moment in the history of the Organization and of our participation in it. It is unnecessary to make more explicit the importance of this hour in universal terms. It seems obvious to all that we are at the threshold of a new era which will be one of peace and prosperity or of insecurity and poverty  according to whether we know how to harmonize  in a constructive fashion  the most essential objectives and the most enlightened national interests of each country here represented. Brazil has the benefit of facing the challenge Of this new hour with a Government whose term has just begun and which carries  in its objectives and mode of action  the indisputable stamp of realism and diligence. This allows us to contemplate our action within the Organization against a background that is simultaneously broader in time and more encompassing in tenus of solutions to the problems under consideration.9.	We have repeatedly and publicly enunciated the principles on which the international conduct of President Ernesto Geisel's administration is based  and we have already given sufficient demonstration that we know how to unite action with words when it comes to turning those principles into reality.10.	During recent years Brazil has taken broad steps  first in correcting the main distortions that disrupted its economic and social development and  subsequently  in the consolidation of a model of growth that truly attempts to respond to the authentic aspirations of our national community. Thus the country has grown internally and thus also it has grown in terms of its presence  its potentialities and its responsibilities in the international field. While this is happening  we try to avoid the traps of history by not repeating the errors of nations which became great  many times at the expense of others. We want our presence in a wider ranging international scene to be accompanied by the preservation of the primordial ethical values that have been and that continue to be the bases of our foreign policy.11.	We want our words in the international field to be direct and simple  without ambiguity or subterfuge. We want the Brazilian Government to be able to accomplish the oecumenical vocation of its people  who are open to uninhibited and frank communication. We want to explore the paths of understanding  for we believe  fundamentally  that cooperation is more effective than antagonism and that mutual respect is more creative than ambitions of preponderance.12.	Our conduct for attaining those objectives is pragmatic and responsible: pragmatic to the extent to which we desire effectiveness and to which we are disposed to seek  wherever Brazilian national interests may move us  areas of convergence and zones of coincidence with the national interests of other peoples; and responsible because we will always act within the framework of ethics and exclusively as a function of objectives clearly identified and accepted by the Brazilian people.13.	I do not intend to comment on the various items on the agenda of the present session. There will  I am sure  be many occasions on which the Brazilian delegation will speak on those items during the coming weeks. From this rostrum I wish only to underline which are the problems  in our understanding  to the solution of which we must jointly dedicate our most urgent attention.14.	Immediately the problem of decolonization springs into view. We have on this question a position of absolute clarity: Brazil believes unreservedly that there is no justification for delay or subterfuge in the process of decolonization  both in the American continent itself and over the entire world. Brazil will give its support so that those peoples still subject to forms of colonial domination may achieve  within the shortest possible time  the national independence to which they aspire. We believe that to the extent that the will of the community of sovereign nations in support of acceleration of the decolonization process becomes general  so much greater will be the possibility that decolonization may be achieved peacefully and under conditions that will allow constructive cooperation between the peoples of those countries that were previously held as colonies and the peoples whose Governments had theretofore followed a colonizing policy. In this sense  support given to emancipation is as important as action directed towards the colonizing Governments so that they may detach themselves quickly and with conviction from their policies of colonial domination. In both forms of action the forum of the United Nations has demonstrated its effectiveness  and it is our intention to support it in this role.15.	Brazil is following this; path  which is not always the easiest one or one which pleases those who cannot distinguish appearance from reality. For the Brazilian Government  the challenge faced by those who want to rid the world of the colonial stigma is the challenge of efficacy. To blame the colonizing past is not what matters; what matter? is rather to help build the future of free nations. This position corresponds to what is deepest in the Brazilian soul. We are prepared to make explicit those sentiments and the aspirations that correspond to them by offering our concrete cooperation in the building of these new nations.16.	Amflcar Cabral  the great leader of the independence of GuineaBissau  was aware of the anti colonialist will of the Brazilian people. His words are so similar to those we have so often uttered in relation to African peoples under colonial domination that they seem almost to have come from the same mouth. I quote them:""Our interest"" in developing relations of friendship  solidarity and cooperation with Brazil is all the greater as we feel ourselves linked to the Brazilian people by bonds of blood  culture and history  and we ardently desire to establish with Brazil  after the conquest of our independence  broad fraternal relations in all fields  just as we desire them with the people of Portugal  which we never confused with Portuguese colonialism.""17.	The same feeling of brotherhood binds us to Mozambique and Angola  whose independence we want to see completed. We hail the agreement that on 7 September the Portuguese Government concluded with the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO]. Little more than a century and a half ago the same date marked the first independence of a former Portuguese colony  and it is Brazil  that former colony  which is here represented and which offers its hand to its African brothers. To Brazil this gesture signifies not just an unbending adherence to the inalienable principle of self-determination. To us  the emergence of African nations to independent life has an additional dimension which allows us to take up again  on an equal footing  the close sharing of life with peoples that have been among the most generous sources of our mode of being.18.	To the opening up of prospects for the populations in the Territories under Portuguese administration in Africa  there has not been  unfortunately  any corresponding visible progress in respect to areas under colonial domination in other continents. In the same fashion  there still remain forms of subjugation resulting from racial or religious prejudices.19.	In the United Nations and outside  apartheid has been universally condemned in the name of the most diverse principles. Ethically  it runs directly contrary to the universal values of the human conscience. From the viewpoint of doctrine  it incorporates the most discredited theories of alleged racial superiorities.20.	When we repudiate apartheid we also repudiate any pretension of the international community wishing to colonize culturally the nations of Africa. Thus  when we rejoice at the emergence to independence of new Portuguese-speaking nations  we are not uttering praise for any cultural supremacy but are simply welcoming the opportunities now open for a broader brotherly understanding by the communities of the same language. For the African Portuguese-speaking nations and for other nations what we want is that they may be authentic in the expression of their own rich and varied cultures. We in Brazil  who owe so much to the different African cultures  can only hope that they may reinvigorate themselves in the climate of freedom offered to them by national independence.21.	It has been said  and rightly so  that in the history of mankind ours is the first generation upon which has fallen the task not only of making the world but also of preventing the world from being unmade. It is an enormous responsibility for those who  like the great majority of mankind  have such minute means available to them for influencing global decisions which have such a great effect on them.22.	We stand almost as helpless spectators of the accelerated arms race  which is incessantly pursued under the mantle of protestations of detente at promises of disarmament. The disproportion between the scope of the problem and the measures agreed on for its solution is smaller only than that which exists between the alleged defense justifications and the overwhelming destructive power that has been accumulated already.23.	More than anything else  it is shocking to see the magnitude of financial and technological resources devoted to arms production  so many times higher than that which would be necessary to reform the present structure of economic inequities and thus to allow men to live in a world free from fear  more unfettered by shame and  above all  more favorable to the expression of its creative potentialities.24.	There would be reasons  perhaps  to welcome the evolution during recent years from a world in a climate of ""cold war"" to a world in a climate of detente. We would have more reasons to rejoice if we could see confirmed in the future what seems to be the present evolution of that climate into a virtual entente. It depends in part on ourselves  the countries that seek development  whether such an entente will be made to our benefit or to our prejudice. It is to a certain extent natural that the great Powers should seek such an entente and  above all  for the preservation of the status quo -which  however  would benefit them only in the short run. However  under its shadow  and this is the only benefit which we receive  we who are less strong must seek only to realize a policy of closer and less tense cooperation in the international field. We must utilize this opening in order to obtain a better coordination of the less developed countries in the defence of their interests in economic and social progress.25.	This evolution has saved us from the spectre of apocalyptic war  which would be the logical consequence of a boundless arms policy. This does not mean that the world has reached the certainty of being able to live in peace and security  a certainty which is the most profound aspiration of the majority of peoples. Many are those who still continue to suffer from the bitterness of armed conflict or who live under the recurrent threat of its intensification. We have to recognize that the contribution made by the countries not directly involved in those conflicts to their solution is precarious. And we have to admit that it is the very terror of total nuclear conflict which feeds or allows the growth of those localized wars.26.	The question of the Middle East deserves constant and real attention from all of us.27.	It is surprising—I would even say shocking - to see that the world seems to turn its preoccupations towards the Middle East only when a war crisis occurs in that disturbed region. The set of problems which for so many years have afflicted the peoples of the Middle East should require of the international community a concern to .bring about continuous and creative cooperation. Within that context  if the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) may indeed constitute one of the possibly indispensable conditions for the development of the solution to the problem  it is also true that that implementation does not exhaust the range of measures essential to the attainment of the greater objectives of peace  security  tranquility  and social and economic development of the countries of the region.28.	Objection to wars of conquest is a constant factor in the history of Brazil and a norm inscribed in our Constitution. We hold the right to territorial integrity and the obligation of respect for sovereignty to be absolute. Consequently  we believe that withdrawal from the occupied territories is an integral part of the solution to the conflict.29.	Only those frontiers which have been negotiated and recognized by all for the good of all will be calm. This is the solution which  by bringing them peace and security  will truly serve the countries of the region.30.	We  the countries of the American continent  are fortunate to have an institutional solution to such problems and we are proud that the security agreement binding us together has determined  for many years now  that all regional conflicts be solved starting from the initial and indispensable assumption that occupying forces are withdrawn from areas under military invasion.31.	The drama of the Middle East is enlarged and made universal to the extent that it involves human aspects which cannot be ignored. The community of nations must not spare an/ effort  including efforts made in conjunction with the peoples of the Middle East  to ensure that the sufferings of the Palestinian people are alleviated by appropriate measures. It is inhuman to consider that any solution that does not attend to their rights is equitable  and it is an illusion to think that such a solution would be lasting.32.	We are sure  on the other hand  that a greater effort of international cooperation with the countries of the Middle East in the economic and social fields may provide a decisive contribution to peace. It is gratifying to note that wide prospects seem to be opening up in this direction  and there will arise if all parties  conscious of their growing responsibilities  work with creative imagination and firmness of intention unprecedented modalities for cooperation which will be of great significance to the international community  and especially to the developing countries. Such cooperation  which is in the interest of all countries and all regions  if correctly implemented  may bring about results of extreme importance in the reorientation of the flows of trade  of investments and of financing  correcting the existing distortions which contribute to insecurity and instability in the international field.33.	Latin America  in its mutual solidarity  has a clear conception of the challenge that the present crisis represents for each one of our countries. This challenge does not frighten us; rather  it stimulates us to redouble internally  within each country  the efforts needed to accelerate national progress  and to expand  in the external field  forms of cooperation to achieve common objectives resulting from the convergence of our national interests.34.	One of the characteristics of the time in which we are living is the growing command that developing countries are assuming over their natural resources. This evolution is allowing those countries to reduce their excessive dependence on the economies of the developed countries and better to orientate their own economic growth. It also opens up unprecedented opportunities for cooperation among developing countries.35.	In Latin America  an awareness of the importance of this process is visibly increasing. The full use of natural resources in Latin American countries is fundamental to the acceleration of the growth of the region and may become a relevant Latin American contribution to the alleviation of the world crises of energy  raw materials and food. At the same time  the strong cultural and political solidarity that binds together the countries of Latin America  also makes joint endeavors in the economic field ever more viable. Thus we see ever-growing possibilities of cooperation in the use of natural resources common to or shared by more than one country. The. novelty of this form of cooperation  at least on the scale on which it is being developed in Latin America  has not yet permitted a general understanding of its potential or of the problems it involves. I consider it important to bring before the international community my country's point of view on these questions.36.	Brazil considers that the free use and exploitation of the natural resources in its territory is a right inherent in the sovereignty of the State. Such a right cannot brook restrictions. In the case of resources which are  by nature  not static and which flow through the territory of more than one country  that right remains unalterable  those restrictions alone being acceptable that result from the obligation not to cause significant or permanent damage to the exploitation by other countries of the natural resources in their territories. To subordinate the sovereign utilization of our own natural resources to consultations of a.suspensive nature would be to introduce an intolerable disruption in international order  with the result of making the right that we were trying to preside a mere ""dead letter"". The Brazilian Government  which does not refuse to make use of or to resort to consultation between Governments in this as in any other matter  and which has resorted to this method of procedure frequently in the past  cannot 'accept the perversion of the cooperative function of consultation by questioning the sovereignty of States. For this reason we think it is our duty to awaken the consciences of Governments to the implications of principles of consultation that would injure the sovereign right of countries to use their natural resources  and that  though seemingly constructive  would be potentially disruptive to the international order  which it is our aim to preserve  and an impediment to the material progress of nations  which it is our objective to stimulate. We should all be aware that natural resources  the use of which it is intended to regulate in opposition to the sovereign decisions of territorial Governments  do not flow over ground only. There are those that flow beneath the ground  as there are those that flow in the territorial sea. The characteristics of certain resources must be the motive for responsible behavior on the part of those who use them  rather than for hindering their use and thus benefiting no party at all.37.	We are experiencing all these problems in Latin America and we are seeking solutions to them based on the principles of harmony of interests  peaceful understanding and enlightened cooperation  principles that this Organization has established as the foundations of international life. If I bring to this rostrum the example of Latin America  it is because I sincerely believe that it constitutes a positive contribution to the realization of the ideals of the United Nations.38.	My reflections have barely touched on some items of the agenda for the present session. The reason is that I have tried to confine myself to an enunciation of Brazil's. position on questions that belong to the agenda of mankind more than to the agenda of the Assembly  and on the set of fundamental problems  the solution of which will determine the shape of the coming decades.39.	I have chosen to concern myself with those problems that are more closely connected with the aspirations of liberty  human dignity  justice  progress and peace. On many of these questions the international community has made considerable progress. On others  the results obtained have been imperceptible. Nevertheless  there is no reason for dismay. The severity of the problems should constitute for all of us not a reason for disenchantment  but an incentive to redoubled efforts  creative imagination and fidelity to the purposes and principles upon which this Organization of sovereign States was built."
"17",983,"BRB",29,1974,"Mr. President  I am happy to join those who preceded me in paying tribute to you on your election to the presidency of this  the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly  We recall with satisfaction the initiative taken by the President of Algeria which led to the convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly to deal with a matter of immediate concern to all nations. At this time when our preoccupation must be the need to forge a new international economic order  we can think of no better tribute to you and your Country than that the honor of presiding over the deliberations of this session should be bestowed upon so illustrious a representative.141.	I wish also to place on record our deep appreciation of your predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  whose wise and efficient guidance of our deliberations during the twenty-eighth regular session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly not only earned him the respect of the international community but also brought credit to his country and all of Latin America.142.	I should also like  on behalf of my delegation  to pay due tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the untiring efforts he continues to devote to the service of the United Nations.143.	Today we greet three new Members of this Organization. My delegation has great pleasure in being able on this occasion to extend a cordial welcome  to our sister Caribbean State of Grenada  which has long-established links with the English-speaking States of the Caribbean  links which are the result of a common historical experience. We are indeed happy to share with Grenada the stirring challenges that face this body.144.	As one of the first States to recognize the sovereignty of the people of Bangladesh  we take particular satisfaction  too  in welcoming a delegation from the People's Republic of Bangladesh and would reiterate to them our sympathy concerning the recent natural disasters which so cruelly struck this new nation. Our condolences also go to the Government and people of Honduras on the suffering which that sister Latin American State now experiences after the grave tragedy which befell it on the eve of this Assembly session.145.	These calamities must serve as forcible reminders of the obvious responsibility this Organization must seek to discharge in providing assistance in cases of natural disaster.146.	We must welcome  too  the fact that the Portuguese people have found a new leadership persuaded to end the vicious wars which that country has waged in Africa for over a decade. The presence of a delegation from Guinea-Bissau in this Assembly is a welcome indication that the Portuguese Government accepts the inalienable right of a people to govern itself. We look forward to being able by the next session to welcome delegations from the other Territories which  until recently  formed part of the Portuguese empire.147.	The universality of membership of this Organization will provide the possibility of greater contentment and  it may be hoped  easier dispersal of the suspicions and frustrations of its Member States. But the admission of any new Member State reminds us that Belize  a member of our Caribbean community  has yet to achieve its independence  not because the metropolitan Power has refused to surrender its control  but because it fears possible assaults upon its territorial integrity. We believe it to be the responsibility not only of States like mine that share a common destiny with Belize but also of this forum to be continually seized of the problem and to work towards a solution that will help to ensure the ultimate goal of independence for that Territory.148.	We regret to note  too  that in southern Africa the indigenous peoples are yet struggling to attain the human status which the Members of this Organization are committed to guarantee to all peoples of this world. It would be difficult to justify in any human terms the oppression meted out to the African populations of Namibia and Rhodesia and the abominable repudiation of human values practiced under the system of apartheid in South Africa.149.	My Government has time and again emphasized its abhorrence of the malevolent system of apartheid and will continue to condemn the South African Government for its criminal imposition of this system on the peoples of southern Africa  for its refusal to hand over Namibia to its legitimate rulers and for its support of Rhodesia's illegal Government -all in defiance of the United Nations and its Charter.150.	But while we display eagerness for every people to enjoy its inalienable right to political freedom and would share in their joy of newly gained independence  we must reflect whether the attainment of sovereignty is not threatened by the political and economic instability of today's world. Barbados is pleased to note the continuation of the very positive steps which some countries have taken during the past year further to resolve their differences. The widening and deepening of detente between the superPowers will no doubt save humanity from the ravages of another major war  and the poorer and weaker countries must applaud all efforts to strengthen peace and security in the world.151.	But it is with regret that we observe that no lasting settlement has yet been found for the conflict in the Middle East. There are few international problems which so clearly bring home to the small countries of the world how negligent the so-called great Powers have been. It was these Powers that sponsored the creation of the State of Israel. But their pursuit of shifting and contradictory policies and their use of the area as a stamping-ground have been largely to blame for the sorry and wasteful belligerence that has prevailed in the region since 1948 and the tragedy that has overtaken millions of Arab refugees.152.	We would applaud the tireless and concerted efforts which brought about disengagement in the region after last October's conflagration  but we feel it the moral responsibility of the same Powers to bring all parties to the long-standing conflict to the conference table  to have the problems of frontiers worked out and to have the problem of the wandering and buffeted Palestinians resolved -in short  not only to effect disengagement  but also to create a lasting and effective basis for peace in that part of the world. It would then be possible to ensure that the human and material resources now devoted to the waging of war in that l ea could be better deployed to the general fulfillment of all the legitimate goals of humanity within the Middle East.153.	My country also deplores the damage done to the political independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus during the past few months. Here is  a case of a small  defenseless country ripped apart at the will of more powerful countries and made the battle-ground upon which the latter choose to settle their differences. This most recent experience is indeed a sad commentary on the achievements of this body since the Second. World War  for it again reminds us that our system of international peace-keeping is at best selective  at worst ineffective.154.	Another area of major concern must of necessity be the economic injustice suffered by the majority of States and peoples. At no time in the history of this Organization has the world economic outlook been as gloomy as it is today. Throughout the countries of the developing world there is a common denominator: life is poor in quality  poor in prospect. And yet it is not by divine inevitability that the rich grow richer and the poor grow poorer.155.	As we approach the mid-point of the Second United Nations Development Decade  we might understandably extrapolate from our accumulated experience in international co-operation for development and ask whether that experience justifies faith in a future of fruitful action in this sphere. Unless we would proceed blindly in today's world of crises  inflation  disequilibrium and deepening poverty  we cannot escape the responsibility of examination and analysis of the factors underlying the frustration of our agreed goals and objectives.156.	Thirty years ago the Charter of the United Nations committed the international community to the creation of conditions of stability and well-being and to ensuring a minimum standard of living consistent with human dignity through economic and social progress. The launching of the First and Second Development Decades marked attempts to give substance to this pledge and to adopt policies of international co-operation to achieve the agreed purpose. It was true then  and remains tine today  that the scale of such co-operation should match the magnitude of the problem.157.	That the record of achievement of the stated goals has been less than satisfactory is a common-place. That there is a probability of abandonment of the goals is now a common fear. So let us not forget that the crisis in energy* is but the latest in a series of crises or setbacks that have characterized the international economy in recent times.158.	We all know that the widening gap between rich and poor countries predated the energy crisis. We all know that the phenomenon of international inflation -the export of inflation from the rich to the poor countries -predated the energy crisis. We all know that the specter of global food shortages predated the energy crisis. We all know  too  that foiling levels of development assistance predated the energy crisis. All this is known.159.	But the phenomenon of vastly increased prices for the world's main source of energy has aggravated these trends. For oil-importing developing countries the prospects are bleak indeed. The most affected among the developing countries can hardly afford to buy food any longer. For the rest  the disequilibrium of crippling external payments prevents the expansion in productive capacity that is a prerequisite to growth and improved living standards. In this period of international economic crisis the future prospects of the majority of the world's peoples will depend on how poor countries like Barbados  with fragile economies  are able to manage the immediate problem. The case for immediate emergency relief to the most affected countries of the world is beyond dispute. The problem is survival today  or we may not reach the challenges of tomorrow.160.	The international community has in fact ad-dressed itself to that problem. The elements for the mechanism of relief were agreed in the Special Pro-gramme contained in the Program of Action adopted at the sixth special session of the Assembly. The dimensions of the problem and the magnitude of assistance needed have been outlined by the Secretary- General. But once again performance unhappily falls below requirements and expectations. And  if we must be frank  it falls below the collective ability of those able to assist. The world is treated to the spectacle of posturing by all but a few of the donor countries  while those in need remain uncertain of the fulfillment of the aims of the Special Program and of the magnitude of the assistance they will receive  and are doubtful whether such assistance as is eventually rendered will reach them in time.161.	But let us not forget that development -not mere survival- remains the essential path to peace and justice. And let us not be fooled into believing that the improvement in the living standards of the vast majority of the world's peoples will necessarily be achieved by stop-gap measures  any more than it will be achieved by an exclusive concern with the survival of those on the brink of total disaster. Countries like mine  which previously received little by way of development assistance  can no longer view with equanimity either the absence of such assistance or its painfully slow rate of disbursement.162.	It has long been recognized that an essential ingredient of international co-operation for the achievement of a more equitable world order is the transfer of resources from the developed to the developing nations. In today's realities  oil-exporting countries can play a crucial role in making such transfers possible. Looked at in the longer term  what is doubtless needed is a restructuring of the productive capacity of the world as distinct from the mere redistribution of its incomes. That  as we see it  is the essence of the new economic order called for by the sixth special session. The elements of the new order are already perceived. The courage for its implementation is yet to be demonstrated.163.	The demand for a new order of international economic justice has been nowhere louder than at the United Nations Conference recently convened in Caracas to work out a new regime for the control of the resources of the sea  My country put forward the view that the formulation of the principles of any regime governing the use of the sea may well depend on the willingness of the developed maritime countries to accept the fact that the rules of the traditional freedoms of the sea as at present interpreted by them have to give way to a new and revised order based on political and economic justice. Developing countries must exercise sovereignty and control over the marine resources within their national jurisdictions  while at the same time accepting responsibility for ensuring that the traditional interests of the community of nations in the areas of their sea are respected and protected. It is to be hoped that whenever the new regime that will govern the use of the sea is finally elaborated there will be an effective expression of political and economic justice on the sea -justice which  regrettably  we cannot say now exists on land.164. The Government and people of Barbados believe that we are here to bend our several efforts to the improvement of the human condition. If by our words and our deeds we fail to justify that belief  I must then ask  why are we here?"
"18",1059,"BTN",29,1974,"Mr. President  it is my privilege and pleasure to convey from our Sovereign  His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck  and the Government and people of Bhutan their warm greetings to you  Sir  and distinguished representatives. May I take this opportunity to offer our heartiest congratulations on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is conscious of the fact that you bring to this important post years of rich experience in the field of international relations in your capacity as Foreign Minister of Algeria. We are particularly pleased about your election  since it was in Algiers that Bhutan was admitted to the non-aligned group of countries. We pledge our support to your endeavors in tackling the difficult and sometimes controversial items with confidence and diligence.60.	I should be failing in my duty if I did not refer to the valuable leadership provided by your predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  during the twenty-eighth session as well as the sixth special session of the General Assembly.61.	Let me also place on record our deep appreciation of the tireless efforts made by Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  for implementing the lofty objectives enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. He has faced a difficult year  trying his utmost not only to implement the various resolutions of the United Nations but also to apply the principles and purposes of the Charter in order that situations of conflict  wherever they occurred  might be mollified by his vigilance and energetic action.62.	We are very happy to welcome the three new Members of the Organization  the People's Republic of Bangladesh  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and Grenada into this family of nations. With the admission of these three countries to membership of the United Nations  we are closer to the principle of universality. We hope that the remaining countries will soon find their way on the road towards this great Organization. My Government is particularly delighted that Bangladesh  a close neighbor  has now taken its rightful seat in this Assembly. It is pertinent for me to recall what my Minister for Foreign Affairs  His Excellency Mr. Dawa Tsering  said at the twenty- seventh session of the General Assembly:""Bhutan welcomes the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent sovereign nation. We extended our sympathy and support to the people of Bangladesh during their struggle for national liberation and we are happy today that we were one of the first to recognize the reality of Bangladesh . 63.	My delegation also had an opportunity to participate in the 1776th meeting of the Security Council  held on June 10 this year  when the Council adopted the decision to recommend to the General Assembly that it should admit the People's Republic of Bangladesh into the family of the United Nations  and we warmly welcomed that decision. With its ancient culture and heritage  we are confident that Bangladesh will make useful contributions in this Assembly and other forums with a view to strengthening this universal Organization.64.	Bhutan is fully conscious of the changes that are taking place in our part of the world  and we are taking the necessary steps to adopt our attitudes and policies in the context of these changes. We indeed compliment the leaders of the subcontinent for their courage and vision  and it is our sincere hope that this will continue to prevail in the interest of a durable peace in the region. Pakistan  displaying a sense of realism  recognized Bangladesh as a sovereign independent Republic  and Bangladesh  for its part  adopted an accommodating attitude towards Pakistan. We welcomed the New Delhi Agreement  under which this important event took place. We also hope that the spirit of the Simla Agreement of 2 July 1972  and the mood generated by it  will prevail between India and Pakistan  resulting in the achievement of a durable peace in the subcontinent. In this regard we are happy to note that direct talks between India and Pakistan have recently been held to restore communications and travel facilities.65.	Happily  Bhutan continues to enjoy close friendly relations with all the neighboring States  these friendly ties were more recently strengthened at the time of the Coronation of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  which took place on 2 June at Thimphu. The occasion was graced by the presence of the Heads of State from the neighboring countries  representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council and representatives from other friendly countries.66.	Our Monarch  young as he is  shoulders heavy responsibility with a great sense of maturity and wisdom. Under his direction and guidance  Bhutan continues to progress steadily and to forge friendly relations with all countries  based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and sovereign equality. Bhutan is wedded to the principle of non-alignment and adheres to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. It is gratifying to note that our relations with India continue to be most cordial and friendly  with mutual trust and co-operation. We look forward to an era of still greater co-operation and friendship with India in the years to come.67.	My delegation also extends a warm welcome to Grenada on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations. Grenada's emergence as a sovereign independent nation was part of the evolutionary process set in motion by the administering Power  namely the United Kingdom  and the transfer of power by peaceful means is yet another landmark in the process of decolonization.68.	Another happy event for all of us is the admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Rations. We welcome this nation from Africa whose people waged an unrelenting struggle lasting over a decade in order to attain their birthright of freedom and independence. The presence of the representatives of Guinea-Bissau in this Assembly represents a fitting monument to all their martyrs.69.	The dramatic change in Portugal  with the acces-sion of progressive forces to the helm of affairs  has caused a new wind of change to blow in the Portuguese colonies in Africa. What Portugal has done and is definitely determined to do in Africa is  of course  of great moment in history. We welcome the recent transfer of power to an interim Government in Mozambique with the avowed purpose of granting independence to that country by June 1975  We hope that a satisfactory solution will be found for the Cape Verde Islands and that power will be transferred to the liberation movements in Angola with the least possible delay and without any local complications  either as to ethnic differences or the rights of the minority settlers. We note with pleasure and satisfaction Portugal's far-sighted vision and acceptance of the reality of the situation  and also congratulate the Secretary-General for his initiative in facilitating the pace of change.70.	We hope that the Portuguese example will enlighten the illegal regime in Zimbabwe and the racist regime in South Africa. The flood-gates of change cannot be closed by any imaginary dam  that of apartheid or any other. We applaud the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal for his condemnation of racism and apartheid from this forum [2239th meeting]. If any lesson is to be derived from the current movement  it is that South Africa would be well-advised to surrender the administration of Namibia to the United Nations in order to demonstrate that it will also change its heart. Simultaneously  South Africa should take steps to repeal all the obnoxious  repressive and dehumanizing laws  abandon apartheid  which has been declared by the Assembly to be a crime against humanity [see resolution 3068 (XXVIII)  annex]  and heed the incessant calls of this Assembly. Such a change would contribute to world peace and stability. Those who oppose change will be the architects of their own decay.71.	Bhutan is a peace-loving nation. We should be happy to see a relaxation of tense situations wherever these exist. In the opinion of our delegation  detente at the present moment has held its ground  although it is fragile. With the best will in the world we have still to work hard to strengthen and make it lasting. We feel that the trends towards detente are encouraging  but that is only one aspect of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]  and the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)  annex]. My delegation attaches great importance to the implementation of these declarations. Many steps have been taken towards strengthening international security. For example  the limited agreement achieved by SALT is already in existence. We hope that the resumed SALT talks will make further significant progress  The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is well under way. Certain important principles have been thoroughly thrashed out by the European countries which  we hope  will soon lead to worthwhile results.72.	While the major Powers are determined to securely anchor detente  the results of the Disarmament Conference are not very encouraging. We believe that the goal should be universal and complete disarmament. In the recent past  various proposals on disarmament have been made to the Assembly. Progress is painfully slow. My delegation last year also supported the resolution calling for a reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)] in the hope that the production of destructive armaments could be minimized and that the developing countries to that extent might benefit. In spite of these efforts  unfortunately  certain nuclear-weapon Powers are proceeding to accumulate deadly nuclear weapons. In view of this  a comprehensive disarmament conference has become more urgent than ever. My delegation would welcome the holding of a world disarmament conference to create conditions under which real progress could be made. Such a conference  in our opinion  might strengthen the foundations for a lasting peace  which is the highest aspiration of mankind.73.	My country does not favor nuclear proliferation. However  it seems essential that there should be a distinction between the military and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The military use of nuclear energy would be catastrophic  while its peaceful use could accelerate much needed development activities. Under existing conditions it is understandable that a developing country must search for solutions to the complex problems of development  even including the development of peaceful nuclear energy potential. It is in this spirit and context that Bhutan confidently appreciated the assurances given by India that it would . use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes.74.	We are happy to note that the truce in the Middle East is in force together with the disengagement of forces  and that UNEF is playing a valuable part in maintaining the truce conditions. The situation is still marked by uncertainty. My delegation believes that Security Council resolution 242 (1967) is still a good basis for settling the problem in the area peacefully. We hope that the parties concerned will show great understanding  and a spirit of accommodation and com-promise in abandoning all claims to territories occupied by force  and in taking into account the legitimate rights of all the parties concerned  including the Palestinians.75.	My delegation viewed with deep concern the re-cent events in Cyprus. It is gratifying to note that the two communities in Cyprus have started exchanging prisoners of war  and we hope they will engage in a fruitful dialog. We are of the conviction that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus must be restored without the use of any outside force. That will be the only way in which to demonstrate that small States  specially the non-aligned ones  can enjoy the protection of the Charter as well as fulfilling its principles and purposes.76.	Bhutan also favors the creation of areas of peace in all regions. It is in this spirit that my Government supported the principle that the Indian Ocean should be declared a zone of peace. This question has been engaging the attention of the Assembly since 1971. The Secretary-General's factual statement of the effect of the great Powers' military presence in the Indian Ocean is well known [AI9629 and Add.I  annex)  and we hope that the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean will be fruitful. My delegation fully recognizes that the Indian Ocean should be maintained as a zone of peace. If great-Power rivalry is allowed free rein  it will affect the vital interests of all the littoral States  and could also help bring about political in-stability and social and economic difficulties  which will also be felt by the hinterland States.77.	The situation in IndoChina is a good example. Although the war has officially ended  the countries concerned are stilTfavaged by the after-effects of war. We earnestly hope that the various parties concerned in those countries will soon find a peaceful solution with a view to ending all tensions and building a lasting edifice of peace in that region. In this spirit my delegation would support any move that could ensure stability and peace in the area.78.	We noted with satisfaction the consensus on the question of Korea that was reached at the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly. Unfortunately  the circumstances have not been propitious for translating the consensus into positive action. We hope that the authorities of both North and South Korea will start a dialog in pursuance of the consensus so as to achieve peaceful reunification without outside interference.79.	The international economic situation is gloomy. A perusal of some of the statements made earlier in this Assembly indicates that an economic catastrophe of a global nature is just around the corner. At the sixth special session held in April to consider the item "" Study of the problems of raw materials and development""  my delegation stated our case for international compensation to those countries that could not with-stand the pressure of the inflation brought about by the general increase in prices of the key inputs required for development. May I be permitted to quote some observations from the statement I made at the special session. I said:""Owing to their reserves and their vast resources backed by modern technology  the rich nations have been able to cushion the shock of the crisis. On the other hand  the worst victims are the developing countries  in particular the land-locked least developed countries  which find themselves in a situation in which their survival is imperiled unless immediate remedial measures are set in motion.""80.	My delegation also made the suggestion that the United Nations should seriously consider the creation of a special fund for the payment of international compensation to all the severely affected countries to tide them over the present crisis.81.	The special session of the General Assembly also indicated the countries which have been most seriously affected as being those which are at the greatest disadvantage in the world economy: the least developed  the landlocked and other low-income developing countries  and so on. But the provisional list of countries to benefit from the Special Fund of the Special Program excluded a number of land-locked and least developed countries. We hope the Ad Hoc Committee on the Special Program set up within the framework of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order will not fail to recommend the States which are in need of immediate assistance to mitigate their difficulties.82.	Although the process of socio-economic development was initiated in Bhutan only in 1961 we have achieved good progress within a short span of time. In spite of this progress  we are at present confronted with difficulties in implementing the projects envisaged in the Five-Year Plans. These problems have been caused by runaway inflation  the increasing cost of transportation and the present rise in the cost of key materials and commodities. These difficulties tend to retard the progress of our development efforts towards self-reliance. Bhutan has no key materials to export which could alleviate the burden.83.	Bearing all these factors in mind  my delegation will watch with interest the shape of things to come and the framework of the global economic order which emerges  including the reforms of the world monetary system.84.	Countries which are producers of a single commodity have become fabulously rich overnight. The transfer of monetary reserves  not only from the rich countries but also from the poor countries  to the few producers of that commodity does not appear to conform to any generally accepted economic or moral principles as understood in this decade. If the world economy is not to collapse although signs of its collapse are not wanting bringing in its wake untold sufferings for the millions of people in the third world  drastic remedies on an international scale are called for.85.	Bhutan was unable to attend the United Nations World Population Conference held at Bucharest in August. Nevertheless  we have made a preliminary examination of the report on the world Program of Action finally adopted by the Conference.5 While some of the principles of the world Program of Action are generally acceptable to us  we require more time to scrutinize the implications of the report. It is realized that a land-locked State like Bhutan should view the problem of a population explosion with due caution. In the view of my delegation the population question is linked with the problem of world food  and we look upon the inter connexion as an inevitable corollary to the increasing population and gradual decline in resources. We are happy that the World Food Conference will be IWd in Rome next month. Our delegation will be participating in the deliberations with keen interest to find solutions to the grave problems facing such a large portion of mankind.86.	My delegation has been taking a keen interest in the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The sea-bed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction have been declared by this General Assembly to be the common heritage of mankind [resolution 2749 (XXV)]. There is no doubt that this should be the key concept of any legal order that is to govern the sea and the ocean floor. Indeed  any efforts to deviate from this principle would jeopardize the hopes and the fulfillment of the needs of the developing countries  particularly the landlocked States and other States at a disadvantage geographically. The session of the Conference held at Caracas has contributed a great deal towards bringing about a comprehensive legal order. It is the hope of my delegation that during the next session  which will take place at Geneva  the needs of the various interest groups will be taken fully into account irrespective of their size and geographical position. The urgency of the situation demands that international agreement be arrived at as early as possible. However  this should not be taken to mean compromising unduly the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries. We must bring into existence a strong international regime on rational and equitable lines for the benefit of all nations. My delegation would like to stress with all emphasis that we must not make the heritage of mankind the subject of unilateral acts by either coastal States or major maritime Powers. My delegation would be willing to contribute towards bringing about a just and equitable law of the sea.87.	My delegation maintains that the United Nations is doing the best it can with the contributions of theMember States. Its achievements  whether in the political  economic or social sphere  are many and varied. For the economic and social development of the third world it is imperative that conflict situations  local wars and violations of human rights be eliminated. On the question of eliminating them  and ensuring human survival in reasonable conditions  the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  has stated:""The basic question for the United Nations and its Members  therefore  continues to be whether the necessary effort and political will can be mustered in time to make the Organization effective in meeting the overwhelming problems of our time."" [A I9601J Add. I  sect. /.]88.	I earnestly hope that the necessary efforts and the political will be forthcoming  and I would like to conclude my statement on this note of cautious optimism."
"19",1099,"BWA",29,1974,"Mr. President  on behalf of my delegation  I wish warmly to congratulate you on your election to the office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is a fitting tribute not only to you personally but also to the Government and the people of your great country  Algeria. My delegation is confident that  with your diplomatic skill and the long experience which you have had in the work of the Organization  you will guide this session through to a fruitful conclusion. I pledge my delegation's co-operation and support to you.78.	May I also take this opportunity to express my delegation's gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Benites of Ecuador  who presided so skilfully over the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly.79.	I wish also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts and contribution to world peace and devoted service to humanity.80.	For my country and my delegation  it is always a welcome pleasure to see new Members admitted to the United Nations. Thus  I salute the delegations of Bangladesh and Grenada and  through them  extend our hearty congratulations to their respective Governments and peoples.81.	But  on this particular occasion  I wish to beg representatives' indulgence for speaking emotionally on the admission of Guinea-Bissau. Guinea-Bissau's admission to the United Nations is to the African continent an act that marks the beginning of a new era in southern Africa an era which  we hope  shall at long last bring independence and freedom  peace and stability to that region. In our view  nothing will ever be the same again in that part of Africa  following the April coup in Portugal. We are happy to see our brothers from Guinea-Bissau among us  we welcome their presence and we congratulate the Government and people of Guinea-Bissau on their victory. We are aware of the enormous task ahead of them as they set themselves to the business of reconstruction and development of their country. We therefore urge the international community to give them material support.82.	It is our hope that the cease-fire of 7 September 1974 between the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] and Portugal will indeed lead to the total independence of Mozambique on 25 June 1975. We welcome that cease-fire and look forward to the admission of Mozambique to membership in the United Nations.83.	In September 1969  on the occasion of Botswana's third anniversary of independence  the President of my country  Sir Seretse Khama  addressed the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth session [1764th meeting] from this rostrum. It is now five years since that address  and Botswana has  only a few days ago  celebrated its eighth anniversary of independence  before going to the polls in less than a fortnight from today to elect a new Parliament. It is therefore fitting for me to begin by recalling the belief expressed by the President of my country in the United Nations.84.	I reaffirm the faith of my country in the principles and purposes of the Charter of the Organization. We in Botswana view the United Nations as an effective Organization through which enduring peace and progress of mankind can be assured. We believe that this world body is eminently suited to deal not only with major problems of peace and security for all nations but also with the pressing problems of human rights  self-determination  poverty and economic development. It is our view that what may be regarded as the failure of the Organization is  in fact  a reflection of the world it seeks to serve. To that extent  we share the wish of those who seek to improve it and to make it more effective.85.	The value of the United Nations to small nations  like my own  whose interests may on occasion be threatened  should not be diminished. On the contrary  the Organization should increasingly play a very important role in safeguarding peace and security for us all  in calling the attention of the international community to the pressing economic problems  and in bringing pressure to bear on the colonial and white minority regimes which practice racism and apartheid.86.	To my country  the specialized agencies of the Organization continue to be a significant source of economic development and technical assistance  and we feel honored to have benefited from such assistance.87.	The events of the past 12 months are of significance to the Organization. When the Security Council adopted resolution 242 (1967) on 22 November 1967  it was hoped that its provisions would be a framework for peace in the Middle East. The Organization of African Unity [OA U] attached great importance to the provisions of that resolution. But peace has continued to prove elusive. The prolonged tension in the Middle East  which led to the October war in 1973  was for my country a truly sad development.88.	Botswana has never supported any view which denies the existence of the State of Israel. Equally  we reject as inadmissible Israel's acquisition of Arab lands through the use of force. Regrettably  both the 1967 and 1973 wars have resulted in such acquisitions by Israel. We urge Israel to vacate those lands  if only in deference to international law  which protects all States alike. In our view  such withdrawal would constitute a serious step towards peace and security in the region. My delegation believes that any settlement of the Middle East issue must also take into account the interests of Palestinians if it is to guarantee any measure of permanent peace in the area.89.	Another dangerous conflict has recently occurred in Cyprus. Apart from membership in the United Nations and in OAU  Botswana is a member of the non- aligned group of nations  and so is Cyprus. The independence of Cyprus should be safeguarded out of respect for the principle of self-determination. We hope and trust that peace and calm will return to that em-battled island. We equally hope that  with such calm  that nation's independence will be guaranteed through a negotiated settlement. Consequently  my country does not favor any annexation of that State  or of any part of it  by any Power.90.	We commend the efforts of the United Nations in seeking to restore peace to that country  and hope that the parties concerned will respect its role in this connexion. My country continues in a modest way to contribute to the maintenance of UNFICYP.91.	The consequences of the recent hostilities  which have rendered homeless almost one third of that country's population  are of concern to us. We trust that other nations  particularly the non-aligned  as well as the parties directly concerned  will continue jointly to co-operate with and support the efforts of the United Nations.92.	My country continues to observe with keen interest events in other parts of the world. We know that in South-East Asia fighting is still raging  and that areas of friction and conflict still exist. Closer to us  in southern Africa  wars of liberation are continuing. The relations of world Powers are of immediate interest to us. The possibilities for world-wide conflict and confrontation have yet to be totally eliminated. If  indeed  the spirit of rapprochement and accommodation  which has been talked about so much over the past few years  is a new development which augurs well for the future of mankind  it is to be hoped that its forces will be used to eliminate the lingering areas of conflict. We hope that this spirit of detente  which we welcome  does not contain elements which could lead to greater rivalries and greater confrontations.93.	The developing nations cannot be expected to welcome a new development which seeks to serve only the desires of a club of nations  leaving aside other pressing problems of the world which continue to confront the United Nations. It is the hope of my delegation that the developing nations as well as the major Powers will join together  in the interests of peace and security  equality and self-determination  to work for the creation of a new spirit that can benefit all of mankind.94.	Being only eight years old  my country is relatively new to the international scene. However  the aspirations of mankind today are obvious to all of us. None of us can remain aloof any longer. The new spirit of co-operation which I have referred to should address itself to these aspirations by providing solutions to the most pressing problem facing us: the realization of economic and social progress. My Government has committed itself fully to pursuing this task as vigorously as ever. Therefore  in the international context  it is the view of my delegation that economic and social progress is also one of the main concerns of the United Nations.95.	Although this concern has been clearly reflected also by the many conferences held in the past years  it seems to us that those held with the last 12 months demonstrate beyond any shadow of doubt the concern of all Members of the Organization in this regard. And here we can recall the attempts of the sixth special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development  held in April this year; the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas recently; and the World Population Conference  held at Bucharest several weeks ago. In all those Conferences the concern of the world community was the same: economic and social progress or  more specifically  the ever-widening gap between the standard of living of the developing nations and the industrialized Powers; the world food situation  which is becoming more and more critical; the problem of population management and the equitable sharing of resources; and the havoc wrought on the economies of nations by the energy crisis.96.	Indeed  the eradication of poverty  illiteracy  hunger  disease and other sources of human suffering and misery should remain the concern of us all  individually as well as collectively. Our desire for economic and social progress should be translated into meaningful schemes and programs of assistance from which the needy and most deserving can benefit.97.	I speak openly on the problems of economic and social progress  fully aware that my nation is small  and with the full knowledge that compared with other nations our effort or contribution is bound to be small. For indeed  my country has no assistance programs or financing schemes to offer to the international community  in this regard  we are recipients of aid. However  we developing nations are eager to make any contribution  however small. Thus my country has every reason to be proud of its effort and contribution  given the state of its economic development.98.	My delegation wishes to commend the spirit with which the sixth special session of the General Assembly was convened. Yet we must bemoan the fact that no sooner had that session ended than the enthusiasm for it vanished. The economic situation in the third world has worsened over the last 12 months. Economic growth is at a standstill. In some cases  the reversal of economic progress has been the result  especially following the recent energy crisis.99.	If the apparent lack of enthusiasm is the unfortunate result of pointing accusing fingers at any one group of countries as being responsible for some of these problems  might I add that it is neither the wish nor the intention of my delegation to find a scapegoat. And in this regard  may I compliment those countries  developing or developed  which have come to the rescue of the less fortunate countries.100.	Clearly  the magnitude of recent as well as perennial economic problems has emphasized the need for multilateral action. We hope that the international community  especially those countries with the means to do so  will respond to this situation. The tendency to emphasize  either unilateral or bilateral action might prove self-defeating. We must come to the rescue of those among us who need help most.101.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which convened in Caracas  Venezuela  this past summer  dealt with issues of importance to our community of nations. It is no surprise to my country that the international community should attach such great importance to the development and codification of the law of the sea. This is indeed a welcome development.102.	The Caracas session and indeed its predecessors was significant in more than one way. First  it had representation from all sectors of the international community. In this connexion  it broke with past traditions. Secondly  for the first time the Conference has a comprehensive agenda. We were happy to note that most  if not all  interests were reflected in it.103.	My country is land-locked. And while we appreciate the rationale for devising a law which will create order and promote a rational management and exploitation of the resources of the sea  my country  as a land-locked State  has specific interests to protect and promote. Hence our effective participation at the Caracas session and our intention to continue to do so at future sessions. It is vital to my country that the right of free access of land-locked States to and from the sea should be recognized and enshrined in any future treaty on the law of the sea. Equally important is a guarantee in any such treaty of an unfettered transit of goods and persons of land-locked States.104.	We naturally attach great importance to the question of the common heritage of mankind. Therefore  it is important to us that the international seabed be a viable area  and not just a barren left-over. We also attach significance to the type of international sea-bed authority which will be created to govern the area. In our view  the authority should not only control and manage the area and its resources but should also have title to it. Consequently  the authority must be vested with full powers to function effectively as a trustee of mankind as a whole. Above all  we envisage an authority which would engage directly in exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed.105.	I would like to affirm that my country supports the creation of economic zones by coastal States. However  it is the view of my country that regional land-locked States should participate on an equal basis with regional coastal States in the exploitation of the marine resources of such zones. Equally  the question of scientific research and the dissemination of the results of such research  in both the economic zone and the international sea-bed area  is important to my country.106.	My delegation would also urge that the interests of developing countries which produce land-based minerals similar to those found in the sea-bed areas be borne in mind. We look forward to promoting these interests at the next session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea.107.	Decolonization and self-determination are some of the major preoccupations of the Organization  as are racism and apartheid. For many important reasons our white minority-ruled neighbors continue to be our major preoccupation. For my country  the continued existence of colonial and white minority regimes in southern Africa is an everyday reality. One has only to recall the tracts of land on which we have settled several thousand refugees  or the explosions which have already spilled innocent African blood on our own soil  to understand the situation. Hardly a day goes by without our being affected in one way or the other.108.	The emergence of a new Government in Portugal several months ago brought to an end almost half a century of dictatorship in that country. The crumbling of that dictatorship should in real terms signal the crumbling of colonialism in Africa. My delegation is confident that all States Members of the United Nations will feel able to support this view. As for the third-world countries  there can be no doubt about their commitment to this cause.109.	The new Portuguese Government has already made known its preparedness to grant independence to Mozambique and to Angola. My delegation welcomes the cease-fire declaration of 7 September 1974 in Lusaka between Portugal and FRELIMO. The arrangements for the transfer of power from Portugal to the heroic people of Mozambique are  indeed  a fitting tribute to the valiant struggle for self-determination and independence waged by FRELIMO.110.	We hold in contempt the futile attempts by reactionary white settlers in Mozambique to seize control of that African country in total disregard of the constitutional rights of the people and in violation of the constitutional method for the transfer of power to the legitimate representatives of Mozambique. The responsibility of Portugal and of the international community to ensure the success of the transitional Government in Mozambique  so that the preparations are completed for full independence in June 1975  is now very obvious.111.	The reactionary element of the white settler community in Mozambique is inspired by the existence of minority-ruled States- in the neighboring areas. It is in the interest of Portugal and of the entire international community to liquidate the resistance of such communities wherever such resistance occurs. The total liberation and independence of Mozambique is a further contribution to peace and stability in the region and to peace and security in the continent. We commend the new Portuguese Government for recognizing the right of the people of Mozambique to independence. We salute the heroic people of Mozambique for this victory and in the same vein welcome the Government in Mozambique.112.	In any situation of colonialism where issues are unclear  where directions remain equivocal  and where negotiations remain meaningless  the liberation forces can have no alternative but to intensify the struggle. The right to independence is not negotiable  and  consequently  we reject the notion of referendum s. We consider that the freedom movements concerned express the wishes and sentiments of the people of these Territories  and that  in collaboration with these peoples  those' movements are capable of engaging in meaningful consultations to work out an acceptable method for the transfer of power. Therefore  we would like  while commending Portugal  to urge that efforts be intensified to speed up the total liberation of the State of Angola.113.	The African countries still feel committed to  and are prepared to honor  the Manifesto onJSouthern Africa  signed at Lusaka on 16 April 1969. However  this noble commitment continues to be conditional upon colonial and white minority regimes in southern Africa first accepting fully the principle of self-determination. We urge all of them to adjust to the new situation.114.	We all witnessed a very sad development on 30 July 1974  when 80 per cent of the white voters in Southern Rhodesia all in all numbering only around 83 000 in an African country with a population of close to 5 million voted Smith's regime back to power. My delegation finds that intolerable.115.	Instead of negotiating in good faith with the African nationalists  the Smith regime has chosen to harass them while consolidating itself. It can thus be seen why the African people in Southern Rhodesia would vow to dislodge this regime by all means avail-able. We urge the international community to intensify its efforts towards a just solution to the Rhodesian problem.116.	There is no doubt that the United Kingdom has an outstanding responsibility in Rhodesia  and we agree with those who have said that there can be no satisfactory settlement without the agreement of the African people in Southern Rhodesia. We hope that the United Kingdom will intensify its search for a solution of this problem. My country continues to make sacrifices  economically as well as otherwise  in an effort to assist and join with those who seek a lasting solution to this problem. In our view  the search for a solution should take into account the importance of the participation of the recognized leaders of the African people in Rhodesia. A concerted effort should be made to eliminate foreign elements in Rhodesia which could make the white minority regime even more intransigent. The international community should call on those among us who are in a better position to do so to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Smith regime.117.	As with Southern Rhodesia  the situation in Namibia shows no sign of meaningful change. While  because of our geographical position in southern Africa and our long border with South Africa  the functional relationship between my country and South Africa has not changed in any way  we continue to disapprove very strongly of South Africa's racial policies. And in this connexion  we regret that such policies are being extended to Namibia  a Trust Territory of the United Nations. Namibians are our neighbors and brothers. We have always recognized the legitimacy of their struggle for freedom and independence. My country continues to support General Assembly resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966  the effect of which was to transfer the administration of Namibia to the United Nations. My Government abides by the most recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice with respect to that Territory.1 Consequently  my country deplores the present situation  as well as the continued suppression of liberties by South Africa in that Territory.118.	My delegation believes that there can be no future for white minority regimes in Africa. However  the choice of whether democracy and equality will come peacefully or through a violent struggle clearly rests with those regimes. The ultimate objective of liberation itself will never be compromised. Adjustment now could avoid a situation which threatens peace and stability in the region. Since its independence  my country has  with little effect  made its own efforts to influence those concerned to refrain from intensifying racial policies and to work for the bringing about of change  in recognition of the rights of black people in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa.119.	We have called increasingly upon the inter-national community to pay attention to white-ruled southern Africa and the suffering of the black populations there as a result of their being denied freedom  self-determination and equality. We continue to deplore the rigorous oppression and suppression of liberties in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. We renew our appeal to the international community to strengthen its efforts to influence events in the region. In this connexion  it is our hope that all nations of the world  particularly the western countries  will demonstrate in word and in deed their total abhorrence and rejection of the institutionalized system of racism and apartheid. As for ourselves  there can be no other way.120.	We have been invited to engage in a constructive debate during the current session. Indeed  proposals have already been placed before us for our consideration. My delegation will respond positively to this when we come to consider the resolutions and decisions which we shall make and adopt at a later stage. Allow me  therefore  to conclude by conveying to the Organization  and through it to the delegations of Member States represented here  as well as to our brothers in the freedom movement  the greetings of the people of Botswana. Our foreign missions and embassies are very few in number. But we have friends in all continents. It remains our ardent desire to have more friends. Our membership of the Organization is in itself a source of strength. We take comfort in the knowledge that our problems are also the problems of our friends."
"20",1143,"CAF",29,1974,"Mr. President  after so many voices which have been heard from this rostrum expressing to you in different terms and in different languages congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly it would seem gratuitous at this stage of our work to reflect another sentiment which has already been expressed. However  in associating myself humbly with the compliments that have been paid you I am convinced that I am not simply discharging a traditional duty or making a gesture of international courtesy  but am  in fact  lauding with pride the exceptional merits of my brother  Abdelaziz Bouteflika  to whom I am bound by so many positive ties  which I would not like to go into now if only to avoid offending his legendary modesty and exposing myself to disapproval.73.	You are a worthy and valiant son of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  which maintained special relations of fraternal co-operation with my own country  the Central African Republic. The Algerian Republic is undeniably in the forefront of the nations which truly deserve to be called revolutionary. It is precisely this well-thought-out  practical  effective and proud revolution  that in their acts my own head of State  Jean-Bedel Bokassa  President for Life  Marshal of the Central African Republic  and his Government  have been carrying out since 1966  following the example of Algeria  for the benefit of the hard-working people of the Central African Republic.74.	Your election is a three-fold victory: a victory for the policy of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  to which our two countries are both happy and proud to belong and which reached its apogee at the historic Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers in September 1973; a victory of the oppressed peoples  particularly of the African peoples  over colonialism  imperialism and racial discrimination  and also of the struggle for freedom and independence; and a personal victory because of your great statesmanlike qualities and your vast experience of international problems. This in my view constitutes a sure guarantee of the success of our work. In the discharge of your heavy responsibilities  I should like to assure you  Mr. President  of the unreserved support and the effective cooperation of the Central African delegation.75.	I should also like to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Benites of Ecuador  for the devotion and competence with which he discharged the delicate task of conducting so successfully the proceedings of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.76.	The praiseworthy efforts so ceaselessly deployed with courage and determination by the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  ever since he took up the office  both for the sake of the total liberation of the territories still under foreign domination and for the maintenance and restoration of peace throughout the world  compel our admiration. May he find here an expression of our deep gratitude and our most sincere wishes for success in the performance of his noble task.77.	My delegation was very much distressed to hear of the catastrophe which has plunged Honduras into mourning and we would request the delegation of that friendly country to be good enough to accept and convey to its Government and people our deepest condolences.78.	The opening of this session has been  marked by the admission of three new States Members to the Organization. We are happy to welcome to this hall the representatives of Bangladesh  Grenada and our sister Republic of Guinea-Bissau  to which we would convey our warm and fraternal congratulations  accompanied by our best wishes for happiness and prosperity for their peoples.79.	The twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is taking place against a background of important international events and changes. Indeed  in spite of tireless efforts to bring about detente  the number of conflicts involving a resort to force has not been reduced. We are witnessing helplessly an unbridled arms race  constantly accompanied by assurances of detente and false promises of disarmament.80.	The already disastrous economic situation in parts of the world  particularly in developing countries  continues to worsen at a dizzying rate under the pernicious influence of galloping inflation  provoked by monetary disorder.81.	the distance between the proclamation of human rights and the actual implementation of those rights continues to increase in a way that is intolerable for southern Africa.82.	In accordance with its peace-loving policy  its attachment to the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations  the Central African Republic attaches primary importance to problems relating to decolonization in Africa. In this regard  my delegation takes pleasure in the current developments in the colonies under Portuguese domination. We should like to take this opportunity warmly to congratulate the liberation movements of Guinea-Bissau  the Cape Verde Islands  Angola and Mozambique on their recent victories  which have crowned their heroic struggles for self-determination and independence. The overturn of the Fascist regime of Caetano was the decisive event in the dynamic struggle being waged by African nationalists. This struggle first made possible the liberation of Portugal itself from dictatorship and thus opened up the prospects and new horizons for the self-determination and independence of the colonies.83.	My delegation is convinced that the political acumen which the representatives of the new Lisbon Government have so far displayed will be consistently maintained and that the application of the principles of independence will be extended soon to Mozambique  Angola  the Cape Verde Islands and other Territories still under Portuguese domination. In this regard  we have followed most attentively the profession of faith made here  from this very rostrum  on 23 September 1974 [2239th meeting] by Mr. Soares  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the ""new"" Portugal  and also the program of action of the new Portuguese Government.84.	Convinced that these promises will be honored  and aware of the efforts which have been undertaken since last April to put this program into effect  the Central African Government is ready to establish diplomatic relations with the new Portugal.85.	With regard to the decolonization of the so- called Spanish Sahara  which is of concern primarily to the African continent  as is indeed the case of the other Territories still under foreign domination  the question arises of the attitude of the Spanish Government and the future of those Territories. The Spanish Government has refused and still refuses to apply strictly and scrupulously the principles of decolonization. In spite of the numerous relevant resolutions of our distinguished General Assembly  calling upon Spain to accelerate the process of decolonization  particularly by withdrawing the occupation troops and allowing the refugees to return to their homes  by permitting the visit of an inspection mission from the United Nations and the opening of negotiations on the problem of the sovereignty of the Territories in question  Spain persists in doing everything in its power to perpetuate its colonial domination in this region.86.	The future of those Territories has always posed the problem of sovereignty  and our august Assembly has always wished to provide for consultations between the two countries concerned; Morocco and Mauritania. My delegation is gratified by the fact that those two fraternal countries  relying on the wisdom and authority of the higher instances of our Organization  should have decided  in the conflict between them and Spain  to submit the problem to the International Court of Justice.87.	The Central African Government unreservedly supports this prudent position adopted by Morocco and Mauritania  countries with which my country enjoys fraternal relations  and hopes that the General Assembly will do everything in its power to bring about the implementation of this procedure so as to give  the principles of the Charter a true interpretation.88.	We have also noted with genuine satisfaction the statement made a few days ago from this rostrum by the Foreign Minister of the French Republic  Mr. Sauvagnargues [2238th meeting]  expressing the willingness of his Government to grant independence to the Comoro Archipelago. This action  which is no surprise to us  is in perfect conformity with the political policy of France ever since the time of General de Gaulle  and we can only share our pleasure with the people of the Comoros.89.	The example of the recent developments in Portugal should serve as a lesson to the minority and racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia  where the dignity of the colored man is still constantly trampled underfoot. The Central African Republic would like to reaffirm here its complete disapproval of the outrageous policy of apartheid  and considers that the obstinate refusals of the Pretoria and Salisbury regimes to heed the international appeals that have been made are a challenge to the international community.90.	It is clear that the wind of liberty which is blowing through Africa will not spare southern Africa. We are firmly convinced that it is imperative that effective measures should be taken to enable the United Nations to play a more active role in the elimination of racial discrimination in southern Africa. That is why we are gratified at the decision taken by an overwhelming majority by the General Assembly on 30 September 1974 [resolution 3207 (XXIX)} calling upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa in the light of the constant violation by South Africa of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.91.	On the subject of the environment  Mr. Maurice Strong said in Addis Ababa on 23 August 1971  whenhe was Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment:""The United Nations can be only as successful as its Members permit it to be; it can be effective only to the extent that its Members wish it to be; it can be strong only if the political will of Governments grant it strength. I am convinced that in facing the challenge of the environment the United Nations will also be sowing the seeds of its future greatness and that those seeds will take root and flower in soil which must be saved for the good of the human family.""92.	Indeed  the Government of the Central African Republic  aware that from a global standpoint there is a definite interdependence between the environment and development  aware also that any approach to the environment problem must necessarily embrace all the aspects of human life  nourishes the hope that the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  proclaimed in resolution 3223 (XXIX)  will rid southern Africa for ever of the substances primarily responsible for polluting human dignity -that is  apartheid or racial discrimination  Vorster or Ian Smith.93.	For more than a quarter of a century the Middle East conflict has constantly been on the General Assembly's agenda. In the Central African Republic we take some satisfaction to see the disengagement agreements signed concerning Sinai and the Golan Heights. We should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the leaders of the countries directly concerned on their wisdom and their spirit of conciliation. In our opinion  those agreements are only a first step towards a withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and a recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. In that respect we are gratified that the Palestine question has been included in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We place great hopes in the results of the discussions to be held on that question.94.	Hardly had the first steps been taken towards a solution of the Middle East problem than the Cyprus conflict broke out  once again making the eastern Mediterranean a theater of strife. The tragedy we are witnessing in Cyprus is that of two communities which are obliged to live together but cannot manage to agree on the way to do that in peace and harmony. Once again  the most serious danger in that conflict lies in the intervention of foreign Powers in the internal affairs of the island. Indeed  these events endanger the independence and territorial integrity of that country and hence pose a great threat to international peace and security. We hope that all the parties concerned in this conflict will soon reach a negotiated settlement  thereby ensuring the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus.95.	Two years have passed since the Paris agreements on Viet Nam were signed  but peace has not been restored to IndoChina. The delegation of the Central African Republic notes with bitterness the lack of will on the part of the countries concerned in that conflict to put into effect the provisions of the Paris agreements for a peaceful settlement. We remain convinced that peace in Viet Nam can result only from respect for and strict implementation of the Paris agreements.96.	With regard to Cambodia  the Central African Republic continues to support the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. We continue also to support the efforts to restore that Government's legitimate rights in the United Nations.97.	We note with concern that no progress has been made in the talks between North and South Korea. We still believe that the most realistic way to solve the Korean problem peacefully is and remains a continuation of the talks and a widening of the exchanges and co-operation between the two Koreas  with the aim of accelerating the independent and peaceful unification of the country  in accordance with the consensus unanimously adopted at the General Assembly's twenty-eighth session.98.	International co-operation between the industrialized countries and those of the third world is far from satisfactory. As we stated from this very rostrum three years ago:""For us  in a low income country  the most important objective is and remains the economic and social progress of our people. That is the top priority.""2That is why Mr. Jean-Bedel Bokassa  President of the Central African Republic  said on 1 January 1966  when he became head of State: ""People can't eat politics"".99.	Since then the Central African Republic sometimes called ""African Switzerland"" -has been constantly cultivating peace  in the first place with its immediate neighbors and then with the entire world. We believe that His Holiness Pope Paul VI was quite right when he conferred on the head of State of the Central African Republic the title of ""Pilgrim of Peace"" during an audience granted to our head of State by the Pope at his summer residence in Castel- gondolfo in August 1970. All the nations of the world  large  middle-sized or small  need that peace to develop harmoniously and to ensure the welfare and prosperity of their peoples.100.	That is why all intelligent and objective observers agree that our foreign and domestic policy is based essentially on economic movement and the Bokassa Operation  a truly original strategy for the economic  social and cultural development of our country  resulting from the new breath of life and the new mentality in the Central African Republic and its people  determined to set to work to defend the idea of each nation's sovereignty over its own natural resources  of its right to retrieve them and use them freely.101.	But the efforts which we constantly exert within the framework of the Bokassa Operation  whose good effects have already spread beyond our frontiers  are unfortunately being counteracted by natural phenomena resulting from the fact that we are a landlocked country  more than 1 500 kilometers away from the Atlantic Ocean on the one hand and the Red Sea on the other. That is why  in his message to the nation on 1 January 1974  the head of State of the Central African Republic proclaimed 1974 as the year in which the Central African Republic would come out of its enclave. All our efforts are directed towards the achievement of that objective  and we are sure they will succeed  thanks to the help of countries friendly to the Central African Republic.102.	To those major difficulties resulting from our geographical position we must unfortunately add the malicious though skillful attempts to stifle our country  the Central African Republic  despite the relevant resolutions of the Organization  and particularly General Assembly resolution 3169 (XXVIII) on special measures related to the particular needs of the landlocked developing countries.103.	In that connexion  we are entitled to ask: Did we choose to be situated where we are  to be a landlocked country? What has happened to this duty of solidarity which we constantly clamor for in all the bodies' of international and regional organizations?104.	We in the Central African Republic believe that the United Nations must use all its influence in the specialized agencies dealing with loans and development to encourage greater assistance to the less endowed countries  particularly those that are landlocked and  as I have said  that includes the Central African Republic.105.	It is along this line of thinking that we attach great importance to the rapid completion of the Trans- African road  which will service the Central African Republic and will constitute one of the essential elements in strengthening African unity. But completion of the railroad to link Bangui  the capital of the Central African Republic  to the Trans-Cameroonian line is and remains a vital element for our national economy.106.	We are happy because after much hesitation  vacillation and manoeuvring  the only reasons for which are the schemes and bad faith of those responsible  certain international financial organizations and certain friendly countries have accepted the justice of our view and have become interested in building this railroad.107.	Indeed  how can one fail to be interested in the development of a country such as the Central African Republic  which not only abounds with natural resources of all kinds  but opens wide its doors to all investors  public or private  from wherever they may come.108.	Finally  we wish to denounce once again a regrettable tendency of certain countries  which claim to be friendly  and which often in bad faith cannot or will not meet their obligation of international solidarity  to resort to empty excuses  saying that they cannot grant assistance to our country without obtaining the prior agreement of a certain great Power which  moreover  is our friend  and which has excellent relations with us in every field. By such action we consider that those countries show contempt for us  and ignore the fact that the Central African Republic is a sovereign  free and independent country with sole responsibility for its own destiny.109.	May I explain our profound disappointment with regard to certain brother and friendly countries which  far from understanding the gesture of solidarity which they demanded of us at a difficult time in their history  have done nothing in return  although they could give us a simple acknowledgment of their appreciation  even by a symbolic gesture  which we really need  instead of flooding European and American banks with unproductive capital.110.	On 3 October 1972  we made the following statement from this rostrum:""Today the ideas of peace and security  of development and wide-scale multilateral co-operation are supported and appreciated by an ever-growing number of countries. Real conditions exist  such as trade and international economic relations that  we are sure  can become important factors in the maintenance and strengthening of peace and economic and social progress.""3111.	We also expressed the fervent hope that the United Nations would be able to bring together the developed and the developing countries into a network of co-operation in the economic  commercial  technical and other fields. In so doing  it would greatly contribute to the transformation of the human condition in an ever-changing world full of inequalities. For one of those inequalities -and this is no secret to anyone -is the constant deterioration in the terms of trade for under-developed countries which have vast resources and which are conducting a determined fight for the well-being of their peoples.112.	The Assembly will understand our pleasure in reiterating our satisfaction at the welcome initiative taken by Mr. Houari Boumediene  President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  in convening the historic sixth special session devoted for the first time solely to .consideration of the problems concerning raw materials and development. As we all know  the special session of the General Assembly was an event of great impact  crowned by the adoption of two documents whose importance is recognized by all: the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.113.	The special session laid the foundations  in the interests of the whole international community  for free economic co-operation among independent and sovereign nations. In so doing  it helped to put an end to the deplorable post-war economic situation  characterized by a deterioration in the terms of trade and the broadening and deepening of the existing gap between the rich and poor countries  a gap which in the long run threatens the security and the survival of our economy.114.	Although major results were obtained during the sixth special session  today our world must wonder about the viability of the economic system on which it has always relied. Is it likely to promote social justice and progress for all  and at the same time prevent major upheavals in the political balance of the world?115.	The continuing misgivings of public opinion are due to the inability of the international community to meet the most elementary needs of the peoples on our planet.116.	The Special Program of emergency assistance  adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly  and the multilateral and bilateral initiatives  are encouraging evidence of international solidarity. Let us all hope that those programs will develop fully and will be supported so that an acceptable rate of development can be maintained everywhere in the forthcoming years.117.	It is absurd that certain large countries  instead of wanting to or trying to control inflation -the ill- effects of which never cease to plague the poor countries -and rapidly to rebuild an international monetary system with the assistance of all the Members of our Organization  now claim that the price of the oil is the fundamental cause of the crisis looming over us.118.	But we sincerely believe that this crisis cannot be dealt with or overcome without a world economic plan. Such a plan is of concern to the whole international community  particularly the third world  already poor    which is the most severely affected by the present economic situation.119.	In closing this chapter  I would say that what is being challenged is a political economy rather than an economic policy. The legitimate hope of a new order is spreading among all the nations of our planet. The old world is breaking up and disappearing; the new world that we desire with all our hearts is struggling to emerge.120.	But for that change to take place  the United Nations must be more effective. Our Organization is not functioning as we would have wished. Hence the need to revise the Charter  which is even more justified today because of a current democratization now prevailing in international relations. The sole fact that many States which in 1945 were colonies have been able to accede to the Charter since their attainment of independence militates in favor of the revision of the Charter.121.	In an international community such as ours  made up of such diverse States  with legal systems and political institutions that reflect their economic and social conditions  one cannot impose an international order which no longer represents mankind as a whole.122.	The Central African delegation does not consider that the Charter is a sacrosanct document which cannot be changed. The course of events since the entry into force of the Charter requires its revision. Thus the delegation of the Central African Republic is pleased to see that item on the agenda of this session [item 95]  and we are prepared  to study it carefully and give constructive consideration to proposals to revise the Charter.123.	I have drawn the attention of this Assembly to the serious problems of the hour which concern us all and which threaten world peace. Their solution depends on the devotion of each of us to strict compliance with the principles of the Charter in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect. Although I cannot hope to see those problems solved at this session  may I at least hope that a new spirit will emerge  a gleam of hope for a better world  and say  with the poet Vercors  ""Tomorrow will be a beautiful day""."
"21",1187,"CAN",29,1974,"I take great pleasure in joining speakers who have preceded me in congratulating the President on his election to that high office. My delegation is confident that under his wise guidance this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will create the climate necessary to deal with the new world outlook so many speakers have foreseen during this general debate.69.	We are particularly aware of the leading role of the President's country in the non-aligned movement. Indeed  the initiative which Algeria took in calling for the special convocation of this Assembly earlier this year will be of signal importance to the work of this Organization in the months and years ahead. The aims of the non-aligned countries as enunciated by President Boumediene in this Hall at the sixth special session [2208th meeting] merit recollection as we commence our work: the emancipation of all peoples in the context of international co-operation based on the equality of States  respect for national sovereignty and the establishment of a just peace throughout the world. These are ideals to which we can all readily subscribe.70.	The presence among us for the first time of the delegations from the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  following the accession of those three States to membership  is evidence of the continued march of this world Organization towards universality. Canada was a sponsor of each of the three resolutions supporting their membership and we are confident that each of those countries will make a distinctive contribution to our work at this session and in the future.71.	We in Canada have been deeply moved by the tragic aftermath of the hurricane which has devastated Honduras and surrounding regions. We heard this morning from the Foreign Minister of that country an appeal for international assistance. In this connexion the Government of Canada has decided to allocate $525 000 for emergency relief efforts in areas affected by this natural disaster.72.	Some of the major political problems which faced the United Nations during its early years have now receded and no longer figure so prominently in its deliberations. In particular  the cold war is giving way to growing co-operation and detente.73.	The last two decades have witnessed the resolute progress of peoples under colonial rule towards self-determination and independence. The past few months have seen particularly encouraging developments in the African Territories which have been or remain under Portuguese administration. Guinea-Bissau has now attained its independence and negotiations to the same end are under way with regard to Mozambique and Angola. It is a matter of satisfaction to all supporters of the United Nations that Portugal has agreed to work with the appropriate United Nations bodies in the process of decolonization. We in Canada welcome these developments and offer our encouragement to the Portuguese and African peoples concerned in their search for early equitable and peaceful solutions to remaining problems.74.	Elsewhere  some fragile yet hopeful progress has been made in the past year towards settling certain of the regional conflicts that still exist. Lest we be lulled into an unrealistic sense of security  however  the recent events i"" Cyprus serve to remind us how quickly a slowly simmering dispute can degenerate into a serious threat to international peace and security.75.	If we have in the past months been reminded of the fragility of international peace and security  we have also come to realize the fragility of international monetary and trade relations. Accelerating rates of inflation and declining rates of growth  high interest rates and low stock prices  together with a widespread sense of unease  mark the problems facing the international economy. There is no doubt that the higher energy costs will require much more financing and in time massive adjustments on the part of those countries  both developed and developing  whose payments positions have been most severely affected.76.	No people or government can of itself deal with the problems of inflation and unemployment  of trade imbalances and currency fluctuations. None will be immune if short-sighted and selfish policies lead to graver repercussions. These are not simply technical problems questions of currency flows  trade barriers  and exchange rates they are matters of human dignity. Unemployment  malnutrition  starvation and lack of shelter are an affront to all of us. We ignore them at the risk of our own welfare and security.77.	A renewal and strengthening of international co-operation is an urgent requirement if we are to sustain social progress and economic development. We all have a responsibility to contribute to such co-operation. Those countries which command massive financial resources have  however  a special responsibility for seeing that such resources are invested in a helpful and constructive manner  and that their use strengthens  rather than disturbs  the health of the world economy.78.	At the present time there is no more urgent development issue than the vigor of the world economy. When production and demand falter  all of us whether developed or developing suffer. Difficulties in the developed countries translate into distress in developing countries and something akin to disaster in the most seriously affected.79.	If there are grounds for apprehension there are also signs of hope: some important steps have been taken in IMF towards a systematic and progressive reordering of the monetary system; the onset of a major trade negotiation appears to be drawing nearer; a number of industrialized countries have pledged themselves to exert their best efforts to avoid measures restrictive of trade in response to balance-of- payment difficulties.80.	But much more still needs to be done. Development assistance should be maintained and  where possible  increased.. The responsible international institutions should be strongly supported. The habit of consultation should be strengthened.81.	Those considerations will influence Canada's thinking at this session of the General Assembly  as at other international meetings. There are two such meetings to which I wish to draw special attention. This autumn  Governments will meet at the World Food Conference to adopt a program aimed at securing a sufficiency of food for all. Next year they will meet here in New York at the seventh special session  on development. The Canadian Government attaches great importance to the work of these conferences. We will exert our very best efforts to ensure their success.82.	In seeking solutions to our political and economic problems we cannot forget that we face another pressing task: to ensure that human beings are alive to enjoy the improved circumstances that we are seeking for them.83.	Our security is threatened more than ever today by developments in nuclear and conventional warfare. One of the most urgent problems of our time is how to bring the nuclear arms race under CGntrol in order to ensure international stability and the avoidance of nuclear war. The nuclear Powers have a direct responsibility for overcoming this grave problem. At the same time that we face-the immediate dangers of existing nuclear arsenals we are confronted as the Secretary-General has warned-— with a heightened risk of the wider dissemination of such arsenals. Here all States have a responsibility. Canada takes seriously its share of that responsibility.84.	Specifically  the problem we face is to devise a system which will allow the dissemination of the benefits of nuclear energy without at the same time contributing to the spread of nuclear weapons. The international community has attempted to devise a system to cope with this problem. Canada has been very active in this endeavor. But the system could be strengthened further.85.	We have developed a valuable system of nuclear power generation and we believe that nuclear power should not be withheld from those whose energy needs can best be met by this method. We are deeply committed to the cause of international development  but equally we are anxious to avoid contributing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.86.	In addition to our requirements  and subject to security and resource limitations  we want to make our nuclear power generating system available to other countries. However  until more adequate internationally agreed measures are instituted  Canada intends to satisfy itself that any country using Canadian-supplied nuclear technology or material will be subject to binding obligations that the technology or material will not be used in the fabrication of nuclear explosive devices for whatever purpose. To that end Canada attaches special importance to the role of nuclear safeguards applied by IAEA.87.	The need for truly effective anti-proliferation measures fully accepted and applied by the international community is now pressing. The nuclear technology involved is. no longer beyond the reach of a growing number c. countries. The costs of developing a nuclear explosive device are no longer prohibitive. The principal problem is to obtain the necessary materials. Every day more and more of these materials are being developed throughout the world and the problem of controlling their movement  as well as their use  is becoming proportionately greater.	88.	The phenomenon of proliferation is  in political terms  something like a nuclear chain reaction. With the successful explosion of a nuclear device by each newcomer to the ranks of the nuclear Powers  greater grows the desire of other countries to ""go nuclear"". In a world without truly effective safeguards they feel their national existence threatened. If each new nuclear-weapon State prompted its neighbor to follow its example  all concerned would find their security quickly undermined.89.	We believe that it is the very existence of nuclear explosive devices that presents the hazard to humanity and it increases in proportion to the number of countries possessing them. One net J make no distinction in terms of what countries possess such devices. The danger lies as much in the number of countries that have them  as in the policies of the possessors.90.	If we are to avoid a nuclear catastrophe we must accept the fact that there are practical limits to the application of the principle of non-discrimination. The Canadian Government urges the international community to accept the obligation not to contribute to the uncontrolled spread of nuclear explosive capability  and the safeguards required to ensure compliance with that obligation.91.	Our aim is to secure international measures which will halt both the multiplication and the wider dissemination of nuclear weapons  and which  will check the spread of the technology of nuclear explosive devices and the further development of that technology as applied to nuclear weapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the efforts to limit strategic arms  and the achievement of a comprehensive test ban are designed to achieve these objectives.92.	As for the halting of the proliferation of nuclear weapons  all States should undertake not to transfer nuclear technology or materials except under inter-national supervision aimed at ensuring that the transfer is not used for fabricating nuclear explosive devices. In addition  all States should place the inventories of the nuclear fissile material that they hold for peaceful purposes under international supervision. Nuclear- weapon States should  as a first step towards this objective  place their peaceful nuclear facilities under this supervision and seek to halt their production of fissile material for weapons purposes. International supervision of fissile material is the best available means for .the international community to be assured of each State's peaceful intentions. This would allow States to concentrate on the development and distribution of much-needed nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.93.	The nuclear threat to our security may be dramatic and awe-inspiring but we cannot neglect the more prosaic and lethal threat from the use of conventional force. One of the few useful tools we have developed so far to deal with this problem is peacekeeping by a force sponsored by the United Nations. Canada has responded positively to United Nations requests and has engaged in virtually all the United Nations peace-keeping operations to date. This has not been without cost in livings of Canadians or of those from the forces of the other participating countries.94.	Our interest is therefore obvious. There is no doubt in my mind that an overwhelming majority of Canadians continue to accept the importance and the usefulness of a United Nations peacekeeping role. But I would be less than candid if I did not admit that Canadians ""are today less inclined to accept in an unquestioning way the burdens of participation. Their concern springs mainly from the fact that peace-keeping endeavors often seem to do no more than perpetuate an uneasy status quo.95.	If United Nations peace-keeping is to be fully effective  it must be accompanied by a parallel effort on the political level  especially by the parties most directly concerned  to convert the temporary peace that a peace-keeping force is asked to maintain into something more durable. If this is not done  and if those who contribute to peace-keeping are faced with indefinite prolongation of their hazardous tasks  I am afraid that Governments will be less willing to respond to future requests for troops.96.	The past year has seen two new peace-keeping operations established in the Middle East and the Force in Cyprus reinforced. These developments were important in themselves  but they are also capable of teaching us lessons for the future. From the Canadian standpoint the operations in the Middle East are working effectively and are making an essential contribution to the maintenance of the ceasefire and disengagement agreements. But equally important  new principles have been established in the process. Participants have been drawn from a broader base than in the past  and a sounder financial foundation for the operations has been laid through a general assessment of the United Nations membership. These innovations have contributed to effective peacekeeping in the Middle East for the present  and will enhance the prospect of greater effectiveness in the future.97.	There are fewer grounds for satisfaction in the case of Cyprus. There  despite the presence of United Nations peace-keeping forces  fighting has taken place on an unprecedented scale because the long-smoldering political problem remains unresolved. Moreover  it has been demonstrated once again in Cyprus that without the agreement and co-operation of the disputants the constructive role of a peace-keeping force is severely circumscribed. 98.	If the usefulness of the United Nations in peace-keeping is to be maintained and expanded  new principles and techniques to strengthen it must be found. The machinery is at hand under the Charter to ensure an effective United Nations response to future peace-keeping needs. The advantages of agreement in advance on how United Nations peace-keeping should be directed and controlled are obvious. The experience of the United Nations Emergency Force could point the way to such agreement or to the formulation of guide-lines for peace-keeping operations under the overall authority of the Security Council  with a system of sharing responsibilities among the Security Council  the Secretary-General  the troop contributors  and the parties directly concerned in the field. This Organization can scarcely afford to neglect any instrument that might have a contribution to make in helping to defuse situations of armed conflict. It is the hope of the Canadian Government that Member States will continue to give this problem the attention it deserves.99.	I have touched upon a few of the pressing political and economic problems that demand the attention of this Assembly. But I have dwelt upon two major problems of security: peace-keeping and the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices. As the Secretary-General has pointed out  a proliferation of nuclear explosive devices could help to . . create almost unimaginable dangers for the survival of our civilization and the human race."" [Al960llAdd.I  p. 7.] I do not therefore apologize for my preoccupation with these problems.100.	I would not wish to conclude without paying tribute to the work of the Secretary-General and his staff at Headquarters and throughout the world in carrying forward the wide spectrum of tasks which challenge our Organization. In the introduction to the Secretary-General's report  he said the following:""We are reminded every day of how thin the margin is between order and chaos  between sufficiency and desperate want  between peace and annihilation. If we wish to overcome the vast anxieties and uncertainties of our time  we have to make a conscious and concerted effort to change course and to make some   of our stated objectives\ into realities."" [Ibid.  p. 9]At this twenty-ninth session  the Canadian delegation pledges itself to work with all other delegations to move towards our common goals."
"22",1248,"CHL",29,1974,"The delegation of Chile participates in this international forum with the sincere intention of helping to achieve effective co-operation between States and of. contributing to the solution of the humanitarian  social  cultural and economic problems that concern the United Nations.166.... The purpose and goals of the Charter of San Francisco continue to be the purpose and goals of the foreign policy of Chile. We accordingly reaffirm our adherence to the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)  annex] and to the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. Chile believes that today more than ever we must respect the basic principles of international coexistence.167.	Prohibition of the use or threat of force  prohibition of intervention of any kind in the internal affairs of any nation "" respect for the rights of peoples to self-determination  as well as unlimited respect for international treaties  are some of the basic principles that inspire our participation in this Assembly's general debate  as well as in the study of the many subjects that will be considered by the Committees.168.	We have attentively followed the efforts of the United Nations for the maintenance and restoration of world peace. The current negotiations in the Middle East  thanks to the intelligent role played by the Secretary-General as well as by the dynamic Secretary of State of the United States of America  clearly demonstrate that the United Nations is an effective instrument for the solution of international conflicts when the political will exists voluntarily to adhere to its standards. The disengagement agreements are an essential first step toward the achievement of a just and lasting peace in that part of the world.169.	Recent events in Cyprus have caused my Government concern. This is not the proper moment to examine the causes  which sure already so well known to this international body. In our judgment  what matters is the survival of that United Nations Member State  which currently finds its integrity and independence so seriously threatened.170.	We consider that this General Assembly should give maximum priority to the problem of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and obtain the cessation of tests  whether underground  at sea or in the atmosphere. The fact that a number of countries are now able to produce devices of this type  along with the temptation of some nations to become atomic Powers  might lead to a nuclear race that is as risky as it is absurd  and which could develop into a war so destructive as to affect the whole human race. The gradual proliferation of members of the nuclear club thus poses a grave danger for international peace and security.171.	We believe that the best way to achieve these objectives would be to extend geographically denuclearized zones. In this regard  I should like to declare that the Government of Chile is completing the internal legal arrangements for the ratification of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America  which was signed at TIatelolco. Within a very short time we shall deposit the relevant instrument of ratification.172.	Some South American Governments have expressed the desire to reach a regional arms limitation agreement in order to allow for a more accelerated economic development of their countries. Chile has declared its outright support for this initiative and believes that  in general  offensive weapons should be especially limited  while those needed to fulfill the defensive aims of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance should be maintained.173.	Ever since the time of the League of Nations  Chile has supported the principle of the universality of international organizations. We consider that the ability of the United Nations to accomplish its basic goal -to secure a just and lasting peace in the world- depends upon the strict application of this principle. Thus we rejoice at the admission into our Organization of the States of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea- Bissau. We extend our warmest welcome to them and we feel certain that they 'will make a timely and active contribution to our deliberations. I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate Chile's support for resolution 1514 (XV) concerning the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.174.	The Republic of Honduras was recently the victim of a catastrophe bringing desolation and ruin to thousands of homes. My delegation wishes to reiterate to the Honduran delegation the warmest and most heartfelt feelings of the people and Government of Chile. At the same time  we should like to request the Secretary-General  whose dedication and skillful action merit our fullest support  to invite the relevant specialized agencies of the United Nations and other institutions to grant our sister nation their swiftest and most ample co-operation.175.	The world economic situation is certainly not encouraging. The crisis the world faces probably has no parallel in history. Deep-seated problems exist which have been developing for a long time and which  far from being solved  tend  on the contrary  to become dangerously acute. I refer to rapid population growth  the food crisis  ecological destruction  the deterioration of the environment and the gradual extinction of non-renewable natural resources.176.	We are going through what the experts call ""international economic turbulence""  most visibly and probably most dramatically manifested in the energy crisis. The old post-war order  characterized by the Bretton Woods Agreements and the traditional trade patterns associated with GATT  has demonstrated its total inefficiency in our time and  as repeatedly pointed out  has turned into a new international economic ""disorder"". Both institutions and mechanisms created nearly 30 years ago have demonstrated their inability to cope with the problems of today and have jeopardized the objectives of the International Development  Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]. At the same time  the industrialized nations have not given priority to financial co-operation for the benefit of developing countries  nor have they fully opened their markets to the exports of developing countries. Peace and economic prosperity together constitute the guiding principles of our Charter. Therefore it is regrettable and dangerous that the results achieved in the economic  financial and commercial sectors are not comparable with those achieved in the political and military areas.177.	A number of recent new developments call for a re-examination of current economic policies. Industrialized countries have suddenly been faced with the fragility of the structure of their economic systems  while the developing countries have seen their negotiating potential unexpectedly raised. For the first time a certain symmetry of interests and benefits has emerged between those two groups of nations  which affords a unique opportunity for negotiating fair agreements.178.	The foregoing impels me to insist that we urgently adopt specific measures that will accelerate multilateral trade negotiations on a preferential basis that will apply to tariff as well as non-tariff trade barriers. At the same time  it is necessary urgently to accelerate decisions for the reform of the international monetary system that would give the developing nations a much larger participation than that afforded them so far.179.	Chile believes that Latin America has something to say and something to offer in all those areas. Our region can rely upon existing co-ordinating mechanisms  and these should be used fully. An example is the Special Committee on Latin American Co-ordination. This body expresses the genuine Latin American personality. Likewise  we have organizations such as the Latin American Free Trade Association and the Andean Subregional Integration Agreement (Andean Group) to the improvement of which Chile is fully committed.180.	Latin America's efforts towards establishing a guaranteed international economic order are borne out by the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States by Venezuela's valuable contribution to the Inter-American Development Bank  and by our countries' active participation in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The second session of this Conference  recently held at Caracas  should be viewed in terms of both the successful organization of the Conference by the host country and the effective and useful work undertaken. The Conference defined what could be called the basis of  or key to  international solutions  particularly the 200-mile economic zone and the formulation of the concept of the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction being the common heritage of mankind.181.	Chile  the first country in the world to proclaim  in 1947  a 200-mile marine zone  was joined by Ecuador and Peru in a later defense of this doctrine in some memorable diplomatic battles. While at that time we seemed isolated in our position  new we are gratified to note that we are supported by the great majority of nations. Conceived as an economic zone or patrimonial sea  that doctrine has become fundamental to an international solution. It is not. only a triumph for the developing countries; it is also an expression of the justice of the fundamental relationship existing between a country and the resources of its adjacent sea 182.	One proof of Latin America's commitment to overcoming the most urgent problems of our time was the efficiency and dedication with which the representative of Ecuador  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  presided over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We wish to pay him our warmest tribute for the brilliant manner in which he discharged his lofty duties.183.	The people of Chile recently celebrated with spontaneous joy the first anniversary of its liberation from the Soviet-oriented totalitarian regime that had tried to impose its dictatorship on the country and its people  and in multitudinous rallies held throughout the land the people reaffirmed its support for the present Government of national reconstruction.184.	This year  with the enthusiastic support of all sectors  healthy economic foundations have been laid and are already yielding initial results. Central Bank reserves  which were only $3 million a year ago  now exceed $300 million. Exports between January and May of this year increased by more than 200 per cent over the same period in 1973. In spite of higher import prices  Chile's balance of trade has ceased to show a deficit  and now shows an appreciable  surplus. Agricultural production will increase significantly this year  since essential planting is 50 per cent greater this year than in 1973. This increase is a result especially of the fact that the Government has turned over rural land  which had been nationalized by the previous regime  to authentic peasant farmers. Particularly noteworthy has been the increase in copper production  total output being 46 per cent higher this year than last year.185.	The recovery of our economy has created confidence abroad and made it possible for Chile to renegotiate its external debt within the framework of the ""Paris Club""  on mutually acceptable terms. The runaway inflation we were suffering is being controlled  and a program for the gradual reduction of the inflation rate is under way. In order to avoid dislocations  it is based on increased productivity and reduced government spending.186.	Social development is and has been one of the Chilean Government's fundamental concerns. The difficult anti-inflationary campaign is being carried out as fairly as possible  with benefits accruing to the workers through long overdue substantial pay rises and social improvements. So  for the first Time in our country's history  the dilemma of the most helpless groups of people has been confronted squarely and in depth through a complete study of the factors involved and a program of action designed to. put into effect urgently needed solutions.187.	Within this brief summary of my Government's efforts  special mention should be made of the children's nutrition program now being carried out in Chile with the full knowledge of UNICEF and other international organizations. We are confident that the success of our studies and accomplishments in this area will enable our country to co-operate usefully with other nations. We are pleased to offer them our experience for mutual benefit.188.	The Chilean Government has passed a new law  the Foreign Investment Statute  which establishes rules to attract foreign capital but  at the same time  clearly protects our national interests. This foreign investment law has already produced a significant increase in the number of requests to expand current investments or to invest in new industries  and has attracted numerous national and private groups from abroad  which have all been anxious to co-operate in our development on fair  serious and well-defined terms.189.	While laying the groundwork for the economic reconstruction and social development of the country  my Government has assigned top priority to the rehabilitation of the judiciary  which is a spiritual and moral legacy of the people of Chile and the very essence of their historical identity. Upon taking office  my Government acknowledged its patriotic obligation to revive the fundamental attributes of the Chilean character  and to restore justice  and the institutions that had been violated  destroyed or negated by the previous Government. It gives me great pleasure to be able to describe how the Government of Chile is fulfilling the promises made to the citizens of our country.190.	The fully independent Judicial Branch administers justice without any interference whatever from the Government  which accords it the most absolute and total respect and prompt implementation of its sentences and resolutions. This situation is in contrast with the violent and defamatory attacks against the High Court which occurred under the preceding Government. At that time the judicial Branch's constitutional powers were disregarded and its sentences and judgments were not carried out  all of which conspired against the independence of the Judicial Branch. It is enough to point out that at the time there were more than 7 000 sentences handed down by the courts which were never carried out. 191.	The Comptroller General's Office  an autonomous institution responsible for confirming the legality of the acts carried out by the Executive Branch  fulfills its fiscal responsibilities with total autonomy and efficiency. It has been enlarged and strengthened in its attributes. The Comptroller Genera's observations and administrative notices are no longer scoffed at as they Were under the procedures that operated under the preceding administration. 192.	Also  in line with a legal tradition of more than 150 years of republican life  the Government of Chile a few days after assuming power named a Commission to draw up a new political Constitution. The Commission is made up of distinguished university professors with vast judicial experience and ample knowledge of public affairs. More than 70 distinguished professional experts co-operate with it  representing a varied spectrum of activities. The work of this important Commission is carried out in an atmosphere of complete freedom and along the lines of certain general principles proposed by the Commission itself and approved by the Government prior to publication and dissemination throughout the country.193.	The new Constitution will encompass the basic principles that derive from our Chilean legal tradition and from the historic cultural identity of our homeland. It aims at the improvement of institutions to the fullest extent possible and in accord with universal experience and Chilean specific realities  and will institute a representative and democratic system  with authorities whose power will originate in the law and who will be elected by the people in free  pluralistic  secret and informed elections.194.	The legal reorganization in Chile and the intense task of effecting legislative renovation which are currently under way are inspired and determined by the principles and values which the Government of Chile proclaimed and published last March. It would be rather lengthy to refer at this time to the declaration of principles. Suffice it to say that the declaration encompasses the highest human values and is consistent with the highest Western and Christian philosophy. In my country this document has been widely published and I can assure this Assembly that these are-the principles that inspire Government action  as well as the principles that are defended and guaranteed in Chile today.195.	Some politicians or institutions  whether misinformed or in bad faith  have sustained a media campaign designed to create the impression that the Government of Chile upholds repressive measures and ignores both legal rules and human rights. For the most part  these attack* originate with individuals who see the flaw  in others but do not wish to recognize their own flaws.1 96. The truth is that Chile is a country with borders open to any representatives of official international institutions and to private persons who wish to visit our countryside and cities in order freely to converse with our people and. understand the reality of a people that is marching with unity towards a better future.197.	The International Committee of the Red Cross  ever since the advent of the current Government  has maintained a permanent delegation that has received"" ample authority to visit those who have been detained and tried arid  from time to time  found guilty. This delegation periodically reports 'to its headquarters in Geneva as well as to the Government of Chile.198.	The Office of the United Nations High Com-missioner for Refugees has conveyed to my Government its appreciation for the co-operation extended in the solution of problems deriving from the presence of over 14 000 foreigners who are in the country illegally. The majority were individuals who had been expelled from their home countries and who had gone to Chile to continue their subversive and terrorist activities.199.	We have invited a commission of conciliation and investigation of the International Labor Organization so that it may observe how Chile is complying with its international obligations and how the law protects the social progress achieved by workers.200.	Chile fully agreed to the granting of asylum in foreign diplomatic missions  although many of them exercised that right for the first time  with no claim to do so since the Governments concerned are not parties to the Conventions on the subject. Regardless of the fact that in many instances asylum was not warranted  the Chilean authorities agreed to grant all the requested safe-conducts. It gives me pleasure to announce that no refugee remains in asylum in foreign embassies. In view of the scope which some have tried to give to diplomatic asylum and which Chile de facto did not want to deny  my delegation assigns top priority to the discussion and approval of a universal convention on the subject.201.	The Government of Chile authorized the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights to hold an extraordinary session in my country in order to study on the spot the status of such rights. We granted all the facilities that were requested. Have our detractors allowed international committees into their countries in order to carry out an in-depth investigation of human rights  permitting them to visit detention centers and to hold conversations unobstructedly and privately with detained persons?202.	On 1 of September the Chief of State of Chile  General AUgusto Pinochet  made the following statement:""The Government wishes to announce that  in spite of serious legal or moral charges for which persons arrested under the state of siege and those facing trial have been held responsible  it is ready to authorize such persons to leave the country for good  should they so desire  with the sole exception of particularly grave cases.11Subsequently  he called on other nations which have attacked us violently to act similarly under the super-vision of the'International Committee of the Red Cross. The Committee has offered the Government of Chile to undertake the necessary steps to implement this initiative  and we have given it full support in this noble task. We are drawing up the list of those persons who voluntarily wish to take advantage of this offer  and there is nothing to prevent them if they so wish it from leaving the country with their families.203.	In brief  we can guarantee with deep conviction that today Chile is one of the countries where every person whether a national or a foreign resident has complete personal security and where human rights are fully respected. 204.	these past few days  efforts have been made to associate Chile with interventionist acts from abroad. My Government did not hesitate to denounce the impudent involvement in Chilean internal politics during the past administration by several Communist countries. Such acts were intended to unleash civil war in my country. Now  in accordance with the traditional attachment to independence which is characteristic of our policy  and the authentically Chilean roots of my Government  we firmly reject  irrespective of their aims and their place of origin  any acts of intervention that directly or indirectly entail foreign entanglement in the internal or external affairs of Chile.205.	Social justice  solidarity and the participation of every Chilean in the common effort to reconstruct our motherland a demonstration of how we have overcome artificially engendered hatreds and an illustration of a new mechanism aiming at the efficient and prompt solution of the problems confronting the people of Chile. This is the path we have chosen. We have committed ourselves to this endeavor with austerity and sacrifice but also with dedication and faith in the future of our land.206.	The Chilean delegation is present at this session of the Assembly with the intention of extending this very same spirit of co-operation and solidarity to the accomplishment of the tasks incumbent on the international community. In so doing  we trust that the over-all result will be the attainment of positive agreements worthy of the fundamental goals of the Organization."
"23",1294,"CHN",29,1974,"Mr. President  first of all  I should like to congratulate you on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly and I am confident that you will preside well and make positive contributions to the current session.86.	New and important victories have been won by the people of all countries in their struggle against colonialism  imperialism and hegemonism since the start of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly last year. The numerous third world countries have become the main force in the revolutionary struggle against the two hegemonic Powers. More and more people have seen through the so called detente played up by the superPowers. All the basic contradictions in the world are further sharpening  particularly the contradiction between the two superPowers on the one hand and the people of all countries on the other and the contradiction between  the two superPowers themselves. It is now evident to all that the world today is amidst more intense turbulence and unrest.87.	What should be noted here first is the great October war in the Middle East. The heroic people of Egypt  Syria  Palestine and other Arab countries  in defiance of superPower obstruction and disruption  boldly took up arms and successfully rebuffed Israeli Zionist aggression. This fight exploded the myth of Israeli ""invincibility""  upset the state of ""no war  no peace"" imposed by the superPowers and demonstrated the might of the united struggle of the Arab people.88.	In this Middle East war  the Arab countries used oil as a weapon to deal a heavy blow at Zionism and hegemonism. This was a historic  pioneering action. Its impact far exceeds the scope of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle. It has opened up a new dimension for the third world's struggle in defense of national resources against imperialist plunder and exploitation.89.	The African people's struggle for national liberation has made great progress. Portugal is one of the oldest colonial empires. The downfall of the former Fascist regime in Portugal is a victory for the African people  who have persevered in a long armed struggle  as well as for the Portuguese people  who have persistently opposed the reactionary colonial war.90.	The peoples of IndoChina have steadily achieved new successes in their struggle against United States aggression and for national liberation. The VietNamese people have carried on an unremitting struggle for the strict implementation of the Paris Agreement of 27 January 1973 and against the Nguyen Van Thieu clique's violations of the Agreement. In Laos  the Provisional Government of National Union has been formed. The Cambodian people have grown ever stronger in their fight against the traitorous Lon Nol clique. The struggle of the Korean people for the independent and peaceful reunification of their fatherland has won ever wider support. There is a growing tendency among the SouthEast Asian countries to free themselves from superPower interference and contention.91.	The struggle of the Latin American peoples against hegemonism and in defense of their State sovereignty  independence and national economic rights and interests has continued to surge forward. Those peoples initiated the struggle fair the zone of exercise of their maritime rights of 200 nautical miles  which has become the common demand of the great majority of nations.92.	The Asian  African and Latin American peoples have supported each other in struggle  and they have become ever more keenly aware that unity is strength. At various conferences  they have strongly denounced colonialism  racism  Zionism  imperialism and hegemonism. Their just struggles and those of the people of other countries  supporting and complementing each other  are pounding away at the old international order  which the superPowers vainly attempt to maintain.93.	In the past year  the contention between the two superPowers  the United States and the Soviet Union  for spheres of influence and world hegemony has become more intense. This is a fact which no agree menu between them can cover up. The Soviet leadership has lauded these agreements to the skies  as if the mere conclusion of agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union would bring detente to the whole world and usher in a ""new stage of history""  namely  a ""world without war"". ""Detente"" has become a kind of quack medicine hawked by the Soviet leadership everywhere. But none of us will forget that it was after the reaching of a stack of agreements at the second United StatesSoviet talks that the Middle East war broke out  and that it was after the reaching of more agreements at the third United StatesSoviet talks that the Cyprus events occurred.So then  where is the ""detente""? Has not there been ample manifestation of the contention between the two superPowers during the Middle East war and the Cyprus events?94.	To keep a ""balance of power"" the United States and the Soviet Union reached certain agreements on ""strategic arms limitation"". But is has become more evident since their third summit talks that  at bottom  these agreements serve the purpose of bigger and more intensified contention. As far as balance is concerned  it has always been relative and temporary whether in nature or in human society  while imbalance is absolute and constant. In the real life of today  there is in fact no ""balance of power"" between the two superPowers. Instead  each side is desperately trying to outstrip and overwhelm the other  and the wildest arms race is on. No wonder the superPower with the label of ""socialism"" has  of late  arrogantly boasted that it is ""on a historic offensive along the entire front of the global confrontation""  and that the pace of its advance is ""rapid"".95.	Lenin pointed out: ""The content of imperialist politics is 'world domination' and the continuation of this politics is imperialist war."" So long as imperialism and social imperialism exist  there will be the danger of war  and genuine detente or ""lasting peace"" will be impossible. Today  the danger of war comes from the superPowers. One superPower is trying by hook or by crook to carry out infiltration and expansion abroad and squeeze into the other superPower's spheres of influence in Europe and other parts of the world in order to supersede that superPower and realize its own wild ambition of world domination. With this fierce contention between the superPowers going on as it is  eventually either the superPowers will go to war against each other or the people will rise in revolution; either the war will give rise to revolution  or revolution will prevent the war. As Chairman Mao Tsetung has said: ""The danger of a new world war still exists  and the people of all countries must get prepared. But revolution is the main trend in the world today.""96.	By stepping up their contention for world hegemony  the two superPowers are bound to hasten the process of their turning into their own opposites. Nowadays  not only have the third world countries risen one after another in revolt against them  but the second world countries in between the superPowers and the third world have also stood up to resist in various ways control and bullying by the superPowers. Beset by troubles at home and abroad  both superPowers are having a very tough' time. One superPower has already overstretched itself and is in a dilemma  unable to attend to all its troubles at the same time. The other superPower is in an even worse predicament. It has wild ambitions but lacks strength  and its difficulties abound. They are both in the plight described by the Chinese verse: ""Flowers fall off  do what one may."" Overestimation of the strength of the superPowers does not square with the facts. In the final analysis  it is not the one or two superPowers but the people of the world in their thousands of millions who determine the destiny of the world.97.	The Chinese delegation would now like to state its views on a number of questions confronting the General Assembly at its current session. First  wewould like to state our views on Africa's fight against colonialism.98.	China consistently supports the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples and considers this to be her bounden internationalist duty. In Africa  we firmly support the peoples of Mozambique  Angola  Zimbabwe  Namibia  Azania and other regions in their just struggle against colonialism and racism. We hail the birth of the Republic of GuineaBissau and warmly welcome its admission to the United Nations. We firmly demand that Spain terminate its colonial domination in Spanish Sahara and sincerely hope that the Arab countries concerned will work together with the people of Spanish Sahara to seek a reasonable solution to the existing questions of this region through friendly consultations on the basis of unity against colonialism.99.	We hold that the colonial peoples can win national liberation only by relying mainly on their own efforts to wage a tit for tat struggle against colonialism. Moribund colonialism relies on armed force to carry on its deathbed struggle  and it will never step down from the stage of history unless it is defeated by the armed struggle of the colonial peoples. Both the birth of the Republic of GuineaBissau and the more recent agreement on the independence of Mozambique are in essence the result of the long and persistent armed struggle of the people of GuineaBissau and Mozambique  and are by no means favors bestowed by colonialism.100.	The downfall of the former Fascist regime in Portugal  which persisted in the colonial war  is  of course  an important event. But this development in no way implies that Portugal will bring independence to the colonial peoples on a silver platter. Recently  under the pressure of the people  the new Portuguese Government had to recognize the right to independence of the peoples in the Portuguese colonies. This is a manifestation of the general trend. But it is yet to be seen whether the new Portuguese Government will suit its actions to its words. Even when that Government has reached an agreement with a colony  it remains to be seen whether the agreement will truly by implemented. The declaration of the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] adopted at the eleventh ordinary session points out that  if Portugal does not take a clear position on the right to total independence of its colonies in Africa  there will be no other way but pursuit and intensification of the struggle for national liberation.101.	We warmly endorse this correct stand. According to our experience in China  all reactionaries habitually use counterrevolutionary dual tactics  and we must use revolutionary dual tactics to deal with them. Armed struggle is fundamental  but negotiations are not excluded. Sometimes negotiating is tit for tat; and sometimes not negotiating is also tit for tat. Even in negotiations one must base oneself on fighting. In the course of negotiations  the fundamental interests of the people must be protected. The armed forces of the people must be strengthened  and not weakened.102.	Moreover  it must be pointed out that while old line colonialisms have not died out  neo colonial isms of various descriptions  including the neo colonialism flaunting the banner of socialism are stepping up their infiltration. These neocolonialisms are sowing discord among African countries and within the national liberation movements to split and demoralize them in a vain attempt to supplant old line colonialisms and control the regions concerned. Sharp vigilance should be maintained against this. The future of the African liberation struggle is bright  but the road ahead remains tortuous. We believe that the great and increasingly awakening African people  strengthening their unity and persevering in a long struggle  will certainly surmount all difficulties and triumph in the end.103.	Second  on the Mi 'die East question  we wish to say the following.104.	The Arab people brought about an excellent situation through fighting the October war. This war has strengthened the confidence of the Arab people in victory over the Israeli aggressor and broken the stalemate that was deliberately created by the superPowers. Now  a disengagement has been effected between Egypt and Israel and between Syria and Israel  but the Middle East question is still far from being settled.105.	The essence of the Middle East question lies in Israeli Zionist aggression and the contention between the two superPowers  the United States and the Soviet Union  for hegemony in the Middle East versus the struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples against aggression and hegemony.106.	The Chinese Government and people always support the just struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples. From the very beginning  we have refused to have any contact with the Israeli Zionists  who persist in aggression. We have firmly opposed the contention between the two superPowers in the Middle East and opposed their support of and connivance with Israel  and we have constantly exposed the truth that social imperialism is giving sham support while actually attempting to control the Palestinian and other Arab peoples.107.	It is well known that the United Nations has held innumerable discussions on the Palestine question and adopted countless resolutions thereon  of which the one referred to most often is Security Council resolution 242 (1967). All these resolutions have the common feature of twisting the question of the restoration of the Palestinian.people's national rights into a so called ""question of refugees"". This is a gross injustice. We have always opposed it and will continue to oppose it.108.	Now  the Arab countries have proposed the discussion of the question of Palestinian national rights at the General Assembly session  so that all countries may hear directly the voices of the millions of Palestinian people and the 100 million Arab people and so that more countries may understand and support their just position. This is entirely necessary.109.	The restoration of Palestinian national rights and the recovery of the lost Arab territories form a struggle that is an integral whole. There can be no settlement of the Middle East question so long as the lost Arab territories are not recovered and Palestinian national rights are not restored. Whatever maneuvers they may engage in  the two superPowers will never succeed in their attempt to sacrifice the Palestinian national rights and undermine the militant unity of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples.110.	We hope that the United Nations will rectify its longstanding unjust attitude on the Palestine question  recognize the Palestinian people's national rights and support their restoration. But historical experience merits attention. No unrealistic hopes should be pinned on United Nations resolutions. In the final analysis  the Arab countries can recover their lost territories and the Palestinian people can regain their national rights only by relying on their own close unity and unremitting struggle  with the support of the peoples of the whole world.111.	Third  our views on the question of Cyprus are as follows.112.	The question of Cyprus is a legacy of imperialist colonial rule. The internal cause of the recent eruption in Cyprus is the lack of a satisfactory solution to the question between the two communities on the island; and its external cause is the attempt of each of the two superPowers to put this island of strategic importance under its own influence and control.113.	One superPower stirred up trouble by pulling wires behind the scenes. The other superPower  pretending to ""uphold"" the independence of Cyprus and feeling anxious  like an ant on a hot pan  issued one government statement after another  supporting one side one day and the other side the other  sowing discord and fanning the flames of trouble. Racking its brains for ingenious devices  it turned up with proposals  first for the sending of a ""United Nations special mission"" and then for the convening of an international conference with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council. Anyone with a discerning eye will see that its ""mischievous"" actions serve neither the interests of the independence of Cyprus nor the interests of the Greek and Turkish communities or the countries directly related to these communities  but are aimed at meddling in the Cyprus question and further squeezing into the eastern Mediterranean. In quest of hegemony in the Mediterranean  it has redoubled its efforts to threaten  cajole  subvert and undermine the Balkan countries  causing their grave uneasiness and aggravating tension in this region.114.	We hold that the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus must be respected. We hope that a reasonable solution will be found so that the Greek and Turkish communities can live together in equality and harmony. Cyprus  Turkey and Greece are all friends of China. We have all suffered from imperialist tactics of sowing discord and divide and rule. As for the questions left over from history  we believe that they will not be difficult to resolve so long as the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus and the countries concerned seek to do so by peaceful means and through patient consultations. We should be constantly on guard against superPower meddling and intervention.115.	Fourth  on the questions of the South Asian subcontinent and nuclear free zones  we hold the following views.116.	The dismemberment of Pakistan by India with the backing of the Soviet Union gave rise to turbulence and unrest on the South Asian subcontinent. Great efforts have been made by the Government of Pakistan to promote a normalization of relations between India  Pakistan and Bangladesh. By April this year  the Indian Government had finally implemented in full the resolutions of the General Assembly and Security Council of 1971 on the ceasefire between India and Pakistan  the withdrawal of troops and the repatriation of prisoners. This ought to have created favorable conditions for the relaxation of the situation on the South Asian subcontinent. But a new wave arose when the previous one had barely subsided. In May  India exploded a nuclear device allegedly for peaceful purposes. In June  the Indian Government imposed on the people of Sikkim the so called ""Government of Sikkim Bill""  which it had concocted singlehandedly. And  more recently  the Indian Parliament adopted a constitutional amendment  making Sikkim a so called ""associate state"" of India. To put it bluntly  this is the annexation of Sikkim. It is another naked act of expansionism perpetrated by the Indian Government after dismembering Pakistan by armed force.117.	The Indian Government's annexation of Sikkim has aroused the opposition of the Sikkimese people as well as the Indian people and met with condemnation by India's neighbors and world public opinion. The Soviet propaganda organs  alone  sing the praises of India. This shows that Soviet revisionist social imperialism is the boss behind the scenes of Indian expansionism.118.	The Soviet Union is unscrupulous in its efforts to interfere in  subvert  divide and control the South Asian countries. It is conspiring to engineer another dismemberment of Pakistan. It dreams of opening a corridor to the Indian Ocean to serve its interests in its contention with the other superPower for hegemony in the South Asian subcontinent and the Indian Ocean. The two superPowers are competing with each other in setting up military bases in the Indian Ocean  some of which are overt bases while others are covert ones  nominally for civilian  but actually for military  use. The turbulent situation in South Asia and the Indian Ocean calls for vigilance.119.	The turbulence and unrest in South Asia totally contradict the desire for peace of the peoples of all countries in this region. The proposal put forward by Pakistan for the establishment of a nuclear free zone in South Asia [AI9706] is entirely  reasonable. China gives it her firm support. We also firmly support the proposal of Iran and Egypt for the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East [AI9693 and Add./J]. China is a nuclear country  although her nuclear weapons are still in the experimental stage. We are developing nuclear weapons for defense and for breaking the nuclear monopoly and ultimately destroying the .nuclear weapons. The Chinese Government has solemnly declared on many occasions that at no time and in no circumstances will China be the first to use nuclear weapons. It consistently holds that the nuclear countries should undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear countries or nuclear free zones. We are ready to make such an undertaking in regard to the proposed nuclear free zones in South Asia and the Middle East. We hope that all the other nuclear countries will do the same.120.	Fifth  I turn to the questions of Cambodia and IndoChina.121.	In the past year  the Cambodian people have continued to win new victories in their war against United States aggression and for national salvation. The People's Armed Forces of National Liberation of Cambodia launched sustained offensives on all fronts and kept annihilating the effective strength of the enemy. The liberated zone is expanding and becoming ever more consolidated. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk  head of State of Cambodia  is the Cambodian people's sole lawful Government. It has been recognized by more than 60 countries  and its friendly relations with third world countries are developing steadily. It enjoys a high international prestige. After the tour of Prince Sihanouk  Deputy Prime Minister Khieu Samphan visited many countries in Asia  Africa and Europe this year. They were both accorded a warm welcome in the countries they visited. The just struggle of the Cambodian people has won support on an ever wider scale from people all over the world.122.	The traitorous Lon Nol clique is a handful of national scum repudiated by the people of Cambodia. This clique is rent by disunity and beset with numerous contradictions. In the areas under its rule  the economic situation is deteriorating and mass movements are raging like a storm. It is in a dire plight. Of late  it has advanced a proposal for socalled ""peace negotiations""  attempting to achieve a demagogic effect. We all know that the key to restoring peace in Cambodia lies :n the cessation of United States aggression and interference in Cambodia. So  the purpose of that socalled proposal is simply to cover up the fact of United States aggression and interference in Cambodia and prolong the moribund life of the Lon Nol clique. The Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia has already opposed and rejected that proposal. The Chinese Government resolutely supports the solemn and just stand of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia.123.	It is utterly illegal for the Lon Nol clique to usurp Cambodia's seat in the United Nations. Last year  some people used procedural tactics to postpone for a year the discussion on the question of restoring the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia. That was wholly unjustifiable. The Chinese Government firmly maintains that this session of the General Assembly should adopt a resolution to immediately expel the representatives of the traitorous Lon Nol clique and restore to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia its rightful seat.124.	More than one year has elapsed since the signing of the Agreement on ending the war in Viet Nam  but peace has not yet been restored in South Viet Nam. The Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam has worked tirelessly for the strict implementation of the Paris Agreement. But its efforts have met with obstruction and sabotage from the Saigon administration. Relying on massive United States military aid  the Saigon administration refuses to implement important provisions of the Paris Agreement  with the result that the situation in South Viet Nam has thus far remained tense. We demand that the United States Government strictly comply with the Paris Agreement and stop its involvement and interference in South Viet Nam  so that peace can really be restored in Viet Nam.125.	The Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam is the authentic representative of the South Viet-Namese people. The Paris Agreement recognizes the fact that there exist two administrations in South Viet Nam  namely  the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam and the Saigon administration. It is unreasonable that the United Nations should accept only the observer of one side  that is  the Saigon administration. To rectify this irrationality  we hold that the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam should be invited to send its observer to the United Nations.126.	Sixth  with regard to the Korean question  our views are as follows.127.	The General Assembly at its last session reached a consensus on the Korean question  confirmed the three principles of Korea's independence  peaceful reunification and great national unity and decided to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea.1 This was a welcome development.128.	The facts over the past year show that the United Nations should not rest content with the progress made but should continue to go forward. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made many efforts to push ahead the north south dialog and promote the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. But all these efforts have been unreasonably rejected by the South Korean authorities. The proposals on minor issues advanced by the South Korean authorities are wholly aimed at covering up their unwillingness to conduct negotiations on the fundamental question of reunifying the north and the south. What they really want is division  not reunification. On the pretext of a so called threat from the north  the South Korean authorities have taken a series of ""emergency measures""  depriving the South Korean people of all basic democratic rights. They have arrested  tried  imprisoned or murdered large numbers of people of various strata who call for democracy  freedom and peaceful reunification  ranging from young students and professors to political figures. Even people like former President Yoon Bo Sun and Catholic Bishop Chi Hak Soun have not escaped such persecution. Before the case of kidnapping Kim Dae Jung is closed  the South Korean authorities have already gone ahead with more sinister actions. Today  South Korea is in fact under the reign of terror of a Fascist dictator. It is mainly because they have the backing of United States troops that the South Korean authorities dare so feverishly to repress the people and sabotage the north south dialog. In order to eliminate outside interference in Korea and promote the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea  the withdrawal of foreign forces from South Korea is entirely necessary.129.	In paragraph 2 (c) of the explanatory memorandum attached to the request for the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty ninth session of an additional item on the question of Korea  which was submitted by the United States and other countries [see A/9741 and Add. 15]  it is asserted that the United States troops under the United Nations flag have not interfered in the internal affairs of the host country. This makes a mockery of common sense. Does not the presence of tens of thousands of United States troops serve to embolden the South Korean rulers  to say the least? The consensus of the last session of the General Assembly affirmed that the reunification of North and South Korea should be achieved by peaceful means without interference by outside force. As a logical consequence of affirming this principle  the foreign troops under the United Nations flag should be withdrawn from South Korea. As for the statement contained in the draft resolution annexed to the explanatory memorandum that ""tension in Korea has not been totally eliminated""  well  to put it bluntly  this is another way of referring to the so called threat from the north  which is a myth that has long been exploded. By now even that neighboring country which has all along supported South Korea no longer believes in this myth. The assertion that the ""United Nations Command"" cannot be withdrawn because of the existence of this ""threat"" is sheer deception.130.	The Chinese delegation is firmly against that draft resolution. It strongly maintains that the current session of the General Assembly should discuss and adopt the draft resolution submitted by Algeria and other countries for the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations [see Al9703/Add.3].131.	Seventh  the Chinese delegation's views on the question of disarmament are the following.132.	It is quite understandable that disarmament is a matter of concern to people when the arms race  and especially the nuclear arms race  between the two superPowers has become more intense and glaring. But hopes are one thing  reality another. For instance  we all talked about disarmament here a year ago. Now  after a year has passed  have the armaments accumulated by the two superPowers decreased  or have they increased? In our view  they have increased. Is the danger of war greater or less than last year? In our view  at least one cannot say it is less.133.	Why is this so? First  because the two superPowers are fiercely contending with each other on a global scale. And their arms expansion and war preparations serve their policy of hegemonism. Secondly  because the superPowers  when faced with increasingly acute economic troubles  inevitably turn to the further militarization of the national economy as the way out. In this regard  the present situation resembles that of the 1930s in many ways.134.	Disarmament is an old issue  and China's views on it are well known. We are in favor of disarmament. But we favor genuine and not sham disarmament  still less empty talk about disarmament coupled with actual arms expansion year after year. Some say that to hold a disarmament conference is better than none. We understand this well intentioned desire. But we consider that  when the arms race between the two superPowers  which directly threatens the people of the world  is being stepped up  and when the superPower with the label of ""socialism"" is actually bent on using empty talk at a disarmament conference as a cover for its arms expansion and war preparations  the convening of a nominal disarmament conference or its preparatory meeting will only pro* duce the effect of lulling the people of the world.135.	The Chinese Government is in favor of holding a genuine world disarmament conference. But the conference must have a clear aim and the necessary preconditions. The clear aim is the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons  and absolutely not the so called limitation of strategic arms. The necessary preconditions are: all nuclear countries  and particularly the two nuclear superPowers  the Soviet Union and the United States  must first of all undertake the unequivocal obligation that at no time and in no circumstances will they be the first to use nuclear weapons  particularly against nonnuclear countries and nuclear free zones for example  the Soviet Union should  first of all  undertake obligations in respect of the nuclear free zone in Latin America and they must withdraw from abroad alt their armed forces  including nuclear missile forces  and dismantle all their military bases  including nuclear bases  on the territories of other countries. Only thus will it be possible for all countries  big and small  on an equal footing  to discuss with equanimity and resolve the question of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and other questions  free from any threat of force.136.	In the absence of a reduction of the armaments of the two superPowers  what should the numerous small and medium countries do in the face of their threat? In our opinion  the small and medium countries should strive to strengthen their necessary and independent defense capabilities in the light of specific conditions. This is a fundamental and reliable abroad.13>. As expected  the Soviet Government  which comes up with some novelties each year  has put forward this year an item entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human well being and health"" [item 103J. The letter requesting the inclusion of this item as an important and urgent matter in the agenda of this session [A 19702] is so obscurely worded that one cannot make out its real meaning. We would rather wait till the Soviet representative explains the matter in clear and simple language before acting whether it deserves some comment 138. Eighth  the Chinese delegation would like to state the following views on the question of defending State sovereignty and national economic rights and interests.139* Inspired by the victorious struggle which the Arab countries and people waged with oil as a weapon  the third world countries have started an immense tide of struggle to defend their State sovereignty  control their national resources  develop their national economy and oppose exploitation and plunder by imperialism  and particularly that of the superPowers. Through the efforts of numerous small and medium steed countries from all parts of the world  the General Assembly at its sixth special session finally adopted the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a Hew International EconomicOrder. This was a significant victory for the united struggle of the third world countries. It marks a new trend in the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism  and particularly against hegemonism  a trend of deepening this struggle by carrying it into the economic field.140.	Since the sixth special session  the developing countries have strongly demanded the implementation of the provisions of the Declaration and the Program of Action and the continued transformation of the old international economic relations based on exploitation and plunder. More and mote developing countries are taking bold action to control their national resources and the production and pricing of their raw materials. They have further united themselves in various raw material producers' organizations to strive to break superPower manipulation and monopoly. An important part of this struggle of the third world is the work of formulating the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  initiated by the President of Mexico.141.	But the superPowers have done their utmost to belittle or deny the great significance of the Declaration and the Program of Action and tried by all means to obstruct the realization of the just demands of the third world. One superPower openly declared its disagreement with certain principal paragraphs in the two documents and obstinately refused to implement their provisions. The other superPower has set in motion its propaganda machine to vilify the Declaration and the Program of Action as showing ""regionalism"" and ""economism""  ""reflecting group interests""  and so on and so forth. This fully shows that both superPowers want to preserve the old order of exploitation and plunder.142.	Some people say that the current economic difficulties are caused by the increase in oil price. This is a specious statement. In the final analysis  the present economic difficulties are the inevitable outcome of the imperialist system; they are not due to increase in the prices of raw materials  still less to any alleged misdeeds on the part of the oil producing countries. Those people are daily spreading the idea that Arab and other oil producing countries have reaped a windfall of tens of billions of United States dollars through the oil price rise. But they forget that the international monopoly capital has reaped an immeasurably greater amount of super profits through long years of plunder and exploitation and through the forcing down of the prices of oil and other raw materials. Ever since the emergence of colonialism and then imperialism  the parity between the prices of raw materials and industrial goods on the world market has always been unfair. Particularly in times of economic crises  the colonialists and imperialists invariably use every possible means  including the forcing down of the prices of raw materials  to shift the grave consequences of economic crises on to the broad masses in the colonies and semi colons  i.e.  the developing countries of today. The imperialists regard this state of affair* **s normal and reasonable  and even as sacred and inviolable. Now  this sacred and inviolable state of affairs is being violated. To fly into a rage is futile. To bluff is also f 'tile. The profound significance of the oil battle lieu in the fact that the developing countries have united themselves and independently exercised control over their national resources and fought against plunder  exploitation and the shifting of crises on to them. Of course  higher oil prices have caused non oil producing countries of the third world some temporary difficulties. Ways should be sought to resolve these difficulties  but this struggle and its great historic significance must not be negated on this account.143.	Combating maritime hegemonism and formulating a new law of the sea is an important aspect of the struggle of the developing countries to safeguard state sovereignty and develop their national economy. At the recent Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held in Caracas  the great majority of the developing countries were for the establishment of an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles. Driven by circumstances  the two superPowers ostensibly gave up their opposition an attitude in which they had persisted all along. But  as if by agreement  they both raised a number of preconditions and restrictions under the name of a ""package deal"". The substance of these preconditions and restrictions is insistence on ""freedom of passage"" through straits within territorial seas and on ""freedom of fishing"" and ""freedom of scientific research"" in the exclusive economic zones. Nominally they have accepted a 200 nautical mile economic zone  but actually they want to emasculate the exclusive economic zone so that it will be devoid of any concrete substance and the developing countries will be left with nothing whatsoever. To put it bluntly  the ""freedoms"" demanded by the superPowers are their freedom to plunder the developing countries and their freedom to pursue hegemonism.144.	In particular  the super Power which claims to be ""the natural ally of the developing countries"" has put on an even more wonderful show. Assuming a compassionate tone  it exclaimed that international trade and security would be impaired if freedom of passage through straits within territorial seas should be denied  and that if it was not allowed to go fishing iii the exclusive economic zone  the fish there would die uselessly. You see  how kindhearted it is. In fact  these are but crocodile tears  which cannot disguise its vicious super features.145.	It is a serious struggle to defend State sovereignty  control national resources  develop national economy and combat superPower plunder and exploitation. The super Powers have bound to put up a desperate fight  but it will be of no avail. At the sixth special session of the General Assembly and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at Caracas  numerous developing countries came forward to expose and condemn the superPowers and resolutely called for smashing the old international order and taking their destiny into their own hands. This is a thing that has never happened before. The superPowers have never been so isolated. The situation is excellent. We are confident that the numerous developing countries  closing their ranks  allying with all forces that can be allied with and persevering in struggle  will surely continue to win new victories.146.	International developments show that the world has changed enormously and profoundly. Countries want independence  nations want liberation  and the people want revolution this torrential tide is sweeping into every corner of the earth. Storms have broken out even in places that have been rather quiet for decades. The world situation at present is indeed aptly described by the verse  ""The wind sweeping through the tower heralds a rising storm in the mountains."" And this wind is gathering momentum. At such a juncture   it is our hope that this session of the General Assembly will do some useful things to advance the cause of human progress. The Chinese delegation is ready to work with all of you toward this end."
"24",1339,"CIV",29,1974,"Mr. President  may I be permitted to express to you the sincere congratulations of the Government of the Republic of the Ivory Coast on your brilliant election to the prestigious post of President of the General Assembly. We are certain that you. will carry out the burdensome task entrusted to you with total success and that you will place your rich and great experience at the service of the world in general and of Africa in particular -our Africa  which is so much in need of genuine and lasting peace.60.	We would request the delegation of Honduras to transmit to its Government the sincere condolences of the Government of the Ivory Coast on the catastrophe which that country has recently suffered.61.	International relations are characterized today by economic insecurity. The ""Yom Kippur war"" has revealed a process which goes largely beyond the framework of the conflict and has had serious repercussions upon the internal and external policies of our countries  repercussions which have to be brought under control.62.	The cause of galloping inflation lies not only in the rise of energy prices but in numerous factors of the world economy. The development and the extraordinary growth of the industrialized countries of Europe  America and Asia rested upon the progress of science and technology  but also upon a false illusion which is now beginning to be dispelled: the very low price of raw materials and the weakness and the poverty of the countries producing those materials. It is against this state of affairs that our countries are now fighting. And the petroleum- producing countries have demonstrated that this undertaking had meaning. Of course  it is indeed because the prevailing international situation left them with no other option that the well-off countries were obliged to accept what they claimed to be unacceptable  namely  a substantial increase in the price of the raw material which they could not do without petroleum.63.	And we consider that the success achieved by the petroleum-producing countries is also our success; but we must be careful that it is properly co-ordinated with our fragile economies so that we can avoid being led to assume false positions. This success is a positive factor in the struggle for greater economic justice throughout the world.64.	Indeed  under our eyes an extraordinarily important fact is being brought about. From now on  in the case of this product there is at least a reversal of trend: it is the end of the buyer's market and the beginning of the sellers market; it is the latter now who sets the price for his merchandise and no longer the buyer  as is still the case in the present structure of international trade. It is for this new state of affairs that we have been struggling for more than a decade with respect to all commodities. The action undertaken by the petroleum-producing countries must assist in the thorough transformation of the present world economic system  which provides for industrialized countries a prosperity that is largely founded upon the deterioration of the terms of trade  which in turn leaves a very small margin for maneuver with respect to our own development.65.	The institutions which typify the current economic order pass over an unbearable situation  because they make it possible for some to live upon the negation of others. Their transformation and the establishment of new economic relations will be difficult to anticipate as long as the countries of the third world have not admitted the essential need for union and solidarity.66.	But in the meantime  and since the balance of power is unfavorable to us  it is necessary for us to install within the present system a certain number of escape valves. The best and the most efficient  in our opinion  is the one which involves the establishment of associations of producers on a product-byproduct basis  with the participation and unqualified support of all of the victims of the existing economic system  even if some of them are able now to fix the price for their raw materials. That is the only way that would make it possible for us to stake a claim in the economic field and emerge from this role of marginal and rival micro-groups  and together find a common and effective response to the essential question of commodities.67.	Of course  we do not intend to radicalize our positions. However  the continual impoverishment of our countries is becoming unbearable. It would truly be a catastrophe if the petroleum producers were to accept the position that their action should be dissociated from that of the remainder of the developing countries that produce raw materials and commodities. It is therefore important that following upon petroleum  which is an energy product of primary strategic importance  identical action be conducted with respect to other raw materials so that it might be possible to develop a policy that would be the reflection of a permanent and strengthened solidarity among the proletarian countries.68.	That solidarity must take concrete form. For that it is necessary for the developing countries to unite  but it is also and above all necessary for the richer among them to remain very close to the poorer and least fortunate among them so as not to neglect the fundamental influence of the political factors of solidarity.69.	In this respect we believe that an equitable and realistic solution for rearranging the world economic order that has been so strongly disturbed now would be the implementation of the close cooperation advocated in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)].70.	We  the Members of the United Nations  must recognize that the slogans in our resolutions which frequently conceal our shortcomings must give way to pragmatic methods of approach to problems  because all  large and small  are living through the most disturbing economic adventure of our times. Together we can master the world economy  galloping inflation and the consequences of the energy crisis. Over and above all this there remains  in the case of each of us  a margin which may be opened to reciprocal concessions; otherwise  more than one of our leaders will have his sleep haunted by the nightmares brought on by the cries of the hungry.71.	The political future also remains gloomy. Indeed  since the Second World War our planet has never really known genuine peace. None of the conflicts shaking the world has been resolved. Those who are so skillful at producing these conflicts proceed to circumscribe them  to regionalize them and to localize them far from their own frontiers. In Viet Nam  in Cyprus and in the Middle East  we have been able to do nothing other than to accept an impasse in which we enclose ourselves more and more.72.	In Viet Nam men continue to die by the thousands and life remains unbearable for all as a result of the virulence and intolerance of irreconcilable ideologies which have confronted each other for more than a quarter of a century.73.	In southern Africa life continues to take the form of an injustice and a monstrous moral indignity  and the frailty of peace in that part of the world is quite obvious for all.74.	In the Middle East  the hope born of the Geneva Peace Conference is evaporating. The earlier situation of ""no peace  no war"" has reinstated itself. The ubiquity of the cannon merchants is again to be observed in the region. And the great ones are responsible for the infernal escalation of the arms race. It is even claimed that it is possible thereby to curb the inflation that is at present rampant throughout the world.75.	The Middle East constitutes one of the numerous impasses into which we have been led by the confrontation of the great Powers for more than a quarter of a century. Yet they all agreed to propose and vote in favor of resolution 181 (II) of 29 November 1947 which imposed the partition of Palestine.76.	But there is more. Twenty-one years later one of those great ones  a friend of the Arabs  declared again  on 18 November 1968  in Budapest:""We consider that any acceptable solution in the Middle East must include recognition of the right of Israel to lead an independent national existence. This opinion is also shared by the Arabs.""77.	One year  later  in chorus  on 20 September 1969  in a collective declaration made at United Nations Headquarters  those great Powers reaffirmed ""the right of the States of the region  all the States of the region  to exist"". At the same time they proclaimed with equal conviction ""the recognition of the legitimate right of the Palestinian people"". And the whole of this imbroglio stems from Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967  which  in order to avoid the eternal right of veto  was drafted in terms sufficiently equivocal to allow of as many contradictory interpretations as the oracle of Delphi.78.	Truth to tell  no enigma exists. These declarations are made deliberately and at the cost of the grossest contradictions. We  in the Ivory Coast  are convinced that any peace strategy which may 5K devised will be doomed to failure if  setting aside fanatical formulas  it is not based on certain facts which flow from the analysis we have just made and which cannot be ignored.79.	First  Arabs and Jews lived side by side in Palestine for centuries. Even if the latter were less numerous  one thing is evident: Christians  Jews and Muslims lived together in perfect .harmony and underwent foreign occupation.80.	Secondly  there was a historic vote -but a vote with stories about it too - the General Assembly vote of 29 November 19473 by which the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian question  embodying the report of its Sub-Committee was adopted. That Sub-Committee included  among others  the United States and the Soviet Union. The result was a national home  a single one  for the Jews: Israel. Why? The chain of events  the complexity of the diplomacy Of the time  the dexterity of the actors of the time  lead the ivory Coast to stop here and not exhaust itself by looking for the responsibilities involved.81.	Thirdly  since then we have all been confronted directly by the rigorous and passionate violence of the men who created this conflict and by the violence which the conflict in turn brought about. Intermittent wars  short  but cruel and useless  in 1948  1956  1967 and 1973  were sorry incidents of these events. The destruction of the State of Israel appears to be a mythical hypothesis since the four great Powers are unanimously in favor of guaranteeing the existence of that State.82.	Fourthly  the other inhabitants—Palestinians  Arabs  Muslims and Christians -no longer have a fatherland  however. Yet our era has adapted itself rather well to the existence of divided countries: the two Germanys  the two Koreas  to mention only those. Thus it is no longer astonishing that the radicalization of Palestinian nationalism  which needs no further definition  is becoming frenetic and hortatory and that this struggle has become the governing element of the Middle East.83.	Fifthly  the return of the* territories occupied by Israel since  the six-day war will not resolve the problem of peace in the Middle East. The Palestinian problem antedated the six-day war.84.	Sixthly  the already complex problem will be further complicated if we continue to leave it at the level of the solidarity of all the Arabs against the solidarity of all the Jews  including those of the Diaspora throughout the world. Moreover  the problem is more a problem of the major Powers responsible for partition than an Israeli-Arab problem.85.	It is on the basis of the desire to know what must be known that we have recapitulated these facts. But  since everything is linked together  everything is interconnected  everything is there  the Ivory Coast asks your indulgence  your tolerance and your understanding  that of all of you in general and that of the great Powers in particular  in letting me present the position of my country on this crucial problem. In order to do this  the Ivory Coast will abide by the main constant features of its diplomacy.OUr country seeks neither to please nor to offend  to contribute with all its efforts to the pursuit of a just  equitable and durable peace in this part of the world which is so dear to the whole of mankind.86.	There is a saying current in my country: ""A man cannot hide the sun with his hand"". Thus  if the Jews of Palestine have a national home  Israel -and few today would seriously challenge this- the other Palestinians  the Christians and the Muslims remain without a fatherland. Therefore we must recognize that they are no longer simple refugees: they constitute an organized community. And there will be no peace in the Middle East as long as that community has not found its fatherland.87.	What can I tell you  the great ones of this world  if not that you must have the honesty to recognize your errors and to correct them  instead of continuing in them  as you are doing now  to the misfortune of the whole world?88.	In this region you only want to avoid a fierce confrontation among yourselves. Your concern is to  principle and your interests at each base of the development of the situation. Your interventions are based more on the appropriateness possible control of the Mediterranean than on the step for genuine peace. Indeed  constantly to reaffirm legitimate rights of the Palestinian people without applying legitimate rights isdeliberately to turn your back on peace. Gentlemen  see to it that the Palestinians recover their part of Palestine  which you partitioned  and you will save world peace. Then you will also be bringing about the conditions necessary for a fruitful dialog between Israelis and Palestinians and our hopes for fruitful co-operation between the enemy cousins will be realized. Meanwhile  if we do not do this  we shall be setting out on a course of no return which  because of the ebb and flow of the situation  will slip out of our control.89.	The same drama  born of the mania for partition imposed by the political psychology of power  is also being played out in the same area in the case of Cyprus. The crisis through which the Republic of Cyprus is at present passing derives its origin from a fear felt in common by both the Greek and Turkish communities: the fear that the island will be attached to Greece  that it will be partitioned  that there will be intervention at any moment on the part of one or another of the guarantor Powers in the internal affairs of the country. Perhaps in place of these so-called treaties of guarantee  which are inadmissible for a sovereign State and which add to the confusion  it might be possible to write into the constitution of Cyprus the principle of the inalienability of any part of the territory of the Republic  a clause that appears in all of our constitutions.90.	Be that as it may  the right of intervention which Great Britain  Turkey and Greece have arrogated to themselves is unacceptable  not only for Cyprus  a sovereign State  but also for the United Nations. It infringes on the fundamental principle of the Charter. Used as it has been used  it will result in a guerrilla-type resistance internally and  externally  will bring about reactions with unforeseeable and incalculable consequences for the island and for the entire world as well. Thus  we must not become accomplices in this sense of global power that is felt by each of these States  this desire to impose on another State Member of this Organization its way of life. We must rid Cyprus of its tunic of Nessus  that truly lethal garment represented by those treaties.91.	For 10 years Cyprus remained s able. Archbishop Makarios  with his keen sense of national and international political realities  succeeded in remaining the guarantee for the genuine independence of the island. In Cyprus  the praiseworthy goal he pursued was the establishment of a system of integration of the two communities within a unitary State  one in which authentic democratic procedures would guarantee  without discrimination  the totaT safeguarding of individual rights. But the Republic of Cyprus is a victim of the redistribution of realities in this complex game of chess that is being played in the Mediterranean. Must we admit the necessity for violence in the taking of power? We do not think so. And that is exactly why we reproach the advocates of the theory of ""necessary revolutionary violence"". Such a climate is dangerous and offers no guarantee for anyone.92.	All those -instigators  actors or accomplices- for whom the coup d'etat has become an institution that is an end in itself  bear a grave responsibility in this deadly and immoral provocation. They have on their consciences thousands of innocent dead and the despair of tens of thousands of refugees.93.	We proclaim once again that force must net prevail and must not count as a paying proposition. In this tragic Cyprus affair that causes us so much concern  we believe that we must entrust the requisite powers to the Secretary-General for the purpose of achieving the evacuation of foreign troops. After that  we must attempt to reconcile two necessities: that of compromise between the parties  and that of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus  in the absence of which we shall be consolidating a state of permanent insurrection that would result in a turmoil that would postpone for ever any peace in the region and pose a terrible danger to peace throughout the world.94.	In sustaining this position  we shall be loyal to our ideal which rejects discrimination in all its forms. Greek Cypriots  Turkish Cypriots  Christians  Muslims  Jews  blacks  whites or yellows—we shall never accept any classification of human beings on this abominable basis. We must help to bring about the birth of a national pan-Cypriot feeling.95.	It is because we are convinced of our anti-racist position that we reject the policy of apartheid in South Africa and that of the illegal regime of Ian Smith  together with all other forms of racial discrimination in the world.96.	The physicist Jean Debiesse is right in affirming  with mathematical proof  that racism is all the more stupid in that we are all  absolutely all of us  of the same blood. One can laugh at this demonstration; some will because they are skeptics  others because they are believers and regard this as a truism  a truth already affirmed by the revealed religions. And yet it is these latter who are fighting in Cyprus  in Ireland  in the Middle East  and who  in the name of religion  practice apartheid in South Africa.97.	The economic future is gloomy. The political future is likewise gloomy. But there is a ray of hope that has appeared. The right to self-determination and independence has been recognized in the case of the Territories under Portuguese domination. This phenomenon is quite different from the cases  so frequent in politics  where happenstance finally becomes reality. At the 1253rd meeting of the Security Council  held on 8 November 1965  the Ivory Coast expressed its conviction that arms would never prevail against what that old man in Cabinda called ""novas ideas"" (new ideas).98.	We had to touch the sensitive heartstrings of Portugal and bring it to reason. What nation  however fierce it may be  cannot be brought over to political virtue and reasonable human feelings? The right of peoples to govern themselves is the foundation of all civilization  and the winds of nationalism blowing through Africa are a feature of that genuine civilization. Thus  progressively  thanks to the action of all  the idea of liberty has won Portugal over. Portugal is to be credited with having found realistic truth  most fortunately  by coming closer to reality with us  and it is for that reason that we are most gratified at the important decisions that have recently been taken by the new Portuguese Government to grant independence to all its Territories. Africa is seeking neither revenge nor retribution  and the independence granted will make it possible for Portugal's presence in our continent to be fraternal  adopted  accepted and desired.99.	We celebrate the independence of Guinea- Bissau. This new nation  and those that will yet accede to independence  are and will be Members of this Organization. They represent its future and what it will become. Our financial and technical assistance will be essential to them for binding up the wounds they have incurred in their struggle and for establishing themselves as independent and viable countries. To that end  we propose the establishment of a fund  through voluntary contributions made by States Members of the Organization and by all countries that have recognized or that will recognize them. The precedent already exists and can be repeated in their favor.100.	I would not wish to conclude without addressing  on behalf of my country  our most heartfelt congratulations to the gallant people of Guinea- Bissau and its courageous freedom fighters  nor without respectfully - and devotedly saluting the memory of the one who gave his life for the liberation of his people  Amilcar Cabral.101.	I would also wish to pay a special tribute to President Leopold Sedar Senghor of Senegal  who made discreet use of dialog so much maligned to complete the freedom fight  thus confirming the virtues of dialog.102.	The new Portugal has realized that the time of colonialism is over. It has shown itself strong enough to make a fresh start. We believe it deserves our congratulations and encouragement.103.	The settlers in Mozambique sought to distract the decolonizing forces of Portugal. They mutinied. They machine-gunned the African quarters at random and left almost 100 dead behind them. That scenario is a well-known trap  filled with rancor and tragic reminiscence  which always turns against its authors. Those settlers do not  understand that the phenomenon which they are experiencing results not from the abandonment by metropolitan countries of their empires but from the irrepressible force of nationalism. Nothing justified that Lourengo Marques crime  which brought them to absurdity. The nationalists have shown as much sang-froid as realism in the face of the obsessed hatred of the settlers.104.	The Frente de Libertao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] advocated a harmonious and democratic multiracial nation. All it received by way of reply was a show of chauvinistic fanaticism from petty settlers who are part of the aberrant designs of world colonialism.105.	The continuing and unavoidable disaster of colonialism in all its forms is so eloquent that it would not have been necessary for us to dwell upon its last throes if it were not significant to note that the supercilious chauvinism of those settlers and their frenetic colonialism  feeding on the fantasy of the past  might lead them to a dead end  an ill-conceived escalation  a bluff as in the case of the Organization de l'armee secrete [OAS] in Algeria with the sorry consequences of an exodus without return. But we have every confidence in the great wisdom of FRELIMO  which will not allow itself to be drawn into devastating hatred.106.	We shall continue to applaud Portuguese decolonization. The arrival of General Spinola has brought about important changes in our relations with Portugal. We are ready to establish proper diplomatic relations with that henceforth friendly country.107.	Before Spinola  de Gaulle  too  experienced a similar situation during the process of the decolonization of Algeria the OAS. Unfortunately  colonization abounds with such retrograde minds  just as imbued with a somewhat faded imperial elegance as those of the Mozambique settlers. De Gaulle settled his problems with the honor of the great soldier having the creed of the pledged word and a clear vision of the future. We note which satisfaction the statement of the French Minister for Foreign Affairs relating to the forthcoming accession to independence of the Comoro Archipelago [2238th meeting]  a declaration which is part of the noble traditions of France.108.	The Lusaka agreements cannot and must not be called into question  and to prevent this all precautions must be taken so that those anarchists  those camouflage racists and they are prolific in that region shall not play the role of termites in the works of the institutions born of Lusaka.109.	General Spinola has already shown proper understanding of the goals of the Organization. We have made the necessary distinction between the former leaders and those who today have courageously and resolutely embarked upon the course of democracy and decolonization. We look with considerable sympathy on their efforts and we are ready to help them  if necessary  to break the dark forces which are still prevalent among them and in Africa seeking to block the accession to independence of Mozambique  Angola and the Cape Verde Islands.110.	The United Nations must  without locking itself into a complacent alibi ""internal affairs"" help Portugal in crushing the last depraved advocates of colonialism so that they will for all time lose their last illusions.111.	In spite of the very legitimate complaints against South Africa  it is nevertheless fair to recognize that its refusal to be mixed up in the affairs of Mozambique and Angola now makes impossible the establishment of a new Rhodesia in Southern Africa. Let us hope that  on the basis of the Portuguese example  South Africa will show an equal comprehension vis-a-vis the United Nations and grant independence to Namibia.112.	Mr. President  it is truly symbolic that it is under your presidency the presidency of one of the gallant sons of Algeria that the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples is thus being implemented.113.	We ask Bangladesh and Grenada to accept our warm congratulations. May we  after Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau  soon see Mozambique  Angola  the other Portuguese Territories and the Comoros assume their rightful place among us  while we await with impatience  as you know  the arrival of Zimbabwe and Namibia."
"25",1374,"CMR",29,1974," For many years  from this rostrum and others  the non-aligned countries have constantly called for peace and detente -a far-reaching general detente which would lead to international understanding and co-operation. As pointed out by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work' of the Organization [AI960llAdd.l]  it is comforting to see that here and there in the world there is continuing progress towards detente.47.	One serious threat to international peace and security  as we have never ceased to condemn  is the persistence of colonialism and racial discrimination in Africa. However  there are very promising developments in the Portuguese colonies of Africa. History teaches us that a people which oppresses another cannot be free  and this truth has been amply confirmed in Portugal. The Portuguese people  subjugated by one of the last Fascist regimes of our century  was unable to liberate itself so long as the Portuguese Government was bent on pursuing overseas and by force of arms a policy of colonial occupation which history  the determination of the colonized peoples and world opinion condemned to inevitable failure.48.	As things turned out  in their heroic and just struggle against colonialism  the valiant liberation movements in the Portuguese colonies contributed substantially to the liberation of the Portuguese people itself. The glory for this is theirs. Today  after half a century of Fascist and obscurantist dictatorship  the Portuguese people can at last live as a free people  devoting itself to the urgent task of development and resuming its place in the community of nations.49.	But if the events of April 1974 are to become a genuine revolution worthy of the great humanist traditions of Portugal  if they are to become part of the logic of detente  the dialectical process must proceed to the very end. In other words  the political liberalization which has been taking place in the metropolitan country and which is no more than a necessary prerequisite must be followed by the rapid accession to independence and freedom of the Portuguese colonies as well.50.	We are following and we welcome all the efforts being made by the new Portuguese regime in this direction. We hope that nothing will arrest its progress along the honorable road upon which it has embarked  at the end of which it will And the respect and friend-ship of the African countries and of all the peoples of the world who love peace and justice.51.	We also hope that the Portuguese example will inspire all the other colonial Powers to speed up the inevitable decolonization of the colonial territories they still occupy. To this effect  we support the efforts of the French Government to speed the process of decolonization of the Comoro Islands.52.	We also take note of the recent statements of the SpanisL Government concerning what is called Spanish Sahara  and we are closely watching political developments in that territory in the light of the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity [iOAU] and the United Nations which should lead to effective and genuine decolonization 53.	Finally  we hope that there will soon be a happy outcome in the case of Zimbabwe  that of Azania and that of the international territory of Namibia. In other words  and in accordance with United Nations resolutions  Pretoria must put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia. The Government of the United Kingdom  the administering Power  must restore legality in Rhodesia by establishing a genuine democracy  resulting from negotiations with the liberation movements  which are the sole authentic representatives of the people of Zimbabwe. As for apartheid  which is a disgrace to our century  the United Nations must stop at nothing in order to bring to heel the South African racists who have made racism a State policy.54.	My delegation unreservedly supports the decision taken recently by the Assembly [resolution 3207 (XXIX)] to invite the Council to consider frankly the relations between South Africa and the United Nations  and will spare no effort in the Security Council to ensure the triumph of the just cause of the African people of Azania.55.	I take this opportunity of paying a well-deserved tribute to all the friendly countries which so far have given their material  financial or political support to the African liberation movements. As I did in the course of the good-will mission which I have just carried out in some of thole countries at the head of a delegation of the Co-ordination Committee for the Liberation of Africa  on the express instructions of the OAU  I wish to reiterate to all those countries the deep gratitude of Africa.56.	The encouraging prospects we have just mentioned concerning decolonization should not  however  make us forget that detente remains fragile so long as hotbeds of tension or bones of contention continue to exist in Viet Nam  Korea  Cambodia  the Middle East or Cyprus and so long as brutal or covert interference by foreign Powers in the internal affairs of other States continues to spread. That is why our desire has always been that a lasting and just peace should rapidly return to those regions.57.	As far as Viet Nam is concerned  we look for the complete withdrawal of foreign troops so that the Vietnamese people  within the framework of the Paris agreements  may bind up their wounds in freedom and set about rebuilding their economy laid waste by long years of war.58.	Similarly  we consider that following the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea the time has come to withdraw all foreign troops still stationed on Korean territory. It is only in a situation free from outside interference that the people of Korea will be able freely and effectively to resolve the problem of the independent and peaceful reunification of their country.59.	In Cambodia  powerfully and firmly united behind its President  Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  in the National United Front of Kampuchea  the Cambodian people are successfully combating aggression. More than 90 per cent of the territory of Cambodia with more than 80 per cent of the population is now liberated and under the direct administration of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia. My delegation accordingly considers that the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia must resume its rightful place in the United Nations without further delay.60.	We welcome all the efforts of the United Nations and on a bilateral basis to restore peace to the Middle East  but we still say that  in order to bring about a just and lasting solution  these efforts must be based essentially on the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories and the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.61.	In the island of Cyprus the constitutional edifice erected so laboriously in 1960 has been taking terrible punishment which reached its peak in July 1974 and has already cost thousands of innocent lives. The guarantors of the island's status -the United Kingdom  Greece and Turkey -have been unable  and with good reason  to find immediate ways and means of restoring peace  which is a prerequisite for the search for a negotiated solution to this problem  the implications of which  by endangering an established system  could threaten world peace.62.	Confronted with this impasse  the world was in good conscience obliged to react and to call for an end to human suffering and the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops  with the praiseworthy objective of creating conditions favorable for the final settlement of the question by the establishment of the independence  unity and territorial integrity of the island. Those were essentially the concerns of the Security Council in its resolution 353 (1974) of 20 July 1974. As a non-permanent member of the Council  Cameroon was happy to contribute to those efforts  which must be continued.63.	Much remains to be done in this direction  in as much as that resolution of the Council and the other subsequent resolutions  the Geneva Conference and other initiatives in the same direction have not produced the desired effects. One of the things the Assembly must do at this session is to seek an appropriate solution to this problem  in which humanitarian considerations must take precedence over political aspects.64.	That is why my delegation  aware of the tense situation which continues to prevail in Cyprus and  if truth be told  throughout the eastern Mediterranean  will look favorably upon and support any initiative from no matter what quarter tending definitively to restore peace to the island and to resolve no less definitively  in the interests of the Greek and Turkish communities of the island  the political problem posed by an untoward arrangement whose failure all deplore.65.	I should like now to address myself to a matter of concern which is crucial to detente  and I refer to international co-operation. The sixth special session of the General Assembly  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Caracas  and  most recently  the World Population Conference held at Bucharest  revealed the importance of the subjects they dealt with  the urgent need for fair solutions  and at th« same time the stubbornness of selfish national interests that render all efforts of cooperation practically useless. 66.	Twelve months ago  when the energy crisis be-came widespread  we realized how precarious our situation was; but our problems did not begin yesterday. For several years now  world prices for certain commodities have been continuously rising. According to the economists  the relationship between prices and incomes is direct  which is to say that high living standards are matched by high wages which in their turn lead to rising prices. But this situation does not prevail to an equal degree everywhere in the world.67.	It is true in the developed countries  where the majority of the people earn salaries above the average. But when the developing countries  whose active population must content themselves with low wages  are caught up in the machinery of inflation  their purchasing power undergoes a sharp decline. Thus  the poor become every day poorer and the Governments  destitute of resources  encounter insurmountable difficulties which can jeopardize the functioning of essential institutions.68.	It has been said that today 15 per cent of the human race possesses 85 per cent of the world's wealth; and the majority of those people live in Western Europe and North America  while hunger  ignorance  disease  poverty and natural disaster are the lot of the countries of the third world.69.	In recent years we have drawn the attention of the international community to the many and grave problems of the third world. Perhaps we were not understood. It seems to me that the petroleum-producing countries  in their frustration  have merely burst the abscess of a crisis which had long been gathering. Their position is well known. But did the developing countries have to go so far before the international community finally woke up to the situation and decided to come to the aid of our frail economies  by setting fair prices for our raw materials?70.	All of us in this Assembly have an idea of the way in which bilateral and multilateral aid is granted to the developing countries. While the gratitude of those countries should be emphasized here  we may ask for how much longer this aid will continue to be forthcoming  and what is its real impact on our economies  when all the other factors necessary for harmonious  accelerated  extensive and lasting development are lacking.71.	We have noted that since the end of the Second World War the prices of manufactured goods have increased year after year. With these rising prices  the level of living in industrialized regions has substantially improved  and the populations of Western Europe and North America have thus entered an age of luxury and even waste. The developing countries can only look on helplessly while this is happening for  while our production increases thanks to energetic development efforts  the income that we derive from it continues to decline.72.	Until a. just and proportionate relationship is established between the prices of manufactured goods and those of raw materials  we shall never be safe from technological aggression. In other words  the real problem facing mankind is that of a better distribution of resources  services and technology  and this can only be achieved by a vigorous policy of international co-operation  which was what the Second United Nations Development Decade seemed to be aiming at with  among other objectives  the transfer of technology.73.	We are not asking for charity from the wealthy countries  even though history tells us that those countries in large part built their colossal fortunes and ensured their own development by the exploitation of our peoples and the plunder of our natural resources. What we are asking is merely a new and more equitable economic order.74.	The General Assembly at its sixth special session showed the way to avoid the errors of the old economic system which led to the present crisis. One of the most important results of that session was the unanimous recognition of the interdependence of the industrialized countries and the countries of the third world that provide raw materials  and the interdependence of problems of trade  development financing and the international monetary system. To solve those problems we need co-ordinated solutions  both on the national and on the international level. The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and  above all  the Program of Action for the establishment of this new international economic order  indicate both the objectives to be attained and the means of attaining them.75.	My delegation particularly welcomes the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI)  in which the General Assembly calls on the whole United Nations family to undertake immediately an emergency assistance operation in order to aid those of the developing countries most deeply affected by the present world economic crisis. My delegation notes with satisfaction that many countries have already clearly indicated their willingness to make voluntary contributions to that Special Program.76.	Where tLsre has been some progress towards political detente it has often been outside the United Nations  Similarly  in the field of co-operation we cannot seem to find  inside our Organization  a platform acceptable to both industrial and third-world countries whereas  outside the United Nations  in a bilateral  subregional  regional or multilateral context  some positive action is possible.77.	Can we therefore conclude that the United Nations has failed in its mission? Not at all. Over the 29 years of its existence the United Nations  because it is unique and universal  has emerged as an outstanding forum for contacts  for the exchange of views  and for collective reflection on the common problems of all mankind. Furthermore  in the specialized agencies major efforts have been made and positive results achieved. We hope that with the distinguished and dynamic encouragement of the Economic and Social Council  and with the assistance of our tireless Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  to whom we should like to reiterate our congratulations  the work of the specialized agencies will continue and expand.78.	It is therefore under the banner of hope that we come to take part in the work of the twenty-ninth session. It is  of course  a qualified hope  but a hope that will one day be realized through the determination of some  the understanding of others and the firm purpose of all who bear the name of man. Our hope is a world where peace  justice and human solidarity will prevail.79.	When we speak of human solidarity  our thoughts naturally go to Honduras and Peru  whose peoples have been so sorely tried by a terrible hurricane. I hope that the delegations of Honduras and Peru will accept the deeply felt condolences of the delegation of Cameroon in this painful hour. Far from being discouraged  such trials should  on the contrary  strengthen our solidarity and shore up our hopes for a better future.80.	You will  therefore  understand  Mr. President  that my delegation  moved by this hope  appreciates the three-fold tribute represented by your enthusiastic and unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session. This is  first of all  a tribute to the people of Africa who  thanks to the dynamic and resolute stand of OAU over the past few years  particularly since the last session  have played a considerable role in reaffirming and strengthening the ideals of freedom  independence and solidarity set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.81.	It is also a tribute to the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  whose valiant people have won imperishable laurels not only through its heroic struggle against colonial oppression  but also because of its continuing fight against the injustices of imperialism as denounced at the last special session  convened in fact on the initiative of your famous head of State  President Houari Boumediene.82.	And it is a tribute  finally  to yourself  a diplomat of consummate skill  a tireless freedom fighter and impassioned defender of the dignity and independence of the peoples of the third world. Beyond the mere ritual of congratulations  believe me  Mr. President  my delegation feels itself directly touched by these tributes paid by the most noble world Assembly to the head of the delegation of a friendly sister country.83.	We should also like to extend this tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Benites  who so wisely and responsibly directed the difficult proceedings of the twenty- eighth session and  above all  the sixth special session.84.	A sign of the times: it is under your presidency that we joyfully welcome for the first time the delegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  that brother State whose independence  proclaimed on the field of battle a year ago  tolled the knell for the last and oldest of the colonial empires. We welcome the admission to this Assembly of our brothers from Guinea- Bissau and of our friends from Bangladesh and Grenada  and we extend to them our warmest congratulations.85.	The admission of three new Members is part of the thrust towards universality  which must be one of the objectives of our Organization if it really wishes to be the major center for harmonizing the actions of all the nations of the world so as to maintain international peace and security  to develop international relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples  and to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character. In a word  to usher in a genuine world civilization in conformity with the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter."
"26",1416,"COD",29,1974,"Mr. President  in the name of my delegation and on my own behalf  I should like to extend to you my warm congratulations on your brilliant election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. In the current world context  during this period of decolonization  it is of particular significance that the session is being presided over by a great son of Africa. Indeed  Africa is extremely proud to see that Guinea-Bissau has now joined the United Nations and that the decolonization process as far as Portugal is concerned  at least is accelerating and intensifying and is in the process of transforming our continent into a completely liberated one.241.	Moreover  your election  Sir  falls within the historical context of a process which is leading the world inexorably towards the total liberation of every form of shackles  enslavement  inequalities  injustice  discrimination  hunger and poverty. I am therefore convinced that your long and vast experience in international affairs  your valuable contribution to the African cause  your lucidity  modesty and firmness  not to mention the great services you have rendered to your own country  will all be of vital use to the Assembly in this crucial period for the international community and at a time when the word ""crisis"" is mentioned all around the world with alarming persistence.242.	In addition  your election follows the holding  last April  of the sixth special session  which dealt with the pressing issues of raw materials and development.243.	You are indeed the worthy representative of a sister State whose courage and determination were able to overcome a decaying colonialism. The blood shed by the Algerian people serves as an example and a symbol for all of Africa and for all those struggling for their liberation.244.	The presence in this Hall of the delegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to whom  on behalf of my delegation  I extend a hearty welcome is the tangible result of the armed struggle of the PAIGC against the forces of evil. It is also proof of goodwill on the part of the new Portugal since its change of Government on 25 April 1974  and gives the international community grounds for hope. The United Nations  which has always recognized the legitimacy of the struggle of the Guinean nationalists  is thus reaping the fruits of that victory.245.	The Republic of Zaire  which made its full contribution to the struggle of the African liberation movements  is particularly gratified over this stunning success  all the more so since it was one of the first countries to recognize Guinea-Bissau's independence. We therefore welcome with open arms  to both the African group of States and the international community  this young sister State with which we shall be maintaining close relations of friendship  and developing intense co-operation in all fields.246.	May I also take this occasion to extend a warm and cordial welcome to the other new States just admitted to the Organization  namely  Bangladesh and Grenada.247.	On behalf of the Founding President of the Popular Movement of the Revolution and President of the Republic of Zaire  and on behalf of the Executive Council and in the name of my delegation  I sincerely congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his courageous efforts to hasten the liberation of territories still under colonial and racist domination. A great pilgrim for peace  the Secretary-General traveled to Portugal  where he made arrangements with the new Government of that country to advance the cause of those territories.248.	Although his mandate in regard to certain territories remains unimplemented  my delegation feels that the new steps taken by the Secretary-General should be encouraged ; and supported by all States Members of the Organization  because  as was stated from this rostrum on 4 October 1973  during the twenty- eighth session  by the Founding President of the Popular Movement of the Revolution and President of the Republic of Zaire  Citizen Mobutu Sese Seko: ""Africa today remains the only continent where colonization  racial segregation  apartheid and contempt of man because of the pigmentation of his skin persist."" [.2140th meeting  para. 103.] Both for the honor of the Organization and for international peace and security  it is high time that this situation changed. Fortunately  the new Portugal has given us grounds for hope.249.	Indeed  we are impatient to see the former Portuguese colonies rapidly achieve complete independence  but we should also pay all due tribute to the new Portugal  which  itself emerging from the shadows and from fascism  has already begun the process of complete decolonization  at least for Guinea- Bissau and Mozambique  and we earnestly hope that this will be the case also with Angola.250.	To be sure  although we cannot overlook the particular situation in that territory in relation to the other Portuguese colonies  we have noted with satisfaction the repeatedly stated determination of the new Portuguese authorities to initiate negotiations as soon as there is unity among the various liberation movements representing the fighters in Angola. The international community can but encourage and spur Portugal on to assume all its responsibilities towards that end.251.	While congratulating the new Portugal on the action it has undertaken  the Republic of Zaire nevertheless considers it premature to enter into diplomatic relations with Lisbon until it has carried out its decolonization task to the full.252.	Despite these bright promises  however  it must be noted that in many cases the world is still in total darkness. Such is the situation in Zimbabwe  Namibia and Azania.253.	Portugal  which was formerly accused of obscurantism  is today carrying out a struggle on two fronts: on the one  to vanquish domestic fascism  and on the other  to liberate the territories still under its domination. To this end  it has not hesitated to crush the revolt of the minority settlers who were longing for the bygone era of colonialism; whereas the United Kingdom  under the same conditions  has sacrificed the interests of the Africans for those of a minority of colonists  for the most part  British.254.	The worst of it is that that country  acting wickedly and in very bad faith  has succeeded in hoodwinking international opinion  rocking it to sleep with lullabies about trumped-up sanctions  when in reality it has betrayed our black brothers into the hands of the minority in Zimbabwe. That country bears full responsibility for its defeatism and I hope it realizes it. Taking refuge behind these trumped-up sanctions  the United Kingdom has the cynical presumption to go so far as to act as the policeman with regard to these measures and to accuse certain brother countries  mine among them  of violating the sanctions against Rhodesia.255.	As far as my country is concerned  this accusation is based on the fact that Zaire permitted an aircraft registered in Africa and trading with Rhodesia to land on its soil. But I ask you whether my country should have allowed an aircraft in distress and  what is more  of African registration to crash. If to come to the aid of an aircraft in distress is tantamount to trading with Rhodesia  we must frankly admit that we have here some rather curious reckoning which it can only be assumed is typically British.256.	All countries represented here are aware of Zaire's determination in the struggle for African liberation and none of them can doubt our will or determination to achieve the total liberation of Africa.257.	By those defamatory allegations  the United Kingdom Government is deliberately trying to mislead international opinion. The United Kingdom  curiously disguised in the cloak of virtue  pretends to forget that it is the cause of the daily tragedy of life for the black majority  oppressed by a white minority clique. Let it rather assume its responsibilities by following the example of the new Portugal and restoring order in its rebel colony instead of spreading servile and shameless lies. Zaire  for its part  will assume all its responsibilities and will not rest until peace and justice are established in Zimbabwe. The United Kingdom must intervene effectively to restore to the majority Zimbabwe people their rights  which have been usurped by a minority of racist colonizers.258.	Whatever may be the attitude of the racist minorities in southern Africa  we believe that the era of regimes of occupation  enslavement and domination has passed  because the international community is ever more aware of the absurdity of these regimes. They in turn  although they are now at bay  should still try to cure themselves of the political blindness that afflicts them and learn from the present situation.259.	My statement would be incomplete if I did not also speak of the situation of the Sahara still under Spanish domination  of Djibouti and of the Comoro Islands which France and Spain continue to keep under their yoke.260.	So far as the so-called Spanish Sahara is concerned  we are particularly gratified by the agreement reached between Morocco and Mauritania to submit the question to the judgment of the International Court of Justice. All the States Members of the United Nations should praise the wisdom of these countries and encourage them to pursue the peaceful road they have taken. In consequence  Spain must abandon the fallacious pretence of holding a referendum  because a referendum) is not synonymous with decolonization and  in any case  as far as we know  Spain did not organize a referendum when it seized that part of Africa. The decolonization of Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau was not accomplished by means of a referendum. And  incidentally  we may ask why Spain has not applied the same principle of holding a referendum in the case of Gibraltar.261.	Despite the comparative relaxation of tension that can be observed in international relations and at which my country rejoices  new causes of tension are being added to the discontent  the frustration and the spirit of revolt that are the habitual source of the crises that continually threaten international peace and security. The rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union  on the one hand  and the United States and China  on the other  is an important step towards the achievement of peaceful coexistence.262.	We have noted with satisfaction the efforts of the United States to find a solution to the Middle East problem  and we hope that more substantial results will follow the first steps that have been taken towards the achievement of a just and lasting peace in that part of the world. In any case  the Palestinian people is entitled to an existence worthy of that name and to a homeland. No definitive settlement of the Middle East problem can ignore the rights of that people. If the Israelis have a homeland  then it is essential to put an immediate end to the kind of Diaspora to which the Palestinian people seem to be condemned.263.	The forthcoming reopening of the Suez Canal will strengthen economic co-operation and trade be-tween the countries of that region and of other regions. It should also create an atmosphere of confidence and make the Indian Ocean a true zone of peace.264.	The Korean problem must also be solved in a just and satisfactory manner. The Republic of Zaire recognizes both Koreas and maintains good relations with both. We consider that it is for the Koreans themselves first of all to find a peaceful solution to their problem. Consequently  my country is at once in favor of accelerating the process of unification and opposed to anything that can hamper the achievement of the will of the Korean people.265.	The Paris Agreement of January 1973 has unfortunately not settled all the problems in Viet Nam. The parties concerned in the conflict must  therefore  continue their efforts to re-establish peace once and for all by eliminating all ambiguous situations.266.	With reference to Cambodia  Zaire denounces all foreign intervention. We believe that the efforts undertaken by the Government of Prince Sihanouk will achieve the complete reunification of the country.267.	Another conflagration has unfortunately erupted  this time in Cyprus. Zaire pronounces itself in favor of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and against all foreign intervention. The Cypriot problem must be solved by the Cypriots themselves  without any foreign intervention  within the framework of existing agreements and with respect for the rights of the communities involved.268.	Peace is one of the objectives sought by the Republic of Zaire in its relations with other States. Immediately after gaining its independence  my country suffered years of tragic civil war provoked by intervention on the part of foreign interests. We therefore attach great importance to the question of peace. The United Nations  whose main purpose is to maintain peace amongst nations  will find our country a steadfast ally: The people of Zaire are grateful to the United Nations for its contribution to the restoration of peace in Zaire.269.	Peace throughout the world that is the objective of the United Nations. Unfortunately  however  we are compelled to recognize that since the inception of the Organization peace has not generally prevailed throughout the world; conflicts have erupted almost everywhere in the Middle East  in Viet Nam  in Cambodia and  recently  in Cyprus.270.	The Organization has often been powerless to safeguard peace. This impotence is chiefly due to the fact that States Members and those not the least among them are very often in disagreement with the fundamental principles of the Charter. Various reasons have been advanced to explain the weakness of the Organization  whose structure  established in San Francisco after the Second World War  no longer suits the needs of the time.271.	The principles which govern decision-making in the Security Council  for example  by according certain States primacy over others  seem to us to contradict the principle of the equality of States. Those same States  moreover  have the right of the veto. Experience has shown that those privileged States in the Security Council have always used their right of veto whenever their own particular selfish interests were at stake.272.	The permanent members of the Security Council have an excessive advantage and they act accordingly by safeguarding their own prerogatives while preaching  of course  in their own cause. We can understand that these States are opposed to any revision of the Charter. But are we ready to make this forum the Disunited Nations or the United Nations?273.	We feel that the veto right belongs to another period  a period of the past  and should disappear from the text of the Charter. The Organization would thereby gain in prestige  and confidence in it would be renewed  because the maintenance of peace is no longer the monopoly of a few privileged States but  rather  a task incumbent on each Member State. It was on this basis that  in 1971  our country initiated the idea of revising the Charter. On 4 October 1973  before this very Assembly  the President of Zaire  Mobutu Sese Seko  confirmed this suggestion [ibid.  para. 202].274.	Acting on the basis of the non-representation of the African continent at the time of the elaboration of the Charter at San Francisco in 1945  we can state that this is the time to revise the Charter. For indeed  out of 51 signatory States  only three represented Africa  whereas now  out of 138 Member States  42 are African  almost a third of the entire membership. It seems to us that this important African presence in the Organization cannot continue to be ignored.275.	Lack of respect for the fundamental principles of the United Nations and the non-application of its recommendations and resolutions by certain States weaken the role of the Organization.276.	In violation of the principles of the -Charter  the United Kingdom refuses to fulfill its obligations towards the black majority in Rhodesia  while South Africa persists in the implementation of its policy of apartheid and seeks to extend that ignoble policy to Namibia. Finally  certain States become the accomplices of those others by supporting the enemies of the Organization  thus sapping its authority.277.	Despite certain weaknesses. of the Organization  Zaire is very gratified over its progress in safeguarding the cultural independence of Member States. Indeed  the recovery of their cultural heritage  which had been pillaged by the former colonial Powers  has made it possible for the third-world States to give effect to resolution 3187 (XXVIII)  which deals with the restitution of works of art to countries victims of expropriation.278.	We are very pleased to pay tribute to the perspicacity of the United Nations and to the wisdom of certain countries which have begun to implement this resolution. This applies notably to Belgium  which  although it did not always have extremely cordial relations with Zaire  nevertheless has given a useful example. Even before the adoption of that resolution  Belgium recognized the legitimacy of our action and promised to restore our works of art. We believe that this example should be followed by countries which have expropriated the cultural heritage of other countries.279.	In April of this year  on the initiative of the President of Algeria  the sixth special session of the Assembly was held in this very room. That session dealt solely with the problems of raw materials and development  which arc the main concern of all countries.280.	This awareness of world economic interdependence gave to the debates in this Hall an unequaled scope and depth. The special session was important both for the high level of representation at it and for the quality and tenor of the statements made. The debates presented a striking picture of the world economic situation. The majority of the countries  after having recognized the fundamental injustice of the present international economic system  formulated an extraordinary number of constructive proposals which the Ad Hoc Committee on the Special Programme  established by resolution 3202 (S-VI)  must harmonize in order to transform them into policies and plans of concerted action to govern the new international economic order. That new order  based on equity  equality  independence  the common interest and co-operation among all States  will correct inequalities and remedy injustices so as to ensure  for present and future generations  harmonious economic and social development.281.	At the sixth special session  the Assembly prepared directives in the form of a general Declaration of principles and a Programme of Action. By laying down a line of action to be followed  the Assembly made an enduring contribution  because  from now on  economic relations will be viewed in an entirely new light.282.	The Programme of Action has provisions relating to the difficulties encountered in the field of raw materials and the field of commerce  development and financing  as well as in the monetary system  the transfer of technology  industrialization  and the permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources.283.	Regardless of the results achieved  we can state that the session provided an opportunity to all States Members of the United Nations to realize the inter-dependence and complementarity of their respective economies  and demonstrated that each Member State has a voice in and a contribution to make to the development of the world economy.284.	There is a tendency to attribute the present economic difficulties solely to the energy crisis  whereas that crisis is the result of Inflation which has been manifest for some years now. Naturally  the oil problem has aggravated the situation  particularly as regards the poor countries  but we must not forget that inflation preceded the oil crisis. Furthermore  owing to the fact that it has affected all the countries of the world  this crisis which then seemed to be a necessary evil is  in the last analysis  a good thing. Because it affected exclusively the under-equipped countries  the rich countries were pleased and they chanted the hymn of prosperity and invoked the laws of the market and other magic principles. However  it now appears that everybody is concerned  and we can only hope that more lasting solutions can be found  not based on intimidation or sorcery but within a large framework  with the good faith of everyone.285 As to the oil-exporting countries  in view of the decisive role that oil plays in the world economy  these countries must bear their share of the responsibility in achieving a satisfactory settlement of the present crisis. We would therefore suggest that  at this session  the General Assembly give serious attention to this question and decide on the practical modalities for the application of the two important resolutions the Declaration and the Program of Action adopted at the sixth special session.286.	The Republic of Zaire  under the leadership of President Mobutu Sese Seko  did not await recognition of the right of all countries to their own resources  because for some years now our people has been master of its own soil apd subsoil. On 30 November 1973  nationalization measures were taken in order to complete our economic action programme so as to ensure for our r^ople full enjoyment of its sovereignty over its natural resources and effective and complete control of its entire national production. Thus  after achieving political independence  Zaire has attained full economic independence.287.	As we can see  economy problems are of concern to most States  particul&ciy the under-equipped countries. What we are demanding is greater justice in the field of economic co-operation with the developed countries  for any assistance given to the under-developed countries should contribute to their de-velopment and should not return in one form or another to the donor countries.288.	This well-known assistance for development is mostly a myth that is used to assuage the conscience of the rich countries. Not only is this assistance much too small to safeguard the standard of living of the recipient countries  but the instability of prices of raw materials and the scarcity of investments  together with the effects of inflation and the ever-rising prices for finished products  has kept the underdeveloped countries in a precarious situation  forever receiving assistance and up to their ears in debt. In these conditions  escape from underdevelopment is hopeless  and the haunting specter of colonization or recolonization retrains.289.	Zaire fully supported the proposal of the President of Mexico on the adoption of a Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. Such a document would be a very important and historic contribution. In order to obtain the support of all concerned  the economic rights and duties of States must take into account the principles of equity and international economic justice.290.	The world community must call on science and technology in the service of all. The transfer of technology constitutes  for the underdeveloped countries  the point of departure for real and harmonious development.291.	The sea-bed and ocean floor contain vast riches and resources which could be put at the service of all mankind. The sea increasingly appears to be a source of food  energy and minerals which could make up for the exhaustion of the earth's resources. According to data issued by the United Nations  15 per cent of oil resources is already being obtained from offshore exploitation  and that figure will reach 33 per cent in 1980. Sixty-five million tons of fish were harvested from the high seas in 1972. Furthermore  it has been estimated that certain mineral resources of the seabed are far more plentiful than those of the earth.292.	All that wealth must be shared  and to that end maritime frontiers. must be defined. That has been done only imperfectly in the four conventions signed in Geneva in 1958  conventions which are today largely discredited. More than half of the countries of the world have refused to ratify them  considering them too much a reflection of the interests of the main maritime Powers.293.	That is why the controversy on the law of the sea has finally been seen as an essential element of the problems upon which depend the fate of humanity  and of the struggle against underdevelopment and against the hegemony of certain Powers which would like to see the sovereignty and jurisdiction of States strictly limited  so that they can freely exploit the natural resources of seas other than their own.294.	The Third United Nations Conference oh the Law of the Sea  which met in Caracas from 20 June to 29 August 1974  strikingly confirmed the antagonism existing between the developed and the poor countries  since no text was adopted by that Conference. However  Caracas provided an opportunity for the third world to make its voice heard and to clarify its position.295.	The exploitation of the mineral resources of the sea and the sea-bed must be carried out in an organized  rational manner  from the point of view of well-applied international justice and with the object of preserving and conserving those resources for future generations. It should not serve to provide advantages for some to the detriment of others  particularly by prejudicing the interests of the underdeveloped countries whose prosperity depends essentially on the exploitation and exportation of raw materials. In order to avoid wasteful exploitation of those resources  control measures must be adopted  with the firm application of the principle of complementarity between the resources of the earth and those extracted from the st296.	We hope that the Conference at its third session  which is to be held in Geneva from 17 March to 10 May 1975  will find equitable solutions so that the resources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction may indeed constitute the common heritage of mankind  as was stated in the Declaration of Principles on this matter unanimously adopted by the General Assembly [resolution 2749 (XXV)].297.	The new conventions on the law of the sea should not enshrine as a principle the right of the strongest nation or of the nation which can best exploit the resources. All countries  whatever their size or degree of development  are equally entitled to exploit the resources of the sea.298.	A few weeks ago  the World Population Conference concluded its work in Bucharest. Several tendencies were revealed during the debates  particularly concerning the delicate problem of the birth rate. It is the view of my country that priority should be given to economic development and to the fairest redistribution of wealth rather than to the reduction of the birth rate.299.	Although we recognize the relevance of a realistic and responsible policy on population  Zaire cannot support the Malthusian theses which make the limitation of the birth rate a goal and an end in itself. That seems to us a policy of expediency designed to divert attention from the real problem  that of the inequality and injustice of the present international situation. The problem of poverty cannot be solved by killing off the poor.300.	In our view  the population density per square kilometer is one of the determining elements in deciding on any limitation of births. Countries with a population density of 200-300 per square kilometer are faced with the problem of birth control  while those with a population density of less than 50 per square kilometer have no need to concern themselves with it.301.	Propaganda would have us believe that there is a ""yellow peril""  whereas the true peril is the ""white peril"". The demographic statistics of China  for example  show that that country has not yet reached the critical threshold of over-population. In absolute numbers  with a population in China of 800 million  in a country of 9.8 million square kilometers  the population density is only 80 per square kilometer  whereas certain Western European countries have a population density twice  or even three or four  times as high.302.	In the final analysis  economic development and the raising of the standard of living are the primary objectives  while control of the birth rate is a matter of principle whose application must be left to each country in the light of its own capacity to feed its population and of its economic perspectives.303.	The present international situation  characterized as it is by coexistence and harmony between the great Powers  as well as by the appearance of many centers of power in the world  is not simply the result of rapprochement between the super-Powers but rather is the result of a long historic struggle of forces  and of new social values that have appeared in the contemporary world. Those new social forces have put the established order in question and imposed as a necessity world coexistence and ideological pluralism.304.	The center of gravity of international relations and conflicts  because of the joint struggle of the oppressed peoples to overcome their poverty  has shifted to the third world  which now carries real weight on the international scene  enabling the countries of the third world to play a new role in contemporary history.305.	The new historic stage in which we find our-selves calls for a new approach on the part of the industrialized countries  which must realize that relations between developed and underdeveloped countries can no longer be what they were in the past  with the dependence of the latter upon the former. They must rather be those of interdependence and a rich and dynamic complementarity.306.	Once again  the Republic of Zaire wishes to express its confidence in the United Nations  which seems to us  in spite of everything  to be the most appropriate organization for dealing with problems relating to international peace  security and co-operation  and the most appropriate framework for finding just and equitable solutions to the various disputes which arise between States.307.	I should like to conclude by expressing the most sincere congratulations to the President of the twenty-eighth session and of the sixth special session of the General Assembly  Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador. The successful outcome of those two sessions was  in our view  the result of his ability and his great sense of duty."
"27",1462,"COG",29,1974,"Mr. President  at the outset I should like to associate myself with the speakers who have preceded me at this rostrum and tell you how pleased the delegation of the Congo is to see you guiding the work of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. In so doing  I am certainly following a tradition  but I am above all carrying out a very pleasant duty in expressing the deep joy felt by the people of the Congo on hearing the news of your unanimous election. The trust placed in you thus marks a new milestone in the career of a talented statesman and an experienced and wise diplomat  whom Africa is privileged to count among its sons a militant  a fighter for freedom with unshakable faith and determination forged in the Algerian resistance.30.	Your election is also above all a tribute to the heroic Algerian people who  under the wise and enlightened leadership of President Houari Boumediene  are striving for the liberation of the third world and the assertion of its character. The resounding success of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-aligned Countries  held at Algiers 13 months ago  and the historic sixth special session of the United Nations General Assembly on raw materials and development  convened on the initiative of President Boumediene  are further proof of the ever-stronger attachment of your beautiful country to the cause of the third world.31.	But for the Congo your country has done much more  Mr. President: here I must try your modesty  known to all of us  and say that for more than a decade the Algerian people and the people of the Congo have extended their hands to one another in the grip of brothers and fellow fighters that has grown firmer as the years went by.32.	The heroic struggle of the Algerian people to regain their sovereignty serves as a symbol and an example to all oppressed peoples. The firm support which your country affords to all just causes  particularly the struggle for liberation of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America  has made Algiers the universal capital of freedom and human dignity.33.	The current session is being held at a particularly important moment in our history  a moment when areas of light and shade are strangely intermingled  and nascent hopes die  and then reemerge  so that mankind can never have a full sense of reassurance. I cite as an example the case of Viet Nam. It had been hoped that the lesson which the valiant Vietnamese people taught the army of aggression of the United States of America would have stripped away the last shred of illusion from all those who had not yet understood that all the peoples of the world  whoever they may be  have the right to choose their own path  that which best reflects their own ethos  and that they believe most likely to ensure the achievement of their deepest hopes and their happiness. We must note  unfortunately  that United States imperialism continues  and constantly violates the Paris agreements  agreements that gave rise to so many hopes which have now vanished  one after another  plunging both Viet Nam and the world back into increasing insecurity.34.	The Organization must act  and act promptly  to ensure that the Paris agreement is applied scrupulously and in full  because that is the only way in which lasting peace can be established in that part of the world  which has suffered so much from atrocities and wars of aggression.35.	Not far from Viet Nam  in neighboring Cambodia  the Khmer people also are being subjected to an unjust war  which they are repulsing with courage and determination  daily winning important victories over the aggressor which are recognized by the entire world. Today the National United Front of Kampuchea controls virtually nine tenths of the country. What is the Organization waiting for  before assuming the historic responsibility incumbent upon it by expelling from the international community the traitors to the Khmer nation  and restoring the rights of the only legitimate Government of Cambodia  that of Prince Norodom Sihanouk?36.	It is also urgent to put an end to the imperialist aggression in Korea. While we welcome the decision reached during the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to dissolve the famous United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea  the consensus reached in the General Assembly on 28 November 19732 serves the Seoul regime as yet another pretext to nullify the praiseworthy efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to bring about the peaceful and independent reunification of their torn country. But that vigilant people  overwhelmed by a series of acts of treason by the Government of Seoul  and despite an extremely ferocious machinery of repression  is increasingly insistent that all foreign troops be ejected  as an obstacle to peaceful reunification  free of all foreign interference  of the two parts of that beautiful country. The Organization can no longer be shackled by a consensus which serves as a pretext to prevent the realization of the deep hopes of the Korean people.37.	Nearer to here  in the Middle East  the same aggressors are attempting to subjugate peoples whose fighting tradition goes back for thousands of years. Everything has already been said about the Middle East  and the vain pretensions of the Zionist State have been revealed in this forum by outstanding speakers from all corners of the world. I  for my part  would merely invite the international community to be increasingly wary of allowing Israel and those who support it from distorting the nature of this problem by presenting it as a conflict between the Arabs and the Jews  whereas the substance of the question was  and still is  the right of the uprooted and despoiled people of Palestine to return to their country. We are pleased that an item permitting us to consider the tragedy of the martyred Palestinian people has been included in. our agenda.38.	In the eastern Mediterranean the same international firebrands have sown war  mourning and misery in the island of Cyprus. We cannot remain indifferent to the crisis which has afflicted that country  a member of the movement of non-aligned countries. The Government of the People's Republic of the Congo believes that the United Nations has the duty of guaranteeing the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus.39.	In Africa the struggle for liberation is spreading and has achieved decisive victories. The heroic struggle of the peoples of Angola  Mozambique and Guinea- Bissau  which is a part of the war being waged by all oppressed peoples of the world  has made a decisive contribution as Comrade Marien N'Gouabi  President of the People's Republic of the Congo said  a little more than a month ago at the Summit Conference of the Central and Eastern African States at Brazzaville to liberating the Portuguese people from the Fascist yoke under which they had lived for more than half a century. This solidarity means that the new leaders in Lisbon will better understand the aspirations of the peoples of Africa who demand the unconditional and immediate independence of Angola and other territories under Portuguese domination.40.	Amilcar Cabral  one of the most valiant and incorruptible sons of Africa  wrote with his own blood one of the most beautiful pages of its history . A point of no return has been reached in the process of liberating Territories which remain under the colonial yoke. We must pay our respects to the memory ofAmilcar Cabral and give thanks for the lessons he has taught us all. And particularly  we must pay our respects to his country which we are pleased and proud to welcome to the Organization. May the representatives of Guinea-Bissau accept the congratulations of the people of the Congo which  on behalf of President Marien N'Gouabi  I have the pleasant duty of extending to them from this rostrum.41.	I should also like  on behalf of my delegation  to congratulate the representatives of Grenada and Bangladesh upon their admission as Members of the United Nations.42.	To return to Africa  Mozambique  which has just banished from memory an irrevocably condemned past  is merely a few months away from attaining inter-national sovereignty. The United Nations must ensure that the Lusaka agreements are properly implemented. Africa itself must do everything to thwart the maneuvers of the outdated colonists who are attempting to place in jeopardy the victories achieved in the struggle for liberation in Mozambique and Angola  where they are creating and encouraging divisions within liberation movements. This is a well-known method designed to delay independence in Angola  and to plunge the country into a civil war which would serve as a pretext for the neo-colonialists who do not wish to renounce their dream of conquest in Africa. All of this neo-colonialist agitation occurs against the background of the well-known wealth found in Angola. This is wealth which imperialism contemptuously wishes to continue to exploit to the detriment of the interests of the Angolan people.43.	The march of the Portuguese colonies towards independence must not make us lose sight of Namibia  Azania  the Comoro Islands  Djibouti  and all other territories under colonial domination aspiring to independence and sovereignty.44.	We think that the United Kingdom should accept its role and assume its responsibilities in Zimbabwe. Also  the NATO Powers  which are supporting the racist regime of South Africa now extending its policy of apartheid in Namibia  must make the white colonists understand that it is in their own interests to return forthwith to the path of reason. The Africans can take pride in the fact that they have thwarted the most recent maneuvers of the Government of Pretoria which attempted to include puppets in a delegation which itself only represents a condemned policy. The General Assembly  by rejecting the credentials of this delegation [resolution 3206 (XXIX))  once again demonstrated its indignation at the criminal policy of apartheid. My delegation is pleased that a decision has been taken to stop the talks between the Secretary-General and the Government of Pretoria on Namibia  talks which the racists in South Africa were exploiting for propaganda purposes.45.	Finally  while on the subject of colonization  I should like to indicate another absurd subtlety in this criminal enterprise which would wish to have us accept the principle of the referendum. I don't know  and I should like to know  whether within this Hall there is a representative of a former colony who could tell me that the inhabitants of his country have been consulted by a referendum and  by so doing  had accepted foreign occupation. History teaches us that treaties prepared by colonizers were imposed upon our peoples through traditional chiefs to whom the terms of the treaties were not even explained.46.	Simple logic and rules which have always governed societies would have required that permission be asked to come to a country  and not to leave it. Moreover  this is the method which has been imposed upon us by investors in our economic relations with them when they demand adequate guarantees that they will be allowed to repatriate their capital. Here we are touching upon one of the problems which will predominate during this session.47.	In the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General said that he had witnessed some signs ""of a new determination to face up to the enormous challenges of a global society"" [A/96011Add.I  sect. XIII].48.	Need I stress the fact that my delegation heard with great interest this report. Its conviction  objectivity and thoughtfulness are a very important factor in our work. Unfortunately  as regards economic problems which the Organization must confront  some statements made from this rostrum dispel this optimistic vision. As we are going through irreversible changes it is rather disappointing to see that some great Powers still hope to practice the policy of the big stick and of invective. The development of proletarian nations is the greatest problem confronting our generation.49.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly  convened  as I said earlier  upon the initiative of the great leader of Algeria  President Boumediene  made it possible as regards raw materials and development to discern a new policy and to commit the international community to changing the asymmetrical features of international economic relations today. It is true that we cannot expect everything to change immediately  but these rearguard actions cannot make any less valid the lessons learned by the international community from the sixth special session  during which the third world  seeing its very survival threatened  was able to become fully aware of the fact that the fundamental reasons for its backwardness were not something it was predestined to put up with  but  rather  that its underdevelopment was organized and maintained by international imperialism which uses the poverty of the third world as a method of increasing its progress and wealth. This special session was an opportunity for the third world countries to reject the logic of the system of the division of labor which forced poor nations to supply raw materials at low prices  while the prices for capital goods were maintained at high levels.50.	Many international forums have heard and condemned the disproportionate profits achieved by exploiting the peripheral regions. It is no longer possible merely to take note of the fact that one third of the population of the world holds seven eighths of the world's income  whereas third world countries  re-presenting two thirds of mankind  must be satisfied with one eighth of that income. Despite the tragedy of this situation  the third world did not wish to choose confrontation as a means of dealing with the dramatic consequences of this system. We ourselves are convinced that dialog on a strictly equal footing is the most appropriate democratic means by which to uproot the ancient system and replace it by a new order that could give a vigorous impetus to fruitful cooperation among all peoples.51.	One of the primary tasks during the Second United Nations Development Decade it to open the eyes of the wasteful consumer societies of the West to the meaning of the phenomenon of underdevelopment. For  in fact  the basic causes of this scourge are to be found in the industrialized societies that are contributing to the economic backwardness of the developing countries. Today  through the joint efforts of all Members of our Organization  the international community possesses two documents of historic importance: the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and3202 (S-VI)]  which indicate specific guidelines for new international economic relations and invite the Organization  in a spirit of much-needed solidarity  to contribute to the Special Fund established by the Program of Action  for the least favored Members. Thus we are at a crossroads. Are our efforts to bog down in sterile confrontation  or shall we rather  all of us  by demonstrating courage and daring  cross the bridge and take the path that leads to progress for all with fraternal cooperation among all peoples?52.	Today  there are certain principles that no one can uproot and that are the normal corollary of the independence and sovereignty of States: first  the permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources  with  as a consequence  control by them of the mechanisms that enable the countries producing raw materials to establish the prices of their produce  and also the right of each country  if necessary   to resort to nationalization and  secondly  the legitimacy of the struggle that the developing countries are compelled to wage against multinational companies  whose often disastrously harmful activities are well known to all.53.	My country has already had an opportunity to indicate its solidarity with raw-material producing countries. Their struggle is the struggle of all of us. The seizure by the oil-exporting countries of the controls of the pricing mechanisms for their raw materials opens great vistas of hope for other third-world producers of raw materials. Our working masses are always ready to produce  but we cannot produce at any price. We must sell our raw materials at prices which make it possible to raise the standard of living of our workers and to meet the needs of our countries. That is why we can no longer let ourselves be abused by the campaign of hatred that has led the wealthy countries to establish ""holy alliances"" dedicated to exorcising the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries [OPEC] and to dividing the ranks of the third world.54.	Leaving aside such activities as doomed to failure  let us set our sights towards the quest for effective remedies to the grave crisis gripping the world  first by abandoning our selfish  wasteful ways and then by inaugurating an era of justice and peace in international relations for  as several speakers have emphasized  the inflation that is eating away at the world like a cancer is a phenomenon generated by the industrialized countries  the brunt of which has been borne by the third world  countries in their capacity both of seller* of raw under-priced materials and of buyers of the manufactured products of the wealthy countries. The energy crisis is an easy alibi all too frequently used by some developed countries as an excuse for raising the export prices of their merchandise. The spiraling inflation that is putting the world in a panic must therefore be more seriously and more objectively studied.55.	In view of its constant concern with the search for justice and peace in international relations  my country viewed with pleasure the convening of the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  the Second Session of which took place recently at Caracas. The international community has thereby shown its recognition of the absolute necessity of making a fundamental change in international maritime law. Despite the attitudes of bygone times  we wish to express our hope of seeing these negotiations lead to a convention that will promote international cooperation on a basis of equal rights for States  of justice and of peace in this important field. For the time being  what is important is that discussions have begun on new terms that are full of promise for all the peoples of the earth.56.	The People's Republic of the Congo has participated and will continue to participate in the work of that important Conference  on the basis of proposals made jointly by the member States of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]. Here  once again  it is up to the wealthy countries to renounce those privileges that help to accentuate the structural dependence of under-developed countries on the industrialized countries. That is the only way our work can be successful. For the attainment of that aim we need more than the material and financial means which are  of course  necessary for the Organization to function well we need to infuse greater authority into that Organization. That can be done only if we are courageous and impartial enough to make a resolute attempt to modify its structure one which certainly responded to the needs of one era but does not correspond with those of today.57.	An undertaking of this nature is indispensable if we wish to speak seriously of disarmament  if we wish such destructive calamities as drought no longer to be used by some countries for propaganda purposes  and if we wish to put an end to the interference of great Powers in the political lives of small States  so that countries such as Cyprus can reach their own national concord according to the wishes of their inhabitants  so that peoples such as the heroic people of Chile  with whom we stand in full solidarity  may no longer be massacred for merely wishing to live for and by themselves.58.	I am thus reaching the conclusion of my statement. I know I have only repeated topics that so many outstanding speakers have enlarged on here  some with rarely equaled eloquence. But in so doing it has been my wish  with deep humility  and on behalf of President Marien N'Gouabi  to make this modest contribution of the People's Republic of the Congo to the work of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations."
"28",1509,"COL",29,1974,"My first words are addressed to you  Mr. President  to congratulate you on your well- earned election to preside over this  the greatest forum of the peoples of the world  to guide it with your recognized wisdom and boldness at this particular moment in history.171.	My next words are of welcome to the three new States that have emerged from colonial status into full sovereignty and independence. I greet Guinea- Bissau  Bangladesh and Grenada  whose heroic presence among us gives us cause for rejoicing.172.	I must say a few words regarding the grief of Latin America at the ravages suffered by Honduras  our sister Republic  struck by adversity in the form of a hurricane. This is the time for us to show our solidarity with that small but great nation  and to give prompt and decisive help in its reconstruction.173.	Rarely in the history of this Organization has the period between two regular sessions of the General Assembly been so filled with events  or shown a deeper and more extensive transformation in the conditions of human life and the relations between peoples. There is an atmosphere of expectancy  of dissatisfaction and of tension between the industrial countries and the developing nations. The latter have been waging an almost vain struggle to achieve higher standards of living  and to close the gap between them and the economic and technological Powers. The unequal terms of trade are the common denominator of the problem. The Algerian proposal to hold a special session to study the question of raw materials and development resulted in the sixth special session? and served to pinpoint that tension which had been dramatically exacerbated by what was termed the energy crisis  that is  by the decision of the oil-exporting countries to re-price their obviously non-renewable resource and to serve notice that their reserves were limited and that their management had entered a radically new phase.174.	The effects of these measures have touched all nations of the world to a different extent and in different ways. The bases for industrial production of wide areas have been changed  and many articles have been subject to unavoidable readjustments. Obviously  that measure was not the cause of the monetary troubles which were already being felt  nor can it alone be held responsible for the phenomenon of global inflation. But it is linked to imbalances in the world market  to the financial crisis and to the changes in many prices  which were earlier referred to as equitable but which now appear suddenly capricious in their response to the new oil price levels  which the producers quite justifiably consider as having been set belatedly.175.	Going beyond the specific and immediate debate on oil  the sixth special session issued a Declaration which might wall be termed the Magna Carta of economic equity and then went on to adopt its Program of Action. Despite some reservations  consensus was the order of the day and for the first time it became obvious that world solidarity was more than an empty phrase. The interdependence of all peoples of the earth was a fact of pristine truth and it was made clear that the needy and the wealthy were components of a single whole that must be reviewed with justice  with courage and with wisdom in order to advance towards a more egalitarian and secure world. It was also made clear that  besides peace  collective security  the urgency of disarmament and the prohibition of aggression  economic development and social welfare were also objectives of equal importance and inseparable from the others.176.	Among the lasting benefits derived from that sixth special session was the fact that the third world  once an amorphous collection of peoples with neither close contacts nor clear-cut goals  became a consolidated body. That session opened wide the doors to dialog and a gate to the future and set in true motion the principle of the sovereign equality of States. The voices of the strong and the weak acquired equal resonance. These are irreversible achievements; and we can as of this moment assert that the symbol of the United Nations for the next long years will be an economic symbol  or  more specifically  the systematic and courageous search for the way in which three quarters of the world's population are to move towards standards of development  or at least are to be given conditions whereby to achieve such standards; so that contrary to the usual effect  their efforts to progress will not bring about a relative regression.177.	It is  however  clear that the historic session of April last in this same hall did not possess magical virtues or automatic means  and we cannot confuse our intentions with the long-range results. That session was accompanied or immediately followed by dark economic omens: monetary instability and uncertainty regarding ways of stabilizing currency exchanges; poor harvests and grave warnings about the world's food reserves. But over and above all  there was a global inflation whose levels and speed of growth were practically unprecedented in scope. Many industrial economies that had a mere few months earlier appeared prosperous and sound suddenly showed signs of weakness and sank to near bankruptcy levels. Money had lost some of its purchasing power and became more difficult to obtain. The situation of most developing countries went from bad to critical because of the trend among the industrialized nations towards cutting down on their purchases in the third world and concentrating on raw materials that were essential for subsequent manufacture. Those raw materials did not have the benefit of the necessary emergency machinery to impose conditions of sale and prices; what is more  they bore no relation to the capital goods which those less advanced countries had to import  with their enormous surcharges due to the high standard of living in the manufacturing countries now further increased by the inflationary spiral.178.	Thus many peoples not only feel that they have drifted far afield from the minimum well-being and development targets set a few months earlier in New York  but now face critical situations in the procurement of food for survival. A feeling of urgency and an awareness of the gravity of the moment seems to hover over most of the items on our agenda. The peoples who have had control over the possibility of peace or war  of collective security and control of trade  as well as those nations which have enjoyed sudden boom conditions  now have the chance of using their resources  not in charitable works  but in an enlightened effort of self-defense against the boomerang of an untenable economic situation. The political stability of the world is threatened by the rising waves. A new type of society  one that is desperate and skeptical regarding all forms of government and of opposing ideologies  may supersede the more stable  peaceful  traditional and organized national communities. One need not stretch one's imagination too far to foresee  among the poor peoples who are being robbed of their hopes for improvement  calamities which will engender further calamities.179.	The moment is ripe to prove the capacity of the United Nations. No bilateral arrangement  nor agreements between blocs  will have sufficient influence to alter the economic course or to arrive at global policies that will offer true safeguards. It is only world-wide agreements  arrived at here by dialog  through reason and in the assurance that we are living in a united world  that will give adequate answers to the complex and threatening challenge. All countries  some in more orderly fashion than others  are turning to the task of domestic therapy. More than ever before  Governments are aware of the need to assess the possibilities of their respective peoples  and many of the latter are responding with dedication and fervor to the sacrifice of a more than precarious existence. But there is a limit to the ability to perform miracles  and facts  as we well know  are stubborn. Beyond the national effort there is still that great battle to be fought.180.	Personally  I am optimistic regarding the human ability to adapt in order to meet unforeseen circumstances and almost instinctively to organize in the face of the common threat. Herein lies the greatest reserve of the United Nations: that it is a state of mind and spirit that transcends cultures  ideologies and customs. More than the isolated generosity of some countries  it is a community effort which  with .some sort of occult wisdom  leads us to an equilibrium  to a restoration of peace  to the preservation of order  to a sense of foresight  and to acts that start beyond individual and specific interests. This does not mean adopting a passive reliance on providence  or a giving-in contrary to the strength of reason organized into systematic thinking. It is an act of faith in values that we hold in common and that find in this Organization their most propitious outlet.181.	Events do not pass by the United Nations without affecting and changing it. The sixth special session is a good example of how the concept of economic development crystallized  despite the vagueness with which Article 1  paragraph 3  of the Charter refers to ""promoting and encouraging respect for human rights""  which is an entirely different matter. That statute  the result of the post-war period  was based on outmoded notions of sovereignty which were unconnected with natural resources. Yet it has been in force since 1946  so that it is high time for 138 associated nations to revise it  to bring it up to date  making it more operative and dynamic.182.	At the twenty-fourth session of the Assembly in 1969  Colombia proposed just this. It was then that our then Foreign Minister  now the President of the Republic  Mr. Lopez Michelsen  from this same rostrum  called for the need to rejuvenate the San Francisco Charter that had been drafted ""25 years ago to operate for geopolitical conditions which have been surpassed"".8 We advocate not its demolition but a change of some of its parts. No one can deny the services that this venerable legal instrument has rendered. But by the same token  no one can blind himself to the slowing down  the artificial obstacles and duplications it has caused  or to the vagueness and lack of precision it has created. Those who fear that a revision of the Charter implies a break-down of the spirit of the Organization and a jump into the unknown are mistaken.183.	Paradoxically  it is far more in keeping with tradition to ensure that institutions retain their creative dynamism than to preserve their facades intact. The British writer G. K. Chesterton contended that it was far more traditional to keep painting the white mast white than to wait until it had lost the last traces of its whiteness on the pretext of preserving it intact. Notions such as the common character of the seabed  of outer space and their multiple uses cry out for a place in our Charter  as do those of biological balance or those of the campaign to safeguard the environment against pollution  for the right to ecological balance is not the heritage of a single generation isolated in time  and we are in danger of being adjudged by posterity as the destroyers of the planet. 184.	Colombia is honored this year as being the site for the first International Women's Conference at Bogota. The two main phenomena that characterize the social changes of the twentieth century have been the rapid urbanization which brought about the mass exodus from the countryside and the creation of innumerable huge cities. The other feature of our time has been the emergence of women into economic  social and political life. This has led to changes in the structure of the family and of culture itself. Obviously  that leads to a change in mentality  in attitudes and tasks in the life of man. It is the human couple as such that has changed. To assess the alterations in the domestic and social functions of both  their influence on the home and the community  and to discern the new trends will be among  the tasks of that Conference. The Conference will also have to examine the obstacles that still stand in the way of the harmonious integration of the efforts of women and men jointly to grapple with such tasks and responsibilities as are posed by under-development. Furthermore  the Conference will have to gage the results of the World Population Conference held recently at Bucharest. Responsible motherhood and the right to control fertility within the framework of women's freedom and beliefs are indissolubly linked to their rote in modern life and to women's identity  dictated by their biological and psychological nature.185.	We are well aware that no assistance will suffice to shatter the fetters of underdevelopment unless it is linked to an orderly and systematic internal effort. But it is equally true that the distances between some societies and others are so great that in order to bring many peoples into the modern era a veritable race against time is required. This is typified in the field of technology. In the solidarity and inter-dependence of the present-day world  the right to use or abuse specific knowledge is not too well under-stood. There are some areas  such as health  where the preventive vaccine cannot be the exclusive property of any if it can be used to save the lives of millions of beings. Thus  too  certain discoveries and improvements in key areas  such as energy or the exploitation and preparation of basic products  must be termed the collective heritage of mankind. We must consider that the so-called transfer of technology should be operated not bilaterally through more favorable conditions or counterpart benefits between countries  but  rather  by a gradual but massive transfer as the poorer countries require it. This leads to the idea of a world pool of technology which should be administered or monitored by the United Nations.186.	One item that certainly does belong on our agenda is the ""Examination of the functions of the International Court of Justice"" [item 93]. This subject was discussed at the twenty-fifth  twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh sessions and should cast some light on the functions and priorities of the main legal organ of the United Nations. The subject also dovetails with the concern over the review of the Charter. Colombia believes that it would redound to the benefit of the international community if the sphere of the advisory opinions and decisions of the Court were to be widened. The surprising evolution of international law today  which is rich in new issues  should benefit from the clear decisions of the Court  as the nature of the matters brought to the consideration of that supreme tribunal warrant.187.	During the last few years  the growth of war material of all kinds has been virtually unaffected by arms control or disarmament agreements. Limited or localized wars  such as those of IndoChina  Cambodia or the Middle East  have a markedly experimental character. They affect military criteria and planning. Technological progress in certain tactical and strategic weapons is so rapid that the great Powers are constantly beset by the terror of being irremediably left behind by their peers. This explains the lag and delay in bilateral agreements on mutual reduction of forces and the vagueness of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. It also explains the meager results obtained at the summit talks to find a balance in the possession of multiple independently target-able re-entry vehicles [MlRVs).188.	Thus  the rate of military technological production has only grown. Even in the fields of chemical and bacteriological warfare there is no sign of a reduction or destruction of existing arsenals  but  rather  it is believed with some justification that more sophisticated progress is being made in these destructive fields.189.	The nuclear-weapons tests in the atmosphere  which in 1973 shook the world and particularly those countries that border on the Pacific Ocean  are far from ended  and they systematically coincided with the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmoshpere  in Outer Space and under Water  signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963. This proves the paucity of success obtained in this vital field by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament which  doubtless and despite all  is the most important forum for world arms control. Blocked by the negotiations of the super-Powers  it has turned  us attention to the noble  albeit more limited  objectives such as the prohibition of the use of needlessly cruel and indiscriminate weapons  for example  napalm  and acts of war against civilian populations.190.	I quote from the S1PR1 Yearbook 1974 of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute:""SIPRI has shown that world military expenditures [for 1973 and 1974] are running at about $207 000 million per year"" which is over 6 per cent of the gross national product of the countries of the world and equal to the total income of the 2 000 million persons living in the region of the third world with the exclusion of China. ""The military expenditure of those countries which provide development aid is estimated at approximately 6.7 per cent of their gross national product  which is 30 times greater than the official development aid they provide.""191.	We can safely say that  aside from the imbalance between the prices of raw materials and those of manufactured goods  no other factor acts as such a drawback on the life of peoples representing 70 per cent of the world's population as does the arms race.192.	So  for reasons of world security as well as of pure economy  it is only just that we aspire to a world peace conference whose agenda will include all types of weapons and systems of mass destruction  and whose conclusions will be guaranteed in advance by the great atomic and military Powers by means of forms of verification open to and exercised by the United Nations. This hope  which might appear a Utopian flight of fancy   is  nevertheless  the corner-stone of our Organization  and to its achievement all our efforts must be directed all the more so since the danger is growing and we stand on the threshold of a second generation of countries that are capable of nuclear warfare  193.	Colombia is a country  dedicated to peace  that is eager to work and  by its own efforts  to obtain what is indispensable to it in a framework of world commerce that will exclude the imperialism of trade  tied loans and inflation built into the goods it imports. During the last decades  we have watched with anguish the systematic erosion of coffee prices  which represent 50 per cent of our export trade  while seeing a radical increase in the prices of agricultural machinery  inputs and fertilizers. The national effort has been gigantic in order to cover the coffee deficit with manufactured goods and to meet the needs of the national growth and the peaceful revolution to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth and more equality for all Colombian citizens. We believe that at this time the situation of coffee is alarming. We believe in the advisability and the need for a climate between producers and consumers not of confrontation but of dialog and progressive under-standing. The President of Venezuela  Mr. Carlos Andres Perez  in a recent message to President Ford of the United States  denounced this situation in the following terms:""At this very time  we are seeing how the refusal of the developed countries  including the United States of America  to agree to just and fair prices for coffee has resulted in the inaction of the Inter-national Coffee Organization  which was established precisely to achieve a satisfactory and just equilibrium between producers and consumers. The coffee-producing countries of Latin America and Africa will lose roughly 30 per cent of their foreign- exchange earnings  while manufactured goods from the developed nations have doubled or tripled an price."" [S^ AI9784  annex.]194.	It is obvious that  confronted with this picture  we should feel ourselves as allies of all the countries that face similar obstacles in Africa or Asia. Colombia considers Latin America to be an extension of the concept of the nation and is united with each and every country in that region of brothers. We are aware that in this planetary world of ours Latin America is a bridge that links other areas culturally and economically. We offer our friendship indiscriminately to all the peoples of the world  regardless of their ideology  so long as they respect our institutions and the democratic system of Colombia.195.	We are here to perform an arduous task  and to perform it together. We are not unaware of the obstacles  but we possess the faith born of our tradition that ideas become the weapons that no wall is sufficiently high to keep out. Freedom is something as real and tangible as the air we brent he. We believe that freedom hungers for bread  for security and for well-being and ultimately identifies itself with them."
"29",1634,"CRI",29,1974,"Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of Costa Rica I should like to join the many speakers who have congratulated you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. We trust that your leadership will be as effective as that of your predecessor. It is with pride that  as a Latin American  I have herd participants at the twenty-eighth session express their approval at the extremely effective manner in which Mr. Leopoldo Benites conducted our discussions. He was always an imaginative and dispassionate President  who never displayed any fanaticism and who did not allow his ideas to divert him from the proper application of the Charter and the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.2.	Costa Rica  a Central American country  has felt the tragedy of the sister Republic of Honduras as though it were its own. The Foreign Minister of that afflicted country  my good friend Cesar Batres  described to this Assembly on 25 September [2242nd meeting] the loss of life and the suffering that Honduras has had to endure as the result of the fury of the forces of nature. The material loss and the economic destruction have been so great that the people of Honduras by themselves could never repair the damage.3.	That is why generous international assistance has become indispensable  and this Organization  representing the international community  and many of its Members individually have already started to give such assistance. We are thankful for this overwhelming expression of solidarity .with our brothers from Honduras  and we make an appeal for redoubled efforts in the very difficult task of rebuilding the economy- of Honduras  which Hurricane Fifi has left in such a deplorable state.4.	Costa Rica was the first Latin American nation to recognize the State of Bangladesh. Since 1972 we have supported its admission to the United Nations. On 10 June 1974 my delegation had the pleasure of .voting at the 1776th meeting of the Security Council in favor of the draft resolution recommending the admission of Bangladesh to the Organization. Therefore  it should surprise no one that now that the representatives of that nation have taken their place in our midst  we Costa Ricans should extend our warmest welcome to them.5.	We are pleased to note that the admission of Bangladesh is the result of the improvement brought about in the situation in the Asian subcontinent by the far-sighted and peace-promoting attitude of the three Governments involved in the 1971 war  namely  India  Pakistan and Bangladesh. The manner in which these Governments resolved a conflict which was as bloody as it was ancient should serve as an example to other parts of the world.6.	The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees also deserves a tribute for having implemented with singular effectiveness the New Delhi Agreement of 28 August 1973  which provided for the repatriation of the Bengalis from Pakistan and of the Pakistanis from Bangladesh. In the introduction to his report to this session  the Secretary-General states: ""More than 241 000 persons were moved across the subcontinent in that operation  which has been described as the largest airlift of human beings ever organized"". [Al9601lAdd.l  p. 6]7.	The enlightened and progressive eradication of British colonialism in the Antilles enables us today to extend a welcome also to a new American State: Grenada. We wish this new Caribbean nation every success and we hope to maintain with it very close bilateral relations  as well as warm relations within the Latin American group of States in the United Nations.8.	The independence of Guinea-Bissau and its admission to the United Nations are of very great significance in the lengthy struggle against colonialism. It is the beginning of the end of the Portuguese colonial empire in Africa  and that is the result both of the heroic struggle of the people of Guinea-Bissau to achieve self-determination and of the revolution for liberation waged by the Portuguese people themselves. On 25 April 1974  in Portugal  a dictatorial regime which had tried to drown in blood every expression of freedom of the Portuguese in their own country  as well as of the population of the colonies  came to an end.9.	We were very moved by the statement made in this Hall by the Foreign Minister of Portugal  Mr. Mario Soares. Among other things  he said:. . I represent here a new Portugal which has nothing to do with the one which was so repeatedly condemned in this Organization . . .""This new Portugal has ceased to be a hostile and silent country within the United Nations  constantly refusing to fulfill its obligations. . .The Assembly warmly applauded Minister Soares when  with obvious sincerity  he said:""I feel particularly honored to have participated personally in the process of the decolonization of Guinea-Bissau ... It can only be regretted and I say this with a feeling of anguish that this process of decolonization  so long delayed  has left behind it a long  useless war in which so many of the young men of both countries died or were left disabled/' [2239th meeting  paras. 95  96 and 102]10.	In warmly greeting the representatives of Guinea-Bissau who have taken their seat in this Hall  I express the hope that very soon  and with the co-operation of the new Portugal  the States which will emerge from what have thus far been the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique  Angola and the Cape Verde Islands will achieve independence and enter our Organization.11.	Of course  Costa Rica does not confine its hopes to the decolonization of the Portuguese Territories. In keeping with its anti-colonialist tradition  my country will most firmly support all the efforts to achieve self-determination made by peoples still subjected to any form of colonial domination  irrespective of their geographical location.12.	My delegation agrees with the statement made by the representative of Brazil  Mr. Antonio Azeredo da Silveira  in his opening speech in this general debate  that just as important as the support to be given to the people struggling to achieve independence is the action undertaken to induce the Governments of the metropolitan countries to abandon  as Portugal has just done  their policy of colonial domination. He went on to say:""For the Brazilian Government  the challenge faced by those who want to rid the world of the colonial stigma is the challenge of efficacy. To blame the colonizing past is not what matters; what matters is rather to help build the future of free nations."" [2238th meeting  para. 15]13.	Costa Rica is a member of the Credentials Committee and  since certain aims have-been pursued which are not within that Committee's competence  I should like to state my delegation's understanding of its task. Rule 27 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly states:""The credentials of representatives and the names of members of a delegation shall be submitted to the Secretary-General if possible not less than one week before the opening of the session. The credentials shall be issued either by the Head of the State or Government or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.""14.	During the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly a request was made to the Legal Counsel of the Organization to give an expert opinion on the scope of this article. In giving his opinion  the Legal Counsel made the following statement:""... credentials for the General Assembly may be defined as a document issued by the Head of State or Government or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of a State Member of the United Nations submitted to the Secretary-General designating the persons entitled to represent that Member at a given session of the General Assembly. Unlike the acceptance of credentials in bilateral relations  the question of recognition of a Government of a Member State is not involved  and substantive issues concerning the status^ Governments do not arise. . . .""15.	My delegation shares the views expressed by the Legal Counsel. It is in keeping with the universal practice with regard to the competence of the credentials committee in any international body or conference. It is also in keeping with the competence which article 28 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly grants the Credentials Committee  whose sole function is restricted to the almost mechanical task of determining whether the credentials with which representatives are accredited to the General Assembly have been legally issued by the Head of State or of Government or by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of that Member State.16.	It is in no way the task of that Committee to decide whether the Government issuing the credentials is or is not the legitimate representative of the peoples of that Member State. To grant that power to the Committee by means of an interpretation would be to flout legal logic  and would  furthermore  flagrantly violate the principle of non-intervention enshrined in Article 2  paragraph 7 of the Charter of the United Nations.17.	Not even the Assembly or the Security Council has the power to express a judgment about the Government of a Member State  be it de jure or de facto  because that would be tantamount to interference in matters which fall within the internal jurisdiction of the State itself. Representatives can imagine the chaotic situation that would prevail if we were to discuss here the legitimacy of the Governments of each one of the Member States.18.	Still less can we adopt a procedure whereby we reject the credentials of the representative of any Member State  as a means of preventing participation in the Assembly and in other bodies of the United Nations by any Government that my not be to the liking of the majority of Members. By not permitting participation by that Government  which  although perhaps repudiated by the majority  is still the Government in power in that Member State  in fact we would be excluding that Member State from participation in the Organization.19.	In accordance with Article 6 of the Charter  we can expel a Member State if repeated violations of the principles contained in the Charter have been proven. But this is not a decision that can be made by the Credentials Committee  either directly or indirectly. It is a most serious decision  and it can be taken only by the General Assembly by a two- thirds-majority vote of its Members  and only after such action has been recommended by the Security Council.20.	In view of the foregoing  Costa Rica will oppose the Credentials Committee's going even one whit beyond its specific duties in examining the credentials of representatives to the General Assembly  duties that  I repeat  are solely to determine whether or not the document which informs the Secretary-General of the names of the people representing a Member State at a given session of the Assembly the document which we call the credentials has been duly issued by the Head of State   or of Government or by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of a Member of the United Nations.21.	During the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly [2153rd meeting]  Costa Rica was elected a member of the Security Council. My country humbly accepted this high honor  and promised diligently to discharge the very delicate duty assigned to it.22.	In presiding at the 1761st session of the Council on 17 January 1974  the first meeting of this year  we stated the views that Costa Rica holds regarding that peace-keeping organ. After 10 months of the work of the Council  experience has confirmed the statement I made  and I am now able to give a brief analysis of the important matters discussed in that body.23.	Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations mentions the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.. Nevertheless  this equality was not maintained with regard to the formation of the Security Council  since it gave  permanent seats in the Council to the five countries that were the main Powers when the San Francisco Charter was signed. Furthermore  its important agreements required the affirmative vote of the five so-called ""great Powers"" before they could be considered valid. 24. This was due to the fact that the very structure of the United Nations is based on the essential political assumption of harmony and co-operation among the great Powers; and since the maintenance of peace is the main objective of the Organization  its peacemaking machinery is based on the hypothesis of joint action by the five great Powers. That is why the disagreement of one of them -namely  the veto is sufficient to paralyze this peace-making machinery.25.	To some  the concentration of power in the permanent members implies an attempt to establish a world government of the five Powers akin to an international oligarchy. To others  this preeminence of the great Powers is a fair price which the medium- sized and small countries must pay to obtain the co-operation of the more powerful nations in the United Nations. The veto is a safety valve to ensure that the United Nations does not exceed itself in accepting certain unrealistic commitments which may be beyond its power.26.	Costa Rica has always felt that  irrespective of the thesis accepted as the ideal  the United Nations was so conceived that effective action for the maintenance of international peace and security is possible  as we have said  only with the assistance of the great Powers. In order to change that situation  we should not only have to create a new organization -a very unlikely eventuality - but further  it would be indispensable to change the thinking of the main protagonists of the world  an even more unlikely eventuality.27.	In realistic terms  we are convinced that we cannot achieve that goal at this time. It cannot even be said with certainty that it is the most suitable goal. That is why it is better to base our action on what can be reasonably hoped for from the foreign policy of States. Otherwise  as we have already stated  we run the risk of drawing up catalogs of what is desirable rather than building on what is possible.28.	The Security Council was given immense power by the Charter. That power derives from the authority which it has to impose coercive measures and other measures which involve certain punitive elements  agreed upon in the name of the entire international community.29.	The compulsory and binding decisions of the Council along these lines become a kind of legal sentence. But they should not lead us to consider the Council as a law enforcement body whose decisions should be free from all the incidental elements characteristic of political decisions.30.	Far from hurting the Council  its political structure is the element which gives it its strength. Its decisions are not backed up by the impartiality of judges. The States of which it is composed are committed to finding viable formulas to harmonize differing and often opposing political ideas.31.	For that reason  the very strength of the Security Council becomes fully evident only when it makes decisions. Its function acquires true meaning and value to the extent that it ensures international peace and security under the Charter and  since decisions require first and foremost the agreement of the five great Powers  the validity of our premise is confirmed: peace-making by the Security Council is possible only when there exists harmony and cooperation among the great Powers.32.	Thus  when disagreement among the permanent members prevents the Council from reaching decisions in situations which threaten international peace and security  the Council's very existence as a peacemaking organ is deeply affected. The nature of international disputes which the Security Council must deal with is a matter of such high priority that the absence of a decision is as harmful as a delayed decision. Any delay in implementing possible solutions undermines the international standing of the Council and cruelly harms the cause of peace.33.	In the Security Council the delegation of Costa Rica has constantly pleaded for immediate action in the face of situations which might affect international peace and security. Regardless of the political interests of the States which make up the Council  we have always maintained that peace is the highest priority and that there is no justification for putting off matters so closely tied to the vital interests of mankind -namely  those concerning war and peace. We must find a consensus  in order to be able to work on the basis of agreement  negotiation and compromise.34.	To those who tell us that it is immoral to com-promise with an ideological adversary  we reply that the problems of war and peace involve the highest of all moral values  namely  respect for human life. Therefore  we have always maintained in the Council that more immoral than negotiating with those having different ideologies is closing the door to dialog  because  when it means the indiscriminate and large-scale destruction of human life  war is the greatest immorality of all.35.	When  because of disagreements that have emerged between permanent members  decisions have been delayed that called for urgent and immediate action on the part of the Council  we have seen that the further development of the conflict has made it even more difficult for the Security Council to find solutions.36.	In the various situations in which peace-promoting activity has thus been paralyzed  my delegation has always expressed its concern  because each time it has become more firmly convinced that the Council's decisions can have their desired effect only if the action it has decided on is promptly and swiftly carried out. Experience shows that any delay inevitably widens the gulf between the uncontrolled forces at war with each other and unleashes new elements that increase the danger of the conflict.37.	Year after year  the crisis in the Middle East has occupied a preponderant place in the debates of this Assembly  indicating the great importance the international community attaches to the problem and also its inability to resolve it.38.	The fourth Arab-Israeli war broke out in October 1973 -that is  at the beginning of the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly. Thanks to the combined efforts of bilateral diplomacy and the collective action of this Organization  it was possible to ensure that the conflict did not unleash a new  and last  world war. It was also possible to put an end to armed conflict between the Israeli  Egyptian and Syrian combatants.39.	Security Council resolution 338 (1973)  which called for a cease-fire and the initiation of peace talks between the parties  was not implemented immediately. That was one more example of failure to comply with decisions of the Security Council  which unfortunately occurs frequently these days. Hostilities ceased only when  thanks to the action of the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Kissinger  on 19 January 1974  Israel and Egypt  and  on 31 May 1974  Israel and Syria  signed cease-fire agreements.40.	Those agreements were important because they constituted the first direct contact between the warring forces. If they are diligently maintained  they may open the way for successful peaceful negotiation of all the problems separating the Arabs and the Israelis.41.	At the beginning of the general debate  the Secretary of State  Mr. Kissinger  told this Assembly:""[These agreements] were achieved  above all  because of the wisdom of the leaders of the Middle East who decided that there had been enough stalemate and war  that more might be gained by testing each other in negotiation than by testing each other on the battlefield."" [2238th meeting  para. 59]42.	Nevertheless  earlier on  the Secretary of State had said that although the cease-fire and the two agreements for separating the forces had provided a breathing space  the shadow of war was still there. He said; ""The legacy of hatred and suffering  the sense of irreconcilability have begun to yield -however haltingly- to the process of negotiation. But we still have a long road ahead.""One side seeks the recovery of territory and justice for a displaced people. The other side seeks security and recognition by its neighbors of its legitimacy as a nation^ In the end  the common goal of peace surely is ""broad enough to embrace all these aspirations."" [Ibid  para. 56 and 57]43.	The general framework for the establishment of peace in that region was laid down by Security Council resolution 338 (1973)  as a result of which the Peace Conference on the Middle East started its work in Geneva in December 1973; the Conference has since .then not made much progress. However  it is heartening to recall that all parties have recognized that the problems to be dealt with are complex  and for that reason one must be patient and try to dissipate doubts before making commitments in any new initiative.44.	The international community can  however  facilitate those very difficult negotiations by creating the right atmosphere for reconciliation. Mutual recriminations expressed in this forum undoubtedly do not help to achieve that purpose. We must strive to maintain the progress made before the signing of the agreement on the separation of forces. We must struggle to see to it that the hunger for peace and the desire to And lasting solutions that emerged as the result of the devastation caused by the last war in the Middle East are not weakened by sterile discussion or the bitterness that grows from the lack of speedy and positive solutions.45.	The international community could take the initiative in seeking ways to make the warring parties and their allies moderate their mutual verbal attacks. The mass communications media of some of the Arab States and their allies are very effective in presenting Israel as the hated enemy which has no right whatsoever to be located in former Palestine. That kind of propaganda can boomerang against those very leaders who might otherwise be prepared to negotiate a just peace  because their peoples  encouraged by the constant publicity campaign of the mass media  may resist accepting whatever their leaders have in good faith succeeded in working out.46.	Thus there seems to be a marked contrast between the slow progress towards the achievement of peace that has been made this year -progress which must be maintained and protected at all costs- and the policy of open enmity between the parties that is made public even in these halls. Costa Rica hopes that the sense of the responsibility we share in resolving the problems of the Middle East will serve to moderate written and oral statements of aggression here and help the Assembly to co-operate in the creation of a less hostile atmosphere between Arab and Israeli that  unfortunately  I do not think will be favored by the inclusion in the agenda of the item on the question of Palestine as an issue separate from the Middle East  which was adopted at the 2236th meeting. This  however  does not mean that Costa Rica is indifferent to the destiny of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees seeking a permanent home. In this connexion  I would recall what was said by the Foreign Minister of Uruguay  Mr. Juan Carlos Blanco  on thiL problem [2240th meeting].47.	The United Nations is familiar indeed with the problems of Cyprus  problems that have existed since the moment when Cyprus attained its independence. The fight between the two communities on the island  Greek and Turkish  has been followed with close attention by the international community. For more than 10 years a United Nations Peacekeeping Force has been stationed in Cyprus. Our awareness of the problems of that island made us even more grief-stricken at the tragic events which broke the precarious peace at the beginning of August of this year.48.	In the Security Council Costa Rica has followed the events in Cyprus very closely. At the beginning of the crisis  when the peace was disturbed on Cyprus  we noted a lack of decision on the part of some of the permanent members. An opportunity was lost to take effective peace-making action in time and thus prevent further hostilities.49.	Costa Rica shared the pain of that small nation which was powerless to stop a dispute involving other nations and other interests. We were greatly moved when we heard the news of the coup that had overthrown the constitutional President of Cyprus and learned that Cypriot soil was being trampled upon by foreign troop.50.	The delegation of Costa Rica severely criticized the badly timed and short-sighted attempt of th? Greek military dictatorship -which  as we now know  did not represent th? Greek people- to overthrow a legitimate Government. For my country could never accept any change in the structure of an independent and sovereign nation brought about by foreign intervention.51.	At the initial stages of the Cyprus conflict we were told that this was an internal matter  which meant that the Security Council could not take action on it. Costa Rica opposed that view. We stated that the removal of President Makarios had been planned and carried out by Greek military agents responding to the reckless ambitions of the military dictatorship that had done so much to that country  the cradle of Western civilization.52.	Costa Rica stated that the Security Council must not allow itself to be paralyzed in cases where the ""... danger or threat no longer takes place on a battlefield but is surreptitiously displaced to a country and slyly disguises itself as an internal affair . . ."".53.	Subsequently  when the Turkish invasion took place  because of the vacuum left by the lack of action by the Security Council  the fatal failure of the Security Council to act decisively in time became very obvious. When finally the Council decided to acknowledge that peace was being threatened  resolution 353 (1974) was adopted calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Cyprus.54.	Our delegation has followed with attention the subsequent developments in Cyprus. We regret that the cease-fire resolution was not immediately implemented and  furthermore  that the part of the resolution regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops has still not been put into effect.55.	Costa Rica wishes to state for the record that it approves the efforts made by the Secretary-General to restore constitutional order and peace to the afflicted Cypriot nation  and we will do our utmost to help find a formula under which the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus can be maintained because of the successful coexistence of the communities of Greek and Turkish origins.56.	In the year which has elapsed since the last session of the General Assembly  Argentina -and indeed Latin America as a whole- has suffered the loss of a great leader: President Juan Domingo Peron. I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the memory of that statesman. His people will be guided by their memories of him in their search for justice  economic development and the reaffirmation of national sovereignty.57.	As was so well stated by the Argentine Foreign Minister  Mr. Alberto Vignes  great statesmen such as Peron will live beyond their lifetimes because ""their principles and objectives remain in force"" [ibid.  para. 60]. And all of us here must agree with the eloquent and moving statement by Foreign Minister Vignes  on 24 September last  that ""[Peron's] prophetic ideas transformed him into the precursor of universalism and of a 'third-world position"" which are today recognized as being essential means for international coexistence"" [ibid. ].58.	Costa Rica continues to have faith in the United Nations. We believe that  even though the Charter contains provisions which it would be desirable to. amend  the greatest Effectiveness of the Organization depends not on its legal foundations but rather on the political will of its Member States to live in accordance with its principles and to abide by the resolutions of the appropriate bodies and organs. For that reason my country  small as it is  wishes to preach by example. Costa Rica practices an international policy consistent with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and it has never been remiss in shouldering responsibilities flowing from the activities of the organs of the international community."
"30",1680,"CSK",29,1974,"Mr. President  I should like to congratulate you on behalf of the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic upon your election to the high post of President of the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly. In this connexion  I should like to point out that the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria are linked by ties of friendship and struggle for progress and the freedom of peoples. We look upon the election of the representative of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria as a further recognition of the important role played in the United Nations by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.69.	We sincerely welcome to our midst the new Members of our Organization  the People's Republic of Bangladesh  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  and Grenada. Their admission to the United Nations proves that the present international political transition from tension towards detente creates conditions for the successful advancement of the national liberation movement  for the realization of the aspirations of peoples to a free and independent life.70.	The twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly is meeting on the eve of the thirtieth anniversary of the victory over fascism in the Second World War which has brought  thanks to the victory of the Soviet Army  freedom to our people  too  following the period of six years of Nazi occupation. This year Czechoslovakia has recently celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the Slovak national uprising  which represented not only a significant event of resistance against the Nazi occupants  but also one of the important popular military actions in Europe. Next year we shall celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of our State which  as one of the founding Members of the United Nations  has always endeavoured to prevent the repetition of the horrors of war.71.	Today we can already state with satisfaction that in the qualitatively new era of the 1970s the prospects for strengthening and maintaining peace are more promising than ever before. This is a remarkable positive phenomenon in a history filled with almost never-ending wars. It is therefore our duty to deepen the process of international detente  to make it spread to other areas of our planet -in short  to spare no effort in order to ensure that mankind may enhance its spiritual and material values in peace and in constructive international co-operation. This too should become a guiding principle in the activities of the United Nations and at the current session.72.	The axis of international development should not lie in tensions which threaten at every moment to grow into dangerous confrontations  in the feverish anus race accompanied by a senseless waste of material values or in the exploitation of other peoples  but  on the contrary  in detente  disarmament and development.73.	Thanks to the efforts cf peace-loving forces and thanks to their growing unity against the forces of aggression  there exist nowadays the necessary prerequisites for the implementation of the aims and objectives expressed in the three aforementioned concepts.74.	The changing balance of forces in the world  the growing might of the Soviet Union and of other countries of the socialist community  the strengthening of the political independence and economic self- reliance of the developing countries  the dynamism of progressive and democratic forces as well as the realistic approach on the part of a number of statesmen and political circles in the capitalist countries in their assessment of the international situation -all this has rendered the policy of the cold war absurd. The danger of an armed conflict between the States of the capitalist and socialist systems has been reduced. Conditions have been created for a further lessening of tensions  for a consistent implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence among States with differing social systems.75.	The twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly is meeting precisely when detente is the predominant feature in the development of international relations. The settlement of conflicts is in principle moving to the political sphere. At the same time  however  certain recent events indicate that efforts are being made to obstruct this process.76.	The policy of detente is most in evidence in Europe  where substantial changes have made it possible for European countries to begin an era of constructive co-operation. A particular role has been played in this area by the normalization of relations between the socialist countries and the Federal Republic of Germany as embodied in the respective bilateral treaties. Relations between the countries of the socialist community and other Western European countries are also developing. In these circumstances  it seems only logical and completely realistic that the Governments of the European States be required to elaborate the principles which should guide their mutual relations.77.	This is the purport of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Conference has already achieved many positive results. Nevertheless  it is our belief that its course might have been easier had it not been for certain impediments  such as  for instance  attempts to delay the conclusion of the Conference and the casting of doubts as to the level at which its final act would be concluded. Every effort should now be made to promptly achieve the historic objectives of the Conference. It is our belief that the negotiations in Geneva will be concluded successfully in the near future through the joint efforts of all participants.78.	A system ensuring security and constructive co-operation among European nations will benefit not only the European continent but also other regions of the world. At the same time  it will set a good precedent which may indicate a suitable course in other areas. I am referring  for instance  to the efforts to build a system of collective security in Asia.79.	Negotiations and decisions agreed on in the multilateral sphere are more the only path we are following towards international detente. The basis for a multilateral normalization of international relations lies in good bilateral relations among States. There is no doubt that this is particularly true of negotiations of such importance as those between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. It is our Arm belief that the fruitful results these negotiations have yielded in the political  military  economic and other fields and their implementation will contribute substantially to making the process of detente the common denominator of foreign affairs throughout our planet.80.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic unremittingly supports peaceful developments in the world. This is in the very nature of its socialist ideology and of the program of peace which it is trying to carry out  together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries  in international relations. Therefore we have striven and shall continue to strive to develop equal and mutually beneficial relations with every country interested in such relations. We have been trying and shall continue to try to overcome obstacles to the development of such relations.81.	In this context  note should be taken of the importance of the Treaty on mutual relations between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany  which came into force on 19 July 1974. We look upon if as a victory of reason and realism. The Treaty marks the end of a difficult past and paves the way towards the development of equal and mutually beneficial co-operation. In the effort to make our whole frontier a boundary between good neighbors we have also taken steps to remove obstacles to the development of normal relations with Austria.82.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has recently conducted a series of useful talks with other Western countries as well. It has continued to develop its traditionally friendly relations with non-aligned and developing countries. It has established diplomatic relations with a number of States and has signed numerous bilateral agreements in economic  cultural  consular and other fields. We are also endeavoring to achieve such normalization of relations with the United States of America  which would be in accordance with the policy of international detente and would promote the development of mutually beneficial relations between the two countries. We hope that these efforts will meet with a positive response from our partners.83.	We are also aware  of course  of the fact that the encouraging international trend towards the strengthening of peace is not an automatic phenomenon. The surface of the international situation continues to be troubled by events that contrast with the policy of detente and are contrary to the requirement that disputes between States should be dealt with exclusively by negotiation. These events have a negative effect on the international political atmosphere.84.	Last year we welcomed with satisfaction the Paris agreements as fundamental prerequisites for ensuring peace in South-East Asia. Nevertheless  a normalization of the situation in Indo-China has not yet been fully achieved. We therefore support the position taken by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam requesting strict adherence to all the provisions of the Paris agreements and the consistent implementation of the decisions adopted by the International Conference on Viet Nam in March 1973. We condemn the activities of the Saigon administration  which erects obstacles to the creation of an atmosphere of national reconciliation in South Viet Nam. We consider ;hat a realistic way out of the present situation is the plan of 22 March 1974 of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam. Czechoslovakia  together with all other forces of peace and progress throughout the world  will continue in the future also to support not only the efforts of the VietNamese people but those of all other peoples of IndoChina aimed at satisfying their legitimate aspirations.85.	The attention of world public opinion has been focused for many years on the Middle East  where international security has been threatened by long- lasting tensions and war operations. The roots of the explosive situation have not yet been eradicated. The main cause of the grave situation persisting in the Middle East lies in the aggressive policy of Israel. Israel must withdraw its troops from the Arab territories it has occupied and must stop flouting the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine.86.	The Czechoslovak delegation supported the initiative taken by the Arab States  Members of the United Nations  in proposing the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the question of Palestine as a separate item. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic deems it necessary to put in motion all political means that might achieve a Middle Eastern settlement in the spirit of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council. It is particularly essential to resume as soon as possible the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of all directly concerned parties  including the representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] acting as participants with equal rights. The Conference must focus its attention on a concrete solution to the basic problems of the Middle East.87.	A new focal point of tension has recently appeared in the eastern Mediterranean. For certain circles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]  which are attempting to liquidate the independent State of Cyprus  a sovereign Member of the United Nations  and turn the island into a NATO base  the policy of non-alignment was a real thorn in the flesh.88.	The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has always supported the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and has opposed attempts to divide and annex it. The Government of Czechoslovakia remains convinced that an end must be put to outside interference in the internal affairs of Cyprus and that it is essential to implement scrupulously the provisions of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council  particularly resolution 353 (1974) of 20 July 1974  to withdraw ail foreign troops and military personnel from Cyprus  and to leave to the people of Cyprus and its legitimate Government the right to decide freely on the destiny of the country. Those are the aims pursued by the proposal of the Government of the Soviet Union  of 22 August 1974 ' for the convening of an international conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations. The Government of Czechoslovakia fully supports the above proposal.89.	It is also necessary to strengthen peace and ensure healthy international development in a number of other regions of the world. One of them is the Korean peninsula. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic  aware of the importance of the reunification of Korea for-peace and security in Asia  strongly endorses the policy pursued by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  the aim of which is the peaceful democratic unification of the country without outside interference. The decision taken at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to dissolve the unlawful so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was welcomed in Czechoslovakia. The General Assembly  at its twenty-ninth session  must take a further step toward the removal of this anomalous situation which has kept our Organization involved in a policy inherited from the cold war  and it must bring about the withdrawal from South Korea of all foreign troops still unjustifiably stationed there under the United Nations flag.90.	It is indeed outrageous that in today's world the peoples of certain territories should still have to suffer from colonial and racist oppression. The United Nations must press ever harder for a complete and uncompromising implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. The recent achievements of the national liberation movement have  posed anew the question of further organized efforts by the United Nations towards a full elimination of the remnants of the system of colonialism in the world in the immediate future.91.	We welcomed the fact that the new provisional Government of Portugal  supported by the whole of Portuguese democratic public opinion  has dissociated itself from the reactionary position taken by the previous regime  and has decided to recognize the independence of Guinea-Bissau and concluded an agreement with the representatives of the national liberation movement of Mozambique on the granting of independence to that country. We should like to express our deep conviction that the people of Angola  as well as the peoples of other territories under Portuguese administration  will also attain complete independence in the near future.92.	Surely it is high time now to put an end to colonialism  racism and apartheid in the whole of southern Africa. The peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia also must be able live in freedom  independence and equality.93.	During the year that has passed since the Fascist coup in Chile  a world-wide campaign of solidarity with the Chilean people  and a campaign to release Luis Corvalan and other patriots  has been widely reflected in the organs of the United Nations. In the future  too  the United Nations should take further steps against the mass violations of fundamental civil freedoms and human rights by the military junta in Chile.94.	At a time when the international political barometer raises hope for further detente  the need to stop the frenzied arms race  which is a threat to the whole of mankind  and the need to reach general and complete disarmament are becoming increasingly urgent. Political detente must be supplemented by detente in the military sphere  and the more than $250 000 million spent annually by mankind on armaments must be used for economic progress in order to raise the living and social standards of the people  and in order to strengthen economic co-operation.95.	In order to attain positive results in the field of military detente  we feel that it is particularly important not to delay the negotiations on practical preparations for  and the convening of  a world disarmament conference  which would make it possible to move forward towards an overall solution of the whole intricate complex of disarmament questions. It is our continued belief that more active use should be made of the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  particularly with regard to the question of a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons  the limiting of underground testing of nuclear weapons  and the conclusion of an agreement on a comprehensive nuclear and thermonuclear test ban.96.	We have already welcomed the proposal made by the USSR to reduce by 10 per cent the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council and to use a part of the funds  released for providing assistance to developing countries.97.	At the current session  the Soviet Union has introduced a draft resolution [AIC.IIL.675] to which was annexed a draft convention on the prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human well-being and health. This new peaceful initiative has come to occupy an important position in the whole matter of safeguarding mankind against the threat of a devastating war. I am convinced that this proposal will meet with the full support of this session.98.	We further trust that the results of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to be held in the spring of next year  will contribute decisively to the full implementation of the aforementioned Treaty and compliance with it.99.	We welcome the efforts made by the participants in the talks on the reduction of forces and armaments in Central Europe and the constructive character of those deliberations. It is our firmly held belief that they will result in generally acceptable measures which would not put any of the parties at an advantage or at a disadvantage and would not threaten the security of any of the countries involved. Czechoslovakia  like other socialist countries  is prepared to provide maximum support for attempts to stop the frenzied arms race.100.	The present political atmosphere in the world and the further process of detente have created favorable conditions for the promotion of trade and economic contacts among all countries  irrespective of their different social systems.101.	To bring about a complete normalization of international trade and economic relations  it is  however  necessary for the developed capitalist countries and certain economic groupings to abolish discriminatory practices and to liberalize their trade with ail other countries The agenda of this session of the General Assembly includes important economic and social questions as reflected in the decisions taken by the sixth special session of the General Assembly. These must be decided upon in the spirit of the Charter and in the interests of all countries.102.	The Czechoslovak delegation attaches particular importance to the consistent implementation of decolonization in international economic relations  for without it we cannot visualize true progress in the interests of the broad popular masses of the individual sovereign States of the so-called third world. In spite of the resistance of various exploitation minded circles  the progressive principles are nevertheless gaining ground in all spheres of international economic life  just as the economic power of the countries of the socialist community.is growing and the political and economic independence of the developing countries is becoming stronger.103.	We view the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S~VI)] adopted at the recent sixth special session  as well as the future Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States -whose text should be speedily completed and adopted as a universal document- as an important basis for  and contribution to  the all-round development of international economic co-operation. The resolutions adopted at the twenty-ninth session pertaining to the items of the sixth special session must  we feel  reflect the fact that detente and peaceful co-operation are a prerequisite of progress and that disarmament is one of the possible sources of additional resources necessary for peaceful economic development.104.	We firmly believe that it is necessary to strength-en world peace and security as a basic prerequisite for a further systematic improvement in the world economic situation which would also be to the benefit of economic development and progress in the developing countries.105.	There is no doubt that the process of international detente and the degree to which the United Nations participates in strenghening it at the same time help to enhance this Organization. The role and significance of the United Nations in today's conditions  against the background of developed collective efforts of countries interested in the building of permanent and lasting peace  is undoubtedly increasing.106.	We regard the United Nations as an important international forum which is able to make a significant contribution to the strengthening of the present trend towards general detente in international relations so as to implement successfully in them the basic norms of peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems. The present trend towards international detente creates very suitable conditions which are highly propitious for the accomplishment by the United Nations of the tasks assigned to it by the Charter and so that the United Nations can devote itself fully to carrying out the mission formulated in the Charter.107.	We are convinced that concerted action by all peaceful and progressive forces here also in the United Nations will stop all those who would attempt to reverse the course of history. The delegation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic is prepared to co-operate in this spirit at the present session  in a businesslike and constructive manner  with all delegations truly interested in peace  security and the further promotion of friendly co-operation among peoples."
"31",1703,"CUB",29,1974,"Mr. President  the Cuban delegation wishes to express joyous  friendly and fraternal congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. In addition to your known reputation as a revolutionary fighter in the heroic struggle for the national liberation of Algeria  you combine the skill  competence and prestige needed for such a delicate and responsible position.2.	However  we must recognize that the meaning of the unanimous election that brought Abdelaziz. Bouteflika  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  to the presidency of the Assembly goes beyond the framework of the outstanding personal qualities and abilities he brings to his duties. First and foremost  it bespeaks international recognition of the outstanding role played at this time by the peoples and countries of the third world  and  within that vast and stirring group  particularly those which have achieved their independence or are struggling to do so on the African continent. Furthermore  it symbolizes the new situation created by the growing convergence of the non-aligned nations  the democratic  progressive forces and the socialist countries in the arduous and determined under-taking to establish a just international order and to eradicate colonialism  imperialism and neo-colonialism as well as racism in all its forms and manifestations. We can conclude  therefore  that in this specific case those who honor that noble cause  by their words and by their deeds  are in themselves honored. The Cuban revolution greets the Algerian revolution for this well-earned distinction.3.	We are also very happy to express our gratitude to Mr. Leopoldo Benites for the excellent work he did as President of the General Assembly during the twenty-eighth regular session and the sixth special session which followed it.4.	The Cuban delegation wishes to renew its expression of friendship to the sister Republic of Honduras  recently beset by a devastating hurricane. My country has itself experienced the blind fury of that tragic concert of shattering rain  wind and tidal waves. From the very beginning of this sad event  Cuba  true to its Latin American and internationalist duties  offered the Honduran people all possible assistance within our means.5.	The admission to the United Nations of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  the Republic of Bangladesh and the island of Grenada is a matter of great satisfaction for Cuba. While they are all milestones on the road to the universality of the United Nations  what is more important is the significance of their constitution as independent nations; it strengthens and accelerates the process of decolonization. The advent of the people of Guinea-Bissau to independence is the glorious culmination of a long and arduous fight that earned the admiration and solidarity of all corners of the world.6.	In accordance with its revolutionary principles  Cuba is committed to the battle being waged by the peoples of Africa  Asia and Latin America against colonialism  imperialism and neo-colonialism and  therefore  we celebrate as our own the triumph of the people of Guinea-Bissau. The Cuban people was not merely a spectator at that memorable epic. We supported it. We assisted them. Our young fellow-country-man  Pedro Rodriguez Peralta  was one of the international fighters who personally took up arms in defense of freedom and fought shoulder to shoulder with the brave and dedicated warriors of Guinea- Bissau. Wounded and captured in combat  he faced  with the unshakable determination of a Cuban revolutionary  torture and harassment in the horrible dungeons of Portuguese fascism.7.	Am Hear Cabral  the supreme guide and national hero of the people of Guinea-Bissau  was our friend  our comrade and our brother. He died  vilely murdered on the very threshold of victory. But today  crowned with laurels  he is reborn in the thoughts  hearts and will of his people. He will continue to point the way even though he is dead. Let us not mourn his death. Those who lead peoples receive a lasting tribute by having their work carried on.8.	The people of Mozambique  led by the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] is also now in the process of total decolonization through a fixed- term agreement signed with the new Government of Portugal  which is to a large extent the result of the struggle for national liberation in its colonies. Yet we must be alert to the maneuvers and the plots of reactionary white settlers in connivance with South Africa and the imperialist powers to frustrate the freedom movement in Mozambique  Cape Verde and Angola.9.	We must in all fairness rely on the commitment proclaimed in this hall by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal [2239th meeting]. The new Portuguese Government has  by its actions  confirmed its anti-colonialist and anti-Fascist policy. As a consequence of the onerous legacy it received from the outmoded regime overthrown by the armed forces of the people  the new Government of Portugal faces difficulties and problems. But it is obvious that after the recent changes in the structure of power resolutely supported by the broad masses and by the revolutionary and progressive political parties  it is cleansing and strengthening its foundations and  among the harassments and resistance of an outmoded economic order that is still intact  it appears to be heading towards democratization of the country.10.	The admission of the Republic of Bangladesh war* a long-delayed act of justice. Cuba fully supported the inalienable right of that people to national independence and was one of the first States to recognize it as a free and sovereign country.11.	Grenada is an island near to our own and  like Cuba  forms part of the same Caribbean historic constellation  a dialectic synthesis of races  languages and cultures and struggles which dovetail and fertilize each other. A common colonial and neo-colonial past generated our under-development and our dependency. But that same past gave birth to our rebellion and to our determination to be free. Cuba offers its friendship  its support and its co-operation to that island.12.	The establishment of Grenada as an independent country means one link less in the colonialist chain of the Antilles. But there are still fetters to shatter and therefore freedoms to win. Among the other nations of the area Puerto Rico is still subjugated and under the colonialist domination of the United States  against the sovereign will of the people. But  sooner rather than later  it will be completely independent and thus entitled to enter the United Nations. Fulfilling the mandate it received from Jose Marti  Cuba will never cease to help the people of Puerto Rico in their patriotic aim.13.	Providing undeniable evidence of the fact that the struggle for national liberation is invincible in Africa  Asia and Latin America  these three new States which have acceded to independent life wilt give a lasting impetus to completion of the process of decolonization in the world. Some African* nations are still living under the yoke of colonial oppression and racism. It is our bounden duty to contribute to their immediate liberation through material  political and moral assistance. Africa cannot be a free continent as long as countries are suffering from colonialism  neo-colonialism or racism  as Latin America and Asia cannot be independent as long as vestiges of colonialism or neo-colonialist regimes are to be found there.14.	It must be clear to everyone that the process of international detente - taking place in Europe is of vital importance to every country and every people. The basic liquidation of the aftermath of the Second World War and the recognition of the international personality of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have helped to add oxygen to the somewhat rarefied atmosphere of the old continent. The fruit of the  Security and Co operation in Europe are now starting to emerge. The agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union to prevent nuclear war and the negotiations by both countries on the limitation of strategic weapons and the mutual reduction of their armies stationed in Europe obviously tend to create conditions conducive to avoiding confrontation and replacing it by co-operation.15.	That process  tenaciously fostered by the Soviet Union as a complement of its policies of peaceful! coexistence among different systems  strengthens and encourages the age-old aspiration of peoples to security and peace and makes it possible to develop the struggle of the peoples of all the other continents to achieve political independence  economic emancipation and social progress. Detente is indivisible and therefore its benefits should be extended to the world at large.16.	It is equally clear that the promising reverberations felt all over the world are in dramatic contrast to the tensions and conflicts that still lie over the horizons outside the European continent itself. In Latin America the policy of cold war is still with us. Cuba is a nation under blockade. The Cuban delegation renews its strong condemnation of this aggressive measure and states once again that no official negotiation of the dispute between Cuba and the United States can begin until that criminal  arbitrary and anachronistic blockade is lifted for it is in clear contradiction with the detente applied elsewhere. There is no peace in the IndoChinese peninsula. The Agreement ending the war and restoring peace in Viet Nam  signed in Paris on 27 January 1973  has proved to be completely ineffective. United States imperialism has blocked every effort aimed at the peaceful reunification of Korea and foreign troops are still stationed in the south of the peninsula  sheltered under the flag of the United Nations. The agreements so arduously achieved in Laos are constantly jeopardized. With two thirds of its territory in the hands of the people's army of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  the seat of that country at the United Nations is still occupied by the puppets of Lon Nol and we still avoid discussing this burning question here.17.	Beyond the coast of Europe  in the Mediterranean area itself  the Middle East crisis  which is already threatening world peace and security  daily becomes worse. Today the Middle East subsoil is the potential epicenter of an explosion that will affect the whole world. The urgency of a definitive solution is obvious.18.	it would be helpful to realize that  whatever method or means may be used  there can be no just and lasting peace in the area until Israel returns the occupied Arab territories and recognizes the national rights of the Palestine Arab people. Cuba advocates the participation of the true representatives of that people in this session of the General Assembly when we discuss the question of Palestine and in any matters dealing with its existence as a nation. Without a solution to the problem of Palestine  any settlement of the crisis in the Middle East is illusory.19.	The bitter events in Cyprus  closely interlinked with the stormy situation in the Middle East  have thrown a dark shadow of concern over the fate of small nations. I shall not repeat here what is known to all. Suffice it to say that the people of Cyprus was the sacrificial victim of Yankee strategy in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and its allies in the disputed zone of the eastern Mediterranean.20.	The cunning overthrow of Archbishop Makarios  the constitutional President of Cyprus  was plotted by United States imperialism in connivance with the Greek Fascist junta  the reactionary forces of the region and the agents of the two communities in that country. The armed conflict that followed the coup d'etat led to foreign intervention which  despite the cease-fire agreement  is still causing severe losses  outrage and intolerable harassment to the inhabitants of the island. The people and the country of Cyprus have paid a very high price to remain independent and honor their adherence to the Movement of Non-aligned States.21.	Cyprus  the second non-aligned country to be attacked in less than a year by the concerted forces of reaction and imperialism  is at this moment at the mercy of NATO and of the invaders. The crude way it was contrived to impose this situation by force and foreign intervention is a challenge to the international community and to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. If an end is not put to it  it will throw wide open the gates for new aggressions by Israel against the Arab countries and endanger peace and security in Europe  the Mediterranean and the Middle East. The Movement of the Non-Aligned States has most severely condemned the international plot against the independence of Cyprus and actively supports the struggle of its people to reconquer its independence.22.	The Soviet Union has proposed the convening of a world conference within the context of the United Nations in order to resolve the dangerous situation which has been created and to safeguard the independence of Cyprus.' Cuba supports any other proposal tending towards the same end. Therefore  we feel that to that end any formula for solution should contain at least the following conditions: withdrawal of all foreign troops; absolute independence; territorial integrity; freedom to maintain the policy of non-alignment; and the solution of the problem of the national communities on the basis of the principle of territorial integrity and without foreign interference.23.	It is almost futile to specify that Chile was the other non-aligned country that in the past year has been the victim of a reactionary intern0' plot planned in collusion with imperialist intervention. The armed forces of Chile acted as the implacable weapon of those anti-national interests and they are directly responsible for the overthrow of the constitutional Government of Chile and the death of President Salvador Allende  who fell in combat clutching the flag of his .country and whose democratic and socialist convictions have lighted a torch that can never be extinguished.24.	An American hero  Salvador Allende is also a hero of the third world and of all peoples. As the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government of Cuba  Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro  said in a iwcent address:""The great flame of solidarity now burning in all the nations of the world kindled in the heat of the Chilean tragedy has not died down with the passage of months. On the first anniversary of the death of President Allende his stature grows ever greater in the eyes of world public opinion  and the peoples redouble their condemnation of and contempt for theFascist junta. Nothing in the past few years has so deeply wounded moral sensitivities and produced such unanimous revulsion in all corners of the world. There is no government that stands in lower esteem or is more morally isolated than the Fascist Government of Chile.""25.	From this very rostrum at the twenty-eighth session [2148th meeting]  I denounced the participation of the Government of the United States in the overthrow and death of President Allende. That Pinocchio of a Pinochet tried futilely to prove sue wrong but today that participation is known to inter-national public opinion through the cynical confession of the Government of the United States itself  which at that time so obstinately denied its intervention.26.	I believe it most useful to mention those para-graphs of our Prime Minister's speech relating to these matters. He said:""The authorities of the United States at that time hastened to deny what all the world suspected  namely  the responsibility of the Government of the United States for the events in Chile. A year later we learned in minute detail that the CIA has intervened flagrantly in Chilean affairs on the direct order of the highest authorities of the United States throughout the last 10 years in order  first  to prevent the triumph of popular unity  then to hinder the transfer of power following its triumph  and finally to work actively for the overthrow of President Allende.""We now know  from the publication of the report of the Director of the CIA  William Colby  to the Intelligence Sub-Committee of the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives on 22 April 1974 and from other evidence given by CIA agents and published in the United States press  that in the 1964 elections the CIA gave the Christian Democratic Party $3 million to support their candidate  Eduardo Frei  in his campaign against Salvador Allende; that in the 1970 elections the CIA invested considerable funds to prevent the triumph of the Popular candidate  and that same year when the victorious Popular forces had gained power  invested $350 000 to bribe the Congress of Chile so that Allende's election would not be ratified; that  immediately after the constitution of the Government of Popular Unity  the CIA spent $5 million between 1971 and 1973 to disrupt and sabotage that Government; that in the parliamentary elections of 1973 the CIA spent $1.5 million to support the opposition candidates and to influence the information mass media; and  finally  that in the summer of 1973 the CIA financed the counter-revolutionary riots  the truck drivers and trades-men's strikes in which tens of thousands of Fascists participate  and other acts which led to the criminal and treasonable coup of 11 September of that year. These vast amounts were negotiated on the black market  above the official rate  thus contributing to speculation and increasing monetary difficulties. ""Without entering into consideration of the close relations that the Pentagon had with the Chilean armed forces  to which it was still supplying weapons at a time when all the credits ""of the Popular Government were cut off in the United States and in the international financial bodies controlled by it  it is clear that the CIA played a decisive role in creating suitable conditions and paving the way for the Fascist coup which has caused the Chilean people so much affliction  blood and tragedy. The CIA and the highest authorities of the United States who encouraged and supplied this policy bear direct responsibility for all the thousands of Chileans who have been tortured  murdered  imprisoned or exiled  and for the terrible conditions of oppression  unemployment and misery that millions of people are suffering in that fraternal country today. The pure  revolutionary and heroic blood of Salvador Allende that was shed on 11 September when he was murdered must leave an indelible stain on the history of those who govern the United States.""Is it not in flagrant contradiction of all the rules of international law and the fundamental principles of the United Nations? Is it not against all the international conventions and treaties imposed by the United States on the peoples of this hemisphere?""It is not surprising  therefore  that"" -so Fidel Castro pointed out in his speech -""with this basic lack of respect and consideration which the United States shows towards our peoples  it should have owned to and justified its intervention in Chile at the same time as it was threatening Venezuela and Ecuador  among other oil-producing countries  with reprisals in the form of starvation and even worse if they did not bow to its demands and reduce the price of petroleum.""27.	Facts  like fists  repeatedly used  must inevitably lead us all to set up as soon as possible a genuine regional organization that will assure our position in the world and defend the peoples of Latin America  bring them together and unite them politically against the domination and over lordship of the United States. We are learning a worthy and useful lesson from the African nations. South Africa  Rhodesia and Europe are excluded from their regional organization.28.	In the statement to which I referred earlier  the Prime Minister of Cuba placed this question in the right context:""The United States  on the one side and the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean on the other  form two worlds as different as are Europe and Africa; they do not fit within the same com-munity. There the separation is made by the very narrow straits of Gibraltar; here it is by the Rio Bravo and the Florida Straits. In both cases there is a technological gulf  and entirely different cultures.""The United States is already a great community; the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean have before them the historic task of forming their own  as the essential condition for freedom  development and survival. And that can never be achieved through unworthy and promiscuous contacts with the United States. United  our people will have sufficient strength to provide themselves with the security guarantees  in confronting the aggression  interference and domination of the United States  that can never be provided by the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance  or the OAS.""29.	A few days ago the ex-Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army  Ex-Minister of Defense and ex-Vice President of the Republic in the Government of Popular Unity  Mr. Carlos Prats  was murdered by typical Fascist means in the City of Buenos Aires  where he had been living in exile since 15 September 1973. His wife died by his side  blown to pieces by the force of the explosion.30.	Prats was a military man of honor and an upright citizen who remained loyal to his constitutional obligations and to the sovereign will of the Chilean people. Living  he represented an accusing finger pointed at the great betrayal  and a ray of hope for the soldiers and officers who are still the hidd n reserves of the Chilean people. In a letter addressed to Mrs. Hortensia Busst  widow of the late Salvador Allende  he said:""With regard to the conduct of Pinochet  I can tell you that his treason is without parallel in the history of Chile.""In another letter to one of Allende's daughters  Beatriz  he said:""I have suffered much for the it justices inflicted on me  but more for the sorrows that are now tormenting the Chilean people.""He also let her know that he was writing his memoirs. And in his last letter to Allende's widow he said:""I have remained aloof from political and press contacts: but nevertheless my every act is closely watched by a strange and involved network of informers  and every effort is being made in Chile to find some evidence that could be used to besmirch my honor.""31.	Prats assassination  by a strange coincidence  occurred at the same time as the CIA's secret admission in the House of Representatives  and the public admission by the Government of the United States  of the brazen interference in Chile's internal affairs. No great brilliance is needed to draw the logical conclusions: the alleged beneficiaries of this ghastly crime have betrayed themselves. But the noble blood of Carlos Prats will be fused with that of President Salvador Allende and the thousands of other murdered men and women to become the fount for the inexorable victory of the people of Chile. There can be no doubt that they will crush fascism. To that noble foundation has now been added the blood of Miguel Enriquez  Secretary-General of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left  who  when he was most needed  fell in a skirmish with the henchmen of the junta. The delegation of Cuba pays a revolutionary tribute to that valiant fighter.32.	A glance at the lengthy agenda of the current regular session of the General Assembly shows that there are not only many questions still awaiting solution  but also many problems that have emerged during the past year. It is obviously not possible for me to deal with so many questions. My delegation will consider them in detail in the appropriate Committees. 33.	However  I consider it necessary to draw attention brief to the problem raised by the crisis of the old international economic order and some of its most important aspects. At the sixth special session Cuba made known its position on the matter [2227th meetingJ. We pointed out the imperative need to replace that unjust and obsolete structure by a new international economic order  to encourage and ensure the development and liberation of the under-developed nations  which are most ruthlessly discriminated against and exploited by the highly developed capitalist countries -the very countries which today threaten them with drastic reprisals  and even war- after having despoiled them for centuries. ''Truth will make the stones speak""  says the old proverb. And today the very stones must cry out at this clumsy effort to fob off on the under-developed  oil-producing countries the responsibility of the capitalist countries for the growing inflation  the international monetary crisis and the depression which is threatening us phenomena that have been created exclusively by the economic and financial machinery of their own obsolete system.34.	One of the main problems we face at the Assembly is  in fact  not the so-called crisis born of the increase in oil prices  but the real crisis that is undermining the very foundations of the capitalist system. No such situation has been seen since the end of the Second World War. But the characteristic signs of a new depression are clearly visible: cutbacks and unemployment. It is obvious that the boom in the market economies that began in 1971 has lost its momentum and that an alarming decline is now beginning. The financial upheavals of the international monetary crisis have been one of the propellent factors in this process. The foundations of the system established at Bretton Woods have been fatally eroded. The anti-cyclic maneuvers employed to halt the process have thus far failed entirely. The inflationary spiral is still soaring out of control.35.	The significant increase in the prices of raw materials has served as a pretext for some highly developed capitalist countries to organize a campaign to sow disagreement  confusion and disarray among the underdeveloped countries by laying the primary responsibility for what is happening to them on the shoulders of the oil-producers.36.	The underdeveloped countries are not responsible for this situation; they have been and continue to be its victims. The highly developed capitalist countries have for long imposed price increases on the world market  by exporting manufactured goods at prices that uncontrolled domestic inflation forced upwards at an outrageous pace. At the same time  the underdeveloped countries have been compelled to sell their raw materials at steadily falling prices  while purchasing equipment and manufactured goods at steadily rising prices: in brief  the familiar process of the constant deterioration in the terms of trade.37.	It is true that in recent years the prices of raw materials  and above all oil  also rose. But it is also true that that increase  except for oil  was due to purely episodic or temporary factors  ranging from climatic conditions in agricultural production to speculative movements  some linked to inflation and others to the international monetary crisis. It is also true that those who benefited most from the higher prices of raw materials  as the figures show  were some of the highly developed capitalist countries And it is equally true that the underdeveloped countries tried to organize themselves to take joint action for a legitimate improvement of their position vis-a-vis the colonialist system of unequal terms of trade.38.	The total values of the increase in exports of raw materials between 1972 and 1973 amounted to $40 000 million. Of that increase  the highly developed capitalist countries absorbed $29 000 million and the underdeveloped countries $11 000 million. It is demonstrably false that the third world derived any substantive benefits from the recent rise in commodity prices. But there is another point to be considered. The meager surplus obtained by the underdeveloped countries was in many cases wiped out by the deficit side of their foreign trade balances. They have had to face the devaluation of the dollar and the effects of inflation on their imports of manufactured goods and food.39.	In 1973 many Latin American countries had large deficits in their trade and service balances  as well as the outflow of funds represented by foreign private investments. In 1968-1972 almost $8 000 mil-lion was sent back to their main offices by United States firms that operate in Latin America. We would be justified in assuming that Yankee imperialism has assigned to our continent the function  among others  of helping it to solve its international balance of payments deficit.40.	The raising of oil prices by the underdeveloped producer countries has provoked a storm of lies  calumny and threats. There have even been veiled accusations against those countries responsible for inciting a possible world conflict. Cuba's position on this burning question was stated very clearly by our Prime Minister in his aforementioned speech; it is the position of an underdeveloped  socialist but non- aligned Latin American nation; and I shall  if you will allow me  read out a few paragraphs from that speech relative to this problem and the political strategy called for in these critical times:""As raised  in unusually harsh terms by the President of the United States and other leaders of that country  both at the United Nations and at the nineteenth World Energy Conference being held in Detroit -where  obviously  the Yankee authorities  by denying Cuba's representative a visa  prevented our participation -the oil question assumes dramatic proportions.""Through a concerted and perfectly prepared action  the leaders of that country demanded that the oil-producing nations reduce their prices  holding them responsible for any imminent world economic crisis that might arise and threatening them with possible and varied kinds of reprisals. Indeed  the American news agencies undertook to stress the dramatic nature of those pronouncements  and they were justified in so doing.""The statements of the President of the United States were added to by similar declarations by the United States Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury.""The United States strategy is very clear: to group under its aegis the developed capitalist nations  to divide the nations of the third world and isolate the oil-producing nations in order to impose its conditions upon them. In so doing  it threatens them  in reprisal  with putting a stop to the export of food  and even with war.""It is unjust  first of all  to blame the oil-producing countries for world-wide inflation and the inter-national monetary crisis. Responsibility for those problems falls on the United States itself. It is the United States which imposed on the community of nations the monetary system that gave the dollar a privileged position over all other currencies; it was the United States which flooded the world and the reserve banks of nearly all countries with American banknotes  that by far exceeded their gold backing; it was the United States which blockaded and isolated the socialist community from international trade; it was the United States which started the cold war and unleashed the arms race; it was the United States and its allies which  through their military pacts for a quarter of a century  invested thousands of millions of dollars yearly in armaments; it was the United States which launched the war in Viet Nam  which cost more than $150 000 million. The United States war budget exceeds $80 000 million a year  and the CIA alone spends thousands of millions yearly. In this scandalous imperialist policy lie the roots of inflation and of the monetary crisis that emerged long before the oil price rises. It was the United States which established the consumer society and the limitless squandering of the natural resources of the world's peoples. The rise in oil prices  in any event  only worsened an already critical situation unleashed by imperialist society itself.""Secondly  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) emerges as a just reaction on the part of the producer countries of the underdeveloped world to defend themselves against unjust prices  unfair terms of trade and the exorbitant earnings of the great multinational companies  which  for the most part  are United States-owned. Those who invented monopolistic oil prices way above production costs were not the producer countries  but rather the large oil companies  which thus obtained fabulous earnings for imperialism.""For many years oil suffered the same fate as that of other raw materials produced by the under-developed world. But oil is a very special raw material  because iron  aluminum  tin  copper  nickel  uranium  chrome  manganese and many other products are consumed almost entirely by the developed nations; oil  on the other hand  is a product that  to a greater or lesser extent  must be consumed by all countries of the world. Of all raw materials  it is the most essential and most irreplaceable. Therein lies the strength  but also the weakness  of the countries that produce it  in this confrontation with imperialism.""No sooner had oil prices risen after the last crisis in the Middle East than the developed capitalist countries forced a break-neck rise in the costs of equipment  technology and industrial products  far exceeding what the energy costs may have added to production costs. The United States responded immediately to the oil price rises by increasing the prices of its own exports. But while it has that resource with which to face its difficulties  there are many countries in the world that neither are industrialized nor possess oil  and whose agricultural products or raw materials do not fetch adequate prices to compensate for the tremendous increase in the costs of industrial products and energy.""Imperialist strategy is therefore aware that in many poor countries a call for reduced oil prices must fall on receptive ears. Such a reduction could lead to a serious split between the countries of the the third world and  with it  to the ruin of the oil- exporting countries a ruin which  in the long run  would also befall all other producers of raw materials and would spell an aggravation of the already unequal terms of trade imposed on our peoples by imperialism.""Oil enjoys a privileged position among the various raw materials and hence stands in the van-guard of this struggle. But this places an enormous responsibility on the oil-exporting countries. If we want all underdeveloped countries to take part in the oil battle  the oil-producing countries must shoulder their responsibilities in the struggle of the underdeveloped world. It is not by investing oil income in the industrialized countries or in inter-national financial bodies controlled by imperialism that the support of the underdeveloped world will be obtained. Those resources must be invested in the third world itself  in the struggle against under-development  so that the oil battle can be a true banner and a hope for all the needy peoples of the world. Otherwise  much of the underdeveloped world will have nothing to gain from that struggle  and will only have to pay more for energy and manufactured goods and resign itself to further impoverishment in an already critical situation.""Neither the oil producers nor the underdeveloped nations can allow themselves the luxury of missing this historic opportunity. This is the moment when all countries of the third world must unite their efforts and face the imperialist challenge. If the oil producers remain united and firm  if they do not allow themselves to be intimidated by the threats of the United States  if they seek to ally themselves with the rest of the underdeveloped world  the industrialized capitalist countries will have to accept as inevitable the disappearance of the shameful  unjust terms of trade that they have imposed on our peoples.""The non-aligned countries could meet and give a firm  united and categorical reply to the threats and pressures of the United States. Faced with the imperialist strategy of divide and conquer  what is required is even more resolute solidarity; and thus international co-operation  which is so indispensable  would be based not on terms dictated by the imperialists  but on the aspirations and legitimate interests of all peoples of the world.""The Government of Venezuela has replied with determination and dignity to the speech of the President of the United States. Yet only a very few Latin American countries  some of them oil producers or potential exporters  have given Venezuela their support; many Governments have remained silent. When Venezuela nationalizes iron and oil  as its Government has proclaimed it will do soon  the imperialist policy towards Venezuela can be expected to harden.""This is an historic hour in which Venezuela needs the support of all peoples of Latin America  and Latin America needs Venezuela. We must recognize its battle as the battle of all our peoples.""At the same time  Venezuela  with the extra-ordinary financial resources that it can mobilize as the fruits of a firm and victorious oil policy  could do much for the solidarity  integration  development and independence of the peoples of Latin America  as did the soldiers of Simon Bolivar a century ago.""Cuba  which  thanks to the generous assistance of the Soviet Union  has not suffered an energy crisis  and whose development is progressing despite the imperialist blockade and the cowardly behavior of many Governments of this continent  has no hesitation in proclaiming its support for the sister Government and people of Venezuela in their just position vis-a-vis the claims and contentions of the United States.""Let the Venezuelans learn from the example of the Cuban revolution  which under the most unbelievable conditions of blockade  hemispheric solitude and isolation  firmly and unhesitatingly resisted the assaults of imperialism  and which  today  15 years later  emerges victorious and unscathed -an irreversible fact in this continent.''Venezuela will not  however  stand alone in this hemisphere as did Cuba. Perhaps destiny holds anew for the people of the illustrious Liberator an outstanding and decisive role in the final attainment of independence by the nations of Latin America.""41. In his message to the Secretary-General  President Houari Boumediene of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria very cogently refers to the grave responsibilities that fall on the developed industrialized countries.""Feeling  no doubt  that they were unable by their own means and with their own resources to curb the inflationary process  some industrialized countries are trying to attribute the problems which they are experiencing and which they have managed to extend to the rest of the world  exclusively to the price of oil sold by a group of developing countries. In actual fact  far from bringing about inflation  the oil-producing countries  like all countries producing raw materials  have been the first victims of inflation. The true cause of inflation must be sought in the very foundations of the economic system of the developed countries.""This system  which for centuries enabled the Western countries to build up and expand their economies  has its real roots in the permanent exploitation of the poorest by the richest and of the weakest by the strongest. Some developed countries have gone so far as to refuse humanitarian assistance to the most impoverished of the third world countries  while others have made their assistance contribution contingent on the assistance provided by other countries  and particularly the oil-producing countries.... such conduct... is intended to exert pressure on the member countries of OPEC  threatening to exacerbate the plight of the disadvantaged to the point of despair. Most developed countries have failed to learn any lessons from the discussions which took place at the recent special session of the General Assembly and they persist in believing that they can settle the problems now confronting mankind outside the framework of the United Nations."" [AI97S7  annex  pp. 2 and 3.]42.	President Boumediene stresses in his message that ""questions of energy  raw materials or of inflation can be settled only by the establishment of genuine international co-operation"". But he warns that that co-operation can only occur on the day ""when the international economic order ceases to be dominated by the developed countries"".43.	Once again Cuba reaffirms its profound con-viction that the basic problem confronting the third world today is that of its liberation and development. The foundation of its relations with the developed capitalist countries rests on the privileges  strictures and subterfuges of imperialism and neo-colonialism - the machinery that props up and promotes perpetuation of the system was set up during the era of colonial expansion. Their hegemony over the raw materials market  their virtual monopoly of the manufacture of goods  capital assets and the control of the international financial institutions have allowed them at will to impose their unfair terms of trade and to subjugate the evolution and the trends of international trade  which have been characterized by a discriminatory and obstructionist policy to the benefit of the great consortia and transnational corporations and to the grave detriment of the developing countries. Expansion of world trade in these conditions has therefore served primarily to lead to the undue enrichment of the highly developed capitalist countries at the expense  proportionally  of the impoverishment of the underdeveloped countries.44.	The time has come to unite our efforts until we enforce the sovereign right that we possess over our natural resources and thus replace the unjust and anachronistic international order in economic relations by the new international economic order which will encourage and strengthen the development and liberation of the third world. The maturity of our conscience now cries out for coherent action in the effort to reclaim what was ours  which we have determined to carry out without respite and without hesitation  in alliance with the democratic  progressive and socialist countries which share in the same battle. Fatherland or death! We shall prevail!"
"32",1749,"CYP",29,1974,"Mr. President  may I in the first place express to you my warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. We feel confident that under your wise guidance the deliberations of this Assembly will bring a constructive contribution to the solution of the various international problems. In your person we also greet your country  with which Cyprus maintains close links of friendship based on common ideals and purposes within non-alignment. I would likewise wish to express our deep appreciation to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  for the excellent way in which he guided the deliberations of the previous session.3.	I have had the privilege of addressing the General Assembly on previous occasions  but never before in circumstances such as now prevail  never before in an international situation so ominously removed from the fundamental principles upon which this Organization is based. And what is particularly odd is that we are now supposed to be in a period of detente.4.	The world has over the years been eagerly looking forward to a period of detente. The expectation has been that reducing antagonism and tension would lead to a more effective implementation of Security Council resolutions in the vital interest of international peace and security rather than in the opposite direction  as the world has silently but sadly witnessed in recent days. By saying this I do not in the least purport to make any criticism whatsoever. I am merely placing on record a melancholy reality that should not  and cannot  be glossed over in the United Nations or ignored by the international community without dire consequences for the further course of world developments at times so critical as the present. For we are in a period of delicate balance between the prevalence of the concept of the use of force and domination an outdated relic of the past and that of reason and peace so necessary for survival in our interdependent world of a nuclear age.5.	This is a trying period of transition. International events of major significance in their implications and message to the world should be carefully scrutinized by this Assembly. The United Nations is essentially a political institution  but there are times in history when human institutions  in confronting critical problems  have to give prominence to decisions of ethical quality. That ethical quality is but the gist of the principles of the Charter. Ignoring them through the pursuit of short-term parochial interests  in a return to outdated policies of obscurantism  would be an unrealistic pursuit of interest. It can ultimately only lead humanity through a downward course of moral degradation to its physical doom.6.	Upon Cyprus has fallen the sad lot to be a signal and a symbol in the course of mankind. Its treatment by the international community at the present cross-roads in history would be a decisive landmark in that course  whether upwards or downwards. Beyond the tragic fate of Cyprus  what is of wider significance and import is its intrinsic meaning to the world and the inevitable repercussions resulting from it. Thus the problem of Cyprus far transcends the limits and confines of Cyprus. It poses a major international problem and a challenge to the world.7.	An effort to cover up the international crime involving outworn political tactics of pressure to achieve unjust and ignominious compromises is far below the level of the present challenge  and will not serve any good purpose for Cyprus and its people as a whole; least of all will it serve the interest of peace.8.	It is customary  in addressing the General Assembly  to deal with the various international problems and issues. I hope I shall be excused if I deviate from this practice and confine myself to the problem of Cyprus  which has suddenly reached dimensions so ominous as to make it a grave and threatening problem in the area and beyond.9.	My country  a small non-aligned State Member of the United Nations  is at this moment mutilated and practically destroyed by an armed attack and invasion by Turkey  unprecedented in its ferocity and inhumanity.10.	It was about two months ago that I came to the Security Council to denounce the coup  engineered and staged against the legitimate Government of Cyprus by the military junta then ruling Greece. Officers from Greece serving with the Cyprus National Guard  acting on instructions from the military junta in Athens  on 15 July attacked and destroyed the Presidential Palace with heavy weapons  seeking my death. There is no doubt that I was the target of that criminal action. The coup d'etat by the Greek junta failed  inasmuch as it did not reach its target. I am gratified because that military regime  which for seven years oppressed the people of Greece and brought that State to international isolation and disrespect  is no longer in power. Thus Greece is again finding its way to democracy and national dignity.11.	The coup d'etat of the Greek junta was the prelude to the present tragedy in Cyprus. That evil was followed by another evil  and a much worse one. Turkey  using the coup as a pretext  and purportedly acting under the Treaty of Guarantee of 1960  intervened militarily in Cyprus in contravention of the Treaty itself by invading the island on 20 July. The Treaty did not and could not give such rights of military intervention as alleged by Turkey. Furthermore  the very nature and conduct of this military operation in Cyprus has been in direct violation of the declared purposes of the Treaty. For  instead of protecting the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus  as a guarantor Power  Turkey has been destroying both. It has embarked upon destroying what it itself guaranteed. Turkey alleged that the action it was taking was for the purpose of restoring the constitutional order that had been disturbed by the coup. I am under the impression that some countries did not raise their voice against the Turkish invasion at first because they were deceived by Turkey as to its real intentions. Turkey falsely stated that the action it was taking was of a limited nature. It spoke of a policing and even of a peace operation aiming solely at the restoration of the constitutional order. But what Turkey was in fact doing and continues to do in Cyprus has nothing to do with the restoration of constitutional order.12.	As a result of the Turkish invasion  Cyprus  a flourishing and happy island  has been turned into a place of ruins  tears and death. The Turkish invasion forces have occupied almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus and have uprooted from their homes over 200 000 people  constituting one third of the population of the country  who  having been forced to abandon their lands  have become refugees living in appalling conditions. The world has witnessed the ruthless showering of napalm bombs on undefended towns and villages  which has indiscriminately killed the civilian population in a fury of destruction. Even hospitals  churches and priceless ancient monuments were attacked and turned into ashes. Murder in cold blood  raping  looting and plunder were the daily practice during the advance of the Turkish troops. To find parallel examples of invasion with similar acts of brutality and destruction one has to go back to the fifth century A.D.  to the time of Attila  whose name has been aptly given to this invading operation by the aggressor itself. Festivities and demonstrations were organized in Turkey to mark and celebrate the victory of the Turkish forces against Cyprus and decorations and medals have been distributed to the chiefs of the air force and the navy for their victory against a small and defenseless island. Victory it is indeed but a victory against the international legal order  against the United Nations and its Charter and against every norm of decency in a civilized society.13.	Turkey has violated every accepted norm of international law and every accepted standard of international conduct. Its contemptuous behavior and complete disregard of the basic principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations is perhaps unprecedented.14.	The Security Council  by its resolution 353 (1974) of 20 July provided the framework for a peaceful solution to the problem and called upon the parties concerned to enter into negotiations. This resolution was also accepted by Turkey  which has  however  shown no respect for it. At the Geneva Conference attended by the United Kingdom  Greece and Turkey  as the guarantor Powers  and by the representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots  the Security Council resolution was completely ignored by Turkey. In Geneva  Turkey was not in fact negotiating but clearly trying to impose its terms at gun-point. With its troops in occupation of a great part of Cypriot territory  and relying on its overwhelming military superiority  Turkey was exercising blackmail to dictate its terms; and when a recess of 36 hours was proposed for consultations  it was refused by Turkey  which hastened within a few hours to embark upon the already prepared second and intensified phase of aggression against Cyprus  vastly increasing the occupied area. Turkey was thus violating even the cease-fire agreement it had signed on 30 July at Geneva.15.	It is very difficult to describe even in general terms the tragedy and the destruction caused by the Turkish aggression against Cyprus. The number of victims of that aggression was in proportionate terms greater than that of the victims of the many years of war in Viet Nam.16.	I cannot foresee where the drama of Cyprus may lead  if the international community finally fails to put an end to this aggression and if the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus are not effectively ensured. In no circumstances should the acquisition of territories by force be tolerated  nor can it confer upon the invader any vantage point  in negotiations or otherwise. Neither can fails accomplish resulting from military operations be accepted or condoned. If they were to be accepted or tolerated in the case of Cyprus  a most dangerous precedent would be set for other small countries  whose independence would be at the mercy of their more powerful neighbors. 17.	I have come here to seek the support of the international community in our struggle to save the independence  unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus. I am here for the cause of justice and the freedom of a small country  a Member of the United Nations. I bring to this Assembly the agony of the people of Cyprus for the survival of their country in freedom and dignity. We fully recognize the importance of greater understanding between the big Powers as improving the prospects of solution of world problems in accordance with the Charter  yet we feel we have to be skeptical regarding the fate of small countries within the sphere of power politics. We need to be convinced that detente does not imply compromising the interests and even the existence of smaller countries.18.	I shall not attempt to give interpretations of the underlying causes which led to the recent events in Cyprus. But what I have to emphasize is that  what-ever the cause and whatever the reason  there can be no justification for the Turkish aggression. The question before us is simple: Should the fate and the very existence of small countries be decided by gunboat diplomacy  by the use of force  by destruction  by uprooting people from their ancestral homes  without the United Nations being in a position to act? That is the problem of Cyprus today  and it is only natural for the people who suffer to wonder why we have placed our hopes in the United Nations and in the rules of international law and the precepts of international morality which the United Nations represents.19.	My position as to the solution of the problem of Cyprus is that such a solution must be based on the application of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations. In that connexion  I wish to stress that any negotiations on the problem will have to take place in a wider international conference than that of Geneva. We consider the proposal for an international conference within the framework of the United Nations as constructive and therefore acceptable to us. Certain prerequisites are  however  essential and will have to be fulfilled before negotiations are started. It is not possible to have free negotiations for a reasonable solution of the problem while Cypriot territory continues to be under foreign military occupation and while a third of the population are still refugees who have been forcibly expelled from their homes and lands. The return of the refugees is  from a humanitarian no less than a political point of view  a basic prerequisite.20.	Turkey has repeatedly declared that it is not its intention to abolish the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus; but while expressing that in words  it is by its acts doing just that  unless Turkey's interpretation of terms and concepts is different from that generally accepted. Turkey invaded Cyprus allegedly to restore constitutional order  that is  for the implementation of the Constitution of 1960. It is that Constitution which Turkey has guaranteed  together with Greece and the United Kingdom. Although the Constitution gives many privileges to the Turkish Cypriot community in such a way that some of its provisions impede the smooth functioning of the State yet it is still accepted by us as it stands. Any changes must be made with the consent of all concerned. What is peculiar is that Turkey is violating the very Constitution which  as it claims  has given it the right to intervene. It is obvious that the Turkish invasion was not intended to restore the constitutional order  as established by the Constitution of 3960  but to enforce Turkey's partitionist plans in violation of that Constitution.21.	At the Geneva Conference  Turkey made it clear that its aim was a federation based on geographical separation. It has tried for that purpose to create  through its devastating military operation  the geographical prerequisites for such a federation  which never existed in Cyprus. To that end  it has uprooted from the occupied area the Greek Cypriot population so that it may transfer and establish there Turkish populations  removing them from their homes in various parts of the island. Such a federation is not only artificial but also inhuman. It entails the transfer of about half of the population of Cyprus. About 200 000 Greek Cypriots and nearly 70 000 Turkish Cypriots will be removed from their homes and land. I am sure that not only the Greek Cypriots but also the great majority of the Turkish Cypriots would not be happy to abandon their homes and be transferred to other areas. What purpose is to be served by such an inhuman exercise to achieve the autonomy and security of the Turkish Cypriot community  as claimed by Turkey? These protestations and claims are nothing but pretexts for the expansionist designs of Turkey  closely reminiscent of the protestations and claims made by Hitler in order to invade Czechoslovakia. They also remind us of the methods employed by Turkey to annex Alexandretta. The autonomy and security of the small Turkish Cypriot minority of 18 per cent can in no way justify a geographical federation which ;n practice will mean the partition of Cyprus.22.	Turkey has declared that its purpose is not partition and that its military intervention was not to that end. Yet that partitionist aim of long standing has been repeatedly revealed over the years. On a previous occasion when Turkey was about to invade Cyprus  President Johnson  in a letter to Prime Minister Inonu of 5 June 1964  stated:""... I must call your attention  however  to our understanding that the proposed intervention by Turkey would be for the purpose of effecting a form of partition of the island  a solution which is specifically excluded by the Treaty of Guarantee.""23.	The attitude of Turkey on this subject can also be seen from the statement made to the Turkish National Assembly on 8 September of the same year by Prime Minister Inonu  who said  ""Officially  we promoted the federation concept  rather than the partition thesis  so as to remain within the provisions of the Treaty.""24.	Those quotations further confirm the tactical nature of the use of the word federation as an official camouflage of the intended partition.25.	There can hardly be any doubt that the geographical federation is intended and will inevitably lead to the partition of the island and consequently to double annexation that is  ore part to Turkey and the other to Greece. That will be the end of Cyprus as an independent State. Such a development may perhaps be favored by certain Powers in their own interests. Cyprus  because of the importance of its strategic position  has unfortunately frequently been the victim of foreign interests. 26.	No argument can justify the demand of Turkey for geographical federation  which would not only be inhuman but would also mean changing the identity of Cyprus. But what should be the answer if Turkey were to insist on geographical federation and by its military superiority were to impose it by force? Some who appear to be realists may advise that we should negotiate on the basis of geographical federation  indicating that in such a case  Turkey may show some flexibility as to the size of the area to be under Turkish control. There is some talk that the occupied area of 40 per cent might be reduced to something below 30 per cent. I do not think 1 should express any gratitude for such generosity by Turkey. Under no circumstances shall we negotiate so as to legalize the violation of the most basic principles of international law and human rights. Under no circumstances shall we agree to legalize any faits accomplis. Some may argue that if we do not accept geographical federation there is a danger that Turkey might attempt to occupy the rest of the island. It is  indeed  very easy for Turkey to conquer Cyprus. That danger will not  however  make us agree to legalize faits accomplis. What is unjust and immoral  such as the uprooting of populations  cannot be legalized. What is unjust and immoral cannot become just and moral by signing an agreement.27.	The problem of Cyprus may perhaps appear complicated but is in fact very simple. It is the case of a small country  a Member of the United Nations  whose very survival and existence are at stake. This in turn makes it a test case for the United Nations. It is not only we who are anxious to see what the Organization can do and how it can become effective in protecting one of its small Members. I am certain that many other countries will also be anxiously awaiting the answer. It is inconceivable that the United Nations  which represents the conscience of humanity  should tolerate an aggressor applying the rule of the jungle and by brute force creating faits accomplis. If the faits accomplis resulting from the Turkish aggression are to be accepted or condoned  the consequences will not be limited to Cyprus. The future of Cyprus is closely linked with future developments in the sensitive area of the Middle East and the whole of the Mediterranean. If Cyprus were not a non-aligned country  we perhaps might have allies to come to our defense. But the fact that we do not should not render us a victim of a Power  a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]  which has illegally used the arms supplied to it for its defense to attack Cyprus.28.	The case of Cyprus is a test case for non-alignment  and beyond that a test case for the United Nations. If the United Nations fails to make Turkey respect the Charter and its resolutions  the faith of the small countries in the United Nations will seriously be shaken. It is imperative that the Turkish troops and  indeed  all foreign troops  be withdrawn from Cyprus. This is the time for the United Nations to act. It is absolutely necessary not only for Cyprus but also for the United Nations and for mankind as a whole for the Organization to step in decisively and effectively  so that the territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus as a sovereign and independent State  Member of the United Nations  may be ensured and safeguarded.29.	Before concluding  I wish to avail myself of this occasion to express to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our gratitude for his abiding concern over the problem of Cyprus  his untiring efforts to bring about conditions of peace in the island  and his contribution towards a just solution within the principles of the Charter. I would also like to express our deep appreciation to his Special Representative in Cyprus  Mr. Weckmann-Munoz  as well his predecessor  Mr. Osorio-Tafall  for their constructive and patient work in the island. Our thanks are also extended to the collaborators and assistants of the Secretary-General  Mr. Guyer and Mr. Urquhart.30.	I would be remiss if I did not say how greatly we value and appreciate the exemplary manner in which the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus [UNFICYP] is discharging its responsibilities in the face of the great obstacles placed in its way and we pay tribute to its most able commander  General Chand  and to the officers and men under his command. At this moment  our thoughts go in deep sympathy and grief to those men of UNFICYP who  in the service of peace  lost their lives in Cyprus. And of course our appreciatijbn and warm thanks go to those countries whose Valuable contribution in military contingents and voluntary funds have made it possible for UNFICYP to operate in Cyprus."
"33",1817,"DDR",29,1974,"Mr. President  permit me to reiterate be fore this forum my congratulations to the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria on his election to the high office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly and to state in the name of the German Democratic Republic that this is a tribute to the high prestige of the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria in the world. We wish him much success in his responsible function.137.	Complex are the events which bear on the international situation and. the destinies of entire peoples. But the essential thing is that it has been possible  despite powerful counter-efforts  to advance international detente. This has not happened of its own accord. The efforts for the elimination and prevention of international conflicts  the cessation of the arms race  the liquidation of all forms of oppression of peoples  and the development of relations of peaceful coexistence need to be resolutely promoted.138.	The German Democratic Republic joined the United Nations one year ago. As a Member of the United Nations and as a State of the socialist community  it has been making every effort  in its bilateral relations  at the regional level and also in multi lateral organizations  to help carry out the peace program of the socialist States  which also is in harmony with the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and takes account of the interests of all peoples.139.	The foreign policy of the German Democratic Republic is aimed at safeguarding international peace and security  practicing solidarity with the peoples fighting for their national and social liberation  and making peaceful coexistence prevail between States with different social orders.140.	In conjunction with its allies  the German Democratic Republic works for the fruits of detente to be shared by all peoples. Therefore we support all efforts channeling conflicts towards a political settlement. The peoples desire the attainment of durable settlements of those problems which are poisoning the international climate and threatening peace and security. Hence one should not be content with what has been achieved. On the contrary  detente must be consolidated and extended to all regions of the world. This is  in the view of the Government of the German Democratic Republic  an extremely important and equally pressing task for the United Nations and one which the German Democratic Republic will help to carry out. 141.	In May 1975 it will be 30 years since the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition  and primarily of the Soviet Union  liberated the peoples from the cruel terrorist rule of German fascism. In those days of 1945 began the longest period of European peace in the history of this century. This fact corroborates the reality of a policy aimed at maintaining peace. To enable future generations also to live in peace  it will be necessary to further the detente initiated with the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin and with the treaties concluded by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  the Polish People's Republic  the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic with the Federal Republic of Germany. Inviolability of the territorial status quo and of existing borders  respect for the sovereignty of States  renunciation of the use of force and prohibition of interference in the internal affairs of other States should be normal and self-evident standards of conduct among States with different social systems in Europe. In this context it is imperative to implement this set of treaties and to defend it against those forces which tried to prevent the conclusion of the treaties and are now obstructing their implementation in letter and spirit. With the expansion ;of bilateral relations between States  the foundations"" that have been laid for detente can be broadened and reinforced. I need not emphasize that the German Democratic Republic is ready  now as before  to play its part.142.	From their experiences in the Second World War  the peoples have learned the lesson that it is only by way of equal and growing co-operation among all peace-loving nations that mankind will be able to achieve its loftiest aspiration: to maintain a secure and lasting peace. A post-war settlement along anti-Fascist and democratic lines was the hard core of the decisions and agreements reached by the principal Powers of the anti-Hitler coalition. On behalf of the German Democratic Republic  I can state here our view that with the great system of treaties that has come into being since 1970  a post-war settlement has been agreed which makes possible good co operation among the States and peoples. The decisive precondition of the progress which was reached on the road to detente in Europe and hailed by the peoples of the world was the definite recognition in terms of international law of the results of the Second World War and of post-war developments. Therefore  demands based on wishful thinking and reflecting outlived and yet dangerous ideas for changing the map of Europe are not at all helpful to European and international security.143.	As far as the national question on German soil is concerned  history settled it long ago. Freely exercising their right to self-determination  the people of the German Democratic Republic have once and for all chosen the socialist system of society. Today there are on German soil a socialist State  the German Democratic Republic  in which the socialist nation is developing  and the capitalist Federal Republic of Germany  in which the capitalist nation exists. Between socialist and capitalist States there can only be relations of peaceful coexistence  the principles of which can safely be assumed to be known everywhere.144.	The historic chance of living in peace is be coming more real with the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. An early and good conclusion of that Conference would therefore be in full harmony with the legacy of those who fought against fascism. In the light of present-day realities this would be the best contribution all European States could make  as the Charter of the United Nations says ""... to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind . . .""145.	Despite artificial obstacles  detente is being advanced also in other parts of the world. The Ger man Democratic Republic pays a particular tribute to the growing role the non-aligned countries have played  both inside and outside the United Nations  in removing international conflicts  strengthening international security and enforcing the right of peoples to self-determination. We are very happy to note that our traditionally friendly relations with those States are growing in strength.146.	Detente creates more favorable conditions for the just struggle of the Asian  African and Latin American peoples to gain national freedom  strength en their political independence and achieve their economic independence. This is borne out by developments.147.	The admission to the United Nations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh  a country with which we maintain friendly ties  is a clear indication that the situation on the subcontinent has improved.148.	The withdrawal of the foreign troops from South Korea as urged by the Democratic People's Re public of Korea is in the interest of the korean people and would have a favorable impact on security in Asia.149.	We are resolutely opposed to the permanent violations of the Paris Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam by the Saigon Administration and its foreign backers  and demand that it be strictly observed. The Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam is an equal party to the Paris negotiations and therefore has the incontestable right to participate without any discrimination in international co-operation  and this also within the framework of the United Nations.150.	The national liberation movement  supported by the solidarity of the socialist States and democratic forces all over the world  has achieved great success in liquidating the remnants of colonialism. It is in this sense that we view Grenada's admission to the world Organization. Another case in point is the admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations. Bonds of friendship and active solidarity link us with the people of Guinea-Bissau. The overthrow of the Fascist regime in Portugal and the new Government's commitment to the right of peoples to self- determination should make it easier for this session of the General Assembly to adopt effective measures aimed at eliminating all forms of colonial and racist oppression.151.	During the session of the Special Committee against Apartheid held in Berlin  capital of the German Democratic Republic  last May  the States of the socialist community  their citizens and mass organizations convincingly manifested their firm determination to strengthen their solidarity with the peoples of southern Africa. An end must be put to racist terrorism in all its forms. Acting in this spirit  the German Democratic Republic signed and ratified the Inter national Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII)  annex] immediately after it was adopted.152.	It is gratifying to point to the substantial progress in creating a more healthy international climate. But the opponents of detente are far from laying down their arms. While they could not reverse the trend  their incessant attempts to create new hotbeds of international tension and maintain existing ones  to fuel the arms race and defend colonialist and neo-colonialist oppression require not just close attention but resolute resistance on the part of the United Nations also.153.	Is not the attempt to abolish the sovereignty of Cyprus a very striking example?154.	Together with the other socialist States and the non-aligned countries  the German Democratic Republic stands for vigorous action by the United Nation's  to maintain the non-aligned status of Cyprus  to restore constitutional order  to have all foreign troops withdrawn and to establish an effective system of guarantees.155.	If effect were given to the proposal of the Soviet Government to convene an international conference within the framework of the United Nations  in which Cyprus  Greece  Turkey and all States members of the Security Council would participate  and in which other countries  specifically non-aligned countries  could also be involved  this would be the best way of achieving a settlement satisfactory to the vital interests of the Greek and Turkish population of Cyprus and the security requirements of all peoples. In accordance with the primary responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council under the Charter for the maintenance and safeguarding of international peace  these States should as contained in the Soviet proposal to convene the conference provide the required guarantees of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and of compliance with the decisions the planned conference on Cyprus will be taking.156.	Despite growing protests by world public opinion  the military junta in Chile is carrying on with the cruel suppression  tortures and assassination of upright patriots  in brutal violation of human rights. It has so far ignored the appeals of the Secretary-General and the President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Its actions create a dangerous source of tension in Latin America and challenge international public opinion as a whole. This twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly should vigorously demand the restoration of human rights and democratic freedoms in Chile.157.	The settlement of the Middle East conflict is now sought by political means. The German Democratic Republic welcomes this. But  unfortunately  a durable peace settlement is still outstanding. The delegation of the German Democratic Republic is in favor of the immediate reconvening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East so that a stable settlement of this issue on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) can be achieved. The German Democratic Republic has always supported the Arab peoples in their struggle against the permanent Israeli aggression and its consequences and will do so in future.158.	The German Democratic Republic comes out in support of securing the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine. My Government supports the demand of the Palestine Liberation Organization and of the Arab States that the question of Palestine should be considered at this year's session of the General Assembly.159.	The relations between the Soviet Union and the United States are of particular weight in inter national affairs. The Soviet Union has set in motion the reshaping of the Soviet-American relationship  and has thereby made the decisive contribution to ending the era of ""cold war"" and confrontation.160.	Those who invented the theory of the so- called super-Powers have  from generally known selfish motives of great-Power chauvinism  given the Soviet Union's relations with the United States an arbitrary interpretation of their own. But nobody can deny the plain truth that the evolution of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States on the basis of peaceful coexistence is essential to the maintenance of world peace and hence serves the interests of all peoples. The period of the ""cold war"" and the imperialist strategy of ""war brink man-ship"" have not fallen into oblivion. It is the fundamental improvement in international relations which highlights the specific weight of the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.161.	Conditions have improved for the United Nations to work in the interest of international security  disarmament  the liquidation of colonialism and racism  of international co-operation among States on a basis of equality. At the same time  the activities of the opponents of detente underscore the need for the United Nations to make a greater contribution to the normalization of the international situation.162.	Is it not a proved practice to make regular reviews of how decisions that have been taken are carried out? The delegation of the German Democratic Republic would therefore be in favor of a thorough analysis of how the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security  adopted in 1970 [resolution 2734 (XXV)}  is being implemented. This would also meet the demand for the increased effectiveness of the work of the United Nations.163.	It is the policy of the German Democratic Republic  just as it is of many other States  to pro mote detente in Europe  to urge that it should be extended to the whole world and be complemented by military detente  and to demand the implementation of the right of peoples to self-determination and of the principles of peaceful coexistence in the relations among States with different social orders. Should it not be a paramount aim for this General Assembly to adopt further measures to fulfill the Declaration of 1970? As is known  the socialist States proceed from the fact that effective measures towards military detente  armaments limitation and dis armament are indispensable to promoting political detente  and vice versa. Arms expenditures are an unbearable burden on the working people. In many countries the corporations producing arms exacerbate the effects of the objective crisis. Vast human and material resources in science and technology are withheld from peaceful  productive work for the benefit of the people. Scientists in the German Democratic Republic have estimated that almost 50 per cent of the scientific and technological intelligentsia in the principal countries of NATO are directly or indirectly engaged in the development of weapon systems. The arms race  that material preparation of war  is threatening international detente.164.	There is still time to halt that disastrous development. There are constructive proposals to this end. We second the initiative of the Soviet Union to request the inclusion in the agenda of the item entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human well-being and health"". The draft resolution^ submitted by the Soviet Union on this item [AlO.l/L.675] has the undivided support of the German Democratic Republic. It is of great importance in both its current and future relevance. We must not allow the achievements of science and technology ever to be used again for the physical destruction of human beings and material resources. We hold that the Soviet proposal is realistic and directly combines measures for international security with action to protect man and his environment.165.	For a long time there has been an urgent need to convene a world disarmament conference. This twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly could very well proceed from the results so far reached and begin speedy preparations for the conference. We cannot agree with the unsubstantiated argument repeatedly put forward by some States that the time is not ripe for such a conference.166.	Progress in the fields of disarmament and arms limitation is indispensable to remove the sword of Damocles of a nuclear world war  to strengthen the mutual confidence of States in declared peaceful intentions  and to give all States the opportunity to participate in the solution of a fundamental question of international development affecting their vital interests. In this connexion  the delegation of the German Democratic Republic wishes to recall the urgent need to implement the resolution adopted at the twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly on the non-use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)].167.	It is in the very nature of things that the ever greater expenditures for military purposes stand in the way of solutions to pressing economic and social problems and also affect economic  scientific and technological assistance to the developing countries.168.	As we did at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  we point once more to the resolution on the reduction of military expenditures of the permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent which was proposed by the Soviet Union and adopted at the past session of the General Assembly [resolution 3098 (XXVIII)]. We reaffirm our opinion that the resolution should be speedily carried out. The position of certain forces which refuse or delay the implementation of that United Nations resolution is  to say the least  highly regret table.169.	The lofty aims of the Charter of the United Nations are international law. The Charter constitutes a stable foundation for developing peaceful  good-neighborly relations between States. It has stood the test  not least as an instrument of the peoples' struggle against imperialist and colonial oppression.170.	Important social changes have taken place in the world in the 30 years since the Charter came into force. International relations have been reorganized for the better. Yet the purposes of the Charter are far from being fulfilled. From all this we believe one can draw but one conclusion: that it is necessary to ensure that the principles of the Charter become fully effective in international affairs. In particular  the fundamental principle of the unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council has proved to be an instrument of the necessary constructive co-operation of the States concerned in the interest of peace. Do we have a right to do away with reliable instruments? The growing normalization of the international situation and a closer co operation among States of necessity increases the interlacing of political  military  economic  cultural and scientific problems of an international character. From this angle  too  proved instruments of inter national co-operation are indispensable.171.	To develop fully and intensify such co-operation is possible only on a solid political foundation. That conditions of international detente are propitious for tackling burning questions of global interest has been demonstrated by the sixth special session of the General Assembly  the Third United Na tions Conference on the Law of the Sea at Caracas and the World Population Conference at Bucharest. In this connexion  we believe the power of the United Nations lies  above all  in its contributions towards a strict implementation of the Charter in all spheres of inter-State relations.172.	The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order makes clear the close interrelation between the strengthening of inter national security and the development of economic relations between States on a basis of equality. We welcome the fact that the Declaration has reaffirmed the obligation to respect strictly the principle of the sovereign equality of States and their right to dispose of their own natural resources without external interference as much as we are pleased that it has endorsed the right to nationalize such resources. We think it is fully justified and appropriate that the activities of transnational corporations should be brought more into the limelight  since they not only make enormous profits by exploiting other peoples but also interfere in the internal affairs of States and consequently create international conflicts.173.	The German Democratic Republic has always conducted its relations with the developing countries on the basis of the principles specified in the aforementioned Declaration. It has been a guiding rule of its foreign relations to have regard to the developing countries' needs as widely as possible. Therefore  the German Democratic Republic is orienting its growing trade with these countries towards encouraging imports of raw materials and finished and semi-finished products from them.174.	As far as its exports to those countries are concerned  the German Democratic Republic gives priority to the delivery of complete plants  efficient machines and agricultural equipment which aid the process of industrialization and raise the efficiency of agricultural production. It seeks a rapid and continuous growth of its trade turnover with developing countries. And  by delegating experts  advisers  specialists and instructors  we want to contribute towards the implementation of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.175.	If we take a look at international economic relations as a whole  the alarming developments which were also emphasized in the recent World Economic Survey  1973 are only too evident. The trend toWards a deepening structural crisis in the capitalist countries which the survey has noted affects  above all  the developing countries. This is why the delegation of the German Democratic Re public is in favor of effective measures to combat this crisis.]76. By contrast  economic integration within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is developing expeditiously and becoming increasingly effective for the individual members of the Council. This evolution has a bearing on high increases in labor productivity and continuously high rates of growth of production and secures price stability. This is what makes the external economic relations of these countries so dependable and stable.177.	In a few days' time  the people of the German Democratic Republic will be celebrating the twenty- fifth anniversary of the founding of their socialist State. The viability of the German Democratic Re public was frequently questioned. However  thanks to its close co-operation with the Soviet Union and the other States of the socialist community  and thanks to the industrious and creative work of its people  the German Democratic Republic has been and is successful in building socialism.178.	These 25 years have  at the same time  been the contribution of a quarter of a century to the struggle for the strengthening of international security  solidarity with the peoples fighting for their national and social liberation  and active support for peaceful coexistence between States with different social systems.179.	The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany  Erich Ho- necker  recently stated that our foreign policy has always been and will remain a policy in support of all those who strive to strengthen peace and of all peoples fighting for their freedom and independence.180.	In this spirit the delegation of the German Democratic Republic is going to contribute to the successful course of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly."
"34",1835,"DEU",29,1974,"Mr. President  let me begin by congratulating you warmly on your election to this high and responsible office. Your unanimous election is proof of the confidence placed in you and in your country and of the certainty that you will make this particularly important General Assembly session a success. To these congratulations I should like to add our sincere thanks to your predecessor  Ambassador Benites. We were very happy to be able to begin our co-operation in the United Nations under his wise and experienced leadership.36.	I also wish to welcome most warmly the three new Members: Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea- Bissau. We are looking forward to co-operating closely and trustfully with these countries in the framework of our Organization.37.	The twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly is being held against a background of international events and developments which must be regarded as a challenge to political reason. We share the deep concern that permeates the introduction to the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization despite intensive efforts to achieve detente  the number of conflicts involving the use of force is not on the decline; the global network of economic relations is in many places damaged  in some already torn: there is a shortage of raw materials  a struggle over prices; inflation and monetary fluctuations are driving us towards a crisis; the economic situation in some parts of the world has continued to deteriorate dramatically; hunger is still spreading. There are still people who are denied their elementary rights; the gap between the proclamation and the realization of human rights continues to be unbearably wide. Many people no longer believe that their problems can be settled by mutual agreement. This feeling of desperation not only breeds resignation and fatalism; it also generates action that is unjustifiable from any point of view  acts of individual terrorism in the shadow of which no country can feel safe - a terrorism that also leaves its mark on countries not involved.38.	But our chief concern must be to prevent any further breaking up of international solidarity and to reverse the process of disintegration.39.	The Federal Republic of Germany has gone through certain experiences which distinguish it from many other countries represented  here and which determine the nature of our participation in the work of this great world Organization. With your permission I will mention those experiences  in order to illustrate that what we need today is not less but more international solidarity.40.	The Federal Republic of Germany emerged from a separation into states of the indivisible German nation. We are therefore more deeply conscious than others of the fact that States  however great may be their need for existence  are imperfect entities. Our citizens are less inclined to think in terms of nation-States  to regard their Government and their political institutions as the source of all wisdom and to believe that those institutions alone can cope with the massive problems inherent in the pursuit of peace  freedom  human dignity and welfare. We therefore view with concern the re-emerging tendency in some parts of the world to overrate oneself as a nation and the attempts of some countries to increase their prosperity at the expense of their neighbors' procedure that has always resulted in the weakening of all. The Federal Republic of Germany therefore trains its policy on the objective of European unity. We are convinced that only a united Europe can effectively solve the existing political  economic and social problems confronting the member States of our Community. That Community is also willing to share responsibility for solving problems beyond its frontiers; the more closely it is knit together  the more it will be able to do in this respect. This morning [2238th meeting] my French colleague mentioned the request for the granting to the European Community of observer status in the United Nations. This request is further proof of a determination of the European Community to co-operate actively in the solution of world-wide tasks.41.	The other experience of the Germans has been that force  rather than solving problems  in fact makes them all that much more difficult to settle. Once reconciliation had been achieved with the neighbors in western Europe  especially with the French people  the Federal Government under the then Chancellor  Willy Brandt  and under my predecessor and now Federal President  Walter Scheel  concluded agreements on the renunciation of force with those countries from which we have been separated by a sorrowful past characterized by force and conflict. The Federal Government and I can say this also on behalf of all responsible political forces in the Federal Republic of Germany bases itself on the principle of the renunciation of force. As the United Nations Charter expressly lays down  peoples may and should  in the exercise of their free self-determination  manage their own affairs. This also implies  in our view  that divided countries may reunite if that is their own free decision and that nations may join supranational communities. But if force enters into the conduct of international relations  then it will be the seed from which ever more conflict and violence will spring  and consequently will be the source of distress  want and disaster.42.	Both these experiences  the imperfection of our States and the senselessness of force  have led the Federal Republic of Germany of necessity on to the road taken by this world Organization. Only by means of a well-structured international order can the people in our State systems find the framework within which they feel confident they can live in security.43.	On behalf of my country I speak up for the form of co-operation embracing all mankind  the most important model of which is the United Nations  a form of co-operation which  though it is certainly a laborious and tedious way  is the only worthy one and promises to be more successful in the end. Peace  freedom  human dignity  welfare and a reliable system of international relations are indivisible.44.	Today more than at any other time in the past it is the political will for co-operation that counts. The international institutions cannot be stronger than that political will. This is a question not merely of being willing to play a constructive part in bringing about international treaties  but also of being resolved to comply with them.45.	This is the prerequisite for the working of that new form of international relations the development of which has governed the period since the Second world war which  we may hope  will also have been the last world war. It is a precondition which will have to be established in all countries  but not only on the part of governments.46.	I am deeply convinced that it is also the individual citizen in our countries who will have to develop a willingness to act in a way which I have tried to describe as international solidarity. The problems that have been the subject of United Nations conferences in past months and will be the subject of other conferences in the months ahead for instance those on commodity and developing problems  population trends  the use of the high seas  and the world food problems are matters which concern every individual. A government's sense of the common responsibility and its willingness to play a constructive part in resolving these problems depend on the degree of understanding of their peoples.47.	International co-operation in its multifarious forms has created a framework within which it has been possible to bring about extraordinary changes in the world in the past two and a half decades. Let me mention only two of those changes: the process of liberating the former colonial nations which is reflected most strikingly in this very Assembly where the original 51 members have now become 138; and the development by the United Nations of a peace-creating and peace-preserving policy  which has helped prevent the spread of local and regional conflicts.48.	Increasingly  doubts are being voiced today about those same international rules and organizations whose often quiet work in the background has made such developments at all possible.49.	On behalf of the Federal Government I would like to state the following.50.	We want to strengthen the United Nations and enhance its possibilities of action. Whatever its imperfections  there is no alternative to the United Nations. Those who have the peaceful development of mankind at heart must support it.51.	The tasks of the many regional groupings are complementary to the universal tasks of the United Nations. For us  the standing of the United Nations is not in any way lowered because of the fact that we are a member of a defense alliance  and that  together with others  we seek political and economic union in Europe. This diversity of international groupings is commensurate with the diversity of international relations. This pattern is useful as long as no organization turns against others and as long as all respect the rules we have all agreed upon within this widest framework. My country will abide by both these principles.52.	Organizations are the work of men and  as such  imperfect; moreover  times and problems change. For the Federal Republic of Germany there is no reason to question the foundations of the existing international order. Rather  we have to develop its rules and institutions and adapt them to the new requirements  Let us join in studying all aspects of the United Nations system and considering where the Organization itself or the rules upon which it is based can be improved and its problems thus resolved. The Federal Republic of Germany will assist in such a review in the same spirit in which it is seeking within other organizations  especially GATT and IMF  to bring about an organic reform of the international system.53.	We shall have to examine very closely the forms of international co-operation we have developed to see whether they are suited to removing the causes of the crises that have arisen in many parts of the world. In the United Nations Charter the solution of world-wide economic  social and humanitarian problems receives the same priority as the aim of safeguarding peace. Both realms are indivisible. We know that peace is more than a state in which fighting may have stopped for a while. An international economic order embracing the principle of equality and partnership in trade relations also will in itself help to safeguard peace.54.	Those who still doubt the need for rapid action will have had their eyes opened by developments in the past 12 months. The prices of many major primary commodities have escalated in hitherto unknown proportions; energy prices have risen vertically. You all know the consequences: alarming balance-of-payments deficits on the one hand; vast surpluses on the other. This has piled plenty of additional fuel on the fire of world-wide inflation. Data which had served as a valid basis for economic planning were called into question overnight. In many countries there is a growing feeling of uncertainty in the face of an economic trend which appears less calculable than ever in the past. The consequences affect all. The difficulties facing the industrial countries are considerable  but they are not to be compared with those of the least developed countries  which are lacking in natural resources and whose very existence is threatened. We have to tighten our belts  but for them it is a question of survival.55.	This is a challenge which does not distinguish between different systems: it affects all nations  rich and poor  developing and industrialized.56.	I place very much weight on this point. An exacerbation of the conflict of interests between commodity-producing and industrialized countries not only creates problems between those directly concerned  but also strikes first and most tellingly at third countries. This kind of situation results in new tensions  and many countries would be sorely tempted to try to save their own skins without consideration for others. Let us guard against such a temptation.Terrible experiences of the past have taught us that seeking refuge in economic isolationism does not remove the difficulty. On the contrary  world economic relations are so intertwined that action which is felt to be egotistical is bound to produce counter-measures. Consequently  the ""every man for himself' approach leads straight to economic chaos and creates tensions between States and their peoples. What we want is just the opposite: we want to remove existing disparities  especially the gulf between developing and industrialized countries; we want to quell further conflicts; and we want to avoid the situation of some being entirely dependent on others. To achieve this aim we shall have to bring about a world-wide improvement of our economic and social structures; we shall have to boost productivity and encourage sensible growth without neglecting the task of protecting the environment a task which has lost none of its urgency since the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in 1972. When the commodity-producing countries seek to obtain higher market prices for their raw materials  they must be assured that there will be no excessive price fluctuations in the commodity markets. At the same time  we must seek to ensure long-term supplies of those commodities. But in the interest of all we must make sure that the bigger proceeds from energy and raw materials are reasonably used and thus fed back into the international economy. The money should be used where it is most urgently needed.57.	We are prepared to help find solutions  both regional and world-wide  that will prevent any threats to the international monetary system.58.	At the sixth special session of the General Assembly last April the important dialog on world-wide economic problems was begun. We shall have to continue that dialog with much patience and resolution and with a good sense of judgment. No one will benefit from decisions that are not supported by all the world's major trading partners; no one will benefit from resolutions that question the world economic order based on division of labor and freedom of trade or that represent an attempt to replace such an order by a system of global dirigisme.59.	True  the present world economic system is not without defects and weaknesses. We must therefore develop it still further  improve it and adapt it to the needs of all nations. The Federal Republic of Germany has made specific contributions towards this end and is willing to carry on along this road.60.	We appreciate the need for the industrial countries to make their markets more accessible to products from the less-developed countries. The European Community  of which my country is a member  has been catering to this need for a good number of years by granting general tariff preferences. It is currently negotiating a comprehensive system of mutual economic relations with 44 African Caribbean and Pacific countries.61.	The Federal Government supports co-operative projects also by private companies in developing countries. It is trying by appropriate measures to steer investment activities towards the least-developed countries.62.	In recent years the Federal Government has constantly increased the share of its development aid that goes to those countries that are in special need of international solidarity  and it will continue to do so.63.	The Federal Republic of Germany has declared its readiness to provide  as a member of the European Community  a substantial contribution towards the emergency operation of the United Nations for the benefit of the most seriously affected countries  as soon as  the other countries involved have agreed to play a corresponding part.64.	The Federal Republic of Germany is taking part in the fight against hunger in the world and in efforts to solve the world food crisis. Within the European Community  too  our contributions are sizable. We help supply fertilizers. The President of the United States of America [2234th meeting] and his Secretary of State [2238th meeting] have rightly re-emphasized before this Assembly the importance of this problem.65.	Higher commodity prices and the problems they entail confront us with tremendous economic difficulties. Nevertheless  the Federal Government will make special efforts to continue to ^increase its development aid. In the years ahead it intends to increase that aid at a higher percentage rate than the national budget as a whole. For 1975 this has already been decided. Multilateral aid will continue to feature prominently in our development-assistance program.66.	We are making efforts to increase and intensify exchanges in the field of science and technology. All countries should have access to the scientific and technological resources of this world  so as to become more and more able to solve their problems on their own. This  too  is the aim of our projects in the sphere of educational aid. We welcome the idea of a United Nations conference on science and technology  and we shall do our best to encourage the promotion of that project.67.	Last year's events have once again thrown into relief the interdependence of the world economy and have made clear to us how sensitive the complex economic mechanisms of highly developed countries are. Even their capacity has its limits. Their economies can function only under their own laws  and domestic stability plays a great role in this. Only countries with a well-functioning economy can be good trading partners to developing countries; only they can help and  over the long term  attend to the problems of others beyond their own frontiers. Industrial countries with economies shaken by inflation are bound to lose in efficiency.68.	Hence  the results of the Federal Republic of Germany's consistent policy of domestic stability benefit others as well.69.	We are aware that the solution of economic and social problems is possible only When the political prerequisites are there  the most important being an ail-out effort to ensure peace. This task remains^ the prime mission of the United Nations. We can note with satisfaction that in many parts of the world hard work is being done to eliminate conflicts and tensions. To encourage and support those efforts is important.	70.	With regard to peace and security  the obvious cases today are two areas whose conflicts have a direct bearing on us Europeans particularly; they are the Middle East and Cyprus. The conclusion of the disengagement agreements in the Middle East has generated new hopes for a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the conflict.71.	Such initial steps must be followed by others  in order to establish an equitable and lasting peace ensuring the existence of all States and peoples in that region while taking into consideration the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. The progress; made so far is an indication that even among the parties to the conflict the conviction has grown that a genuine solution can be attained by peaceful means only. The Federal Republic of Germany welcomes this development  in which the efforts made by the Secretary of State of the United States  Mr. Kissinger  played a decisive part.72.	Peace in the Middle East will set free powerful forces that can be harnessed to the reconstruction and development of the whole eastern and southern Mediterranean areas. The Federal Republic of Germany and its European partners will not fail to co-operate. By initiating a European-Arab dialog  the nine members of the Community have already laid the first foundations for that great task.73.	The Federal Government most deeply deplores the recent events in Cyprus with its tragic consequences for the country and its people. We hope that those involved in the conflict will succeed soon in finding a negotiated settlement securing the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and restoring to that country external and internal peace.74. Both in the Middle East and in Cyprus the United Nations used its instruments to help in the efforts to bring about a cease-fire and make negotiations possible. I wish in this connexion to emphasize the valuable work done by Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim  to whom we owe appreciation and gratitude.75.	We thank the soldiers of the peace-keeping forces for their dedication in the service of the United Nations  and we pay a tribute to those who gave their lives in that service.76.	The Federal Republic of Germany recognizes the important functions of the peace-keeping forces and has therefore been supporting the actions in the Middle East and Cyprus by voluntary additional contributions. The efficiency and possibilities of action of the United Nations forces could be further enhanced if we succeeded in agreeing on general guidelines for peace-keeping operations. We should increase our efforts to bring about such an agreement.77.	What concrete contribution can we make to an active peace policy? The foreign policy of the Federal Republic of Germany is geared to furthering detente. Detente in itself will not remove existing differences  nor automatically provide more security. But the policy of detente is an effective instrument in the efforts to eliminate old conflicts and prevent the emergence of new ones and it is only.in an atmosphere of detente that efforts at arms limitation and arms control with due regard to security interests will make any sense at all.78.	The Federal Government includes in its policy of detente the most difficult and burning problem prevailing in Germany itself the division of our country with all its painful consequences for the people. I wish to repeat what the Federal Government made clear at the twenty-eighth session [2119th meeting] from this rostrum. We cannot and will not accept the division as history's final dictum on the German nation. That dictum will be spoken by the German people themselves. The Federal Government sticks to its policy of working for a state of peace in Europe in which the German people will regain its unity in free self-determination.79.	This does not prevent us  however  from exhausting the full measure of co-operation attainable in the  circumstances. This  our policy  has paved the way for contractually  settled relations with the other German State  the German Democratic Republic. It has since been seen that co-operation between the States of a divided country in the United Nations is possible despite fundamental differences of political views  that it is beneficial for all  andI should think for the world Organization too.80.	Detente in Europe had to begin Where differences clashed their hardest.  that is  in Berlin. The Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin of 3 September 1971 opened the way. Hence  one of the criteria by which to measure detente is the manner in which that Agreement works in all its parts. Berlin's secure future is an indispensable element of detente in Europe  and it remains a vital interest of our policy.81.	The Federal Republic of Germany wants to see the policy of detente effectively continued. It is in this spirit that the Federal Government cooperates actively and constructively in the Geneva Conference on Security arid Co-operation in Europe and in the Vienna Talks on Mutual Reduction of Forces and Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. We do not seek advantages benefiting just one side; we seek a way that will facilitate the coexistence of nations on the crowded European continent  and it is our hope that these conferences will bring us nearer the time when  in Europe  a highly armed East and West will no longer confront each other.82.	We cannot and will not reconcile ourselves to the thought that the arms race in which not only the great Powers participate is being carried on and on. The economic resources of mankind must increasingly be used to put an end to hunger and misery in the world  but they should be concentrated on that task now  not after there has been a winner in the arms race.83.	That is why I feet that  even more that hitherto  we must seek practical  controlled measures of disarmament and arms control. As before  the Federal Republic of Germany is determined to contribute actively to this. Disarmament and arms control are an integral part of our policy. We are prepared to assume additional responsibility also in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and are certain that we will have an opportunity to do so in the near future.84.	In this connexion I wish to underline the great importance which we attach to the policy of the non- proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Federal Republic of Germany intends to participate in the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons scheduled for 1975. It hopes that this will provide it with another opportunity to help oppose anything that might jeopardize the policy of non-proliferation.85.	In this General Assembly the Federal Republic of Germany focuses its special attention on three sets of problems of world-wide co-operation  namely  the strengthening of the international order and its institutions; the improvement of international economic relations in the spirit of partnership and solidarity; and concrete contributions to detente and disarmament with a view to ensuring a lasting peace. It does so in the awareness of  and with respect for  the expectations  the wishes  the hopes and longings of the people of the German nation and all other nations. All our endeavors are ultimately aimed at enhancing the welfare of each individual human being.86.	This idea leads us to a central aspect of the United Nations work to which this General Assembly should also devote its full attention. I mean the question of individual human rights  of the protection of the individual within the community  and I should like to warn against the illusion that it would suffice to guard the outward order by outward means against war and destruction. What we need is not just the formal recognition of human rights but also their universal acceptance and application so as to endow the outward measures for the preservation of peace with inner firmness and the power of conviction.87.	These are elementary rights which must be respected and applied all over the world: in Europe and I mean all parts of Europe less than on other continents.88.	We expect that the entry into force of the two International Covenants on Human Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)] which the Federal Republic of Germany ratified in December 1973 will spark off fresh impulses.89.	As a new member of the Commission on Human Rights  we want to co-operate responsibly in that body's efforts to give effect to human rights. We want to help and do our best to ensure that the individual shall be protected both from arbitrary treatment by the State and from want  and that population groups shall be protected from discrimination on racial  religious  political and other grounds.90.	We welcome the decision of the Commission on Human Rights and its bodies to prepare studies on the subject of self-determination. The rights of self-determination is a regulative principle to be applied not only in the sphere of decolonization or to one particular continent but in all parts of the world.91.	Self-determination and human rights are the central issues at stake also in southern Africa. The problems of decolonization and the elimination of racial discrimination in that region will again be occupying the attention of this General Assembly. We have left no doubt about our attitude; we demand that any remaining colonialism be eliminated. We condemn all forms of racial discrimination. We can note today with satisfaction that since the last session of the General Assembly fundamental changes have begun.92.	We welcome Portugal's historic decision to recognize the independence of Guinea-Bissau and to open the road to independence for Mozambique and Angola. We see in this a confirmation of our view that courage  energy and wisdom can solve these problems too.93.	The guarantee of individual human rights  the total ban on racism in any form or place  and the achievement of the self-determination of nations are tasks which my people  prompted not the least by its own historic experience  would like to help to accomplish sincerely and energetically.94.	In his treatise Of Eternal Peace  written in 1795  the German philosopher Immanuel Kant  whose two hundred and fiftieth birthday we celebrate this year  drew up principles for international co-operation. These universal aims are also pursued by the United Nations. The principles which this Organization established for international coexistence almost three decades ago are today sure of world-wide recognition. However  white solemn declarations and resolutions are a good thing  we must do more. It will be the task of the General Assembly at the present session to give practical impetus  to point the way for our future work  so that by concrete measure seven if they are only small steps ahead we come nearer to achieving the aims of the United Nations. At the end of this session of the General Assembly we shall be judged by the progress we have made along this path."
"35",1939,"DNK",29,1974,"Mr. President  it is a great pleasure for me on behalf of my Government and personally to congratulate you on your election as President of the twenty ninth session of the General Assembly.15.	We congratulate not only you as President on this honor and this confidence that have thus been placed in you personally  but also your country  Algeria. The place of your country and your own personal place in the field of international cooperation will make it greatly possible for you during your presidency to initiate those progressive  conciliatory  and mediating activities upon which the success of our General Assembly depends..16.	In his interesting report on the work of the Organization [A/9601 and Add.I]  the Secretary General has made it quite clear that this session of the General Assembly is of particular significance. Our attention this year must be focused on the danger of a recession in the industrialized countries  on the new possibilities for cooperation between industrialized and developing nations  and on the urgent need for emergency assistance to the countries most seriously affected by the economic crisis.17.	The United Nations must be prepared to keep abreast of rapidly and radically changing problems. At the same time  nations must be ready to meet new challenges. We must all realize the steadily growing interdependence of nations. The traditional grouping of countries is undergoing changes. International solidarity has become indispensable for an increasing number of countries.18.	The past year has seen sharp changes in international price relationships. The rate of inflation rose steeply. Balance of payments difficulties are threatening a great many countries. The deliberations of this General Assembly on economic and social problems are taking place against the background of fears of a world economic recession unprecedented in the history of this Organization. If we allow the situation to become further aggravated  the whole world will stand to lose.19.	Not only a feeling of solidarity  but also far sighted self-interest should inspire the wealthier nations to contribute to the promotion of economic progress in the less fortunate countries. These countries  for their part  must recognize that stable economic growth in the developed countries is a sine qua non for the expansion of world trade and  in turn  for the economic development of the developing countries.20.	At the sixth special session of the General Assembly I stated from this rostrum [2218th meeting] that  in the view of the Danish Government  changes in relative prices are not only acceptable but necessary if technological and economic progress in all parts of the world is to continue.21.	But at the same time I warned against substantial price changes over short periods. Industries need time to adapt techniques to changed circumstances  Only by taking these factors into account can we hope to accomplish our aim of a more equitable distribution of resources among the peoples of the world at a steadily increasing level of wealth.22.	The present economic difficulties of countries like mine cannot  of course  be compared to those of a number of countries of the third world  where people are often wanting the most basic amenities of life. However  being heavily dependent on foreign trade  including imports of most raw materials  Denmark is also faced with very real problems that are especially hard to solve for a small country with an even distribution of income and with a democratic political system.23.	In Denmark we are striving to adjust ourselves to the hew economic situation. *We have just made a substantial change in the economy of our public sector by reducing our income taxes by 7 000 million Danish kroner a year  which corresponds to about 25 per cent  and at the same time reducing public expenditure by about 7 000 million Danish kroner. We know that to overcome the present situation the active part of the Danish population will have to work harder and more effectively to maintain the present standard of living. We have in fact been able to make this drastic cut in public expenses without changing the Danish development policy or the amount to be allocated to development assistance. We will continue  to the best of our ability  to maintain the high level of our contributions to multilateral development organs. We recognize that long term assistance provided by industrial countries is the type of aid with which developing countries can best improve their economies and raise the standard of living of their people. It is our sincere hope that these efforts will not be undermined by policies leading to a contraction of economic activities in other industrial countries. Finally  the need for assistance in emergencies must certainty be recognized. As a member of the European Economic Community  Denmark will participate in the planned contribution by the Community to the developing countries most seriously affected by the economic crisis.24.	By organizing a series of worldwide conferences on economic and social problems  the United Nations has provided a framework for shaping new policies in international development cooperation. These conferences present unique opportunities which we must utilize. We must endeavor to understand the problems facing other Governments and the limitations set for their freedom of action. We must recognize that only widely accepted recommendations can lead to workable and lasting solutions.25.	The scope of these problems has also presented the European Economic Community with great challenges. It is the justified hope of the Danish Government that the nine members of the Community will be able to live up to these challenges so that the European buildup may gather renewed momentum for the benefit of the member States of the European communities as well as for all other nations of the world. My country attaches particular importance to the responsibility and open-mindedness of the European communities towards the outside world. We for our part expect that other economic groupings of the world will show understanding of the importance and necessity of growing economic cooperation in Europe.26.	Denmark together with the other member States of the European communities has wholeheartedly supported the establishment of a European Arab dialog. This dialog  which is directed neither against any other State nor against any other geographical area in the world and which in aim and content differs from the efforts made to solve the current Middle East conflict  is a natural continuation of a tradition based upon geographical  historical  cultural and economic realities. The dialog is an innovation a form of region to region cooperation based on the presumption that close neighbors have a concern for one another.27.	In Portugal  the firm resolve of the new Government to bring an end to 500 years of colonial rule in Africa has so far resulted in the admission of the Republic of GuineaBissau to membership in the United Nations  in the formation of a Government with African representation in Mozambique  which will soon attain independence  and also in the opening of negotiations for the future existence of Angola in freedom and independence. To a representative of a European country  which  throughout the lifetime of the United Nations  has made persistent and active efforts to speed up such developments  it is extremely gratifying to note that this mission of the United Nations is about to accomplish its ultimate goal. It is our hope that in the final phase of this process all sides will show the understanding necessary to ensure that the process can be terminated in peace and cooperation.28.	We have witnessed encouraging trends in international developments  but there are still areas in which human tragedies occur and political tensions prevail. I should like  in particular  to underline that  in order to secure for individuals respect for fundamental human rights  we consider torture or other cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment to be impermissible  wherever in the world it occurs.29.	In southern Africa  the policies of apartheid of the Government of South Africa and the attitude cf the minority regime of Southern Rhodesia are frightening examples of developments that are incompatible with universally accepted trends. My Government is prepared  now as before  to contribute  within the framework of the Charter  to such effective measures as can be adopted to reverse the trend in these areas.30.	Although the situation in the Middle East remains very serious and fraught with danger there are still  in our opinion  prospects of progress towards an overall solution of the Middle East conflict. It is essential to keep up the momentum in the international efforts which are being made to provide a just and durable peace on the basis of the troop separation agreements  with due regard for all legitimate interests  including the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.31.	In the last few months  we have witnessed a tragic conflict in Cyprus. We have the greatest sympathy for the Cypriot people  and we deplore the painful humanitarian problems which the crisis has created. The Danish Government  having contributed to the peacekeeping as well as to the humanitarian efforts in Cyprus  hopes that all parties will abide by the resolutions of the Security Council and observe the ceasefire  respect the United Nations flag and facilitate in every way the work of the UnitedNations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus in discharging the important tasks imposed upon the Force. We are convinced that a just and durable solution to the problems of Cyprus can be achieved only through negotiations in complete conformity with the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations.32.	The major Powers  evidently  have a special responsibility for ensuring more stable developments in these troubled areas developments opening possibilities for solutions equitable to both parties. Against this background it is most essential that developments in EastWest relations should be marked by continuity in the policy of detente a continuity which may hold out hopes for the viability of this policy.33.	The efforts to bring nuclear weapons under control and to expand cooperation in various fields between the United States and the Soviet Union have been continuing  and in our part of the world important questions stemming from the wish to develop mutual trust and cooperation and to reduce the level of military forces have been the subject of significant multilateral talks in Geneva and Vienna.34.	Denmark has noted with interest the agreements in the field of disarmament that were concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union at the summit meeting in Moscow in July. We hope that these agreements will provide a basis for progress towards limitations of strategic arms and complete disarmament. Denmark hopes that the treaty concerning underground nuclear arms test explosions may be extended to cover more than explosions exceeding 150 kilotons.35.	Efforts should be made in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to reach agreement on a complete test ban treaty and on a treaty prohibiting the development  manufacture and stockpiling of all chemical weapons and providing for the elimination of existing stocks of such weapons.36.	My Government considers it to be of great importance to achieve  as soon as possible  the adherence of all States Members of the United Nations to the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex].37.	The efforts which Denmark has made for years to convene a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe spring from a wish to give real substance to EastWest detente in regard to the States as well as the peoples and the individuals involved. It remains our view that the' mandate of the Conference  which was drafted during the preparatory talks in Helsinki  reflects in a realistic manner questions with respect to which it should be possible at the present juncture to make progress towards a solution. We believe also that such progress would be of great significance for continued and further detente both in Europe and in a broader perspective  which would be the primary aim of the Conference.38.	The Conference has just resumed its work in Geneva  and Denmark will continue its efforts to bring about as soon as possible a solution of the outstanding issues that will fully redeem the hopes which the convening of the Conference has generated in all participating countries.39.	In conclusion  I want to say that it is well known to this Assembly that Denmark has always attached decisive importance to participation in the work of the United Nations and has always regarded the United Nations as a fundamental element in the efforts to bring about a just world order and to preserve international peace and security. The existence of a workable and universal United Nations is one of the cornerstones of Denmark's foreign policy.40.	As a Nordic country we have  together with other Nordic countries  enjoyed a high standard of living and we have  jointly and to the best of our abilities  tried to help to promote development of the least favored nations. The intention of my further remarks is to emphasize that a country which does not produce raw materials and energy is also interested in continuing economic development and in contributing to progress and development in ether parts of the world. It calls for understanding in other countries.41.	As a member of the European communities  we want to be able to participate in the progressive development of European cooperation so as to make Europe a cornerstone of world peace and an important economic factor in the efforts to promote development and raise the standard of living in other countries. That work too has met with difficulties in the present economic situation; that work too demands that other countries understand and accept what we are doing in Europe.42.	In the long term  the solution must be found in the 'evolving of new technology and in cooperation on an equal footing with the countries possessing natural resources. The task now before us is to ensure  by mutual understanding and cooperation  that the changes take a smooth course  leaving reasonable room and possibilities for countries with widely differing structures.43.	This Organization should be judged by its ability to reconcile conflicting views  to bend our wills towards one another  and to adapt its activities to the ever changing problems."
"36",1984,"DOM",29,1974,"Mr. President  before beginning my statement on behalf of the delegation of the Dominican Republic I should like to express in this General Assembly the great sorrow which overwhelms the Government and people of the Dominican Republic at the tragedy which our sister Republic of Honduras is living through. Honduras which; in this period of its history  is making extraordinary efforts to achieve progress on the road towards development  at this time suddenly has to face the violent forces of destiny. There has been practically total destruction as though an apocalyptic hand wanted to plunge it into despair. But that is why we are all here  the sister republics of Honduras  meeting in this international forum so that we may here raise our voices and help in an effective manner the families which are at this time living through terrible anxiety. We express our solidarity with and condolences to Honduras.15.	The Dominican Republic  which takes pride in being one of the founding Members of the United Nations  has always paid its tribute of faith to the principles of the Organization  which have opened tip new horizons for an international legal order  the structure of whirs > as since its establishment resisted the onslaughts on the circumstances of life of peoples  is pleased to extend to the President of the General Assembly  Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  our most cordial good wishes on his election  through the unanimous will of the countries represented here  to allow him to preside over this session and to guide us with his well-known experience and wisdom in the tasks which await us.16.	We know very well that  as well as having eminent qualifications  he is a patriot determined to bring about the progress of Algeria so as to maintain in the forefront the prestige which it enjoys as a country which loves peace and independence  which has outstanding virtues and is concerned to see that the ideals and principles of the Charter will also contribute to the rule of peace and brotherhood among all peoples. Thus  our delegation is aware that your enlightened mind will assist us to find during this session the most correct solutions to the problems that we shall be dealing with under our agenda  and thus to fulfill the objectives laid down in San Francisco when the United Nations came into being.17.	Mr. President  we are certain that you too represent the continuity of that humanistic and universalist philosophy which has been represented here so brilliantly by Mr. Leopoldo Benites  an illustrious son of Ecuador  a man whose impact is already continental and universal.18.	In the course of the year that has elapsed between the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth sessions of the General Assembly  there have been negative international events which we have had to deplore and which have had repercussions on our Organization  the guiding genius in which the peoples that created it entrusted their major objectives for peace and universal solidarity.19.	Yet it is those very events which put to the test the principles of the Charter and the complicated mechanisms available for the attainment of the fundamental objectives. For that reason we must recognize that we must also be convinced that there have been positive events on which the task of the United Nations is nourished.20.	We must have the hope that the sanctity of nature which is approaching is the foundation of a new beginning  of a new history. Our motto from now on should be: we shall all work. Nothing could give us more encouragement than these wise words of the immortal North American poet Walt Whitman: ""If you don't find me at once  don't be discouraged; if I am not there  look for me elsewhere. I am waiting for you. Somewhere I am waiting for you.""21.	All our peoples are convinced that since the State came into being as a legal concept propelled by the history of civilization up to the present time and since the beginnings of the concept of law  which in America goes back to the ""Sunday before Christmas in 1511 when in Santo Domingo the Dominican Antonio de Montesinos delivered a sermon in a church with a cane roof'  a revolutionary sermon which he himself called ""a voice crying out in the wilderness"" and which the immortal Dominican humanist Pedro Henriquez Urena later called ""one of the great events of our spiritual history""  these concepts have constituted the most astonishing invention which the mind of man could have created to ensure the survival of the human species despite all the destructive forces which very often have threatened to eradicate the little world we live in.22.	The certainty that we gain from these facts which history and philosophy teach us should be for us and for all the peoples represented in this Organization the supreme factor which encourages us even more to become stronger  to recognize that  while it is true that very often some events have aroused inevitable and convenient criticism and others have been viewed as signs of a weakening in the attainment of our fundamental objectives  it is no less true that in every case the principles have become stronger.23.	No one can deny that in this century of the atom the horror of war could lead to the destruction of the planet. Our Organization  far from remaining static -although some of its principles have been violated in circumstances which have led some to believe in a crisis of the law- has proved  as has been said  that: ""Development of relations among States in the world of today could not be conceived of without a universal organization of the scope of the United Nations. If the United Nations did not exist  we would have to invent it.""24.	Because of changes in political thinking in a period in history in which our civilization is going through a transition which was already forecast by perhaps unexpected developments and which will change the face of the world  in past years we have expressed similar concepts in response to the quest for constructive solutions; among these we might mention the system of international security and defense.25.	The fact that we are witnessing quick changes in ideas which require profound revisions in the systems of law among States  and accordingly in the Charter  has been recognized lately  with great vigor and decisiveness  in the Latin American region.26.	Hence  the Organization of American States [OAS] in carrying out in-depth studies which have led to drafts for fundamental reforms of the constituent instrument  which will be submitted to the fifth General Assembly to be held in April 1975 and to be preceded by the Consultative Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs  to be held in Quito next November. That must be the point of departure for the revitalization and reorganization of the OAS  so that it may continue to serve as an effective instrument for the aspirations to peace  development and integration of the peoples of our continent. This means that in this forum too we have felt the vigorous onslaught of changes in structure which  although they have been correct and effective for a long time  have now been powerfully affected by the new facts of the international procedures  thus confirming the postulate that principles are nothing more than an emanation of necessity .27.	The Latin American region can be proud at this time that it is testing with useful results -at least so far- an effective instrument which inevitably will be called upon to be more general in international relations. I am referring to the new dialog.28.	We would like to refer logically to the dialog that started in Bogota within the broadest framework of brotherhood and equality where  with great clarity and sincere frankness   the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Latin America decided to hold talks with the Secretary of State of the United States of America  Mr. Henry Kissinger  so as to seek by joint agreement all Latin America united  together with the United States the solution of the most immediate problems of the countries south of the River Bravo. This new dialog was continued in Tlatelolco  in the beautiful capital of Mexico  and later in Washington.29.	We can point with satisfaction to the spirit of Tlatelolco  as we have called this new dawn of a meeting of minds among Latin American countries  without claiming to lay down standards for other regions of the world  since other problems  such as those which affect other areas in Europe and Asia  may find in a similar policy legal  practical and honorable solutions such as permanent peace in the Middle East and a solution of the Cyprus case  to mention only two striking examples.30.	With regard to the Third World  it is no bold statement to affirm that one of the causes which regrettably affect respect for human rights  without involving in it the blind crudity of political passions  is forceful measures and the great dissatisfactions aroused by the underdevelopment of peoples  and this is cruder and rougher when it reflects unemployment and poverty which bring about a confrontation between the scant resources available to satisfy these needs and the impossibility of making those resources sufficient.31.	Thus we cannot fail to support  as we have supported in the past  in this General Assembly the need which cannot be postponed to give priority to the claims of the countries of the Third World. Even though it cannot be denied that progress has been made in that direction  we must frankly admit that in fact there exists no effective dynamic action for a frontal approach to the problem created by underdevelopment in more than 100 areas of the world in so far as the jurisdiction of the United Nations extends. We therefore advocate the application in this field of the postulate whereby the developed countries of the world have contracted a natural obligation to contribute so that the countries of the Third World may more speedily attain development.32.	That is the policy drawn by the Charter of Algiers  where the matter was considered in its full  tragic consequences with the recognition  therefore  that it is an undeniable truth that the world of today gyrates around the economy  which is the axis which centralizes all constructive forces  on Which depend the inevitable and changing social developments of peoples  which are so personally linked to the economic developments* that there is not a single activity of social gathering or of man himself  individually  which does not depend on the economic tides which show the alternatives to our present civilization.33.	With regard to international progress  on the other hand  there are perspectives within the present international situation which lead to the recognition that there is a substantial advance towards progressively normalizing situations which have been of concern to States and peoples and which have prevented agreements which would facilitate and reduce to a minimum the causes that bring about a departure from the line of conduct drawn for permanent peace by the United Nations  within its legal order for all peoples.34.	It is encouraging to contemplate that some obstacles that had seemed to be insuperable have been removed from the road so as to bring about the essential reconciliation required by the concept of universality  which should govern an organization such as ours which already has welcomed more than 138 sovereign and independent States and will receive into the world family more States in compliance with the principles of the self-determination of peoples and the total decolonization of the world  an event in relation to which all peoples can legitimately consider themselves to be brothers.35.	Because of the effectiveness which we attach to dialog  in an atmosphere of friendship and equality and constructive frankness  as a method which should be attempted more frequently in the new diplomacy  we have removed certain clouds which shadowed the prospect of a better understanding between the United States of America and the Soviet Union  as well as with the People's Republic of China.36.	We do not believe that it is going too far to affirm that this has been the result of the fact that confrontation has been followed by a new and sound criterion of negotiation following the best course for men and nations  so that sooner or later all the rough edges which bar the way to international harmony may be made smooth.37.	Concerning the Law of the Sea  two years ago our country had the privilege to be the host for the 1972 Specialized Conference of the Caribbean Countries on Problems of the Sea. As the result of the deliberations of that important gathering  which was attended by all the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of all the countries of Central America and the Caribbean  a new instrument was drafted  called the Declaration of Santo Domingo.738.	The agenda covered many important aspects on that subject  among which we considered the territorial sea and the exploitation and conservation of marine species  as well as the regime for the sea-bed  within our joint geographical circumscription  and we also dealt with concrete aspects of pollution as the merciless enemy of marine fertility.39.	On that memorable occasion  the idea of the patrimonial sea was stated  the idea of exclusive exploitation not to extend more than 200 miles starting from the base lines.40.	The results obtained were undeniably positive in effect  and they have had fruitful repercussions at the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Caracas in 1974  on the fascinating subject of the wealth of the sea and its subsoil as a promising way out for the problem raised by shortages of food and of overpopulation  the projections of which are alarming everywhere in the world.41.	It was a fortunate coincidence that the Specialized Conference  held in Santo Domingo in 1954  on the territorial sea  the continental shelf and exploitation of the wealth of the sea and related matters  suggested as a conflictive contribution the concept of exploitation  which was an advance over the doctrinaire formulations regarding horizontally and vertically as modules within which the rights of thecoastal countries adopted in 1954 in the Geneva Conventions should be regulated.42.	The Dominican Republic therefore has for decades been co-operating for the development and adoption of a new legal regime for the sea. It was with these convictions that we were present at Caracas  and while the Conference there did not arrive at a draft convention on this important subject  which involves the interests of all countries equally  it is no less true that it will make it possible to arrive at final formulations on the points on which no agreement was reached at Caracas  particularly in respect of the criterion of the Dominican Republic that major industrial installations on narrow straits must be the subject of negotiations so as to contribute to the prevention of any kind of pollution.43.	Concerning new States  when we consider the perspective offered by the continuous growth of the United Nations  we must rejoice at the fact that the prophecy that we would arrive at the universality desired by its founders  made when it took its first steps in an uncertain world  has been fulfilled.44.	We also recognize that this decision on the part of the new States to become Members of the Organization shortly after achieving independence is an unequivocal sign that the Organization is moving forward and that its instruments are effective for the attainment of its objectives  despite changes which occur internally in States and internationally.45.	With these convictions  our delegation is pleased and honored to welcome Bangladesh  Guinea- Bissau and Grenada. We are certain that  as they were able to win independence  so they will be able to share the common responsibilities of all States Members of the United Nations.46.	I turn now to Panama. It is of great benefit to America that  after the meetings of the Security Council held in the city of Panama  where all the Latin American countries supported the position of Panama in its claims for a revision of the Canal Treaty  and after the visit and the dialog with Mr. Henry Kissinger  negotiations have been started in a spirit of friendship  mutual equality and respect. This is a step forward towards the changes proclaimed in the last international meetings in the Latin American region.47. America has started what we have called the new dialog  which we are taking advantage of only to implement  through a practical  coherent and harmonious system and in accordance with the most deeply felt needs  of Latin America  the plans and projects which we need to face the reality of our own situations.48. To speak now of a policy for accelerated economic development: at this very hour the countries I of the world are meeting in the highest of the inter' national forums and come here loaded with beautiful illusions and with a series of beautiful formulas backed by arguments which are profoundly convincing but often difficult to translate into reality  and require that at this time we frankly and honestly put a stop to the uncontrolled outpouring of projects  plans and programs  many of which have failed to provide the expected results.49.	We are going to make a sincere suggestion to the countries that are gathered here  particularly to the countries of Latin America. Basically we suggest that we should seek a mechanism or the mechanisms necessary for the true  ultimate development of our peoples.50.	In these times much is said about the population explosion  which has given rise to great discussions and important meetings  such as the World Population Conference held at Bucharest from 19 to 30 August 1974. FAO met in Panama not long ago to speak about the need to increase agricultural production. In Yugoslavia  from 16 to 22 of this month  the second round-table was held on agro-industry. Much is said of the need to obtain investments for the principal industries and  above all  much is said about the energy crisis and about inflation as one of the problems which have absorbed all mankind in recent times.51.	We cannot deny that the apparently disproportionate rise in prices brought about by the petroleum-producing countries lies at the root of the dis-concerting runaway inflation which shakes to its very foundations the culture of super-consumption and the relative prosperity maintained up to now. The drama of the situation is clear when we compare the prices of some commodities: a metric ton of corn in 1972 cost $51; in January 1974 it rose to $122. The price of wheat which  In large measure  is a world food staple  rose from $60 per metric ton in 1972 to $214 in January 1974. Rice  which is one of the products of highest consumption in the underdeveloped countries  rose alarmingly from $131 per metric ton in January 1972 to $538 in January of this year.52.	The ominous consequences of this dramatic economic process have had the most catastrophic and desperate impact on the poorest countries  where hunger and malnutrition have killed millions and millions of human beings and will do vast harm to future generations  since the infant mortality rate of the poor countries attained its highest point during the year 1973  which surely history will baptize the year of malnutrition and human wretchedness.53.	Despite these tacts  we realize that the process seems to be irreversible. That is why we are convinced  and we wish to make this known to this Assembly  that the means of solving our problems is the rational and intensive exploitation of our soil and at the same time the industrialization of its products  our goal being to attain maximum productivity.54.	This policy will of necessity lead us to use the most modern agricultural tools and equipment and the most advanced technical methods in the administration of production  industrialization and marketing programs for agrarian products and  together with agrarian reform  would complement the integral development of Latin America.55.	It is necessary to incorporate into our development plans the concept of agro-industry  which calls for industries to be established where; agriculture is being practiced  so as to bring to our agricultural peoples not only the possibility of taking part in enterprises which would ensure them a fixed income  social security  bonuses  old-age pensions  and so on  but also an opportunity to educate their children  to change their habits and to raise their standard of living  which bears no comparison with the standard of living of the urban workers  who enjoy high salaries and relative equality of opportunity.56.	This policy is different from the policy of import substitution  which leads to an industry without a capacity for innovation and is always underdeveloped. It obliges economic integration to start with micro-economic units forming part of a harmonious scheme  until they can be molded into a single body able to generate the necessary energy to satisfy every need with the greatest possible social justice. It would furthermore be a rational method of halting the great migration of people from the rural areas to the urban centers  attracted by the illusion of a nonexistent industrial development.57.	It has been said that an integrated agro-industry is a modern enterprise aiming to industrialize one of the most ancient and most important activities of mankind. Hence it is not new; it is the clear and objective definition of its goals that is new  as is also the certainty that it constitutes an effective and fundamental mechanism for a genuine solution to our problems.58.	The world is today facing one of the gravest crises ever recorded in the history of mankind  and that is the disproportion between food production and world population growth. There are even large areas of the world where agricultural production has decreased substantially in the past years.59.	The essential reason for this almost general deficit in agricultural production is. fundamentally based on the lack of a clear policy which would motivate man and lead him to work his soil in the social conditions required by the world today  such as the technology  the training and administration  the financing and marketing  so that the optimum yieldmay be obtained from the soil.60.	It is no accident that cane sugar was  has been and will continue to be one of the main substances of the economic process of the Dominican Republic  and that the manner in which it is sown  harvested and processed is industrial  with a high degree of technology -this is one of the spheres where man has been able to produce raw materials at the lowest prices. Cane sugar and its industrial processing constitute a powerful agro-industry in many of our countries  which allow for effective agricultural and industrial yields for the economies of our people.61.	The man in the field must have in his hands the necessary means to extract the highest yields from nature. Nature  which is wise  has always had its own mechanisms  and since the very beginning of mankind there have always been  although not in the dramatic proportions of today  population growth and production deficit. And today all that we men have achieved has been to create some of the necessary elements for a precarious subsistence for the vast majority of our peoples.62.	That is why we make an appeal from this inter-national forum so that all countries  and in particular the Latin American countries  may consider the adoption of this policy  since Latin America is the area of the greatest hope of the world. It is the area of the world which is least exploited  where the land has not yet been worked technically  where the man in the field constitutes 70 per cent of our population of 300 million inhabitants today  and it is the region that could become one of the most productive areas of the world.63.	Regrettably  so far most economic policies in our area have been circumscribed to the mere subsistence of the individual. Few times and in few countries has any thought been given to or action taken of heroic proportions to face our ills.64.	We are totally convinced of the effectiveness of the system of agrarian reform  because in our country  which has a territory of barely 48 070 square kilometers  in the last eight years  under the administration of the constitutional government of Mr. Joaquin Balaguer  thousands and thousands of families have achieved a substantial increase in their agricultural production. But if we were to create the concept of the manager of the field and make of it a reality  ""a manager and man from the city in the field""  possibly the social mutation that would occur in our countries would have highly positive repercussions for future generations  because if the man of the city were to go to the field and set himself up with a large enterprise  in a constitutionally legal manner  as was done in the Dominican Republic  the land would become the property of the one who cultivated it  with laws for minimum salary  social security benefits and other kinds of benefits for workers in the field  like the treatment accorded workers in the city; then migrations towards urban centers would be reduced and small countries  such as mine  for example  could relatively easily become societies where all the men who work in the field  would have electricity  television sets  refrigerators and all the advances of modern times  together with fresh air and the beauty of nature.65.	Obviously the State must provide these managers with the necessary resources  such as the required infrastructure  so that the execution of these projects follows standards of productivity  with a minimum of expenditures  as incentives for the development of managerial skills of this kind.66.	It is also vital for international institutions such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank to intensify their actions so that this type of undertaking may serve the purposes sought.67.	Two decades ago the world had an eminently political criterion. Today the criterion is eminently economic. The most obvious proof is how world policy has changed because of the surprising rise in oil prices and the under development of such countries as Brazil and Venezuela  which have now attained some of the highest production levels and some of the highest standards of living ever recorded in their history by those great and powerful South American nations.68.	Most of the countries of Latin America have suffered a great ill  and there is no more important forum than the General Assembly of the United Nations for us to carry out our own self-criticism. And this great ill is the legendary tendency to live by asking for help from the powerful  at a risk of undermining the self-determination of our people  to find ways for the powerful to help us  while we maintain an attitude almost of indifference  and not just of collective irresponsibility  expecting others to do things for us  instead of facing our problems with our own intelligence  our own resources and our own means.69.	The world of today -and absolutely no one disputes this-is made up of a series of independent States with interdependent economies. It is now clear that all the key economic factors must be assessed  both in relation to their national repercussions as well as their international repercussions. It is only in our times that the world leaders seem to have become fully aware of the importance of what has been called economic interdependence. As an expert on economics at Harvard University  Professor Raymond Bermond  said: ""Suddenly sovereign States feel naked. Concepts of national sovereignty and a national economic potential seem to be curiously lacking in meaning.""70.	We wish to emphasize that perhaps the most curious aspect of this new development of interdependence is that the reactions that have been aroused have followed no foreseeable standard. Few developed or developing countries seem to know how to deal with this. Some consider this as coercion and others consider it as an opportunity. But there is complete agreement only in assuring that interdependence is a fact and that it would seem that in certain circumstances it may represent an unprecedented opportunity for development and prosperity.71.	However  we cannot ignore the fact that  unless we achieve genuine and integral development in our peoples  interdependence will come to an end  and we shall go back to the humiliating and anachronistic dependence which violates the most elementary 'principles of the integrity of our State.72.	To strengthen this thesis and so that we may be conscious of the fact that all that we have stated here is absolutely feasible  we need do no more than read articles 29  30 and part of 31 of the Charter of the Organization of American States  as amended by the Protocol of Buenos Aires  of 27 February 1967 3 which state the following:""Article 29. The Member States  inspired by the principles of inter-American solidarity and co-operation  pledge themselves to a united effort to ensure social justice in the Hemisphere and dynamic and balanced economic development for their peoples  as conditions essential -to peace and security.""Article 30. The Member States pledge them-selves to mobilize their own national human and material resources through suitable programs  and recognize the importance of operating within an efficient domestic structure  as fundamental conditions for their economic and social progress and for assuring effective inter-American co-operation.""Article 31. To accelerate their economic and social development  in accordance with their own methods and procedures and within the framework of the democratic principles and the institutions of the inter-American system  the MemberStates agree to dedicate every effort to achieve the following basic goals:""(a) Substantial and self-sustained increase in the per capita national product;""(b) Equitable distribution of national income;""(c) Adequate and equitable systems of taxation;""(d) Modernization of rural life and reforms leading to equitable and efficient land- tenure systems  increased agricultural productivity  expanded use of undeveloped land  diversification of production; and improved processing and marketing systems for agricultural products; and the strengthening and expansion of facilities to attain these ends;""(e) Accelerated and diversified industrialization  especially of capital and intermediate goods;""(f) Stability in the domestic price levels  compatible with sustained economic development and the attainment of social justice;""(g) Fair wages  employment opportunities  and acceptable working conditions for all;73.	We are aware that the analysis that we have thought agro-industry deserves does not require so much attention by the countries which  benefiting from the wealth of the subsoil  have been able to make up for some of the poverty with other structures where an extraction industry mobilizes large amounts of capital and thereby have obtained an accelerated course towards development and self-sufficiency.74.	If we  the peoples of America  are to achieve and bring to a happy conclusion and concrete reality the programs for agricultural development and industrialization  we shall all of us see our efforts crowned with glory and the efforts of those illustrious statesmen who  with their brave deeds and their glories and the courage of their peoples and the firmness with which they have brandished their swords  gave us our freedom and thereby the right to go on promising and attaining the establishment of a just society where slavery will never exist  nor servility nor dependence.75.	On behalf of my delegation  permit me to pay a tribute to peace  which is the supreme objective of the United Nations  on the MQittient of whose principles the destiny of mankind depends more than ever today. Peace is all the more hidden when we most seek it. It most hides when it is best loved. It is most confused when it is nearest. It is most sacred When it is distant. It is most radiant when it is denied.76.	The great geniuses of political thinking of antiquity and of modern times have tried to define peace within its philosophical vastness. Let me here  however  simply state the theological thinking of St. Augustine  who said:""The peace of men is orderly concord; peace at home is agreed uniformity among those in authority and those who obey and live in it; peace in the city is the orderly concord of citizens and neighbors in ruling and obeying; peace in all things is tranquility in order  and order is nothing more than a disposition of equal and unequal things  which gives to each its proper place."""
"37",2030,"DZA",29,1974,"Mr. President  it would be ungracious of the representative of Algeria not to associate himself with all the compliments which have been paid to you  and perhaps he is best placed to estimate how much those compliments were justified and to what extent they were personally merited. Perhaps it will suffice to say how honored we feel  as Algerians and Africans  and to express our assurance that  under your enlightened guidance  the work of the twenty-ninth session will indeed be crowned with success.90.	We would also like to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Leopoldo Benites and assure him of our admiration and friendship for having presided so competently and with such courtesy over the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.91.	It is a formidable task for me to speak at the end of the general debate  after everything has already been said by distinguished previous speakers  and at best my statement could be only a pale reflection of what the Assembly has already heard. The problems have been posed and analyzed  suggestions have been put forward  advice has been given and solutions proposed. I hope  therefore  that no one is expecting from me an originality to which I cannot lay claim nor any infallible recipe for solving our difficulties. However  I must stress the feeling of concern in the face of the serious dangers threatening the world which marked most statements. These dangers arise not so much from the actual problems faced by the international community problems which it can now clearly see and of which it is now keenly aware as the fact that it has so far found it impossible to produce a satisfactory and lasting solution to them.92.	The striking contrast between this tragic impotence and the prodigious development of the powers of man and his mastery of his environment is  I believe  a paradox typical of our times  when the disparities by which our world is torn stand out more starkly than ever under the glare of powerful lights.93.	There is no doubt that  a quarter century after the Second World War  we are entering an era where not only the international order which has hitherto prevailed  but also the principles which are its very foundation and the philosophy from which it derives its very essence  are now being challenged. In terms of people  the challenge was expressed by the wave of protests which stirred the younger generations throughout the world. It is no doubt to the credit of the old order that it has at least forged the new framework of international society; but this very evolution dooms this old order to oblivion unless it is able to adapt itself rapidly.94.	This new world is supposed to be  above all  a world of mature and responsible people  free from all tutelage and rejecting all paternalism. The rules of the game can no longer be those that decree that only themost powerful can play. The lesson we can learn from history is that nothing lasting can be built against the will of the people. This lesson has never been better illustrated than in our times  which have in additionconfirmed that this will of the people is as sacred and as invincible whatever the latitude or continent.  95.	It is against this background that we should assess the changes that have occurred in international relations. While we would not dream of diminishing the importance of detente between the great Powers  we cannot  however  be more keenly aware of how much further we have to go before we can bring international morality into line with the new structure of our society.96. The claims of all these young countries which have just made their entry into the international arena and have suddenly become aware of their responsibilities cannot be met indefinitely by the prohibitions of an obsolete order  an order which they are all the less inclined to honor precisely because it was that order which permitted their enslavement  the plundering of their resources and the destruction of their identity. Obviously  one cannot build any new order without first attempting to wipe away all wrongs and to restore rights which have been disregarded or suppressed.97.	Whether it be a political or an economic crisis  the situation is in fact the same. There is the same conflict between outmoded concepts and the exigencies of the modern world. Decolonization  for example  fits precisely into this context and  at the same time  is an inevitable stage on the road towards that society of free and sovereign peoples that will be the international community of tomorrow.98.	Progress achieved in the process of independence for the Portuguese colonies gives us a rare occasion for satisfaction within the present world context. While we were happy to welcome here the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  we also greeted with relief the substantial changes which have occurred in Portugal itself and which  H they have to prove something  at least demonstrate that the freedom of the Portuguese people is intimately connected with that of the African peoples which  like it  have been subjected to the domination of the same regime  Fascist at home and colonialist "".broad. A very valuable lesson must be learned from the Portuguese experience which shows that one cannot destroy the freedom of others without affecting one's own freedom. Other countries besides Portugal have also had occasion to learn this lesson  to their cost. If this lesson were digested properly  humanity would  I am sure  find itseW free of the threats to its tranquility.99.	These victories in the anti-colonialist struggle should not conceal from us everything that still remains to be done not only to complete the liberation of colonial territories  but also and above all to put an end to the attacks on human dignity and human values  constituted by the policy of apartheid of South Africa and the racist minority regime of Rhodes^. This year the General Assembly has once again rejected by a larger majority than ever the credentials of the South African delegation  thus reflecting international public opinion  which is unanimous in its repugnance of apartheid. The Assembly wanted to make its condemnation more effective by asking the Security Council to review the relations between the United Nations and South Africa. But no one should be deluded by this. It is above all a test  a test of the determination of our community to impose respect for its principles  bu: a test also of the sincerity of its Members  particularly the most powerful  in their attachment to these principles.100.	Since I am talking about African problems and decolonization  I should in my turn say a few words about the Sahara under Spanish domination. The Assembly has long been familiar with this problem and is aware of the interest attached by Algeria to all problems of liberation  an interest all the greater when there are involved as is the case here obvious geopolitical considerations  and when the desire of the peoples of this region for unity is founded on so many links of all kinds which have always existed among them despite the vicissitudes of time and history.101.	Algeria  Morocco and Mauritania have long been calling upon Spain to decolonize this Territory and allow its population to exercise its right to self-determination. For many years  in fact  these three sister States have co-ordinated their efforts towards this end in the OAU  in the non-aligned group and in particular at the United Nations.102.	The General Assembly has always supported this action and  in resolutions adopted at the last few sessions  it has constantly called upon the administering Power to organize  in agreement with the countries concerned  a referendum of self-determination  under the control of and guaranteed by our Organization. While affirming its attachment to the principle of the self-determination of peoples  the Spanish Government has  however  embarked upon a course of procrastination which has given rise to doubts as to the sincerity of its intentions and has even gradually led to a highly regrettable deterioration of the situation.103.	Although the international community has noted the most recent statements of the Madrid Government  whereby it has undertaken to implement the decisions of the General Assembly  the concerted and common position o* Algeria  Morocco and Mauritania has been clearly express throughout these years  and it cannot be the subject of any misunderstanding: as to the natural interest of these three countries in a peaceful  satisfactory and lasting solution of this problem; as to the need to permit the Sahrawi people to exercise their self-determination and  finally  as to their wish to prevent this problem from degenerating into a source of insecurity in a particularly sensitive area. Stated thus  this position can accommodate any suggestion which would respect its principal elements.104.	Morocco has just expressed its wish to place this matter before the International Court of Justice. Mauritania  to our pleasure  has agreed to this procedure. Algeria can see nothing but advantage in an arrangement which has been agreed upon by its brothers and allies  a procedure which would clarify the juridical and historical aspects of the problem by means of an opinion of the Court. That procedure will  of course  facilitate the search for a final agreement and will show the way to it. In any case  it goes without saying that the opinion of the population directly concerned will always be the most important element and the decisive factor in any settlement. Algeria's interest would be entirely satisfied if the decolonization of Sahara were to be achieved rapidly  thus enabling all the peoples of the region to strengthen and to promote their ties of co-operation  brotherhood and good neighborliness.105.	The Palestinian problem  which this year is on the agenda of our session  may seem somewhat strange because of some of its features and the emotional nature of its content. It belongs  in fact  by its origin  its nature and its ramifications  to the same category of problems which we have already mentioned  and which can be defined in simple terms: denial of justice and infringement of the freedom of peoples and their most sacred rights.106.	The rights of the Palestinian people  its legitimate claims to justice  are being thwarted by a situation of fait accompli  based not on law but on force  a situation which is being perpetrated thanks to uninterrupted aggression and the benevolent complicity of the inter-national community. Ever since this people was driven out of its country  denied its land  stripped of its goods  regrouped in refugee camps or dispersed all over the world  attempts have been made  wittingly or unwittingly  to deprive it of its identity  to deny it its national character and to reduce the scale of its tragedy to the eking out of a wretched daily existence.107.	How can we be surprised  therefore  that the situation created in this way in Palestine has been rapidly transformed into the Middle East crisis we know  which a quarter of a century of effort has not been able to settle  and which is now attaining such gravity that it is directly threatening peace in Europe and in the world? It is not enough to say in explanation that it is a complicated problem  nor is it enough to seek in history  religion or sociology reasons for the failure in the Middle East of methods of settlement which have proved their worth elsewhere.108.	It is becoming increasingly obvious now that the problem has only appeared insoluble because no one wanted to understand the central fact  its very core  which is the situation of the Palestinian people. We could even say that the Middle East crisis is the Palestinian problem  because that problem is the source of the crisis  and will determine its outcome. It is time for the United Nations and international public opinion as a whole to recognize at last something we have ceaselessly represented here as axiomatic. The Organization must understand that its duty is not so much to provide humanitarian relief for a people it has allowed to be struck down and dismembered  but to help it to preserve its identity  regain its homeland  and recover from a disaster which almost wiped it off the map.109.	In approving the inclusion on its agenda of the question of Palestine  the Assembly has taken the first step in that direction  and the debate that is to be held on this subject will  we are sure  make it possible now to deal with the problem of the Middle East within a realistic context  with full awareness of how much clear thinking  courage and sacrifice will be required for a true settlement. But this result will be possible only through a broad and sincere discussion which would involve all interested parties and  of course  first and foremost the Palestinians  through their authentic and best qualified representatives. Thus conceived and carried out  that debate will without doubt represent the most substantial progress that has been achieved since an attempt was first made to seek a solution which would be one in more than name.110.	The crisis that broke out last July in Cyprus and has since then undergone some dangerous developments is one more of the problems engendered by the Middle East situation. This is a serious crisis  because it affects the independence of a non-aligned country  threatens its sovereignty  and is destroying its national unity. It is also complex because of its international ramifications and the strategic consideration^ involved. I believe that this is not the time for apportioning blame for the events in Cyprus that eventually led to the present situation. There .are more important things to do at this time: firstly  to relieve all the sufferings that have been inflicted upon the people  to contain the conflict and prevent it from worsening  and to explore ways and means of achieving a progressive settlement which would respect the independence of the island and its sovereignty  and create conditions for a restoration of confidence between the two communities on the island.111.	Initially peaceful coexistence and later  we hope  fraternal coexistence between the Greek and Turkish communities of Cyprus that  when all is said and done  is the essential objective of any attempt to find a true solution. It is only by eventually sharing the same national feelings  by coming to consider themselves the children of the same motherland and placing their loyalty to that motherland above all other allegiances  that the Cypriots will really be able to exercise their sovereignty and spare their country of all threats of division. This  of course  is something that will take a long time to learn  and it is only possible if all sides demonstrate the same sincere will to succeed. Yet the strongest nations have been forged in misfortune and division  and there is no reason to rule out optimism with regard to the communities of Cyprus.112.	We feel  too  that the contacts taking place between their representatives will be able to overcome present reservations  remedy the errors of the past  and pave the way for the reconciliation of tomorrow. For this it is essential to free Cyprus from its involvement in international strategies and to put an end to foreign intervention from whatever quarter. All foreign troops must be withdrawn and military bases dismantled  in spite of the humanitarian role that they can play in situations like those in which the Cypriot people has just found itself.113.	Once those initial conditions have been met it will be the task of the two communities to determine what system seems to them the best to guarantee the equality of rights at the present time and to promote the gradual forging of those communities into a single nation. The United Nations has spared no efforts to achieve that result and will undoubtedly have a role of primary importance to play in the restoration of confidence and the encouragement of progress towards a fruitful dialog.114.	I am sure no one will be surprised at the extreme interest in the situation in Cyprus of the non-aligned group of countries  which could not possibly reconcile themselves to seeing the very existence of one of their members being threatened. The attacks against Cyprus  against its sovereignty and its national unity  is felt by the entire group as an attack against all the non-aligned countries and as jeopardizing the very policy of non-alignment. That is why the non-aligned group has been following so closely the development of the crisis and why it would like to assure the Cypriot people of its total solidarity. It is ready to do anything which would permit the rapid restoration of peace on the island and facilitate agreement between the two communities.115.	The current disturbances in international economic relations are the best illustration of what I described at the beginning of my statement as a confrontation between an old order clinging desperately to its privileges and a new order wishing to demolish the obsolete structures of the past and establish a scale of values more in keeping with the principles which should govern the modern world. It is there  fundamentally  that lies what some have called ""a world economic crisis"" and which others would like to limit to what they misleadingly describe as ""an energy crisis"".116.	The international economic order which has prevailed hitherto has made possible the extraordinary rise of the industrialized world  facilitated primarily by the availability of raw materials and cheap labor in colonial territories and in the third world generally speaking. That system  originally based upon a similarly serious imbalance in the distribution of wealth  could not but facilitate the enrichment of the most highly developed countries to the detriment of the poorer countries. When the poor countries finally awoken the abuse and  taking their own destinies in hand; wanted to make up their economic lag  under development it began to appear to be a threat to world peace  and world public opinion began suddenly to understand the seriousness of the situation.117.	To remedy that situation  no doubt important changes should have been made in the international economic system which  by reducing to reasonable limits the advantages of the industrialized countries  would have established a greater measure of justice in the world and given the under-developed countries an opportunity to restore their economies. But that was not the course followed. The rich countries preferred  while preserving their privileges  to respond to the claims of the third world by the granting of aid in various forms.118.	I shall not dwell on the serious shortcomings of such assistance  which in any case was not always understood or presented as a duty towards those who had been exploited  and which if it had been left to the initiative of individual countries would never have exceeded an extremely low percentage of the national income of the developed countries. The result was that not only was the economic lag of the under-developed countries not reduced but also that their situation became more desperate with each year. To that should be added the difficulties which the economic system of the developed world had begun to experience  difficulties which derived primarily from an unbridled rate of growth in the industrial field  unprecedented waste and fabulous expenditures entailed in the pursuit of imperialist policies.119.	The world economic crisis in the result of a combination of two phenomena: inflation in industrialized countries  under-development in the rest of the world. The energy crisis has only made more apparent the cracks in the system  but the dimensions of the evil far transcend the mere consequences of a rise in the price of oil.120.	What is the meaning  then  of all the fuss about the price of oil  to which people are attempting to attribute their current difficulties and on the basis of which a solution is sought? I shall not revert to arguments already put forward here by which it has been amply demonstrated that such assertions are inane. The most dangerous aspect of this maneuver against the petroleum-producing countries is that it attempts  first  to introduce division into the ranks of the countries producing raw materials and  secondly  to discourage any attempts to readjust the prices of r w materials by tying them  particularly  to the prices of industrial products. The surprising insistence on the tragic situation of the poorest countries  and the sympathy which is suddenly being lavished upon them cannot conceal from us the deep-seated motivations which are  in any case  fundamentally selfish  and which underlie this approach.121.	The seriousness of the troubles today is such that it should encourage all of us to face up to our responsibilities and not to seek a scapegoat for our sins. It we are convinced that it is only by joint efforts that we can rectify the situation  why  then  issue such incongruous warnings and threats and thus make even more difficult any attempt at understanding and co-operation.122.	It must be that it is easier to find wisdom among the humblest  for it was precisely in the hope of finally seeing the international community embarking upon a course of co-operation that we called for the convening of the special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development. The primary objective of this meeting was to be  in our view  that of stressing the extent to which the world economic crisis had highlighted the solidarity of the industrialized and the underdeveloped worlds  and the extent to which the prosperity of the rich countries was vulnerable if it remained limited to those countries. Secondly  the debate was intended to bring out the real causes of the crisis and thus to define the precise perspective in which the energy crisis itself should be placed. This was thus a unique opportunity for the third world countries to set forth their problems  claims and suggestions in a new context  and for developed countries  rendered by the trials they themselves were undergoing more sensitive to and more heedful of these complaints  an opportunity to become more keenly alerted to the dangers of underdevelopment.123.	The work of resolving the crisis could not be confined to finding partial solutions  which  by not calling into question fundamentally the inequalities and disparities inherent in this system  would have only allowed a postponement of the consequences and would have left the situation to get even worse. Courage and clear sightedness demanded that we get to the bottom of things and discover that the roots of the crisis lay in the economic order itself  and that it was by working on the economic order itself that one could really expect to obtain positive results.124.	This is  in fact  what happened  not without difficulties in the attempt to establish an open and sincere dialog between the developed and the underdeveloped countries  and also not without reservations on the part of the industrialized countries. How-ever that may be  and whatever may be said of this result  it could reasonably be considered as a point of departure along a path which had already been traced  along which there was some ground for hoping that we could make even more progress.125.	The trends that have recently emerged and that would have us focus all our attention on the energy crisis and on the petroleum-producing countries  are aiming in fact at destroying everything which had been so arduously achieved at the last special session. We do not think that such initiatives  by disturbing the harmony which had begun to establish itself between developed and underdeveloped countries and by propelling them towards a confrontation which would be harmful to the interests of everyone  can really help us to get closer to a rapid  satisfactory solution of the economic crisis. We feel  rather  that we must continue to act within the framework laid down at the special session in the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  and attempt to increase what common ground there is  to overcome differences and to prepare practical measures for the application of that Declaration and Program.126.	Since the end of the Second World War the world has undergone profound changes in its structure  in its potential and in its environment. What for so long appeared as a remote ideal difficult of attainment is now within our grasp and can be achieved  if only we want to achieve it and are prepared to pay the price. We could then build an entirely new world based upon principles which have  so far  constantly been proclaimed  but which today must be applied and respected. The years we are now passing through are crucial in this process of metamorphosis  in which we see the strengthening and acceleration of trends towards change and renewal. It is no surprise to see the parallel and contrasting development of forces of resistance to this trend which are attempting to preserve and prolong the old order and of the revolutionary forces which want to force the pace of change.127.	It is up to us  the international community as a whole  whether we want the new world society to be born without confrontation and without violence. It is up to us whether we do not wish it to give way to resentment and rancor which arouse feelings of vengeance and the desire for revenge. To be frank  that has been said by all previous speakers in the general debate  and I cannot better conclude my statement than with the consoling observation that such unanimity represents a hope for the whole of mankind."
"38",2077,"ECU",29,1974,"Mr. President  the honor conferred on Ecuador when I was elected President of the twenty-eighth session of this Assembly had the disadvantage of preventing me  for almost one year  from exercising the exclusive representation of my people; nor  during that time  when I served my country at a high international level  was I able to serve it in other forums.40.	On returning to ground level with a clear conscience from having done my duty and resuming the full and exclusive representation of Ecuador  it is a great pleasure for me that my first duty is to congratulate you  on behalf of the people and Government of Ecuador  on your accession to the Presidency of the General Assembly. These grave moments of conflict in international life demand the clairvoyance of the statesman and the tough energy of the fighter  two qualities that are combined in your personality  which was formed in the fight for independence for your country and then in your continuous efforts undertaken in your exalted capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria to liberate the peoples of the world and to create a new order.41.	It also gives me great pleasure that one of my first duties is to greet  on behalf of the people and Government of Ecuador  the three new Members of the Organization  each from a different continent: Grenada  our sister by geography but above all by history  which since the history of the Iberian-Indian-African peoples of Latin America began in the Caribbean  has been a melting-pot of peoples and a matrix of nations; Bangladesh  set at the heart of a millenary culture; and Guinea-Bissau  which won its independence in an unflagging battle  to whose heroes and martyrs I wish to pay tribute in the noble and austere person of Amilcar Cabral.42.	Having fulfilled those pleasant duties  I must now refer to an event that has plunged my people into mourning: the tragedy of Honduras. Hurricane winds  torrential rains and high tides transformed the beautiful tropical country of Honduras into an enormous devastated area under whose mud 10 000 human beings are buried. Those who survived were attacked by maddened vipers  and  in the midst of the desolation  the specter of famine  disease and misery was raised.43.	I do not wish to make of my statement to the General Assembly a kind of broadened agenda or an advance sample of the agenda items which we shall have an opportunity to deal with in the respective Main Committees or in plenary meetings when items are assigned to them. I shall now refer only to those matters which  although they do not yet appear specifically on our agenda  are implicit in many of the questions we are to debate.44.	It may seem to be a time-worn cliche if I say what I have been repeating in my latest statements and reaffirm today -namely  that we are in an era of transition which we can face only if we have a clear and accurate awareness of the change. Twenty-nine years ago  an historic event occurred: the organization of the international community for the noble purposes of living together in peace as good neighbors  prohibiting the use and even the mere threat of force  advocating respect for the dignity of free man without discrimination and enshrining the right of peoples to decide on their own forms of government.45.	We know that since the United Nations came into being there have been flagrant violations of its principles and purposes -for example  war as a means of expanding frontiers; the occupation of territories by force; the refusal to grant peoples their right to self-determination; the monstrous injustice of apartheid in South Africa and Rhodesia; the artificial division of peoples having ancient homogeneous cultures; the mass devastation of lands by barbarous methods of chemical warfare; and the use of hunger as a weapon. All that is true. But it is also true that the organization of the international community which the United Nations represents has created an international public opinion the obvious pressure of which has prevented the outbreak of a world war and the hegemony of a dominant Power and has made possible the liberation of colonial peoples which are today full-fledged States. The clearest expression of that to be found at this time is Portugal's break with an obsolete idea of domination  a break it has begun with the applause and sympathy of all the peoples of the world. Our civilization  which has successively been Mediterranean and Atlantic and has extended to every ocean  has come to be the civilization of the globe  of man  of all men  of all the peoples of a planet which  small and inadequate though it has become  is the only one we have to live for.46.	I would not wish to evoke poetic images of facile rhetoric. Instead  I shall refer to the image used by an economist with a cool and clear mind  Mr. Robert McNamara  who  at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in 1972  said we are passengers on a spaceship on which one fourth of the people travels comfortably while three fourths travel in conditions of hunger  disease and destitution.47.	After the successive failures of the efforts of the first United Nations Development Decade  the crisis in raw materials compelled us to hold the sixth special session of the General Assembly on the noble and  I would venture to say  bold initiative of President Boumediene of Algeria. The special session drew attention to the vital fact that the international community requires measures other than partial steps; it requires a new international economic order. In my opinion  this is the beginning of the second great era of the United Nations since it was established as the expression of the world community.48.	I must with alarm confess that  instead of an atmosphere of co-operation  interrelationship and confidence which the establishment of a new international economic order requires  this session of the General Assembly has begun in an atmosphere of suspicion and threat. That is terribly negative because threats' and recriminations usually rebound against those who launch them  like a boomerang thrown by an inexpert hand.49.	In the first place  it is not true -and I would say it is hardly loyal to say that it is- that the economic deterioration and paralysis in development of those countries described as most seriously affected is due exclusively to the rise in petroleum prices. Before oil prices were raised  there was an increase of up to 400 per cent in the cost of food-stuffs such as wheat and sugar  building materials such as steel and cement  agricultural machinery  and products derived from hydrocarbons  such as acrylics and fertilizers. But in those cases the victims were not the industrialized countries which process raw materials; the. victims were the weak peoples of the developing world  which in silence suffered the effects upon their balances of payments.50.	Nor can runaway inflation be attributed solely to the so-called energy crisis. Inflation arises when more money is minted than is justified by the production of goods and therefore the vast increase in military expenditure and wars of political hegemony have generated inflation that has inevitably been exported to the economically weaker countries. Furthermore  the system established at Bretton Woods has led to an unequal development which has further enriched the rich and impoverished the poor.51.	Finally  the rise in prices of oil and its derivatives has not affected developed countries that lack those products or have a deficit in their production such as the European countries and Japan in the same way as it has affected the United States  which depends on foreign oil imports for only about 12 per cent of its needs and whose oil companies  in the midst of the crisis  made profits of up to 800 per cent.52.	Lastly  I should like to point out that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] is not a political organization  since its members comprise countries with different systems of government and differing social goals; nor is it an ethnic organization  since in it are represented Arabs  Africans  Iranians  Asians and Latin Americans; nor is it an organization of petroleum producers  since it represents only 85 per cent of the producers; nor is it a mutual aid society  because I know of no decision which commits the wealthier among its members to render assistance to the poorer. It is simply an organization of exporters whose essential purpose is to defend prices that for many years bore no relation to the rising prices of other products while companies amassed wealth by exploiting a non-renewable resource.53.	In his message addressed to President Ford of the United States on the occasion of his statement at the beginning of the present session of the Assembly  as published in The New York Times on 25 September 1974  that great statesman who governs the destinies of Venezuela  Mr. Carlos Andres Perez  said:""Venturing to interpret the policy of OPEC  I would assure you that it is the hope of our petroleum-producing countries that an agreement between the countries producing raw materials and the industrialized countries which will be equitable and bring international justice can be reached  through a world body such as the United Nations  with a view to striking a proper and acceptable balance between the prices paid to us for the labor of the men and women of our poverty-stricken countries and those paid by our economies for the imports we require.""54.	Within OPEC there are different degrees of development  ranging from that of countries which can produce 8 million barrels daily  to that of countries  such as Ecuador  with a maximum output of 230 000 barrels daily; and from that of countries which process their hycro-carbons to countries  such as Ecuador  which have a very weak processing industry  and are therefore exporters of crude and importers of the derivatives of the refined product for which they are paying prices higher than their profits  with serious damage resulting to their balance of payments.55.	In this respect I should like to reaffirm the statement made not long ago by my Government in a communication addressed to the Secretary-General to the effect that Ecuador  with a low average production of crude  without a petrochemical industry and with a very small processing industry  is not in a position to be a capital donor merely because it is a member of OPEC. Ecuador  on the contrary  is a developing country which requires economic assistance in the form of soft loans and substantial assistance with regard to the transfer of technology.56.	Yet  there is one obvious fact that nobody can honestly deny  and that is that the rise in oil prices has had a serious impact on the world economy  not merely on small producers that export ail their crude and purchase the derivatives at high prices and on countries that have strong processing industries hut lack oil  but on all the countries of the world  and particularly on those which have no oil  whose balances of payments have been shattered  whose production has been cut because of a lack of fuel and fertilizers and whose inflation has been accelerated. Those are the countries that have ""been described as the ones most seriously affected. On the other hand  the investment of the profits obtained  as a result of the rise in the price of oil  in shares -including bank shares- in multinational companies and real estate in the developed countries has added to an inflation already seriously accelerated by the arms race and the acquisition of arms by countries which previously did not have the means to acquire them. The total figure for investment in military expenditure in the world has risen to $207 405 million  at a time when mankind faces an imminent and so far inevitable threat of tragic world-wide famine.57.	To deal with this threatening problem -the approach of famine- two international conferences have been held  under the auspices of the United Nations yet in complete autonomy  and another will be held shortly  also under United Nations auspices. I shall refer to them briefly.58.	People are forgetting that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  the first stage of which was held at Caracas this summer  had as its origin the need for the sea-bed and the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and the subsoil thereof to be used for peaceful purposes and to be exploited for the benefit of mankind  so as to promote the development of the weakest countries and avert the dangers of economic imbalances arising out of the illicit  one-sided enrichment of those nations that are technically and financially most powerful. This implies that the sea-bed under national jurisdiction is for the use and benefit of the coastal State and that the work of the Conference had chiefly to concentrate on the establishment of a legal regime and an administrative mechanism applicable to the exploitation of the vast wealth of the high seas for the benefit of mankind.59.	Yet so far interest has centered mainly on determining the extent of national jurisdiction rather than on the kinds of rights which the coastal State should exercise over its adjacent sea and the rights of mankind on the high seas. This is due to the unyielding action of countries with large fishing fleets  which desire to engage freely in their predatory activities.60.	In Caracas three positions emerged in regard to the extent of jurisdiction. The most restrictive accepts a maximum of 12 miles of territorial sea. The second position  which emerged in 1972  accepts as a compromise a territorial sea of 12 miles over which full sovereignty would be exercised and an adjacent zone of up to 200 miles that is  188 miles more without any agreement so far as to the kinds of rights which would be exercised over the adjacent zone. The only agreement is that these would not be sovereign rights  which could be exercised over the territorial sea alone. The last position -which my country maintains and which I defended on its behalf from 1955 to 1972- is based on the right of the coastal State to extend its complete sovereignty over the adjacent sea  in accordance with the geographical  geological and ecological characteristics of the coast and the economic needs of its population for up to 200 miles from the base line.61.	The expression ""200-mile sea"" lacks meaning so long as it is not known what kinds of rights can be exercised over that zone  and to prevent such confusion  Ecuador has maintained and incorporated in its laws that its territorial sea extends for 200 miles and that over that zone it exercises full sovereignty  from which it should be understood that we cannot admit of a 200-mile sea without full sovereignty  as would be the case with the exclusive economic zone or the patrimonial sea.62.	The head of State of Ecuador  General Guillermo Rodriguez Lara  in a statement of which an extract was published in the Quito newspaper El Comercio on 26 July of this year  emphasized the importance of the 200-mile territorial sea -embodied in the territorial laws of Ecuador- and affirmed that the sovereign entity of Ecuador ""is prepared to stop piracy by the powerful and fully implement our laws in regard to maritime jurisdiction.63.	The second United Nations conference held this year was the World Population Conference held at Bucharest. In our opinion  its special importance lies in the fact that it has drawn attention to the problem of the population explosion  but has left each State free to seek its own solutions. Quite obviously  a major population explosion occurring simultaneously with a reduction in food production and an increase in the cost of building materials represents a dramatic threat. The key to the problem  therefore  must be to meet the overall needs of development.64.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly  in putting forward the need for a new international economic order  set immediate and long-term targets with which the present session of the General Assembly must deal. The immediate objectives were entrusted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  who was asked to organize  as the first measure of the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI)  an emergency operation to assist the most seriously affected countries. The long- term goals were entrusted to the Ad Hoc Committee on the Special Program  which has to submit to the Economic and Social Council recommendations on the machinery and scope of the Special Fund  also established by the same resolution  which would meet the urgent needs of the most seriously affected countries but whose ultimate purpose would be to meet the overall needs of development.65.	Wherever we turn  the problem of development confronts us. Its challenge is imperative and urgent  and given this challenge we cannot play with words as children play with colored balloons. ""Coexistence""  ""co-operation""  ""interdependence"" are not mere words: they are calls to action. The simple rite of shifting our blame to a scapegoat and getting rid of it is a subterfuge: it does not really free our conscience.66.	The inexorable fact we must face is that the sixth special session charged us irrevocably with creating a new international economic order: not any order  but a just  co-ordinated and interdependent order. We know that the developed and highly industrialized countries are going through a crisis. We understand that countries which have made enormous profits from raising oil prices are entitled to do this because they were formerly exploited and impoverished. But we know that if both could agree on prudent and well-planned investments  particularly in infrastructure  in the less fortunate or less developed countries  they might dispel the threat of hunger which looms over an anxious mankind and could thus give a successful start to the new international economic order.67.	To say that the new order must be based on inter-dependence is to state the obvious  but it is also an evident truth. Interdependence means that the powerful industrial countries must learn to depend on those which they formerly exploited and that those which were formerly dependent wish to replace dependence by interdependence. The new economic order must basically be a new Order in reciprocal economic dependence.68.	Since the Industrial Revolution  the economic order has been based on the idea of empire and therefore on the colonial relationship of the extraction of cheap raw materials and the creation of expensive manufactured goods- that is  a situation of dependence. The new order must be based as far as possible on giving the previously exploited peoples the means to process their own raw materials and progressively to alter their feudal or colonial structures by increased development and better use of the riches of their soil and subsoil and of their adjacent sea.69.	Because of what I have said previously  I believe that the role of the present Assembly is of vital importance. Instead of wasting itself in sterile rhetoric or fruitless struggles  this Assembly should devote every effort of reason  imagination and  I venture to say  intuition to creating a new international economic order which will make it possible for a threatened mankind to enjoy a dignified and secure existence.70.	In concluding  may I be permitted to inject a personal note and to express my gratitude to all who have spoken so generously of my work as President of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.71.	On the decision of my Government this will be the last time that I shall speak in a general debate of the General Assembly as the representative of Ecuador. I shall  of course  continue to exercise my functions until the end of the present session. During 18 previous sessions I have shared unforgettable days in the struggle for decolonization  against racism  for the strengthening of international security  against aggression  and in favor of non-intervention. From the Assembly I have received for my country and for myself honors which had never before been conferred on citizens of my country  such as the successive chairmanship of the Special Political Committee and of the First Committee  apart from the high honor of being the first citizen of Ecuador to have been President of the General Assembly. So that I am not speaking ""with a pained voice and looking at my shadow""  as Don Francisco de Quevedo  the Spanish poet  said. I am speaking with a feeling in which humility is mixed with pride but a feeling above all of gratitude to all of you as well as hope for your future action. I believe and have often said that every man has within himself a spark of life and hope which  like a torch that has been lit  must be handed on. I place my torch here with a living flame at a time when I feel that all my vital forces are undiminished. I do so with the clear faith that I have had and still have in the destiny of an international community organized to achieve the lofty purposes which the United Nations represents."
"39",2123,"EGY",29,1974,"Mr. President  it is a source of pride and gratification for me to express to you my heart felt congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly during the current session  which is. undoubtedly considered one of the most important sessions in the history of the United Nations on account of the vital questions set before it and because of the present critical stage in the history of the relations between countries and peoples. Your election to the presidency is also to be looked upon as a compliment addressed by the United Nations to your country and to its great leader  President Houari Boumediene  who has dedicated himself to the cause of all peace-loving peoples.2.	I should like to pay a tribute to the tremendous effort exerted by your predecessor  our dear friend Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who conducted the deliberations of the previous Assembly session and of the sixth special session with wisdom  foresight and objectivity.3.	I should also like to pay tribute to the work accomplished throughout the whole of last year by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and to his devotion to the objectives and principles of the United Nations.4.	it gives me pleasure to welcome the friendly countries which have joined our Organization. The admission of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations is undoubtedly an incontestable victory for the right of all peoples to decide their own fate and to shoulder their international responsibilities in full and to undertake a positive  constructive role for the building of a better world for all of us.5.	We look forward to the declaration of the independence of the remaining countries which have been suffering for many centuries from the fetters that have bound them  depriving them of their natural right to participate effectively in decision-making which influences the future of the human race. Here  I refer in particular to the necessity of declaring the independence of Mozambique in conformity with the Lusaka Agreement. The same right has to be acknowledged in respect of the struggling people of Angola.6.	While welcoming the spirit which has motivated the Portuguese Government to abandon the old logic of colonialism and to turn a new page in the history of relations with the peoples of countries previously under Portuguese occupation  we express the hope that this trend will continue and will be consolidated in such a way that it will make it possible to achieve concrete and tangible results with respect to all Territories which are still under Portugal's domination. Then can all the African peoples turn a new page in their relations with Portugal  and only then can cooperation replace conflict and strife.7.	It is indeed deplorable to find that government in South Africa is still based on racial discrimination and on the deprivation of the African peoples  the rightful owners of their territories  of their fundamental rights  in order to serve the interests of an exploiting minority. The racist minorities in Zimbabwe and Namibia are still persisting in the policy of imposing settlers' colonialism and are still following practices designed to change the demographic structure in those regions in order to destroy their heritage and to usurp their wealth.8.	The first and foremost responsibility which we should face in our deliberations during this session and  indeed  in every session is to scrutinize and look searchingly at our world so that we may know where we stood yesterday  where we stand today and in which direction we are to proceed in the near and distant future. It behooves each of us to envisage the development of the world in the future and to evaluate the events of the past. It is on the basis of this mutual assessment of the past and of the future that we can reach an identical  or at least common  view of inter-national situations  thus enabling each Member State to define for itself the course it can follow  the burdens it can assume and the challenges it can accept within the framework of efforts to achieve common goals.9.	Representatives probably know that our concept of the future -be it the result of an individual or a common endeavor- should be governed by rules of legality and morality. The fusion of these two essential elements should be the basis on which we deal with reality and govern our policies  otherwise we would fall prey to day-dreams and  surrendering to illusions  would build our palaces on sand  to be shattered by the winds and transformed into a series of frustrated hopes. 10.	The tremendous scientific achievements of humanity in recent years have provided us with new criteria which should govern our evaluation of the future in the light of our past and present experience. Suffice it to refer here to the principles and methodology employed by the science of ""futurology""  so that our vision of the future of international relations may not be based on star-gazing  speculation or guesswork.11.	A quick glance at the world in the past few years reveals that the most important development on the international scene is the emergence of what has been termed ""detente"". Opinions are divided about detente  for there are Members who view it with optimism as the peace which will save humanity from the scourge of war  violence and hatred  while others deny that it can lead to anything good for human society. Perhaps the non-aligned countries are more entitled than others to have their say about this new element in international relations  since they were the first to call for the reduction of tension and to stress the necessity of lessening the danger of confrontation  which can result in nothing but catastrophe for us all. They were also the first to seek a common ground where all peoples could come together in peace and express their creative faculties in the service of the welfare of all humanity.12.	Perhaps the best attitude to be adopted towards detente is to insist that its application should conform to its theory and that its implementation should be a fulfillment of expectations. Detente should continue and should be consolidated in the interest of all  yet not at the expense of anybody. We do not look upon detente as a matter which concerns the two superPowers more than others; it concerns us all to the same degree since it affects the features of international relations in the present and  to say the least  in the near future. In fact  this doubles the responsibility of the two super-Powers to contribute to the solution of all urgent  burning problems since interdependence prevails in the world of today and it has become impossible for a country or for any group of countries  no matter how strong they may be in the political  economic or military fields  to live detached from the rest of the world. It should by now be impossible for them to imagine that they can act as if they were on an isolated island where they cannot be affected by events in the world at large.13.	It is imperative  in the light of these conditions  that each of us should have support for the role he plays within the international community. It should also be clear that there is no place on the international scene for those who just watch and observe. All of us must insist on rejecting any system by which a country or a group of countries would have the exclusive authority to take decisions that affect the destinies of peoples  because such a monopoly can only lead to abuse of responsibility. Participation in authority and the sharing of responsibility are both a right and a duty for us all  and this necessitates a full participation of all from the very start in decision-making  so that we do not find ourselves confronted with a fait accompli that has been dictated to us and for which we can find no solution. It is wrong to assume that others would willingly acknowledge our right to positive participation  for such a right is to be practiced and not to be granted. Such a course is made increasingly clear by the continuous experience of every day and is becoming a firmly rooted tradition in international relations.14.	Egypt  being one of the oldest civilizations known in human history  is perfectly willing and prepared to shoulder all its international responsibilities with all the risks and sacrifices that this may entail  and it reaffirms once more its basic and fundamental commitment to the struggle to be waged along with all peace-loving peoples that are aspiring to freedom in various parts of the world.15.	Egypt has established it is foreign policy on the basis and within the framework of humanitarian ideals which recognize no discrimination and no isolationism. Thus the Arab movement is a positive one  in full interaction with all human aspirations and movements; it is a movement which keeps pace with events and does not stand against the tide of history.16.	Our obligation regarding the future of Africa is in essence a human obligation  because it grows out of the fraternal links and organic ties between peoples brought together by civilization  history  aspirations and common interests. We may perhaps all agree that the countries of the African continent have been able within a short period  after having shaken off the evils of colonialism  to set an example in the sense of responsibility  good judgment and foresight. It is obvious to all of us that the achievements of our African peoples throughout the limited years  be they on the regional or international level  are achievements that enrich human experience.17.	In a broader context  the non-aligned countries  despite obstacles and challenges  have been able to consolidate the gains which they had achieved in the past in the interest of all humanity. They have remained in the vanguard of the forces which are attempting to rationalize international conduct and to base it on criteria that should lessen egoism  domination and dictating of terms. We firmly believe that many of the problems with which we are still living today could have been solved  had the countries of the third world been able to overcome the obstacles put in their way and had they been able to neutralize the elements that benefit from the continuation and aggravation of those problems. We are confident that the non-aligned countries will in the near future play a role of no less importance than that which they have played in the past.18.	It is within this framework that Egypt conducts its relations with all countries of the world full of confidence and without complex. Consequently  Egypt  while determined not to become a sphere of influence for anybody  is capable of extending its international co-operation in various directions. Egypt honors all its obligations and responsibilities in the same spirit in which it safeguards its rights. In its relations with all peoples of the world Egypt determines its policy in the basic belief that there are no insurmountable problems between Egypt and any other peace-loving people  and that there are no conflicts or contradictions that are impossible to overcome.19.	Egypt  has followed these principles in its relations with the two super-Powers  the pillars of the policy of detente. Bilateral relations with the Soviet Union are founded on friendship and mutual cooperation. We have appreciation for the Soviet people and their leadership in siding with the Egyptian people on their march towards social and economic development and their support of the Arab nation in its legitimate struggle to regain its territories and to repel aggression.20.	At the same time  Egypt has welcomed the relative change that has taken place in the American attitude as a result of the glorious October war  and viewed it as a step in the right direction which is worthy of response. As a re ult  Egypt has restored the channels of communication between the two countries and has also responded to the American efforts in the field of disengagement on the Egyptian and Syrian fronts. These efforts have resulted in military agreements which help to consolidate the fragile and the dangerous cease-fire that existed before. Despite the fact that the American policy towards the Middle East still leaves much to be desired  we are anxious to give America every opportunity to bring that policy into greater harmony with right  law and principle.21.	As a parallel to that  we have welcomed the constructive role played by the European countries after they realized the facts of the situation and understood its dimensions. For our part  we look forward to enlarging this role  now and in the future  for the sake of peace  justice and common interests. Undoubtedly  the European community  which has suffered the scourge of wars and destruction  and which throughout its existence has maintained historical  cultural and economic ties with our region  is qualified to contribute a great deal to the establishment of peace and prosperity in the region.22.	Egypt has responded to the readiness of European countries to strengthen our ties of co-operation  and has established close contacts with each and all of them. Egypt has also reacted positively to the desire of the European group to establish a dialog with the Arab countries  so that co-operation between the two groups may reach a level that would ensure the welfare of all their peoples and open new horizons for wider and more extensive international co-operation. While we welcome this Arab-European cooperation  we do not believe that it should be confined to one particular field  because all fields of co-operation and exchange are interlinked and it is difficult to separate them.23.	As far as we are concerned  the European continent is of strategic importance: in the first place  because the security of the Middle East region is closely linked with the security of Europe and is affected by whatever happens in Europe  and vice versa. Economic and cultural interests are also interlinked in such a way that they have to be molded within a framework of co-operation and interdependence.24.	I agree with the words of my colleague and friend the Foreign Minister of France  Mr. Jean Sauvagnargues  who stated before this Assembly a few days ago:""This type of co-operation that we are both trying to establish does set an example and opensup a promising outlook. It is a question of working together  with all the participants on an equal footing  towards social and economic progress. The undertaking must not interfere with the interests of any country."" [2238th meeting  para. 154.]25.	As a parallel to this enlightened peUcy  Egypt has followed a course founded on the open-door economic policy that aims at consolidating co-operation with all peoples that are prepared to deal with us on the basis of equality  interdependence and mutual interest. It is a policy that does not discriminate between countries and peoples; it is also a policy that does not affect to any degree the path of socialist transformation which we have chosen for ourselves as a system to achieve development and to secure the future of every Egyptian citizen. Thinking and moving  as we do  within this framework  we have been sorry to hear from this rostrum and elsewhere  during the past few days  statements which have proved  from various experiences since the end of the Second World War  to be impractical and to lead to nowhere.26.	We were told that some countries were manipulating basic human needs for the sake of narrow national interests; that the use of some raw materials as a political weapon and the imposition of the oil embargo against certain countries were policies that might eventually lead to confrontation instead of cooperation. It was even claimed that the fragile framework of international economic co-operation would be exposed to danger if the oil-producing countries continued their present pricing policies. We have heard the new thesis that the high cost of oil is not the result of the dynamics of economic factors but of political and selfish decisions that have not taken international interests into consideration.27.	The advocates of this theory want us to forsake reason and to believe the following: first  that oil is the only raw material the price of which has gone up; secondly  that the rise in oil prices has resulted in a spiraling rise in th? prices of substitute materials and of manufactured goods; thirdly  that the rise in the prices of oil products was not due to economic factors; fourthly  that there is an implicit assumption that the Arab oil-producing countries are the only producers that have raised their oil prices; fifthly  that the industrially advanced countries are the ones that deserve attention and protection  because the rest of the countries of the world depend upon them in meeting their needs for manufactured goods.28.	We should have expected that everyone had grasped the profound quantitative and qualitative changes witnessed by the world and realized that the peoples that obtained their independence at the cost of many sacrifices cannot permit any encroachment upon their sovereignty  or any return of guardianship over them under a new guise; nor can they be content with only a facade of political independence. 29.	The following established and indisputable facts should be recognized. First  oil prices rose only after the prices of other raw materials and manufactured goods had gone up. Secondly  the industrially developed countries exclusively have controlled international prices through speculation and monopolies  regardless of the requirements of world social and economic development. Thirdly  the Arabs were not the only ones to raise their oil prices but joined with other producers if different parts of the world in so doing. At the same time  it is obvious that the international monetary system established at Bretton Woods in 1944 has not lived up to the world's expectations. Finally  when the Arabs decided to mobilize their oil to serve their struggle for their destiny  they did not manipulate the destinies of other peoples. They feel nothing but love and sympathy for all other peoples  but when they did follow such a course  that was in response to a foolish policy adopted by some statesmen without any consideration for Arab interests and their feeling. They also used their oil only within the limits that would secure their legitimate rights.30.	The following facts should not escape bur attention. First  the Arab countries did not take any action relating to oil supplies until after they had warned the countries which assist Israel in maintaining the occupation of Arab territories in defiance of the international will and the resolutions of the United Nations. Secondly  the Arab countries lifted the oil embargo immediately after the countries against which it was imposed -and in particular the United States- had changed their attitude and had directed their policy towards contributing to a just and lasting settlement of the problem. Thirdly  some of the statesmen in the developed countries are attempting  before their peoples  to put the blame on the Arabs with respect to inflation  either to evade responsibility for facing the internal situation or to seek the favor of some pressure groups which find it in their interests to launch a campaign against the Arabs.31.	We would have expected everyone to realize the profound change brought about by the glorious war of October  and the far-reaching effects which that war brought about militarily  politically  economically and psychologically. The proper thing to do was to create the circumstances conducive to a peaceful settlement. In that respect  it would have been preferable to take immediate decisions to stop providing Israel with unlimited shipments of arms. This policy has contributed to heightening Israeli arrogance.32.	It may perhaps be appropriate to refer here to a voice which was raised in the United States of America  calling for wisdom and rationality. The voice was that of Senator James Abourezk  when he addressed a meeting of the United States-Arab Chamber of Commerce on 25 September 1974. In his speech Senator Abourezk said:""It is clearly in the interests of humanity  as well as of the United States  that we stop furnishing warplanes  missiles  napalm  phosphorus bombs and the money used to provide these weapons to Israel  so long as Israel continues its mission of destruction of innocent civilians and of their crops in Southern Lebanon/*The Senator went on:""It is clearly in the interest of the United States to bring about a durable peace in the Middle East  rather than the present political stalemate which will once again ignite bloody conflicts in that part of the world.""33.	The problem of high prices of goods is much more complicated and deep than we think. It is not confined to one commodity to the exclusion of others  and it does not relate to one producing country or a group of countries. It affects the whole world. In the final analysis  this question cannot be tackled on the basis of isolating its political factors from economic considerations or vice versa  for it is a mixture of both.34.	International relations are established on the basis of mutual interest and not on dictation  domination and threats. Political decisions should reflect a sense of responsibility and should be based on an exchange of interests. The industrially advanced countries would be under an illusion if they imagined that they could expose the ""security of developing nations to danger or that they could continue to manipulate their wealth and expect them to remain idle.35.	As the Foreign Minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Mr. Gromyko  has rightly stated before this Assembly a few days ago:""The general state of world affairs is being molded by a tremendous number of factors  ranging from political and military to national or even psychological factors. And it therefore hardly lends itself to one-dimensional assessment."" [2240th meeting  para. 125.]36.	The attempt to distort the reputation of Arab countries and defame them will only lead to widening the gap between the parties concerned and this is bound to delay reaching a balanced solution that can guarantee the common interests of all peoples in all corners of the world. The assumption that developing nations will continue to surrender to injustice  suppression and pressure is a dangerous one and it is of the utmost danger because it can only lead to a series of explosions and armed conflicts and an economic and psychological struggle which can only result  in the long run  in a deterioration of international relations which would engulf us all in the worst of consequences.37.	Let us discuss matters rationally and listen to a sincere voice emanating from a rational source which belongs to the third world. Let us listen to the Foreign Minister of Peru  Mr. de la Flor Valle  when he says:""It becomes apparent in the multidimensional struggle of the countries of the third world to create a new international economic order which takes concrete form in the defense and recovery of natural resources;"" [2238th meeting  para. 172.]38.	I wish also to quote the Foreign Minister of France  Mr. Jean Sauvagnargues  when he said:""In this connexion the right of the third world countries not only to receive a fairer share of the fruits of economic and world progress but also to influence the choices on which this activity depends cannot be contested."" [Ibid.  para. 149.]39.	Let us listen also to another rightful piece of testimony coming from the representative of one of the developed industrialized countries. Mr. James Callaghan  the British Foreign Secretary  said the following a few days ago:""The unprecedented world-wide economic boom of recent years led to higher commodity prices prior to the recent increases in world oil prices."" [2240th meeting  para. 219.] 40.	This session is worthy of being distinguished from previous sessions. It should not be just a quantitative addition of another pile of papers to the records of the United Nations. There is nothing more worthy of the attention of this session than the Palestinian people. So  let us make this session ""the session of the people of Palestine"". Let us see to it that history will record that we have directed all our energies and resources towards safeguarding the right of an entire people to maintain their entity  to decide their fate and to continue their creative march together with other peoples working for the establishment of a better world.41.	The international community has committed an historical error by ignoring this people and denying that they existed after they were uprooted from their homeland. History is witness to the fact that throughout the ages Jews have never enjoyed more magnanimity and brotherhood than that which they enjoyed from the people of the Arab world when they lived with them; Jewish culture has never flourished more than it has under the umbrella of the Arab countries  where there has never been any discrimination  persecution or racism.42.	The international community persisted in the error by considering the Palestinian people  victims of oppression  as only groups of refugees deserving of nothing but mercy and pity. Authenticity and the history of the Palestinian people have protected them from disintegration and dispersal.43.	Despite the labyrinth in which the Palestinian people have lived in the twentieth century  they are more determined than ever to exist and to face all challenges with rare courage. Today  the Palestinian people stand with dignity  capable of shouldering their international responsibility and participating in the construction of the new life in the Middle East.44.	When we consider the facts of the situation and look at the cause of the Palestinian people in its proper perspective as first and foremost a political matter  we are neither granting these people a right nor bestowing upon them a privilege; we are correcting an historical error which we committed against them and against the whole of humanity. To withhold the recognition of the natural rights of a people would be tantamount to the humiliation of the whole of mankind. The structure of humanity is indivisible  and we cannot deal with the fate of peoples on the basis of double standards which give or deny without reasoning.45.	The Palestinian people are capable of seizing their own rights and of imposing their will  but it would be better for us to give their movement international legitimacy instead of imposing upon them the task of struggling outside that framework of legitimacy. By virtue of their long history of dealing with situations and facing reality objectively and without evasiveness the Palestinian people are qualified to assume this task. They realize that the glorious war of 6 October has opened new horizons for all the Arabs and has for the first time afforded an opportunity to reach a just and permanent peace in the area that would make it possible for its people to devote their attention to development  and to the task of economic and social transformation which is needed to make their future secure.46.	For those reasons  we suggest that the General Assembly should discuss the cause of the Palestinian people during this session on. the basis that it is the essence of the problem  with the following principles as guidelines: first  the reaffirmation of the basic and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the rejection of any neglect or usurpation of those rights; secondly  the reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination without any outside intervention and to securing their national independence and their right to return to their homeland I am sure that the General Assembly will call upon the Palestine Liberation Organization  as the representative of the Palestinian people  to take part in the debate in the General Assembly when the Palestinian question is to be discussed; and thirdly  the reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinian people to use all means to achieve their basic rights in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.47.	We should recollect that President Mohammed Anwar El-Sadat stated when the fighting was going on in Sinai and the Golan Heights:""We are not war adventurers  we are peace- seekers; and we are not fighting to launch aggression on other people's lands  but we have fought and will continue to fight to attain two objectives: first  the full restoration of all our lands that have been under occupation since 1967; second  the finding of means to restore and ensure respect of the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine.""48.	This is our basic and established policy from which we will never deviate. When we talk about peace  and work for peace  we mean genuine peace that tackles the essence of the problem and ends the cause of conflict  and not simply a peace that only addresses itself to superficial symptoms. The problem has transcended temporary and partial solutions which are intended to prolong the period of the truce -a truce that has not prevented three wars from breaking out in less than 20 years and has failed to pave the way for peace.49.	We agree that there are certain ethical principles to be followed in international relations and policies that should be respected in the interest of international life. The first of these is that .aggression should not go unpunished. And therefore we do not allow Israel to commit aggression and to go unpunished  let alone being allowed to reap the fruits of that aggression. Israel should pay for the destruction which has been inflicted on the cities of Suez  Ismailia  Port Said  Quneitra and other civilian targets50.	Furthermore  economic piracy and the looting of natural resources is something which cannot be tolerated. Therefore  Israel will bear full responsibility for sapping our natural resources; I refer here in particular to the oil and other resources that have been stolen from Sinai.51.	I have declared on more than one occasion that Egypt did not and will not accept the state of ""no peace  no war"". I repeat this here  from this rostrum  because such a state of affairs can only serve aggressive Israel; it does not serve peace  and Egypt rejects it categorically. If anyone should try to maintain such a state of affairs  he would discover that his calculations were based on a gross error and an unsound estimate.52.	We want a just and lasting peace and we are not asking too much in demanding that the peace should be just  for experience has proved that unless peace is just it cannot be durable because it fails to become implanted in the conscience of the nation and it fails to create the proper mental and psychological environment for coexistence between peoples. It is  indeed  deplorable that Israel should not have thoroughly absorbed this fact. Israel's accumulated arrogance and conceit and its superiority complex and desire for expansion have made it impossible for Israel to digest the lessons to be learned from the October war of 1973 in all its dimensions. We still hear every day statements by the officials in Israel threatening that they will not relinquish the lands that they have occupied by force and their audacity has reached the point of denying the very existence Of the Palestinian people. It is  indeed  a mockery that Israel should argue about the recognition of the Palestinian people at a time when it demands more international recognition for itself. Thus positions are reversed and the intruder who has unjustly implanted himself in the area claims for himself what he denies to the owners of the land.53.	To all these Israeli hysterical and desperate cries we say:""Stop that  because it will not do you any good. If you are genuinely seeking to coexist peacefully with the peoples of the area  it is imperative that you discard those reckless tendencies now and for ever. You should not be deceived because some are still supplying you with their assistance and flooding you with charity  giving you arms in limitless quantities. All this is not going to realize for you the dream which apparently you are still entertaining  namely  breaking the Arab will and forcing the Arab people to surrender to your conditions. All this can only produce a prolongation of the conflict  complicating it beyond solution. You will have only yourselves to blame if you later regret wasting this golden opportunity to reach an honorable solution. Look around you  you will see a wall of international refusal of your expansionist and aggressive intentions. You will find a collective denunciation of your shameful conduct which spurs you to attack women and children in villages and in peaceful camps.""54.	There is no alternative to a return .to the truth  logic and international law. And it is futile to cling to traces of the past with their misleading mirage and their unrealized dreams. The destiny of peoples can only be decided on the basis of the just truth and not on the basis of unjust illusions.55.	Orr our part  we have firmly resolved to enter the battle for peace with the same determination that led us to engage in fighting  for our objective in both cases is one and the same: the liberation of our occupied land and the achievement of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. It is for this reason that we have welcomed the convening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  which is in fact a practical echo of an idea submitted by President Anwar El-Sadat.56.	We should remember and it is always beneficial to remember that Egypt was the first country which agreed to the convening of the Geneva Conference  and we went there with a sincere heart. We still believe that it is the appropriate formula for discussing all aspects of the question and for reaching a comprehensive and permanent solution to the crisis. Egypt therefore is ready to go to that Conference at the nearest suitable time after the completion of the preparation for the resumption of the Conference on the part of Egypt and others and in the light of Egypt's responsibility to bear the greatest burden in moving towards a just peace in the area  as well as the special responsibility of the two super-Powers with respect to Security Council resolutions and for the maintenance of international peace and security.57.	It is only natural that  while we are exerting our efforts to establish peace in the area  we should also seek to establish a zone free of nuclear weapons in the Middle East  so as to strengthen peace in that area. This should be parallel to the efforts that are being exerted to encourage the establishment of such zones on the regional level  in order to pave the way to general and complete disarmament.58.	We all know that the countries of the Middle East are regarded at present as non-nuclear Powers and that they are unwilling to direct their resources towards the production of nuclear weapons  with the exception  that is  of Israel. Israel has refused so far to take any step towards acceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]  despite the fact that the majority of the countries in the area have gone a long way towards acceding to that Treaty. That in itself is sufficient to demonstrate and to prove the expansionist intentions of Israel. Israel's refusal to accede to the Treaty explains why Egypt  after having signed it  has not yet ratified it. Should this state of affairs continue  it will constitute a great danger and threat to security and to peace. Speedy action is therefore called for in order to close this gap. The responsibility of the two super-Powers in this respect is a fundamental one  because of their special position in the Treaty and their responsibility  together with the rest of the permanent members of the Security Council  for the maintenance of international peace and security. I should like to repeat here what I have already said  namely  that Egypt is prepared to ratify the Treaty when Israel agrees to accede to it and to adhere to its provisions.59.	We are of the opinion that when we submit this question jointly with Iran [A/9693 and Add.l and 2] for discussion at our present session  we should concentrate on three basic principles: first  on an obligation not to introduce nuclear weapons to the area in any form whatsoever; secondly  on an obligation on the part of the nuclear Powers not to use nuclear weapons against countries of the area  and not to introduce nuclear wear HIS into that area; and thirdly  on the establishment of an appropriate safeguards system to guarantee the fulfillment of these obligations.60.	Within this framework  the whole area and its peoples can be made secure against the dangers of nuclear destruction  and at the same time nuclear energy can be used for peaceful purposes in accordance with the provisions of the non-proliferation Treaty and the guarantees provided for therein.61.	We cannot speak of the Middle East without expressing our deep regret at the sad events that have taken place in Cyprus  resulting in the undermining of the legitimacy and peace of that non-aligned country. We have ties of affection with the people of Cyprus; we are linked by proximity  common interest and a desire for mutual security. We firmly believe that there is no way to restore peace to the various parts of the island without a return to legitimacy and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus. There should be no interference from outside in its affairs  and the two communities of the nation should be left to decide freely their own internal affairs.62.	The non-aligned countries have taken it upon themselves to play an active and positive role in deploying the necessary efforts towards .reaching a solution to the crisis  in the light of these principles and free from all ambition  selfishness and desire to toy with the destinies of peoples. In doing so  the (ion- aligned countries are seeking a quick end to the sufferings of the tens of thousands of Cypriots who have been rendered homeless and who have had imposed upon them the tragedies of a war they did not want  a war in the decision of which they have had no part.63.	When we concentrate our attention on the Middle East and the events and developments of that region  we do not overlook the fact that there are other questions to which we should also devote much of our attention; for we believe in the indivisibility of the struggle of peoples for liberation and for ridding themselves of foreign domination and exploitation. We believe in the unity of mankind's destiny  and our relationships with the countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America are friendly relationships based on fundamental principles. We therefore regard with great attention the events in IndoChina and we demand strict adherence to the Parts Agreement concerning Viet Nam.64.	We also urge  that the peoples of Cambodia and Laos be left to decide their own affairs without dictation or pressure from abroad  since the bitter experiences of the past have proved that foreign intervention leaves behind it nothing but more conflict  more devastation  more suffering. We also hope that the foreign forces will be withdrawn from South Korea and that the Korean people in both the North and the South will be left to decide their own affairs  free from provocation or intervention.65.	The General Assembly at this session is faced with one of the most important tests it has had to meet since the emergence of the United Nations as a means for the expression of the international will and as an instrument for serving the cause of peace and cooperation among nations and peoples. In view of the pressing problems that face the world today  we cannot bury our heads in the sand and we cannot afford to be blind to the facts of the situation  for if we do  we shall be paralyzed or able to do very little -and too late.66.	The test before us is clear and there is no ambiguity about it: either we side with the cause of peace  freedom and progress  or we waste this opportunity -which may be the last for the fulfillment of humanity's hopes  thus ruining the dreams of coming generations.67.	I appeal to this august Assembly -and I am filled with hope- to rise to the level of its responsibility and to the level of the international events at this turning-point in history  and to fulfill the expectations of the peoples we have the honor to represent  so that their confidence in the United Nations and their respect for its principles and objectives may be restored."
"40",2192,"ESP",29,1974,"As representative of Spain to this session of the General Assembly  I should like first  Sir  to congratulate you on your election as President. Your personal qualifications are very well known and highly appreciated  as are your tireless efforts towards better understanding among peoples  and especially your efforts to benefit the developing countries.150.	I greet and congratulate also the people and Government of Algeria  an Arab country with which we have all kinds of ties and with which we maintain today fruitful co-operation.151.	I should like to congratulate also Mr. Leopoldo Benites on the skillful and wise way in which he guided the work of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session.152.	On behalf of the Government and people of Spain  I welcome the new States which at this session have joined our Organization: Grenada  Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau.153.	I should also like to express our condolences to Honduras and the other countries of the region on the catastrophe they have suffered. We wish to express our sympathy to our sister Republic and to assure it of our solidarity. The Government and people of Spain have already given some emergency aid. 154.	The year that has elapsed since the last session has witnessed some striking events which will doubtless bring about a profound change in contemporary international relations. Along with the changes that have occurred in the direction of the public affairs of various countries  there has been an acceleration of the process of decolonization that has facilitated the legitimate access of new nations to international life  thus removing one of the most dangerous causes of conflict undermining the maintenance of peace.155.	A series of unprecedented economic events has made clear the urgent need for a just and rational use of the resources of the world. Similarly  it is necessary  as part of that effort  to adopt regulations governing the use of the sea as a source of wealth  without disturbing the ecology of the marine environment through exaggerated claims or improper exploitation. Joint action in all those sectors must be compatible with the interests of everyone  thereby eliminating reasons for conflict. Undoubtedly we are moving in that direction through the efforts designed to achieve an equitable exchange of goods and products. An example of that is the sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and resources  a session which attempted to lay the bases for co-operation between producers and consumers and for assistance to the least-endowed countries.156.	If those efforts and others with the same aim succeed  we shall have taken a large step towards the international organization of a new political and economic order. But mankind has an inexhaustible capacity to find new problems and thus faces new questions in meeting the issues that historically have been created by the distribution of the land and its resources. Today* it is the violence and subversion carried out by a few against the organization which the others have created. That has become a new battlefield  and concerted international action against it is required.157.	During the past year Spain has suffered the loss of its Prime Minister through assassination. All the facts lead us to think that those who perpetrated that crime have their base and have taken refuge in a foreign country.158.	This experience and other similar experiences suffered by ourselves and by many countries demonstrate the urgent need for international co-operation in preventing and punishing terrorism and-subversion.159.	The universal crisis of values is responsible for the rise in terrorism  subversion and violence as political weapons. The course of contemporary history has given rise to a loss of faith in moral concepts  contempt for the human being  pessimism and despair among the masses  and this despite the considerable material progress achieved. For their part  Governments  lacking adequate means and chary of internal political complications  neglect their co-operation and practically refuse it in cases where they are not directly involved. This selfish lack of solidarity may endanger peace and security.160.	The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations—General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) -proclaims that it is the duty of every State not to tolerate terrorist or subversive activities directed against other States. Yet we cannot in future simply enunciate general principles for the conduct of States to prevent subversive action directed from their territories against those of others. We must go on to effective measures which will prevent those activities from acquiring substance within one country and with impunity projecting themselves on others  with total disregard for the fundamental duty of every State to comply with the obligations imposed by international law  and to have these complied with by all those who reside in their territory  both nationals and foreigners.161.	This must not make us forget that there are many unjust situations throughout the world  that there are many legitimate claims  and that means must be devised to act positively to solve those problems. In this connexion  international co-operation again offers channels which should be studied and used because  unless we go to the root of what continue to be the causes of tension and conflict  the motives for violence will subsist in part. My delegation intends to reiterate and expand on these views in the relevant committee of the General Assembly.162.	On reviewing the international issues most closely affecting Spain  I must give preference to those questions on which the United Nations has acted with all its authority and in regard to which I have to report to this General Assembly.163.	I shall refer in the first place to Western Sahara which Spain administers. I think it appropriate to make it clear above all that on this matter Spain has no dispute or controversy with any country in particular  since all States Members of this Organization are equally bound by the resolutions which advocate self-determination as the appropriate means to bring about decolonization of this Territory. Iii the process of the self-determination  which brings the United Nations closer to its objective of universality  the indigenous peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories are the undoubted protagonists  while the administering Powers have a dual responsibility  not only to the population  but also towards the international community as a whole. TQ the peoples under their administration they have an obligation to create the material conditions and the conditions of political development which will enable those peoples to exercise their right to self-determination and independence and an obligation to guarantee the free exercise of that right. Their responsibility to the international community is to ensure that the process is carried out pursuant to the rules embodied in the Charter and in General Assembly resolutions  and with the participation of this Organization. 164.	In the last 12 months a series of important events have occurred in relation to Western Sahara on which my Government has duly reported to the Secretary-General. During the twenty-eighth session the Permanent Representative of Spain to the United Nations  on 28 September 1973 2 communicated the letter from the General Assembly of the Sahara to the Spanish head of State  and his reply. The General Assembly of the Sahara requested then that ""in a continuous manner an impetus be given to the process which will effectively ensure the possibility for the people of the Sahara to decide their own future"". In this request and in the reply of the Government  the Spanish position  repeatedly stated here  was confirmed. It is that the Saharan people alone are the masters of their destiny  that no one must oppose their will  and that it is up to Spain to set in motion the process of self-determination.165.	After appropriate consultations with the representatives of the indigenous population  the Spanish Government announced the holding of a referendum under the auspices and supervision of the United Nations within the first six months of 1975  to be carried out in accordance with the steps set out by this General Assembly in resolution 3162 (XXVIII) and previous resolutions on the Sahara question. It communicated this to the Secretary-General by letters from the representative of Spain dated 20 August [AJ97I4] and 13 September 1974 [AI9736].166.	The Government of Spain has adopted and is adopting"" specific measures to guarantee to the indigenous inhabitants of the Sahara the free and genuine expression of their will so that they alone  in accordance with the relevant resolutions  will exercise that right. At the same time we have initiated contacts with Morocco  Mauritania and Algeria  for the purposes provided for in the resolutions of this General Assembly.167: We have been at pains to keep the Arab Governments informed of all these events and decisions  in recognition of their close friendship for Spain and the ties of blood  religion and culture which unites the Arab countries with  the Saharan people. We know that our attitude has been understood and we feel sure that our intentions will be duly appreciated by the Arab Governments  whose views we esteem highly.168.	In regard to the ability and right of the Saharan population to determine their own future  the inter-national community has expressed itself through this Organization in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly . Some States have claimed they have special interests in and title to the Sahara  the relative value of which is today illustrated by the claims and counter-claims which have repeatedly been stated before this Organization. But the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the Organization have never doubted the personality of its population  nor has that majority tried to predetermine their future with exclusive options which in practice would imply the negation of the right to self-determination  which has been clearly proclaimed and recognized in every vote taken in this forum. Accordingly  the Government of Spain is pleased today to say to the General Assembly that the preparation of the referendum will be carried out in accordance with the directives contained in General Assembly resolutions  since we consider them to be the most suitable to ensure that the Saharan population may express its will independently.169.	The referendum will thus be the decisive mile-stone in- the historical development of the Saharan people and their relationship with Spain  and will put an end to the divergences of view which have been expressed with regard to the Territory  because the freely expressed will of the population will place the stamp of legitimacy on whichever option prevails.170.	Such co-operation with the Saharan people to enable it to take the road it finally decides upon will be the culmination of a long labor of promotion and development  which is now evident  since this population has been given the opportunity to accede to international life by the peaceful course of self-determination.171.	In sum  Spain intends to respect the will of the Saharan people  the manifestation of which will take place with all internal and international guarantees  in accordance with the resolutions of this Organization  and we shall develop our co-operation with the countries of the area—Morocco  Mauritania and Algeria -so that they may become a factor for peace and progress in the region with which Spain feels so closely bound.	£ \172.	My delegation reserves its right to refute in the relevant Committee the allegations made which would tend to render difficult or place condition^ on the exercise of self-determination by the Saharan people  and we shall correct the inaccuracies stated on facts and data relating to the Sahara.173.	Now I am bound to refer to the serious and long-standing problem of Gibraltar which affects the territorial integrity of my country  the security in that geographic zone  and the moral authority of this Organization  whose resolutions are ignored by a State Member which is a permanent member of the Security Council. 174.	Unlike the question of the Sahara  in regard to which the United Nations advocates self-determination for the decolonization of the Territory  the question of Gibraltar has always been considered  in the relevant resolutions of this Organization  as a conflict between two States  Spain and the United Kingdom  which must clear up the problem of Spanish sovereignty and territorial integrity  which is implicit in the decolonization of the Rock.175.	I shall not go into a history of the negotiations and incidents which have succeeded each other year after year in the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  in the Fourth Committee and in the plenary meetings of successive General Assembly sessions since 1966  nor shall I quote the conclusive text of accumulated resolutions. The documentation is clear  specific and public  as are the rights and will of Spain to negotiate in respect of the legitimate interests of the population. I am not afraid that I shall exaggerate if I add that what is also clear and public is the certainty that the other party has not so far shown that it is prepared seriously to seek a reasonable  just and effective solution.176.	General Assembly resolution 2429 (XXIII) indicated that 1 October 1969 was the deadline for the decolonization of Gibraltar. Five years have elapsed since then. This situation cannot go on indefinitely because it implies failure to comply with the obligation imposed on the colonial Power by the Charter  the resolutions of this Organization  and its membership in it  and because of the requirements of security  dignity and the public opinion of my country.177.	Spain has adopted every possible peaceful attitude in regard to this problem. We have stated and defended our rights before this supreme international Organization and we have sought a formula for a solution by means of bilateral contacts with the United Kingdom safeguarding the interests of the present population.178.	I shall now refer to the latest events which have occurred in relation to this matter. The consensus which was adopted by this General Assembly on 14 December 1973* called on both parties to report to the Secretary-General and to this General Assembly session on the result of the negotiations which were to be undertaken. I regret it profoundly  but it is my duty to inform the Assembly that there has been absolutely no result since there were even no negotiations.179.	The report of the Secretary-General of 8 August 1974 states that on 30 and 31 May of this year  in Madrid  new talks were held between the officers of the two Governments. To dispel any error  I wish to inform the Assembly that in fact the Government of the United Kingdom  in April last  proposed holding talks at the level of diplomatic officers as ""the best means to carry out the provisions of the consensus of 1973 on Gibraltar"".180.	Although the consensus doubtless referred to genuine negotiations on the substantive question of decolonization  in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2429 (XXIII)  we wished to accede to this request for talks as proof of our good will and with the hope that those exploratory contacts proposed by the British Government might contribute to a'Start of genuine negotiations.181.	We were soon able to note that the British side was not prepared to go into the substantive question. The British representatives limited themselves to a specific but marginal item and to a request that Spain should facilitate over-flights of the security air zone neighboring on Gibraltar. Thus it was a claim to create a transit right  which virtually implied a new claim further to consolidate British colonial presence on Gibraltar. In return  it was suggested to us that that would increase the affection of the present population of Gibraltar towards Spain.182.	The offers and guarantees of Spain to respect the legitimate interests of those inhabitants by a special regime are well known. Brandishing the interests of the inhabitants  as was done initially  or their will or desires  as was done lately  is but a pretext to perpetuate colonial occupation; Their interests will remain guaranteed. What cannot be alleged is that they have any right to decide or dispose of a territory which never belonged to them and where they were introduced by the occupying Power serving its military bases  when the real population  the indigenous Spanish population was expelled. The question of Gibraltar is a question of territorial sovereignty to be decided in accordance with the resolutions of this Organization  and only the States concerned are legitimately authorized to do so as the parties to the Utrecht Treaty of 1713  who are exclusively entitled to decide on the consequences of its obsolescence.183.	The United Kingdom has never manifested any desire to negotiate. It invoked the consensus in the General Assembly to give the impression of abiding by it when its true intention was to evade it. With this evasive attitude  the United Kingdom  doubtless consistent with its strategy of a presence on theGibraltar Strait  renders difficult the prevalence of the necessary relaxation of tension for complete stability in the western Mediterranean  and this runs counter to the present requirements of international life and is hardly propitious for the survival of positions of domination and advantage. While a foreign country continues to hold a strategic enclave to influence it politically  exerts an implicit control over navigation and increases its military powers  its purposes are not exactly those of co-operation but of preponderance.184.	The Gibraltar base represents a threat to Spain because it disturbs security as a result of the competing greeds which are created  and is therefore a continuous challenge to the policy of peace of the external action of Spain. Furthermore  the presence of this foreign element in the Strait renders difficult any new regulation of its territorial waters and transit through them because of the interference of sovereignties which the colonial Power installed on the Rock and causes to be felt at all times. It is therefore a disturbing factor for any possible rational solution of the problems created by navigation in that space  because of technological development.185.	A violation of the territorial integrity of Spain  a danger to its security  interference in its external policy of peace and a barrier to bringing up to date the legal regulation of the waters of the States -those are the most outstanding injuries which at present result from the British presence on the Rock and which the people of Spain has patiently endured although the United Nations has recognized the justice of its claims. Thus a colonial situation  the last existing colonial situation in Europe  is perpetuated  and this in a year such as 1974  which is so particularly marked by the stamp of decolonization.186.	It is discouraging and dangerous for the future of the community of nations to note the obstinate  rigid and selfish position of one of its members  a permanent member of the Security Council  a position taken in total contradiction of the opinion and feelings of the majority of this Organization. This cannot fail to jeopardize seriously the moral force on which the effectiveness of the United Nations must be based  because what affects one member of the community in the sphere of moral and legal values  affects all.187.	Once again Spain comes to this supreme body. With a feeling of responsibility and with the greatest good faith  but also with all seriousness  we request the General Assembly solemnly to reiterate to the United Kingdom its obligation to negotiate with Spain for the decolonization of Gibraltar and the reintegration of that territory in the Spanish nation  which will pay due attention to the interests of its present inhabitants.188.	The achievement of security by eliminating tension and by peaceful co-operation will make it unnecessary one day to maintain present defense systems. Until this occurs  however  no country can fail to look after its own security. But Spain  like other States  wishes to make its defense requirements compatible with efforts aimed at the relaxation of tension  and thus contribute to overcoming the contradictions of our time.189.	The Government of Spain has noted with approval the initiatives taken with a view to creating a progressive atmosphere of world detente  and we think that support should be given to the great Powers in the steps taken in this direction. The reduction of tension and increased understanding would no doubt eliminate serious sources of danger in which third countries might be involved. We therefore endorse efforts to secure a better atmosphere and the points of agreement which seem to be emerging between the United States and the Soviet Union  as well as the steps being taken towards a normalization of relations between the United States and China.190.	Nevertheless  our attitude is complemented by a very important consideration. In no case can agreement among the great Powers be achieved at the expense of the rest. An unrenounceable victory of our civilization is the right of all States to freedom and independence  to security  to peaceful development and to the promotion of their legitimate interests. The first duty of every State -and the stronger it is  the more this is to be demanded -is respect for the rights of others  and no type of hegemony or imperialism can today be accepted by the international community.191.	The community of European nations  despite its positive achievements  still awaits its constitution as a great Power  as would be consistent with the creative past of Europe and the hope of its peoples. Spain cannot fail to affirm once again its vocation to contribute to efforts aimed at European construction and its will to participate in any undertaking which will facilitate solution of the problems which Western Europe faces today.192.	On the other hand  the Government of Spain has been following with particular attention the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and will continue to make constructive and realistic efforts to achieve the objectives of lessening conflicting tensions and creating real confidence and a desire for effective cooperation. Although the work of this Conference always takes into account the broader context of world security and is in no way directed against any State or continent  we must emphasize the close relationship between European security and Mediterranean security  which gives our continent its true and genuine dimension. Hence my Government sponsors and often leads efforts to have presented to the Conference the ideas and proposals of the non-European coastal countries of the Mediterranean  which have made in the past and no doubt will make in the future an important contribution towards laying the foundations for security and cooperation  with mutual respect for certain legitimate interests that must be harmonized with justice and equity.193.	Spain  which besides being European has particularly close ties with the Arab countries  has believed it has served the general interest by following a policy designed to lead to a promising future when the European-Arab dialog will open up new channels of expression. The ancient and permanent friendship of Spain with the Arab world makes us wish for a just and lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East. The agreements which put an end to the fighting in October 1973 give reason to believe that this hope will be fulfilled. Accordingly  the Government of Spain considers that it is of the utmost importance that the negotiations on the restoration of peace in that region be successful.194.	What is needed is the total cessation of war operations and every kind of violence  withdrawal from the territories occupied by force  scrupulous respect for the oft-repeated resolutions of United Nations organs  a quest for just and permanent solutions as regards legitimate interests and  first and foremost  recognition and implementation of the human and political rights of the people of Palestine. The task is great and the entire international community must be associated in it. For its part  Spain supports the consideration of the Palestine question in all its aspects at the present session of the Assembly.195.	It is Spain's firm purpose to give its relations with Latin America increasing effectiveness and dynamism which will renew our old and indestructible links. Spain believes more than ever in the future of Latin America  with which it wishes to be united. The awareness that we are indissolubly linked in all that is deepest and most essential enables each one of us to find in the political  social and economic fields specific solutions  which are favored by present trends of understanding.1%. The ideal of unity proclaimed by Simon Bolivar is now being given shape in Latin America by promising movements of co-operation which Spain views with special interest. The entire Hispanic community feels satisfaction at this attainment of regional and subregional co-operation in the political  economic and cultural fields.197.	We consider our special relationship with Latin America as involving a particular effort to complement and co-operate with one another in the spheres of culture  economics  technology and human relations. This understanding has been fully endorsed by the Governments and peoples of Latin America.198.	Many countries of Latin America today need investments of capital which they can view without suspicion  and technology in accord with their respective levels of development. In this field  Spain is making a great financial effort both with individual countries and through international organizations and  while there was a tradition of emigration of Spaniards to Latin America  this has been replaced by a growing exchange of technical experts  professors and managerial personnel  who contribute with their specialized qualifications to the development of the countries of the Latin American community.199.	At the beginning of my statement I said that mankind faces the problem of organizing in a rational and just manner the enjoyment of its resources. At the present time new critical factors have arisen in the already existing economic problems. To the monetary and trade imbalance and the growing gap between the industrialized and the developing countries has been added runaway inflation  a decline in the growth rate of many countries and a sharp rise in the prices of various energy products and raw materials  all of which is causing disturbances in the mechanism for the distribution of resources and income on the international level.200.	At the present critical phase of adjustment and in addition to its efforts to achieve an atmosphere of confidence and understanding among the various countries and groups of countries  we believe that the United Nations can help by drawing up positive and acceptable formulas for the solution of these problems taking into account all the conflicting interests. That is so because the only real choice open to us is international co-operation for development on a far broader scale and on a more committed basis than what has been done so far.201.	The present crisis has had different effects on different members of the international community. Those most affected were the developing countries which lack natural resources. To them must be directed the priority efforts of the United Nations  bearing in mind that the criteria followed so far for their classification according to their level of development have not proved satisfactory.202.	Spain is suffering acutely from the consequences of the present crisis because of the impact on our economy of the rise in the prices of raw materials  oil and food products which are indispensable to maintaining continuity in our development. Nevertheless  as a country of intermediate development we have subscribed to the commitments which are now being agreed to in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and IMF; we have participated in the efforts to restructure the international monetary order in accordance with present needs; we have undertaken to participate in the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations with the desire of obtaining a substantial increase in trade in the products most important to the developing countries; we have joined the African regional development organization and we hope to join that of Latin America in the near future; we likewise supported the establishment of the Special Fund for emergency relief and development assistance to the most seriously affected countries  established by the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order which we have also accepted.203.	Lastly  Spain recently renounced the financial benefits which it had been receiving from UNDP. This decision was taken at the same time as our decision to increase our contribution to that Program not only as regards financing  but also in terms of technological co-operation.204.	Before concluding I should like to make some remarks on the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which has just ended in Caracas.205.	The geographical situation of Spain between two of the principal seas of the world  its long coastline and the inclusion in that coastline of the Strait of Gibraltar  the importance of our shipping and fishery activities  our interest in shipbuilding and our hopes of participating in the future exploitation of the sea-bed  has resulted in the Government of Spain taking clear-cut but fully co-operative attitudes on the main items considered by the Conference.206.	Today  the concept of the territorial sea as a zone of defense and protection for a State is more significant than ever. A territorial sea of up to 12 miles is now acceptable in international law  and the historic concept of innocent passage through territorial waters  which combines freedom of navigation with the security of the coastal State  must be maintained without exception  with agreed particulars when they are considered necessary.207.	To protect the ecology of the marine environment is also vital to ensure that there will be no reduction in the living resources now threatened by in-creasing pollution of the sea. Regulating catches in all maritime areas  including the high seas  will avoid the abuses of modern fishing methods. We must reconcile the recognition of a broad economic zone of preferential interest for the coastal States with the fishing rights of third parties  in a manner compatible with the interests of both.208.	Spain is traditionally a fishing country and an important sector of our population lives by fishing; we declare our intention of co-operating with the countries adjacent to maritime zones of abundant fishing wealth  and in this co-operation we can contribute our industrial and technical capacity. We also reaffirm that the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction is the common heritage of mankind and we advocate reconciling their effective and rational use with justice in the distribution of the benefits of every kind; we therefore support the establishment of an international organization which will regulate and adequately control the exploitation of the sea-bed.209.	The difficult times we face require of all Governments  and of all those in positions of influence in the community  the greatest efforts of imagination  of decision and of good will. Let us make those efforts at every level -within our respective countries  in bilateral relations  in regional co-operation systems  and within the broad universal framework of the United Nations. From the last generation of statesmen we received this Organization  with its qualities and its shortcomings  with much of its potential still unrealized. Let us fulfill that potential not only ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war""  but also so that they may attain a more prosperous  more dignified and more just way of life through international co-operation."
"41",2264,"ETH",29,1974,"Mr. President  I take great pleasure in joining distinguished speakers who have preceded me ""in. congratulating you on your election to the high office of the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your eminent qualities are known to me over the years of our personal acquaintance and your abilities as a dynamic representative of the sister State of Algeria are known to us all in this Assembly. You will bring further credit to your own nation and to Africa  and in doing so you will have the full co-operation of my delegation.87.	During the last session  as a member of the General Committee in which I had the privilege to serve as Chairman of the Second Committee  I had the honour to admire the high competence and skill of your predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador  who so memorably added to the body of precedent and prestige set by your predecessors for the achievement and discharge of your manifold duties and responsibilities.88.	Mr. Kurt Waldheim  Secretary-General of the Organization  continues to serve the international community with vigor and dedication. I wish to pay tribute to him  particularly for the constructive role he has played in the peace-making efforts of the Organization and for his deep humanitarian concern to assist the drought victims on my continent.89.	The United Nations family of sovereign and independent States comes together again this year in the General Assembly  enlarged and strengthened through the admission of Bangladesh  Grenada  and Guinea-Bissau. Their representatives have taken their rightful places amongst us; I extend to them the warm welcome of my Government and delegation.90.	Among the positive developments for consideration in our coming debates that have occurred since last year's session  my Government would particularly note the limited but significant agreements concluded in the Middle East  the growing recognition of the vital economic interdependence between the developing countries and the industrialized nations  and the outcome of the freedom struggle in Africa which is inducing the present leadership in Portugal to pursue a more realistic policy in that continent.91.	The sharpest negative developments during the same period have been the largely unrelieved suffering of millions of our fellow men in the severely drought- affected world  the sudden shattering of peace and tranquility in Cyprus  and the severe dislocation in the international economic and monetary systems.92.	I shall briefly indicate my Government's views on some of the more pressing issues.93.	Ethiopia has whole-heartedly welcomed the troop disengagement agreements which have followed the cease-fire in the Middle East. But while I express my Government's appreciation for the statesmanship of the Governments directly concerned and the indefatigable energy of the United States Secretary of State in achieving these preliminary steps  I am also bound to state my country's deep concern that what has been accomplished may be frustrated by the explosive potential of the present situation.94.	Without in any way wishing to oversimplify the complexity of the problems that are coming before the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  my Government would urge that prompt action be taken to regain the momentum generated by the achievement of the disengagement agreements. It is also the view of my delegation that a peace settlement in the Middle East must be achieved within the letter and the spirit of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and that  for it to last  it must take into account the legitimate rights of all peoples in the region  including those of the Palestinians. I need hardly add that Ethiopia has most acutely suffered from the long closure of the Suez Canal and will assist in every way possible efforts to reopen this vital artery of international commerce.95.	To those of us in Africa the past nine months have brought a particularly welcome application of the sacred principle of self-determination by Portugal's recognition of the independence of Guinea-Bissau and the establishment in Mozambique of a transitional Government led by the Frente de Libertao de Mozambique [FRELIMO]  now on the road to early independence. This relentless and valiant struggle of the national liberation movements and peoples in those Territories is heart-warming in its achievement and in its promise for the future.96.	Again  we are reminded of the adage that independence is often won but seldom granted. In fairness to the new leadership in Portugal  however  we join the many who have given it due credit for commanding the courage to rise to its opportunities and to meet its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. In that effort and in that achievement the Portuguese leadership has our sympathy and encouragement.97.	Ever since the sixteenth session which began in 1961  when I had the privilege of speaking from this rostrum on the question of Angola [1097th meeting]  my Government has been concerned about the fate of the people of that Territory. My delegation would support today active efforts to work out modalities with the national liberation movements in Angola ways and means of facilitating the peaceful and rapid transfer of power. The fact of Angola's independence is acknowledged  and the achievement of that independence must be hastened.98.	It is true that in the twenty-ninth year of the life of the Assembly we can congratulate ourselves that a global conflagration has been avoided. That indeed represents a cause of justifiable pride to the peoples of the United Nations and the triumph  to a certain degree  of human reason. But  on the other hand  localized wars in Africa  Asia  Europe  the Middle East and elsewhere- colonial wars  wars of conquest and of intervention -have caused untold suffering to millions of people. We must emphasize that  in terms of the cumulative loss of human life  the suffering and the havoc wrought  the effect of local wars certainly of no less severity to the victims than that of global war.99.	In this context  let me state at once that Ethiopia does not pretend to have any magic formula for the total elimination of wars and international conflicts. My country has  however  consistently urged the strengthening and the use of the established machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.100.	Most recently  the tragic events in Cyprus have aroused anxious concern. Ethiopia has always supported the use of international machinery and means to obtain peace and security as one of the primary purposes of the Organization. Consequently  we supported the dispatch of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force to Cyprus in the early 1960s and its stabilizing presence on the island for more than a decade. Whatever may be the procedures and means adopted to restore peace and tranquility on the island  Ethiopia believes that the unity of the people of Cyprus and sovereignty and territorial integrity should be strictly preserved.101.	My delegation remains concerned about the uncertain situation in South-East Asia and has noted with satisfaction the withdrawal of the bulk of the armed forces of a super-Power. As regards northern Asia  we hope that the discussions between North and South Korea will be resumed and will lead to a reduction of tension. My delegation trusts that the obstacles to a peaceful settlement may be removed in both South-East and northern Asia.102.	The international community continues as helpless as it is indignant about the repugnant situation still prevailing in southern Africa. It is shameful that  29 years after its founding  the United Nations should still be deliberating upon the twin problems of colonialism and apartheid. The disregard by some Member States of the provisions of the Charter and of the decisions of the Assembly and of the Security Council is obvious. The subjugation and degradation of millions of people in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa should surely be a thorn in the collective conscience of the Assembly.103.	In Southern Rhodesia  the Smith regime  far from being brought to its knees  as we were told it had been eight years ago by the administering Power  has on the contrary consolidated its illegal exercise of power through the complicity and blessing of some Member States. The systematic violation of sanctions imposed by the Security Council against Southern Rhodesia has given sustenance to the white minority regime and strengthened its grip over the defenseless African people in the country. Ethiopia  mindful of its own bitter experience in the 1930s  has time and again drawn attention to the futility of sanctions unless they are scrupulously observed by one and all.104.	The question of Southern Rhodesia continues to be a test case for the United Nations  and my Government regrets that the uncooperative attitude of some Member States has contributed to the undermining of the principles enshrined in the Charter. If the Organization is to be a source of hope for mankind  it is imperative that we act in concert to restore its prestige and make it effective. My delegation therefore appeals to the world community and to the Organization to implement the mandatory sanctions of the Security Council  so that law and order may be secured with justice.105.	It is distressing to note that in South Africa the odious policy of apartheid is being relentlessly pursued  with even more vigor  and that the majority is increasingly faced with the enactment of new suppressive laws and supporting violence. In spite of.the efforts of the United Nations  the Namibian people is still denied the right to self-determination and independence.ICR My Government is aware that the Government of South Africa has of late resorted to the use of classic ploys of delay and deception  with pronouncements from Pretoria of plans for political and constitutional development for Namibia. The timing of those pronouncements by the South African Government  when the General Assembly is in session  is obviously intended-to sow confusion and frustrate consensus when the item on Namibia is discuss d in the General Assembly. South Africa's tactics in confusing the issues  evident in the composition of its delegation to the current session of the General Assembly  have been most properly rebuffed in the Credentials Committee.107. In flagrant violation of the Charter and the re-solutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council  the Government of South Africa has not only continued but also intensified its policy of exploitation and oppression in Namibia. The failure of the United Nations to remedy this situation will no doubt be recorded as the most disappointing episode in the history of the Organization.108.	My delegation is heartened that the General Assembly has adopted  only a few days ago  a resolution requesting the Security Council to examine the question of South Africa's continued membership in the United Nations  in the light of that country's persistent defiance of its Charter obligations [resolution 3207 (XXIX)]. As sanction deeply concerned over the plight and fate of our brethren in southern Africa  we feel that the Security Council should have recourse to the provisions of Article 6 of the Charter  as a preliminary measure. Given the well-known position of intransigence of the apartheid regime in South Africa  the international community will have to consider the possibility of resorting to other provisions of the Charter  relating to enforcement actions  in order to secure the compliance of South Africa with the decision of the United Nations.109.	Disarmament is yet another problem for which effective action has so far eluded the international community. While slight progress has been made by the conclusion of certain arms control and related measures for instance  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)] - recent events make us wonder whether what little gains have been made are not actually being eroded.110.	In the past year  atmospheric as well as underground testing of nuclear devices has continued. The hope we expressed last year from this rostrum [2127th meeting] that the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963 should be improved to ban underground testing of nuclear devices has not materialized. Nor have any additional nuclear Powers signed the Treaty in the past year. Unfortunately  too  no appreciable progress seems to have been registered during the year's sessions of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to further the attempt to reach agreement on an effective mechanism for the comprehensive prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and the destruction of the existing arsenal of such weapons. My delegation cannot emphasize too strongly the need to reach agreement on this and other vital issues of disarmament.111.	Of no less consequence is the fact that  even as actions are being taken towards the dismantling of foreign bases in developing countries  new bases are being set up in new localities  bringing new areas within their range and risk. Measures of progression matched against equivalent retrogression will not help the world community to make headway towards achieving the aims and purposes of the Charter.112.	The Assembly has come to accept the proposition that co-operation among nations is indispensable if mankind is to survive and progress in an interdependent world. Acceptance of this thesis  however  has not been accompanied by the kind of co-operative behavior necessary for the solution or at least the amelioration of the economic and social conditions that bring such misery in the wake of natural disaster.113.	The Sahelian region of Africa and my own country have suffered and are still suffering from severe food shortages caused by several years of drought. Hundreds of thousands of men  women and children have lost their lives. The humanitarian response which we received from the international community has been encouraging. It is gratifying for me to take this opportunity to express from this rostrum my country's deep appreciation and gratitude to those sympathetic individuals  friendly nations and international and non-governmental organizations that came to our rescue. It must be emphasized  however  that the relief aid going to the drought-stricken parts of Ethiopia  both from domestic and international sources  falls far short of the amount needed to cope with the situation. Ethiopia trusts that the international community will continue to respond to the desperate needs of the victims of drought and natural disaster.114.	In view of the unprecedented food crisis in vast areas of the world  especially on the African continent  my delegation feels that it is imperative for the international community to take prompt action and  in particular  to adopt the necessary measures to create an internationally agreed system of food stocks and reserves.115.	Ethiopia's capacity to combat the natural calamities that have befallen it has been severely limited by the soaring prices of agricultural inputs  especially the rapid and overwhelming increase in the price of fertilizer. The price of this invaluable agricultural input is of great concern for most of the developing countries  which have committed such large proportions of their national resources to increasing their agricultural production. The problem is even more acute in Ethiopia than in many other countries due to the fact that fertilizer was only recently introduced into the traditional form of agriculture. Hence  high prices are a disastrous disincentive to potential users. It is to be hoped that the World Food Conference  soon to be convened in Rome  will place this item high on its agenda.116.	In order to maintain at least the present level of food supply  a considerable increase of food production is of vital importance to meet the requirements of population growth. If this can be done  food relief aid can be kept at temporary stop-gap levels. But in order to contain the age-old cyclical recurrence of famine  medium- and long-term planning and large- scale financial outlays are necessary for irrigation  afforestation  and resettlement and rehabilitation of people. Ethiopia has embarked upon such long-range planning. Being one of the least developed countries  however  its ability to finance the necessary projects envisaged in the plan from its own resources is extremely limited. It is evident  therefore  that unless international assistance of adequate magnitude is made available to it  Ethiopia's aspirations for accelerated progress in economic and social development will be severely constrained.117.	The maintenance and development of food production is  of course  completely enmeshed in general economic development. We share the view that the adequate transfer of resources from rich to poor nations would help the developing countries in the achievement of their present programs. It is sad to note  however  that such resource transfers are continuing to decline. The target set for the Second United Nations Development Decade called upon the developed countries to give 0.7 per cent of their gross national product in official development assistance by 1975. It is now estimated that by 1975 official development assistance levels will not exceed 0.35 per cent. This is only half the modest target envisaged for the Second Development Decade. The failure of the rich countries to honor such a modest pledge is discouraging  to say the least  especially when one realizes that the developed countries could double their present official development assistance without undue sacrifice. They would need to allocate less than 2 per cent of the amount by which they annually grow richer during the period of the Second Development Decade. In my delegation's view  the achievement of this target neither demands the lowering of the high standard of living of their people  nor requires them to neglect their domestic priorities.118.	At this session we again urge that the official component of the net transfer of financial resources to the developing countries should be increased so as to attain the targeted level of 0.7 per cent by 1975. Furthermore  we suggest that grant elements should constitute a higher percentage of all development aid. To be truly effective  development loans must be concessionary and untied. We also feel that-the inter-national financial institutions must increasingly adjust their lending policies to meet the needs of the developing countries.119.	Although foreign aid can play a vital role in the development of poor countries  its role must be viewed only as supportive. It is the opinion of my delegation that  in order to sustain an effective program of national development  a nation must be able to generate and earn income through its trade. Because of the scale associated with modern productive enterprises  and the need to earn foreign exchange with which to purchase the indispensable capital goods  international trade has become the mainstay of the economies of developing countries  Future progress in these countries depends upon ability to gain free and unhindered access to the markets of the developed countries for their agricultural products and raw materials. However  trade relations between the developing and the industrialized countries are characterized by unstable prices for exported primary commodities  rising prices of imported industrial goods  and restrictive policies of the developed nations in regard to processed and semi-processed agricultural products from the developing countries.120.	The single most important feature of the economic structure of most developing countries is the predominance of the primary sector in their economies: primary products account for a very high percentage of developing countries' exports. The unstable foreign exchange earnings from the exports of primary products underpin their development programs. As long as the income from this sector continues to fluctuate  we in the developing areas of the world will be faced with difficulties in our attempt to carry out long- term development plans  which require stable and substantial foreign exchange resources. As long as our access to the markets of industrialized countries is hindered by tariff and non-tariff barriers  most of our plans for economic expansion will suffer severe restriction.121.	Alterations in the international economic order must be made to enable the developing countries to increase export earnings and assure them access to adequate  arid steady financial resources for their development. The deterioration in the terms of trade for exports from developing countries must be avoided by establishing a close link between the prices of products exported by developing countries and the prices of goods and services imported by them from industrialized countries.122.	Ethiopia welcomes the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI)  adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth special session  which was convened on the timely initiative of President Boumediene. That session went a long way in defining the present economic problems and in suggesting programs of action. It is for the current session to give earnest consideration to the proposals for concrete  practical implementation during the Second United Nations Development Decade.123.	The necessity for the transfer of technology from industrialized countries to the developing nations is undisputed. The contribution of technology in enhancing the productive capacities of man is obvious. To realize the gains  it is necessary that the problems and the mechanism of technology transfer should be dealt with at the international level.124.	My delegation urges the developed countries to give developing countries access to relevant modern technology at minimum cost and to increase the adoption of that technology for the conditions prevailing in the developing areas. In the longer term the industrialized nations should do their utmost to extend assistance to the developing countries  in terms of research and development  so as to enable them to develop indigenous technology.125.	While appreciating the transfer of technology through agencies such as the transnational corporations  my delegation would call on the Assembly to develop codes of conduct to prevent abuses in the activities of such corporations in the development programs of the developing countries.126.	Ethiopia has supported and will always support all efforts to discourage and condemn any practice which tends to hinder the free and effective exercise of the rights of every State to full and permanent sovereignty over its natural resources. In this connexion  allow me to express my thanks and those of my delegation to the Group of Eminent Persons to Study the Impact of Multinational Corporations on Development and International Relations  which has made a painstaking study and prepared a number of proposals.1127.	The need to reform the international monetary system is as urgent as  and no less important than  the need to reform the mechanisms through which foreign aid  trade and the transfer of technology between developed and developing countries are facilitated.128.	The defects of the present international monetary system and the consequent monetary crisis have adversely affected the development processes of several developing countries  and have accentuated the already difficult economic situations in the developing nations.129. In the view of my delegation  the efforts to reform the international monetary system should be based on the principles and objectives contained in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution  2626 (XXV)). Ethiopia  for. its part  has always urged the' building of an international monetary structure that would promote an equitable system of trade between the developed and the developing countries; as well as the transfer of resources. It is with this in mind that Ethiopia has always attached great significance to the establishment of a link between special drawing rights and the provision ^development finance  assuring the allocation of aid increasing share of the special drawing rights to the developing countries.130: It is the hope of my delegation that the present session of the General Assembly will make substantial progress in implementing the Declaration and the Program of Action of the sixth special session of the General Assembly. What is required is good will  courage and action 131.	I hope that my reiteration of Ethiopia's position on many issues will serve to shed some more light on our mutual problems  and that it will confirm the identity of many of our objectives and our resolve to attain them in the interest of our respective nations.132.	In conclusion  may I respond to the inquiries and expressions of friendly interest made by my esteemed colleagues regarding events in my country and acquaint Members with the facts of the recent peaceful change of government in Ethiopia.133.	The change of government was brought about by the Co-ordinating Committee of the Armed Forces  Police and the Territorial Army  without a single shot being fired and in a manner unprecedented in recent political history. The powers of State having been effectively assumed by the Provisional Military Government as of 12 September 1974  peace and tranquility reign throughout Ethiopia.134.	The national policy of ""Ethiopia Tikdem"" that is to say  ""Ethiopia first"" is founded on the principles of unity and equality among all Ethiopians. In its foreign policy Ethiopia will continue to be strictly non-aligned; it will continue to adhere to the Charter of the United Nations and the Charter of the Organization of African Unity and will honor all international obligations on the basis of mutual respect and equality; Ethiopia will do everything in its power to help people in colonial Territories in the world in general  and in Africa in particular  to gain their independence; Ethiopia will maintain and further strengthen existing friendly ties with all friendly Governments in the world  and its relations with the African countries and with its neighbors  the Sudan and Egypt -the two nations which most greatly share the waters of the River Nile -and with its other close neighbors  Kenya and Somalia  will be maintained and strengthened."
"42",2310,"FIN",29,1974,"Mr. President  I have the great honor of congratulating you  on behalf of the Finnish Government  on your election to the office of President. We know you as a highly respected representative from the continent of Africa. Algeria has  over the years  assumed an active role among the developing countries and within the group of non-aligned States. It was at the initiative of President Houari Boumediene that the General Assembly was convened last spring in its historic sixth special session  a session devoted  for the first time  exclusively to development and economic problems. It is therefore most fitting that the Assembly  has elected you to preside over this regular session.160.	I have referred to the special session on raw materials and development. That event was indeed a milestone. It was above all a manifestation of the interdependence among all nations and the necessity for co-operation. This was plainly recognized in the Declaration proclaiming the determination of the Members of the United Nations to work jointly for the establishment of a new international economic order. The Finnish Government has stated its adherence to that Declaration. It also strongly supports the Prpgram of Action  which contains a long- term framework for the achievement of a new economic order. We furthermore consider it imperative to assure that sufficient resources  both material and human  are made available to the Secretary- General to meet the new demands now being made on the United Nations itself.161.	The most important result of the special session was that it forced Into the open a. thorough re- evaluation of the whole foundation of international economic relations and the staggering problems that face mankind today. It is now generally recognized that only through intensified co-operation and by taking into account the interests of all nations can we save the World from political and economic disruption. The United Nations must now respond swiftly  effectively and in a co-ordinated fashion.162.	The convening this year of three major United Nations conferences one on the law of the sea  one on population  and one on the world's food problems is proof of the need to give to the most pressing questions the' thorough consideration and worldwide attention they deserve all these issues are  however  interlinked and can no longer be dealt with in isolation. A feature common to all of them is their vital importance to each nation. We must- find a common solution which  regardless of the basic nature of the problem concerned  must be a political one.163.	Against the background of these profound changes and challenges in political  economic and social relations among States  it is obvious that the special session of the Assembly next year will be of very great significance. It is therefore urgent that the preparations for that session be now initiated. The Finnish Government considers that the work of the United Nations to meet these formidable challenges is an integral part of our efforts to achieve the primary goal of the Charter  the preservation of international peace and security. The United Nations has indeed become indispensable in our striving to avert the scourge of war  to guarantee fundamental human rights and to promote economic and social progress.164.	Finland has consistently stressed the importance of improvements in relations between the major Powers. At the same time  we have stated that detente  in order to be genuine  must take into account the interests of all Members of this Organization. In order fully to exploit the existing momentum of detente  it is necessary to define and develop new methods and approaches for the further relaxation of tensions in international relations. 165. In this context  the Finnish Government is gratified to see that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe that is now in its second stage in Geneva has already made important headway. Although much remains to be done  we believe that we can already see emerging an outline of a new set of rules of conduct to guide relations among the participating States. The fact that all the participants recognize each other's equality and that they pursue their common ends  not with the aim of isolation but with full awareness of their responsibilities towards all Members of the United Nations  should constitute an important contribution to world peace and security. The Conference is  we believe  now approaching its conclusion and it is our hope that its results will be greeted as a significant step in the development of relations among the participating States. That would  in our opinion  fully justify the holding of the final stage of the Conference on the highest level.166. A main area in which detente should bring new potentialities is disarmament. Nevertheless  in the past year no major step forward has been taken. The important work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has regrettably not been translated into draft agreements on a comprehensive test ban or the prohibition of chemical weapons. On the other hand  we have been encouraged by the resumption of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the United States and the USSR. We earnestly hope that the basis for agreement in this area can soon be broadened. This would in turn create new impetus for other measures in this crucial field to bring world peace and security.167.	The Finnish Government has carefully followed the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference. We welcome the fact that all nuclear Powers have made their contribution to this work. We have noted with satisfaction that the Committee has succeeded in adopting realistic working methods  and we hope that our deliberations during this session will in turn lead to further progress.168.	In searching for ways further to relax inter-national tension  the Finnish Government considers the idea of creating nuclear-free zones a constructive one. In fact  several years ago President Kekkonen of Finland advanced the suggestion that the Nordic countries could form such a zone. His initiative was based on the fact that at present the Nordic countries remain free of nuclear weapons and that all of them have adhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I have noted the words of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization that the initiatives concerning nuclear-free zones are not only a useful but a necessary part of our search for universal disarmament [sec Al960IIAdd.l  sect. X]  In this context  my delegation welcomes the two new initiatives on nuclear-free zones presented to this Assembly [see AI9909 and AI99II]. Likewise  the proposal on the prohibition of action to influence the environment and the climate for military and other purposes merits constructive discussion  as it widens the scope of disarmament efforts.169. The international community has not been spared wars and human suffering. The situation  especially in the Middle East  remains potentially dangerous. Therefore  my Government urges the parties concerned and the great Powers to do their utmost to create the necessary conditions for a just and lasting political settlement  taking into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.170.	On the question of Cyprus  the Finnish Government appeals to all parties concerned to abandon the use of force and  instead  to choose the road of negotiation in order to achieve a peaceful solution based on the independence and sovereignty of Cyprus. As an immediate step it is necessary that all parties  in accordance with their obligations under the Charter  fully respect and comply with the resolutions of the Security Council. Equally important is the full respect on the part of all concerned for humanitarian values.171.	The Finnish Government gives its full support to the efforts made and services provided by the Security Council and the Secretary-General  both in the Middle East and in Cyprus. United Nations peace-keeping activities in both areas have been indispensable for the implementation of the SecurityCouncil resolutions and the agreements negotiated between the parties.. The latest developments in peace-keeping activities give us some hope that broad guidelines for United Nations peace-keeping operations may soon be agreed on.172.	My delegation is seriously concerned that the necessary firm arrangements for the financing of the United Nations peace-keeping operations are still lacking. As a small nation  we Finns strongly believe that peace-keeping is the common responsibility of the entire membership of the United Nations. This  fundamental and fair principle should be the starting-point when we try to agree on the financial aspects of peace-keeping.173.	My Government is concerned that serious violations of basic human rights still occur in various parts of the world. In particular  I would address a strong appeal to the Chilean Government to cease the persecution of political opponents and to set political prisoners free.174.	On our road to decolonization  the independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and the agreed  future independence of Mozambique are great achievements. The firm and resolute will for independence on the part of the African liberation movements  and also their willingness fully to use all possibilities for peaceful settlement""  combined with the policy of the new Portuguese Government  have opened the way to full sovereignty for these Territories without further violence. We sincerely hope that the same attitude will prevail in the case of Angola  so that the people of that Territory may accede to independence without further delay and in a peaceful manner.175.	Despite these positive developments  southern Africa remains a potential crisis area. Again  I became aware of this during my recent visit to several African countries. The Finnish Government has consistently condemned the policy of apartheid practiced by the Government of South Africa. Likewise  we deny the legality of the Smith regime in Southern Rhodesia. The United Nations must now turn all its efforts against these last remnants of colonialism and racism in Africa. On behalf of my Government  I pledge our full support to these efforts.176.	Special ties and feelings of sympathy link Finland to the Namibian people. My Government has always been active in seeking ways and means by which the direct responsibility of this Organization for Namibia could be exercised and the cause of the self-determination of the Namibian people advanced. We shall continue our efforts in this regard. It is in this spirit and yet another step in our consistent support for decolonization that my Government has decided to Seek membership on the United Nations Council for Namibia.177.	This year we have again advanced towards the universality of this Organization by admitting three new Members to the United Nations. The Finnish Government welcomes the membership of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. We are convinced that the participation of these States in our work will be of greatest value. That these three States  as one of their first international actions  applied for membership in the United Nations strengthens our conviction that this Organization is an indispensable forum where nations together can seek solutions to common problems in the spirit of true interdependence."
"43",2401,"FRA",29,1974,"Sir  my first words will be to offer you my personal congratulations and those of my country on your election to the distinguished office of President of the General Assembly and to tell you of the hopes this gives us for the success and the efficacy of our work.105.	A few months ago  in this very Hall  you participated actively in the special session on raw materials and development. Your election to the presidency of this twenty-ninth session rightly confirms the importance of the role you have played  and since virtually all international relations now fall within the realm of our debates  it provides you with an arena commensurate with your abilities and experience as a statesman. In honoring you  the community of nations is also honoring your country  Algeria. Everyone can understand why France has special reasons to welcome this.106.	I should also like to pay a special tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Benites  who had the rare privilege during the past 12 months of presiding over two sessions of the Assembly  during which he displayed outstanding qualities as a statesman and jurist and was thus able to crown most prestigiously a career that had been so closely linked to the work of our Organization for so many years.107.	Lastly  I should like to greet Mr. Kurt Wald heim  with whom I have enjoyed a longstanding friendship. I should like to tell him of the trust and high esteem in which he is held by the French Government for his tireless efforts and for the competence and effectiveness he has shown in carrying out his extremely important and difficult tasks.108.	This is the first time that I have had the honor of speaking on behalf of France before this Assembly  a privileged forum in which to recognize that there is a basic truth which characterizes the modern world and will dominate our common destiny with increasing severity  regardless of the degree of development or the political philosophies of the societies to which we belong.109.	In this ""little corner of the universe"" -to quote Pascal- on this earth which the human eye has been able to contemplate in its entirety for the first time in its history a blue ball  an oasis of life in the blackness of space  a planet which scientific and technological progress has shrunk and at the same time unified by subjecting it to accelerated and profound change men  peoples and States arc dependent on each other and are becoming increasingly interdependent. The death knell will sound for everyone it we fail to appreciate this interdependence  if selfishness  fanaticism  the lust for power and domination threaten the possibilities for a sincere effort to seek together gradual and well-balanced solutions to the difficulties of our times  difficulties which our very progress only serves to accentuate.110.	The fine name of the United Nations thus takes on renewed significance. The enemy that we must confront together is underdevelopment; it is the tragedy of poverty and hunger which the past year  alas  has shown to be distressingly present; it is the turmoil that inflation is causing in international economic relations; it is disorder  inequality and injustice in all their forms; it is the remnants of racial discrimination; it is everything that still exists to hinder the full recognition of and respect for the rights of the individual and the rights of peoples.111.	Need 1 stress before this Assembly of nearly 140 nations-and I doubt that anyone can remain indifferent to a reminder of the great universalis! traditions of my country and the message it brought to the world almost two centuries ago that France  with the legacy of the French Revolution  is determined to strengthen the liberal nature of its diplomacy  to be in the vanguard of the peaceful struggle to give the world greater liberty  greater equality and greater fraternity?112.	I should like to recall here the words spoken by the President of the French Republic last June when the Paris diplomatic corps was presented to him:""This change signifies  lastly  that France  reaffirming and emphasizing her liberal mission  will do everything in her power to contribute to the dawning of a new era in international relations based on mutual esteem and respect and on a spirit of understanding and liberty  and  Under pressure from the peoples of the world  to ensure that the bastions of constraint and intolerance are toppled. She thus hopes to introduce into relations among States a greater measure of simplicity  trust and  may I venture to say  optimism.""113.	The essence of the ""liberal"" philosophy which France advocates and which must  in our opinion  be applied by everyone to international relations is this: that order and justice are in no way contradictory but  rather  are complementary; that only progress towards political and economic order  coupled with consideration for the interests of each State  is likely to guarantee our international society the minimum of stability without which there can be no lasting progress for anyone.114.	This joint effort and the transformation it entails must  of course  be made without losing sight of the ultimate goal of our Organization. The intention to ensure peace and security by gradually eliminating the causes of conflict  whether political or economic in nature  must be matched by the constant concern to eliminate any desire for  or any possibility of  not only conflict but even confrontation.115.	The two basic principles which my country long ago initiated and advocated -namely  detente and cooperation - must therefore be implemented more and more at the international level.116.	In the midst of the alarming turmoil of today's world  it is sometimes difficult to perceive practical ways of implementing these principles. However  a closer look reveals a few breaches in the wall  a few rays of light of unmistakable brightness. We are living in a world of light and shadow. Perhaps it might be useful for me to state how France and the French Government currently view the causes for concern and the reasons for hope.117.	You will not be surprised if first  as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France  I turn my eyes to Europe. As current President of the Council of the European Economic Community  I can testify to the aspiration of our peoples gradually to organize themselves so that from their age old civilization there can emerge little by little a new political organization based on pluralism but capable also of unifying what must be unified.118.	This organization of Europe involves  first and foremost  for my country and for its partners in the Community  the creation in the western part of our continent of a coherent entity that will be capable of confronting the problems of our time; one that will be able to make a genuine contribution to detente and cooperation which are so necessary for our world if it is to survive; and  I might say  one that will serve as a model. The task begun nearly 25 years ago  right after a war which we decided would be the last  is not a simple one. But the leaders of our countries are determined not to miss the rendezvous with destiny which history has scheduled for our generation.119.	That is why you will hear the voice of the European Economic Community becoming more and more distinct. It will speak the language of peace  justice and reconciliation. For  although this Community must of necessity actively pursue its own development  it cannot and it never would wish to turn in upon itself. By virtue of its mission and by necessity as well  the Community is open to the world  alive to the hopes and needs of the underprivileged  aware of its responsibilities in international balance and progress. That is why it intends  through concrete and innovative action  to make its contribution to the necessary effort to restore order to economic  financial and  hence  political relations among the countries of the globe.120.	The Community is faithful to its traditional friendships  first among which is its friendship with the United States of America and Canada  a friendship which is even stronger now that it is yet better balanced and which is constant and indispensable to peace. And yet it does not forget the role that geography and history have allocated to it in the Mediterranean and in Africa  nor the close ties it has maintained with the Soviet Union and all the countries of Eastern Europe  whose contribution to our civilization is so important and with which we hope to foster genuine detente in the Old World. In this spirit we are taking part  as you know  in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  well aware of the scope of the undertaking and thus of the need to work towards the desired goal with great patience and wisdom.121.	Another source of comfort and confidence in the future stems from a new and important step our Organization has taken towards its goal of universal representation  which we are now close to achieving. We are happy to welcome in our midst during this twenty-ninth session the representatives of Bangladesh  Grenada and GuineaBissau.122.	After the trials that marked its birth  Bangladesh  despite serious economic difficulties  courageously is embarking on the path that should lead to reconciliation and cooperation on the subcontinent. May the efforts made by the States concerned achieve the results that we all are hoping for.123.	There are two reasons why we can be pleased with the decolonization that is under way in the Portuguese Territories of Africa: first of all  because it has come about in connexion with a return to democracy in a country that is a friend of France  and secondly  because it is being done for the benefit of a whole group of courageous peoples that have long had many reasons to ask themselves why they were deprived of the independence which their neighbors enjoyed.124.	I should like to hail the delegation of the Republic of GuineaBissau and convey to it our best wishes and congratulations. I should also like to pay a tribute to its members and to the representatives of the new Portuguese Government  a tribute that the political wisdom evidenced during the recent fruitful negotiations in Algiers rightly deserves. The European Economic Community  deeply committed to the values of the democracy on which it is founded  can only welcome any agreements which result in the practical application of the principles of selfdetermination on the continent of Africa. It feels that recognition of these principles will soon be extended to Mozambique and then to Angola. It welcomes in particular the agreement that was just concluded at Lusaka.125.	Allow me to add at this point that France  which was one of the first Powers to foster self determination for many countries that are now influential Members of our Organization  is currently completing its own endeavors in this domain by preparing  with the agreement of the freely elected leaders of the Comoros  the accession to independence of these islands. The French delegation will in a few weeks be pleased to give further information which will emerge from the bill providing for an early referendum in the Comoro Archipelago.126.	Other aspects of the world situation are  however  more disturbing.127.	The situation in Africa is still troubled by tensions and the injustices which persist in the southern part. I would like to record once again here France's complete disapproval of the policy of apartheid. Furthermore  France regrets that the efforts made by our Organization to begin a dialog with the Government in Pretoria with a view to leading Namibia to self-determination and independence have remained fruitless.128.	The situation in the Middle East is still marked by dangerous uncertainty. Following upon the tragic events which have taken place since our last session  disengagement agreements have been concluded thanks to the wisdom of the parties to the conflict and to the tireless diplomacy of the Secretary of State of the United States. These agreements and the stabilized situation on the battlefield  thanks to the control of the United Nations  are the first encouraging steps. However  we must not permit the momentum of peace to grind to a halt. The basic problems have not been settled. The situation is still precarious and it is therefore imperative that the negotiations should be resumed so that an equitable settlement can be reached as soon as possible  one that can be endorsed by the international community  that is to say  the Security Council.129.	France for its part is still in favor of a settlement based on Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  confirmed by its resolution 338 (1973)  which provide for Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories  as well as for commitments to peace giving each State the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.130.	France believes it is high time for the international community to recognize the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people  which this settlement should take into account. It is ready to contribute to the quest for a settlement based exclusively on the genuine interests of the peoples of the region and acceptable to the parties concerned -each and every one of them- among which my country is far from forgetting Israel.131.	Although the crisis which broke out in Cyprus on 15 July and which was singularly exacerbated on 14 August had the highly positive effect of promoting a return to democracy in Greece -and I would like in passing to pay a tribute to the courageous efforts of Mr. Caramanlis- it is yet one more example of the serious difficulties we face this year.132.	In the first place  the crisis concerns the United Nations which  after trying to promote a settlement to the conflict by sending an international force to Cyprus in 1964 and more recently by sponsoring enlarged talks between the communities  must now do everything in its power to prevent the crisis from deteriorating and to facilitate a speedy settlement.133.	It is for the Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities in this matter  which it did as the tragic events unfolded by adopting resolutions that my country helped to draft  as was its duty. We remain convinced that respect for these resolutions by the parties concerned is still the indispensable basis for an equitable settlement.134.	Troubled by this dispute and anxious to restore harmony in Cyprus and between two countries linked to the European Economic Community by the same tie  the nine members of the Community have felt it to be their duty  during the course of several meetings  to add their efforts to those of the Security Council.135.	The most serious problem in Cyprus today is  without question  that of the refugees. We feel that permitting these people to return to their homes freely is consistent with both justice and public international law. We therefore believe that we should make an urgent appeal on this point in the hope of preventing the inception of another tragic refugee problem such as those which  unfortunately  we have already had  which are poisoning the international atmosphere. The problem in Cyprus can be resolved only by negotiation  without recourse to force. In this respect  we consider the talks now under way between the leaders of the island's two communities to be encouraging. I hope that these talks will pave the way  if the necessary gestures are forthcoming  for the negotiations that we should like to see started among Greece  Turkey and Cyprus  countries to which we are bound by longstanding ties of friendship.136.	There is another region where war continues to wreak havoc in various but no less cruel ways  and that is SouthEast Asia. We welcomed the Paris agreements on VietNam and the hope that they engendered. Can it be said today that those agreements are really being respected? I am fully aware of the difficulties encountered by each of the parties; but how can one fail to hope that they will have the strength to overcome the legacy of the past and ultimately to achieve peace with understanding and reconciliation?137.	Faced with these highly contrasting pictures  we can probably say that at least the danger of world confrontations involving the fate of all mankind seems to be less threatening than it was a few years ago.138.	Detente is still fragile. The protective net that it could cast still hangs too slack. Detente obviously remains -and will long remain - linked to a sustained defense effort.139.	France  for its part has  over the past 15 years  halved the proportion of its gross national product destined for military expenditure. But France has not neglected the need to ensure its security and independence by the means that others have already adopted. As a country that was the battlefield of two world wars  France is profoundly aware of the duty incumbent upon it to be capable of defending its independence. Having noted the refusal  and perhaps even the inability  of the greatest Powers to renounce their nuclear weapons  France has resolved  to its regret  to acquire them itself.140.	We too have had to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere  which  in terms of number and size  can in no way be compared with the tests previously carried out by others in the same field. We went ahead with our tests only when we were sure that they would cause no harm; and this was verified by our own controls and by those of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. We have now reached a stage in our nuclear technology that makes it possible for us to continue our program by underground testing  and we have taken steps to do so as early as next year.141.	If  given the present state of the world  no country can renounce the means of ensuring its defense  it is obviously in the general interest gradually to lighten the burden necessarily imposed by the arms race on our economies and  by the same token  on the opportunities for development. Therefore the French Government wishes solemnly to reaffirm that it is prepared to participate immediately in any undertaking designed to lead to genuine disarmament  that is to say  to the effective  gradual and controlled destruction of all existing arsenals. It was in this spirit that France gave its support to the idea of convening a world conference which  if it were to include the five nuclear Powers  might create the conditions under which real progress could be made and might strengthen the foundations for the lasting peace that is the highest aspiration of all peoples.142.	After this brief review of the world picture as it is today  I should like now to come to what is doubtless the basic issue. I refer to the present state of international economic relations and the outlook for those relations. This vital problem does not appear on our agenda  but is should be  quite clearly  the focal point of our concerns  all the more so since the situation which prompted the convening of a special session of the General Assembly this spring has deteriorated markedly in the last four months.143.	Insecurity is spreading far and wide. The most striking example of this is inflation  which is becoming rampant and to varying degrees affects every country with its attendant woes. All the elements of a world crisis are already present.144.	The developing countries  those which are not producers of oil or of important raw materials  are obviously those most affected by the rising prices of the products necessary to economic activity. But the majority of the industrialized countries have also been seriously affected  at least for the time being  There are only two or three major countries among us that are sure of having the resources indispensable to the survival of their economies and their populations  come what may  because those resources exist in their own territories. But although such States  unlike the others  do not have to fear strangulation  none  I repeat  none of the Members of our Organization can remain blind to the serious threats to the mechanisms of the world economy  to the flow of production and trade  and therefore  ultimately  to world peace.145.	The events we are witnessing are  of course  not lacking in positive features. The general redistribution of trump cards held by the highly industrialized nations and the developing nations begun by still disorganized courses of action will be described in history books as a decisive turning point of the era in which we live. This will be true if this redistribution proves itself eventually to be a transition to a new world order  better balanced and more just  and the prelude to an original and fruitful common effort.146.	Such a redistribution was both necessary and inevitable. My country  which in the past has constantly warned against the dangers inherent in the progressive deterioration of the terms of trade and in the growing gap between the industrial societies and the less favored countries  is the first to recognize that it would have been unhealthy and  ultimately  detrimental to everyone to cling to a system of inadequate remuneration for basic commodities. The prolongation of this system was doubtless one of the causes of the recent price rises.147.	This puts me in an even better position to say frankly to this Assembly that none of us can allow himself to ignore the urgency and gravity of the problem which the somewhat random nature of those increases presents not only to my country but  I believe  to all of us. Our world community can withstand the severe disruption of equilibrium that has just occurred only if we make a combined effort  on the one hand  to halt the trends towards a breakdown that are beginning to emerge  and  on the other  to achieve a new world order based on mutual consultation and cooperation.148.	In the spirit of the Charter  which for 30 years has encouraged us to cooperate in order to ensure economic and social progress for our peoples  appreciable efforts have already been made along such lines. The texts adopted on 1 May by the General Assembly during the sixth special session [resolutions 3201 (SVI) and 3202 fSF/j] are in keeping with this tradition of the Organization. Their significance and importance  I feel  lie not so much in the Program of Action that was outlined as in the clear and precise affirmation of the interdependence of all the elements of the world economy.149.	That the growth of the world economy is currently being compromised and with it the opportunities for development is so obvious as to make it superfluous to stress the need to open up new vistas in cooperation among our States. Together we must define the main lines along which the world economy must operate. In this connexion  the right of the third world countries not only to receive a fairer share of the fruits of economic and world progress but also to influence the choices on which this activity depends cannot be contested. I would add to this the hope that international aid  which is still indispensable  will gradually give way to structural reforms in which the less favored countries should have a voice.150.	Although the very great majority of the States that we represent have no intention of withdrawing into themselves  they reject the mechanisms of laissez faire  which are erratic and merciless to the weak  and my country  which has championed international cooperation for many long years now  cannot but give them our complete approval on this point. The march towards a better order is  however  incompatible with disregard for economic realities and laws  the solidarity which unites consumer and producer  and  especially  the basic consideration that no one  no matter how powerful he may be  can be sure of gaining lasting advantages by means of unilateral decisions.151.	Within a country  when one group in society tries to increase its share of the national income and when  on the other hand  other groups try to prevent their share from being reduced  inflation becomes rampant and restores  after a fashion  an often unjust and precarious balance between the claims of each group. Today this is also what is happening in the world's economy. The free rein given to market trends  the exploitation of strong positions  and the setting up of a sliding scale mechanism or of automatic indexing can lead only to a speeding up of the inflationary spiral. Among nations  as within each nation  nothing can take the place of dialog and negotiation among all the parties concerned. The natural framework for this dialog is  of course  the United Nations  and one can only regret that six months after the sixth special session no serious discussion on setting the world's economy in order has been initiated.152.	The United Nations  and not only its specialized bodies  has a general competence in this matter and is particularly qualified since it both anticipates and reflects the world community of the future to arrive at a truly ""integrated"" concept of our planet's economy. But this is a tremendous task and the adjustments to be made are numerous and difficult. The ""global"" approach within the United Nations must be supplemented by efforts at cooperation and consultation on a regional scale which should  of course  take place within an international framework.153.	It is in this spirit that the member countries of the European Economic Community have  as representatives know  just embarked on what we both call the EuropeanArab dialog with the 20 countries of the League of Arab States. Of course the undertaking is still in its early stages and it would be premature to specify its goals  but I think it is quite natural for me to mention it today in this forum  especially since you  Mr. President  have played and are continuing to play an important and even decisive role in the conception and application of this undertaking.154.	The new type of cooperation that we are trying to establish between the two groups of countries does set an example and is promising. It is a question of working together  with all the participants on an equal footing  towards social and economic progress  towards entente and rapprochement between the member countries of the European Economic Community and the member countries of the League of Arab States. It is also understood that the undertaking must not interfere with the interests of any country. On the contrary it must  when the time comes  extend its benefits beyond the European Arab group  especially to the regions close to Africa and the Mediterranean.155.	My hope is that it will be possible to present some results of this undertaking at the forthcoming session of the General Assembly. However  it might be useful  if our partners in the League of Arab States would agree  to inform the United Nations before that time of what developments may have emerged.156.	It is in the same spirit of cooperation that the European Economic Community participated in the ministerial conference which took place at Kingston  during which a fruitful dialog emerged between the countries of the Community and the Caribbean  African and Pacific States on the major political trends of their future association. The conference also set an example. Innovative formula were introduced which  I have no doubt  will help to create a new style in relations between industrialized and developing nations  and even in the drafting of a new strategy for development.157.	The European Economic Community and the United Nations are quite clearly called upon to cooperate more and more often. This is why my delegation  speaking on behalf of the Community [A 19701]  has asked for an item to be included on the agenda for this session relating to the granting to the Community of observer status within the Organization.158.	Another example of this cooperation is quite obviously the Community's offer to participate  together with other States  in the urgent measures advocated by the General Assembly at its sixth special session.159.	Let me say a word about the Organization to conclude my statement. The Charter assigns it the mission of maintaining peace and contributing to the emergence of a world that is more stable and more equitable. Let us not be complacent; the distance we must still travel before this ideal becomes a reality is great. But let us learn to apply to ourselves the severe judgments we sometimes bring to bear on the shortcomings and plodding of the United Nations. The Charter in itself possesses no magic formula  and no change could give it one. The work of the Organization depends primarily on the determination of the Governments represented here.160.	One cannot reproach the United Nations for having failed to discern the great issues at stake in today's world or for failing with respect to the great questions of the day because of a lack of imagination or indifference. The problems of development  hunger  the sea and population have been dealt with in four world conferences held under the auspices of the United Nations this year. Let us note  however  that the conclusions drawn from these major international meetings sometimes leave us dissatisfied. This is not only because it is difficult to reconcile so many interests and differing viewpoints  even when goodwill is present. It is  perhaps  also because our methods and our procedures could be improved by concentrating on the most important issues and on the search for effective action.161.	While these international meetings have the advantage of exposing all points of view  the size and number of the meetings pose problems of organization  method and procedure that are quite different from those the smaller  earlier conferences had & solve. There is a great temptation to use certain stratagems in order to finish more quickly  and it is noticeable that States are in no hurry to put into practice recommendations that have not evolved through the conventional process. Let us then try to act in concert genuinely  in the sole interest of the common good. We can do so within the context of the present Charter  whose potential could be more fully realized.162.	We are living in an age of transition. All around us we find hope  efforts being expended  and the first stages of entente and union  but at the same time we see opposition  and conflict. Which trend will finally prevail? The one that will inevitably lead to our organizing ourselves and unifying ourselves or the one that will lead  albeit temporarily I hope  to hostility  violence and division? Which will prevail?163.	The future of this world never before so conscious of its potential unity  never before so torn by real divisions is still uncertain. The task of our Organization is to guide it in the right direction  but that is also and primarily the task of each of the States represented here. The choice is either organization and reason  or passion  violence  rivalry and confrontation  and eventually  chaos and misfortune for us all. The simple statement of this choice is sufficient to explain our determination and our faith in the emergence of universal reconciliation."
"44",2472,"GAB",29,1974,"Speaking as I am for the first time from this rostrum and representing a country whose policy is profoundly attached to the noble principles of dialog and tolerance and which resolutely directs its efforts towards universal peace and the harmonious development of peoples  I must of course pay tribute to all those who have given of their best for the birth and survival of the United Nations.142.	For in spite of the shortcomings of its Charter  which must finally be brought into line with the political facts of the time  and in spite of imperfections in its functioning  our Organization remains the only hope of all peoples seeking to rise above either their particularism or their selfishness. It is the ideal instrument  if only because it sprang from the very ashes of tyranny  to fight enslavement  oppression and exploitation of man by  man. It is the proper place for perfecting by diversification our means of co-operation and our systems of mutual international assistance which today  more than ever  are the sine qua non of our survival in this century of necessary inter-dependence.143.	Mr. President  at a time when a new wind is blowing through Africa  a continent which has so long been enslaved and robbed of its personality  the choice of you by our General Assembly   to preside over the proceedings of its twenty-ninth session assumes particular significance and becomes a kind of symbol. I have no need  therefore  to 'refer to the special links between Algeria and Gabon  and I will only express my sincere joy and that of my delegation at seeing you presiding.144.	It is true  Sir  that your tried and tested capacities and your exceptional qualities as a statesman have largely transcended our merely bilateral context  and it is  you may believe me  all of Africa and  along with Africa  all the friends of your country who join in congratulating you and in being gratified at your election. Here  as elsewhere  you will  I am sure  know the legitimate satisfaction enjoyed by great men at their own success* The dignity  the outstanding intellectual and diplomatic qualities  and the effective contribution of your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Benites of Ecuador  eloquently testify to the fact that the Third World is not lacking in great men.145.	It could not be otherwise when we have our distinguished Secretary-General as an immediate colleague. We must  indeed  recognize objectively the devotion and effectiveness of Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has breathed new life into the Organization and who  among other noteworthy achievements  has found it possible to restore to the United Nations  particularly by means of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East and his contacts with the new Lisbon Government  its essential role as the guardian of international peace. My delegation would like to congratulate him publicly and would ask him to convey to all his colleagues our encouragement and sympathy.146.	Declaring at the very outset that a new wind is blowing through Africa  I had in mind above all the various aspects of the disturbing problem of decolonization. Indeed  after centuries of an absurd policy  we find the Portuguese people and its army rising valiantly to drive out the Fascists and to restore democracy.147.	Hence my joy and the privilege I find it to greet here  on behalf of the people and Government of Gabon  the delegation of the sister Republic of Guinea- Bissau  and I would request that delegation to transmit to all the sons of its motherland the message of our admiration and friendship.148.	The purest blood of African youth  including the noble and precious blood of Amilcar Cabral  will thus not have been shed in vain  and the youth of Portugal themselves  innocent  free of interests which were of no benefit to them and of a cause which was a disservice to their country and their prosperity  will no longer see their destiny withering on the vine  precisely where it has a role to play on behalf of human fraternity. An epoch has ended with the fall of the Fascists  who have met the fate reserved for all those of their ilk. Thus  there is a new wind blowing which dictates an objective appreciation of the new face of Portugal and means that we must stretch out our hand to Lisbon  so that as soon as possible and on the model of the Partido African© da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde (PAIGC)  the Frente de Libertaao de Mozambique (FRELIMO)  the Movimiento de Liberacion de las Islas de Santo Tome y Principe  the Movimento Popular de Libertaao de Angola (MPLA) and the Frente Nacional para a Libertasao de Angola (FN LA) will come to exercise an effective administration over their respective territories 149.	The Portuguese Government must realize that the democratic reforms it is undertaking now in its own country have meaning in Africa only in the context of uncalculating decolonization and real and immediate independence for our peoples. In this regard my delegation notes with satisfaction the statement made from this rostrum on 23 September by the Foreign Minister of Portugal [2239th meeting). Certainly this requires courage  and is even dangerous vis-a-vis the major multinational firms and others who possess naval bases. But the rebirth of the Portuguese nation  the restoration of its dignity and international esteem depend on such courage as indeed does its future in Africa and its true prosperity.150.	This is also the time to condemn once again  in the face of an outraged international conscience  the odious crime of apartheid  which in South Africa  in Namibia and in Rhodesia has blotted out the personality of millions of human beings  on a scale unprecedented in history  from the land of their ancestors.151.	This situation constitutes a vast plot against us  but let me not be misunderstood: one cannot keep down for ever a people determined to free itself from tyranny or  even more  from foreign oppression. It is time therefore for those primarily responsible for international peace  some of whom are also the disguised allies of apartheid  to put an end to genocide and the threat of racial war which is constantly hanging over this part of Africa  where already sovereign neighboring countries are constantly subject to provocation.152.	If I have begun with the problem of the dignity of our people and our continent  it is none the less true that other situations  particularly affecting world peace and the world economy  are of concern to my delegation  and in any case the two subjects are very closely interconnected.153.	Convinced that there is no real national independence without economic independence  Gabon whole-heartedly endorses the arguments put forward at the sixth special session by President Houari Boumediene [2208th meeting] which led to the conclusion that there is an imperative necessity to reform the international economic system.154.	Already Gabon has been striving to transcend the narrow framework of its own borders and to form a part of larger entities. This justifies our membership in the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa  our membership in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and also our relations with the European Common Market and the Group of 77 developing countries -which perhaps should properly be called the Group of 97.155.	We are therefore ready to broaden our horizons to embrace all States  whatever their national political orientation  provided they understand and accept the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of their trading partners. We consider it indispensable that we belong to the non-aligned group of countries because  in the face of the deplorable economic and financial fabric woven in their absence against the Third World countries to which we belong and which has no other purpose but their perpetual domination by systematic pillaging of their national resources  we must now bring to bear the strength of our cohesiveness and of our right  our permanent and sovereign right  over our natural resources  including our fishing resources in territorial waters  our right to study and to establish ourselves the price of our products  and our right also to deal with trading partners of our own choice  giving priority to trade between countries which are in the process of construction.156.	We are all aware of the effects of monetary disorder engendered by an outmoded economic system  but Gabon firmly believes that no one can continue to be powerful enough to subordinate perpetually a universal majority and to avoid the eventual application of the historic decisions taken in this very Hall from 9 April to 2 May this year by the sixth special session of the General Assembly  a session which the President of the Republic of Gabon  His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo  attended personally.157.	Reaffirming our total adherence to those decisions and principles as they were clearly enunciated on that occasion  particularly the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the Program of Action flowing from it [resolution 3202.(S-VI)]  the Republic of Gabon cannot refrain from condemning certain attempts to sow confusion or diversionary tactics which became apparent in the course of this special session  while the fundamental data of our concerns are clear and unequivocal. These are a fair price  for our primary products  reform of the international monetary system  transfer of technology and industrialization of our countries  control over the dangerous activities of multinational companies  our permanent sovereignty over our natural resources and a new concept of the assistance which may be granted to us. Because if to undertake investment in order to earn one's own profit is not aid and cannot be considered as such  any assistance with strings attached which forces any obligation upon the recipient is not aid either.158.	The countries in the process of construction want to act rapidly to consolidate their economic independence in order to raise their standard of living and relieve the privation of their people. This .requires from their partners  which are industrialized friendly countries  political courage  lucidity of judgment and sound understanding. It is quite useless  otherwise  to broadcast throughout the world pious intentions of solidarity and universal mutual assistance.159.	My delegation considers that we have no right to talk honestly of our desire for peace before we agree that attempts be made and success achieved in realizing the objectives which I have mentioned and which affect the fate of three quarters of mankind in a new context of international co-operation that will make it possible for everyone to enjoy his fair share.160.	Indeed  no one can deny that economic blockades without any other justification than provocation  struggles for influence and hegemony that provoke and maintain the wars which devastate the third world and subversion aimed against the sovereign Governments of our States  derive from the ruthless competition  engaged in by certain nations for the sake of economic monopolies  which are irrefutably incompatible with the advent of a new era of international peace.161.	Concerned both as the primary theater of these upheavals and as an integral part of a society which is in this way collectively threatened  the Third World appeals to the conscience of the great Powers for a change of heart that would lead rapidly to effective and lasting peace.162.	For its part  Gabon calls whole-heartedly for this peace  thanks to which vast financial resources and inestimable discoveries arid technological achievements would be restored^ to global development programs. That is why we unreservedly support any sincere and realistic initiative that may lead tother general and complete disarmament of the countries which suspect each other and keep each other under surveillance  while their arsenals of destruction become ever more sophisticated.163.	The maintenance of peace is the primary role of the United Nations. Gabon would like to see this Organization fully play this role  thanks to the new spirit which should be that of our Charter  which it j is indispensable to revise. The Charter was prepared 29 years ago by 50 States  that is to say  by a minority which cannot make decisions for the 138 delegations represented here today. And the non-aligned countries which constitute the majority of the Organization and eke out their lives at the mercy of the veto of the minority are firmly determined on this matter.164.	Let peace reign through justice and long live the United Nations."
"45",2516,"GBR",29,1974,"Mr. President  I thank you for calling upon me at this late hour when the prospect of lunch must be so much more alluring than the thought of another indigestible speech. I can only undertake that I shall not be over-long or take too much of your time.203.	I must  however  begin by offering the congratulations of the United Kingdom to you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the Assembly  especially as your country has played such a large and important role in the work of the Organization  and we are all looking forward to a period of constructive work under your guidance.204.	Like others who have spoken  we also welcome two new Members from the Commonwealth —Bangladesh and Grenada as well as Guinea- Bissau  the latest country to achieve its independence.205.	This is the first time I have had the honor of addressing the Assembly and I regret it will not be possible for me to stay after lunchtime. I must invoke the newcomer's privilege of making some remarks  with your permission  about our hopes and aspirations for this Organization.206.	I start by giving an assurance that it is the firm policy of my Government to give all possible support to the United Nations. We do so because we believe that this body is the best forum in which to come to grips with many of the daunting problems that face mankind.207.	It should not need an energy crisis  a population crisis  a raw-material crisis  to tell us that the world is shrinking and making us more interdependent. These are by now the cliches of our perorations; we no longer need to prove the point. Yet when action is needed we still do not behave as though we believe it. To say this implies no criticism of this Organization itself.208.	Too often we use the United Nations as a whipping-boy for our own inability to act in concert in response to a common problem. The weaknesses in international co-operation which exist today are not United Nations weaknesses. The responsibility rests with us  the Member nations  that have willed that the United Nations should work on the basis of the lowest common denominator of agreement between the Member States. This negative consensus for that is what it is sometimes means little more than a wafer-thin formula to paper over our differences without any real meeting of minds. Such a consensus cannot be construed as universal approval. Indeed  because it happens in this way  there are occasions when the words in which we express this negative consensus have no chance of being translated into action because the action proposed does not correspond with realities. 209.	What we need in order to be able to act together is positive consensus: a determined effort to reach common ground and an equal determination to work together to overcome the political and economic threats to our peoples.210.	I do not underestimate the difficulties. Our interests are as varied as the nations we represent. But in the past  diverse nations have successfully sunk their differences and combined to face a common enemy. We face common enemies today: inflation  recession and poverty. Let us unite to defeat them.211.	But if we are to achieve this positive consensus for which I ask  we need not only sound policies; we need the attitude of mind expressed by the then Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  Willy Brandt  when he spoke to this Assembly at the twenty-eighth session and said:"".. .we have not come here to use the United Nations as a wailing-wall ... or to make claims we know cannot be met here in any case  Rather have we come to assume our share in the responsibility for world affairs on the basis of our convictions and within the framework of our possibilities"" [2128th meeting  para. 6] It is in that spirit that the United Kingdom Government is determined to bring to this Assembly the political will to make a responsible contribution to solving the problems before us. This will be the evidence of our pledge of support.212.	Before I came here I took the precaution of reading the deliberations of the preceding session of the General Assembly. In many speeches then as indeed is the case of speeches on this occasion the recurring theme was the progress of detente. Mr. Kissinger referred then [2124th meeting] to a commonality of interests between the United States and the Soviet Union in establishing a broad  web of constructive relationships. Mr. Gromyko said [2126th meeting] and he referred to it again today that we had achieved a shift from an extended period of tension in the world to business-like co-operation. He knows and the Soviet Union knows that since I assumed my present office it has been my firm desire that the United Kingdom should play a full and positive part in fostering such ""business-like co-operation"" in our bilateral contacts.213.	On the level of multilateral negotiations  the talks in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and about mutual and balanced force reductions have been moving  to put it politely  at a very slow pace. I hope we can shift both sets of talks into a higher gear so that we can report some positive results before this Assembly meets next.214.	The talks in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in particular are given sufficient good will and understanding for the concerns and interests of all the participants ripe for an early conclusion. We have always recognized that the talks on mutual and balanced force reductions would be much more complex and long-term. But our aim in both sets of negotiations should be the same  to achieve in Europe an order which would allow our people to live in security and co-operation and at the same time reduce the crippling burden of arms spending.215.	It would be a triumph indeed if Europe  which too often in this century has been the center of inhumanity and senseless conflict  could set the pattern for a new order of international relations free of war and the threat of war. Fortunately  it is some years since the threat of war between East and West was a major preoccupation of the United Nations; but the complex of new and interrelated problems are in their different ways as serious a threat to us all.216.	This transfer of our attention has  of course  been brought about by massive and unprecedented increases in the price of oil. On the surface but only on the surface it might appear that there is a. natural difference of interest between those countries which would like to see oil prices reduced and those which wish to keep them at their present levels or indeed to increase them. That is not so. It is in the interests of both producer and consumer alike that the prices of commodities and of manufactured goods should not chase each other upwards in a never ending spiral.217.	In the meantime  even if  as we hope  prices will not remain at their present peak  we have to face the problem of how to adapt the world's monetary and economic systems to accommodate the vast oil revenues now accruing to certain countries some of which cannot immediately absorb them.218.	The objective is clear and quite straightforward. It is to marry the revenue of the oil-producing countries with the' technology of the developed countries  so that the increased production and world trade which would result from such a marriage would be used primarily to benefit the developing countries of the world which need them most. Our knowledge of international monetary mechanisms is sufficiently advanced to enable us to do this and to do it in a way that would be fair both to the oil-producing countries themselves and to those that need the resources. New techniques will be required  but it is by no means impossible to create them if there is the political will and an understanding of the problem.219.	The unprecedented world-wide economic boom of recent years led to higher commodity prices prior to the recent increases in world oil prices. In turn these higher prices for raw materials found their way into the price of manufactured goods  and the resulting inflation coincided with a period in which the Bretton Woods system for controlling international monetary relationships fell into disarray. Collective action is now urgent if we are to ensure that the large surplus oil funds are used constructively to maintain demand and the level of world trade  because inevitably the surpluses of the oil producers are matched by deficits on the part of the consumers.220.	In our view it will be an error which will have global consequences if the oil consumers try individually to eliminate their oil-induced deficits in advance of international agreement on the disposal and investment of the oil producers. That way lies general recession  increasing poverty and social unrest The surplus must be taken into account. "
"46",2587,"GHA",29,1974,"Mr. President  your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the Assembly comes at a time when dramatic events are taking place in Africa and the question of peace and stability on our continent is weighing heavily on the minds of the international community. May I on behalf of the Government and people of Ghana  and on my own behalf  congratulate you heartily and express our confidence that under your able presidency the urgent business before the Assembly will be conducted with all seriousness and in earnest. The election of such an eminent African statesman as President of this body is a matter of great pride to us from Africa. It carries with it prestige and preeminence  and is a tribute not only to our continent  your country and the people of Algeria  but also to you personally.85.	Sir  my delegation cannot help recalling that it was in Algiers and with your active assistance as the Foreign Minister of your country that Portugal concluded  on 26 August of this year  its talks with Guinea- Bissau. Those talks  among other things  resulted in the long-overdue recognition by Portugal of the inalienable right of the people of Guinea-Bissau  and that of all others in its other dependent Territories  including Mozambique and Angola  to self-determination and independence. My delegation has no doubt whatsoever that you  Sir  will bring the same resourcefulness to the direction of the work of this session. We on our part assure you of our co-operation.86.	Mr. President  my delegation is also gratified to have worked under the guidance of your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Benites. His patience  tenacity of purpose and dedication steered us not only through the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly  but also through the crucial sixth special session. I wish to convey to him through you  Sir  my delegation's unqualified appreciation.87.	To the Secretary-General  through whose purposefulness and dedication the affairs of the Organization have been so well managed despite unexpected and serious difficulties at times  we express our deep appreciation and sincere thanks. My delegation gladly accepts his repent to this session [AI9601 and Add.I]  and remains confident that the qualities for which he has become so well known will continue to be applied for the benefit of the international community.88.	My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to welcome Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada to membership in this body. We are happy that one year after its independence Guinea-Bissau has been accepted as a member of both the Organization of African Unity and a Member of the United Nations  to mention only two organizations. We have no doubt that the participation of the new Members in our deliberations will contribute to the eventual attainment of the international justice and peace for which we all continue to strive.89.	Mr. President  in welcoming Guinea-Bissau to the Assembly when you are in the presidential chair  I am reminded in particular of the striking similarities between the triumphant struggle of the Algerian people and-that of the people of Guinea-Bissau. Both countries faced the implacable and ruthless action of colonial Powers. Both waged a long struggle of national liberation against colonial Powers desperately determined to pursue the untenable constitutional myth whereby African colonial territories were considered extensions of European metropolitan Powers. In both cases  while the Organization grappled with the problem of bringing the colonial Powers concerned to see reason  the iron determination of the peoples of the territories triumphed over the arms of the oppressors. In both Algeria and Guinea-Bissau  the two colonial Powers out of desperation sought to intimidate and terrorize sympathetic neighboring territories. Thus Algeria's neighbours—Morocco  Tunisia and the Arab Republic of Egypt -can to this day show the world the scars of their wounds. Guinea- Bissau's neighbours—Guinea and Senegal - suffered the ravages of external invasion and threats to their territorial integrity.90.	The heroic struggles of the peoples of Algeria and Guinea-Bissau have demonstrated to the whole world that colonialism is permanent aggression and a threat to international peace and security. Consequently  the struggles of both Algeria and Guinea-Bissau were given collective support by the United Nations. The independence of Algeria and Guinea-Bissau was recognized by the world Organization even before the formal ceremonial procedure of admission was effected. In their final hour of triumph  not only did the brave peoples of Algeria and Guinea-Bissau liberate their peoples but  by the irony of history  their struggles profoundly affected the internal politics of the metropolitan countries themselves  which led to popular  political  economic and social changes.91.	Allow me to salute the gallant and heroic people of Guinea-Bissau. The Government and people of Ghana would like to pay tribute to both the people of Guinea-Bissau and the intellectual depth that has marked the philosophical and revolutionary horizons held out to the people by the vanguard party  Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC]  at every stage of the long struggle.92.	We pay a solemn tribute to the revered memory of our brother Amilcar Cabral  who laid down his life for the noble cause of his country's liberation. On this occasion we are reminded of his wise reflections on the intellectual arrogance of imperialists on the destiny of oppressed Africa:""There is a preconception  held by many people  even on the Left  that imperialism made us enterhistory at the moment when it began its adventure in our countries. This preconception must be denounced. We consider that  when imperialism arrived in Guinea  it made us leave history our history.""93.	It is the history of the people of Guinea-Bissau  interrupted by 500 years of imperialism  that is now resuming its natural course before our very eyes. In celebrating the formal admission of the people of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations  we are celebrating the victory of the whole human race  the victory of the progressive forces of the world. Imperialism has done its worst to splinter our common humanity into fragments by creating hatred between peoples and by setting race against race. But the human spirit has always resisted and reasserted its wholeness. In this  it has not lacked dedicated agents  among which  we submit  the victorious people of Guinea-Bissau ranks among the high and honored in the revolutionary world.94.	Considering what havoc imperialism has wrought in terms of human and material resources  it is an achievement of no mean proportions and significance that the African peoples have yet managed to preserve their sense of dignity and to move forward in search of political  economic  social and cultural advancement. Suppressed  persecuted and betrayed even by those sections of the world community from which it could rightly expect support  African life has survived  seeking refuge in villages and forests and in the indomitable spirit of generations of victims of colonialist and racist oppression.95.	The people of Guinea-Bissau have a homespun saying: ""A crouching man cannot support anyone on his knees."" In spite of all well-meaning assurances of future aid  Portugal cannot be expected to bear the entire brunt of making restitution for the years of economic misuse of the resources of Guinea-Bissau. We appeal to all Member States to offer genuine assistance. We feel bound  however  to qualify our appeal and to warn especially the once powerful allies of Portugal that if they join in making reparations to that small  newly independent State they must do so without any subtle attempts to substitute neo-colonialist arrangements for the crumbling colonial structure. We ourselves would have preferred all aid to be channeled  if possible  through the United Nations. That  at least  the people of Guinea-Bissau deserve of the United Nations. Let me restate here also that the time has come for those Powers to stop their unbridled interference in the affairs of the small nations  interference that has often created tragic situations for our peoples.96.	I have dwelt at length on the independence of Guinea-Bissau because of its profound significance for peace and development in Africa. The aspirations of Africans are towards peace and development  and freedom in dignity is an essential ingredient of those aspirations. But so long as the framework of peace continues to be based on imperialist and racist interests in Africa  so long will our oppressed peoples continue to fight for their inalienable right to freedom and human dignity. The victory of Guinea-Bissau testifies - as  very soon  will the victories of Mozambique and Angola- to the indomitability of the human spirit  which  when aroused in indignation against injustices  oppression and all forms of indignity  can withstand and overcome ruthless forces of oppression.97.	Just as today we welcome Guinea-Bissau  so shall we tomorrow welcome into the Assembly the new States of Mozambique  Angola  Sao Tome and Principe  Namibia  Zimbabwe and Azania. Time is on the side of the African majorities in southern Africa. Any conspiracy by the racist and reactionary white settlers in southern Africa to prevent the emergence of independent African States would not only be short-sighted but also would create a dangerous situation in southern Africa. Mother Africa can no longer remain heedless to the anguished cries of her sons and daughters still in bondage and servitude.98.	It was our own Kwame Nkrumah who warned from this very rostrum some 14 years ago: ""Africa wants her freedom; Africa must be free. It is a simple call  but it is also a signal  a red light of warning to those who would tend to ignore it.""99.	The racist minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa are frightened by recent developments in the Territories under Portuguese domination. They are increasing their defense budgets and imposing special surcharges on their citizens in order to maintain the status quo in southern Africa. They are recruiting and regrouping mercenaries in order to cause confusion and upheaval in Mozambique and Angola. It must be made clear to those racist minority regimes in southern Africa that the only honorable way out of their present predicament is to come to terms with the revolutionary events crowding in on them while there is still time.100.	The Government and people of Ghana would like to place on record their satisfaction at the determination of the Government of Portugal to fulfill its promises of full independence for the peoples in the TerritorLi under its colonial control and express the hope that the progressive and enlightened influences in present-day Portugal will continue to respond positively to the urgent demand for freedom and in-dependence in its remaining Territories in Africa. It is our belief that  if the Government of Portugal keeps its pledge to the world and shoulders full translatability for the complete transfer of power to tnc accredited and proven leaders of the people in these Territories  Portugal can look forward to a new era of friendly relations and co-operation with independent Africa.101.	No group of States relies more on conciliation  dialog and communication in the search for a peaceful and just world than do the Members from the developing world. No one believes more in the effect of peaceful negotiations than we do. An honest reading of the positions that we have been advocating would expose the weak moral grounding of the allies of the racist regimes of southern Africa.102.	Our words and actions stand in sharp contrast to the world-publicized ambivalence of South Africa's Western allies. This is no time for recriminations  but we fail to see any consistency between their declared support for the principles of the Charter that concern human rights and their continued support of these racist regimes. Their objections to sanctions and their rejection of enforcement measures designed to weaken the resolution of the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia to pursue their iniquitous policies only help to shore up the flagging morale of those regimes. It is not enough to express horror at the evil policies of those racist minority regimes. If mere pious words or declarations constituted the ultimate remedy for these evils  I am sure that we would not need the help of South Africa's Western allies. In the face of the present situation in southern Africa  we invite the trading partners of South Africa and Rhodesia to join us in exploring the avenues for rapid solutions to the questions of southern Africa  Namibia and Rhodesia.103.	My delegation has given consideration to South Africa's recent effort to save its face. I refer to document A/9775 of 26 September of this year.3 This document brings to our attention a statement issued by the Executive of the National Party of South West Africa. In the view of my delegation  the statement constitutes one more insult which the Organization has had to tolerate from South Africa. It is the hope of my delegation that the Organization will tell South Africa in no uncertain terms that the ultimate responsibility for the future of South West Africa lies with the United Nations. What is at issue here is South Africa's continued defiance of this Organization and its flouting of the decision of the International Court of Justice on the status of that Territory. What we would like to hear from South Africa is when that country will abandon this defiance.104.	'	In defining the basis of Ghana's foreign policy recently  our head of State and Chairman of the National Redemption Council  Colonel I. K. Acheampong  said:""We are not racists. Indeed we are opposed to racism in all its forms and manifestations. Thus we believe it is possible and desirable for various races and ethnic groups to live in equality and brotherhood in an African context  once all accept a common loyalty and devotion to the nation and its institutions. We have proved by many examples that it is possible to coexist with erstwhile colonialists when this takes place in an atmosphere of equality  freedom and tolerance.""It is this fundamental belief of Ghana  and our demonstrated commitment to it  which makes it possible for us to appeal here to the Western Powers to join us in the common purpose of helping to create speedily in southern Africa a society based on true freedom  equality and justice.105.	While we are preoccupied with events in Africa  we are not unmindful of equally serious threats to peace that exist elsewhere. The Middle East  and more recently Cyprus  continue to pose a problem for the Organization. The Government and people of Ghana continue to view the situations with grave concern  not only because of the potential they have for causing a resumption of serious conflict  but more for the terrible consequences of those hostilities on the lives of the peoples of those areas.106.	Ghana is committed to assisting the efforts of the United Nations at securing peace in the Middle East. To this end  we have contributed troops to the United Nations Emergency Force serving in the area in the hope that  with the combined efforts of the countries which have done likewise  and with the guidance of the Security Council  we shall succeed in generating a willingness on the part of all the States concerned to come to terms with each other  respect each other's rights and eventually live in peace and harmony. Our troops will continue to be available to the Organization for so long as their presence is deemed necessary.107.	If there is any lesson to be drawn from the spiral of violence in the Middle East  it is that the claims of the parties to the conflict touch the very life and spirit of their peoples. Thus  my delegation believes that no lasting solution can be found without addressing ourselves seriously to the Palestinian question. It is evident also that there can be no easing of tension until the initial step is taken to discourage the acquisition of the territories of others by conquest. Historical claims to territory are the central issue in the question and the roads to peaceful negotiation will be blocked if there is any further alienation of territory from any of the parties to the conflict.108.	True  there can be no lasting peace until all States in the area are assured of secure  recognized and guaranteed frontiers in an overall negotiated settlement. But  since peace begins in the minds of men  there can be no negotiation to determine secure and guaranteed borders until the parties can feel psychologically disposed to this. Therefore  we do not advocate negotiation based on pre-conditions. That is a denial of the very essence of negotiation/But it is clearly an illusion to believe that much can be achieved in this Middle East impasse by a reliance on the well- known proposition ""negotiation from a position of strength"". The foundations of peace in the Middle East have to be carefully laid on the basis of mutual tolerance and by avoiding the past mistake of resorting to a trial of military strength and technical superiority.109.	Some of the tragic elements of the Middle East crisis appear to recur in the worsening situation in nearby Cyprus. We have from the very beginning advocated respect for the sovereign independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. We have never seen any virtue in claims for annexation of the island by any Power. The integrity of Cyprus cannot be predicated on the uncertain and short-term advantage which some believe may accrue to one or other of the two communities in the island.110.	My delegation cannot subscribe to a permanent occupation of Cyprus by foreign troops of any origin; we cannot support any doctrine or policy aimed at uniting the island with any other State on purely ethnic grounds. It is our conviction that the solution to the Cyprus problem consists in creating a secure existence for all communities on the island. It is equally important to insulate the State of Cyprus from super-Power pursuit of strategic interests in the eastern Mediterranean.111.	It was barely a month ago that the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea came to an end in Caracas. That Conference was the third substantive attempt by the international community in the course of this decade to evolve an equitable  orderly and peaceful system for the utilization of the benefits which the oceans and- their floor have bestowed on mankind.112.	Since the Caracas Conference  there have been comments from some quarters which indicate some disappointment  even disillusion  at the results achieved. The Ghana Government does not share these assessments. In our view  the Conference achieved what it could reasonably be expected to achieve.113.	While saying thL  my delegation would be the first to recognize that the extent of progress we make at the next conference  scheduled to take place in Geneva in March and April next year  will depend upon our political will to negotiate at that session. Perhaps  out of frustration  which as I have already indicated is unjustified  hints have been dropped here and there that  unless an early agreement is reached on a convention on the sea  certain countries intend to start unilateral exploration of the sea-bed and exploitation of its resources. It is our hope that no country will resort to that course of action. We say this because we consider that course of action to be fraught with great danger to the harmony and peace of the world. Any such action  therefore  could not be considered responsible and in the interest of the world community as a whole.114.	The Caracas Conference followed closely on the heels of the sixth special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and a new economic order. That session taught all of us that it is only by conscious collective action that the problems of this planet can be resolved. Previous efforts at creating a fair and equitable international economic system  including UNCTAD  all foundered on the conflicting and seemingly irreconcilable interests of different groups of States.115.	Recent events have shown and lent tremendous support to the conviction that it is only by creating a new economic and social order that we can hope to avoid the threatening catastrophe which is bound to be the fate of mankind if we persist in confrontation and the pursuit of selfish goals. The new economic and social order should reflect our global interdependence while eschewing the present inequities in international trade and world financial monetary systems.116.	If my delegation urges the international community to ensure adequate assistance to needy countries  we should not be understood to be preaching the perpetuation of the dependence of developing countries on alms from the developed or industrialized countries. What we are urging is the transfer of such technological ""know-how"" and other inputs as are most likely to conduce to the self-generating development of the receiving countries. By our request we seek to ensure that developing countries will ultimately become as self-sufficient and self-reliant as may be compatible with international interdependence.U7. Ghana  under the National Redemption Council  is today demonstrating its commitment to the idea of self-reliance which we have adopted as the cardinal principle of our charter of redemption. By its application in all our national endeavours we have achieved a measure of success in reorganizing our economy and improving our circumstances to the extent of reducing our dependence on external sources to feed ourselves. We are mobilizing our resources in a new spirit of self-confidence and our people are beginning to see the fruits of their efforts. Our expectation of a better life is therefore great. It is this great expectation that has made us so acutely conscious of the disastrous effects on Ghana's economy of the prevailing high and rising cost of oil.118.	The estimated increase in crude oil prices for Ghana for 1974 is 300 per cent over the 1973 prices  while in terms of foreign exchange expenditure the 1974 prices of crude oil and petroleum products account for about 63 per cent of our total foreign exchange expenditure. These are indeed staggering figures.119.	The over-all effect of the energy crisis on the Ghanaian economy is very wide-ranging not only because of the immediate strain it has placed on our foreign exchange disbursements but also because of the problems it poses  directly or indirectly  for the success of our policy of self-reliance. In this respect  an immediate victim wiH'Be the much-acclaimed ""Operation Feed Yourself' program.120.	There is little doubt that the picture I have painted applies generally to most if not all non-oil- producing developing countries. However  I do not want to be interpreted as indicting the oil-producing countries. I say this because it should be general knowledge that several factors are responsible for the present economic recession into which the world as a whole seems to be falling.121.	We cannot ignore the fact that in the past prices paid for raw materials as a whole have been very low  while those for manufactured goods have maintained constantly increasing levels. The action by the oil- producing countries is therefore seen by my delegation as a reaction to this situation and an attempt to introduce an overdue balance. The right approach to the problem  in our view  would be to give careful consideration to all elements which could be considered responsible for the present dislocation in the international economy. We believe that the present world economic crisis can be solved only by co-operative action by the international community as a whole. Recriminations and apportioning of blame cannot be the answer.122.	My delegation welcomes the agreements reached between the United States and the Soviet Union on further limitations on anti-missile defense systems and on the limitation of underground testing of nuclear weapons. We also appreciate the efforts being made for further limitation of strategic offensive weapons. We urge that these efforts be continued. In spite of this progress  my delegation does not believe that enough has been achieved in the area of nuclear disarmament to give us hope for the future of mankind.123.	What to my delegation seems to be the greatest threat to peace and the human race is the arms race and the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons entered into force on 5 March 1970  but as yet not all countries have signed or acceded to it. My delegation has noted all the reasons which have been advanced by certain countries for not signing the Treaty. However  it is the belief of my delegation that so long as this situation persists  so long will these remain a real danger of other countries disregarding the Treaty and acquiring nuclear weapons of their own.124.	It has been stated  for instance  that some countries are now using the increase in oil prices as an excuse for developing nuclear technology as a means of generating alternative sources of power. It is common knowledge  however  that there is only a very thin line separating the peaceful uses of nuclear power from its destructive uses. My delegation recognizes the positive benefits which nuclear power can bestow on mankind. The nature of nuclear technology  however  seems to suggest that a system of international control of its use is necessary if mankind is to be able to enjoy its positive benefits without suffering the effects of its negative uses. My delegation thus continues to hope that the third session of the Preparatory Committee of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to be held in February 1975  will be able to advance the establishment of such controls.125.	I have touched on some of the central issues which affect the precarious peace and unstable development in the world. I have done this from the perspective of a third-world State which believes that the rights and interests of the millions of people of Africa and the developing countries generally should more than ever compel the mature attention of the international community. If we have met again this year to review the basis of peace  let us not subordinate the interests of the third world to those of the big Powers and their allies. Let us constantly remind ourselves that our search for peace will be illusory if we remain blind to the issues facing the third world.126.	Traumatic events during the past year in Africa  the Americas  Europe  the Middle East  Asia and theFar East point to the fact that we are at another historic turning-point. Whether or not the way ahead will lead to peace  justice and progress will  to some extent  depend on the positions each Member State takes on the urgent issues before us. Let us by our deliberations during this session  and actions to follow  demonstrate a determined will to pursue courses that will lead lo the ultimate fulfillment of the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and collectively tackle the problems of our time in the wider interests of the human race."
"47",2634,"GIN",29,1974,"Recent developments in the international situation have aroused hopes. The agreements concerning peace and co-operation reached in areas of tension in the world; the dialog to bring about greater equality and justice in trade and co-operation between rich and developing countries initiated at the sixth special session on raw materials and development; the victory of progressive forces in certain parts of the world as on 25 April in Portugal  when the Portuguese people triumphed over fascism; and the troop disengagement agreements in Sinai and the Golan Heights aimed at achieving a peaceful settlement of the Middle East crisis  are all events which mark an important stage in the liberation struggle of the peoples.93.	However  while we are gratified at these developments we must recognize that there are still many hot-beds of tension.94.	In the Middle East the disengagement agreements binding the parties in no way get to the root of the problem  and a great deal remains to be done to bring about a just and lasting peace in that area. Here  any peace settlement which does not take into account the fate of the Palestinian people and the restoration of their rights will not encompass the basic elements of the fundamental problem of the area.95.	When weSnention Palestine we are hardly thinking of the notoriety which the vicissitudes of history have conferred on the place. Our hearts  our attachment  our respect and our unconditional support go straight to this nation of martyrs  victim of oppression and deprivation  a people whose right to life would be denied.96.	In the Mediterranean  it is Cyprus which has been the scene of a bloody confrontation. As we have said here and elsewhere  the internal affairs of every country must be managed by its people without any foreign intervention. This principle must prevail in any solution to the tragedy of Cyprus.97.	South-East Asia still remains a source of concern to the international community. The elementary and inalienable rights of the peoples are being made the subject of deals and bargaining and the chances of peace there continue to be jeopardized.98.	The obstinate resistance of the regimes of Phnom Penh and Saigon to the liberation forces regrettably removes any grounds for optimism. The greatest good which could be done by those who support Lon Nol in Cambodia would be to stop all aid to his regime which has amply demonstrated its unpopularity  and to recognize as the only legitimate Government  that of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.99.	In Viet Nam  the situation remains critical and requires an urgent solution before it is too late. The hopes aroused by the Paris agreements are vanishing with every passing day in the face of the flagrant and repeated violations of clause of those agreements by the Saigon regime  which is still being supported and strengthened against the liberation forces.100.	In the Korean peninsula  as has been stated and continued by the Korean people themselves  re-unification should be brought about with independence without recourse to force or outside intervention. Hence  the United Nations should recall and withdraw all troops stationed under its flag in South Korea. The continued maintenance of these troops is contrary to the rights and aspirations of the Korean people and makes no contribution to bringing this people closer to national unity and reconciliation.101.	These are situations -just to mention a few- fraught with consequences that have a dangerous effect on the prospects for peace. Peace can last only if it is founded on the solid foundation of justice  because without justice the world may well be compared to a house built on sand which collapses when the slightest crack appears.102.	Mr. President  at this stage of the discussion  permit me to associate myself with previous speakers in conveying to you our warm congratulations on your election and expressing to you our great pleasure at seeing you in this important post at this session. Your ability  your vast experience  your great knowledge of the questions which are of concern today to our Organization  confirm us in our faith that  under your Presidency  this session will be crowned with success.103.	I could not fail to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the President of the twenty- eighth session  Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador  who discharged his functions with such authority  skill and devotion and with such a high sense of responsibility.104.	May we also take this opportunity to repeat our great appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr  Kurt Waldheim  for the many efforts he has made in such a short time to advance the cause of understanding among peoples and peace and justice throughout the world. He may be assured of our full co-operation and support.105.	It is quite natural for us to rejoice at the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Grenada to the family of the United Nations. The achievement of their independence and their admission to the United Nations represent another victory for the ideals of our Organization. It is also a reaffirmation of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. We are counting on close co-operation and collaboration with the delegations of both countries.106.	My delegation cannot express with sufficient force or the right words the deep satisfaction we feel at the admission of the sister Republic of Guinea- Bissau to the United Nations; for that event represents the culmination of the constant ardent appeals of my people and Government made over the course of many years  in many forums  ranging from the General Assembly to meetings and deliberations of other international organizations  conferences and seminars.107.	These feelings are inspired by the common destiny and active solidarity binding the peoples of Africa  not to mention the unreserved adherence of the Democratic Party of Guinea to their cause and its sincere and unconditional support for the right of peoples to self-determination.108.	Nor can I conceal my deep emotion in recalling our sheer jubilation at the recognition of the victory of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC]  a universal recognition of inde-pendence which  far from being a mere act of kindness  is rather an acquiescence in the conquest by the valiant people of Guinea-Bissau of its right to join the community of sovereign nations which is our Organization. We wish also to extend our gratitude to all those who  throughout the struggle  were unstinting in their support and encouragement.109.	The independence of Guinea-Bissau has been a dramatic achievement  the background to which was a veritable tapestry of tribulation and suffering  sacrifice and bloodshed  which only unswerving devotion to the cause of liberty and a rare tenacity and courage can really account for. Among those martyrs to the sacred cause  those fighters  living or dead  there stands out as an undying memory and source of inspiration an eminent figure in the world struggle for the emancipation of peoples  one who has been seen and heard at all international meetings devoted to the problems of Africa and its oppressed: an incomparable military leader  a statesman of rare nobility and a tireless pilgrim for peace  Amilcar Cabral  whose memory we devoutly honor.110.	The United Nations must now do for others what it has done for Guinea-Bissau  and what it is in duty-bound to continue to do. To achieve universality  the Organization's task  objective and obligation is to wage a continuous struggle to see to it that the interests of States and peoples be given the highest priority on the agenda of all proceedings that require decision making.111.	The developments in Portugal confirm  beyond the shadow of a doubt and in themselves  the justness of the struggle and of wars of national liberation  and of the continuation of unrelenting pressure  which are sources of decency and constructive realism capable of surviving the longest nights.112.	The process begun by the liberation movements has opened a new chapter in Portugal's history and has ushered in a new era -an era of dynamism that instills in the people and progressive forces of that country  the natural allies of the African peoples  a sense of history and a taste for restored liberty and reconquered human dignity  and the need to preserve democracy. Amilcar Cabral was right in saying that it was through the liberation struggle that the African Territories under Portuguese domination  in liberating themselves  would be freeing Portugal from fascism.113.	Experience has taught us that the liberation movements are more than ready to assume their responsibilities  particularly at a time when confidence and good faith are essential for an effort to put an end to centuries of colonization which have left behind them nothing but a dismal record of acts of genocide and sinister  cold-blooded crimes.114.	While it is true that the Portuguese people and armed forces movement as a whole  have unreservedly rejected fascism  it is still more true that  in organizing their resistance and in taking up arms  the peoples of the Territories under Portuguese domination have unequivocally given notice to Portugal and the world of their unshakable will to put an end to servitude.115.	To preserve the intent of the agreements reached between the Frente de Libertaao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] and Portugal agreements whereby the Portuguese Government solemnly undertakes to guarantee the security and territorial integrity of Mozambique in order finally to lead it to independence on 25 June 1975  it is important that the guarantor Power and the international community constantly bear in mind that the advocates of colonization who were behind the terrorism which we deplored in Lourenzo Marques and in the other large urban centers of the country would not hesitate  given the opportunity  to bring about what was inflicted on Africa in 1960 and 1962 in two of its countries  during and after the liberation struggle. Indeed  the protection and complicity enjoyed by the die-hards in well-known influential circles in Salisbury and Pretoria can hardly reassure us.116.	For Mozambique  Angola  the Cape Verde Islands  Sao Tome and Principe  there is only one thing that matters: total and immediate independence. As it was so well put by President Ahmed Sekou Toure  ""Liberty is non-negotiable: it is a right"". Indeed  independence will not be given to those peoples: they will win it by themselves.117.	While it is undeniably true that the action of the young officers fully. Satisfied the legitimate aspirations of the people to rid themselves of fascism  the Portuguese right wing  through subtle maneuvers  is trying to compromise  as least partially  the victory of the Portuguese people  which is a consequence of the other victories of the peoples of Africa. In this situation  we know that the Portuguese people are organizing themselves into political parties and that they are now working towards the building of a genuine democracy.118.	We reaffirm that the present successful stage of the anti-colonial struggle -and we want this to be so  determined as we are to contribute to it by all means at our disposal  as we have always done - marks what  without overstating the case  can be called the beginning of the end. We have considered it an offensive  a single movement on a single front  where any success or break-through in one sector leads to successes and victories in others. Peace and liberty cannot stand in isolation. That is why we must not permit the creation of a situation in which there is progress in one area but stagnation elsewhere. It is consequently important that after the radical change that has occurred in what were the Portuguese colonies  our collective efforts should be concentrated with ever more conviction and political will on Zimbabwe Namibia and apartheid in South Africa  where inter-national imperialism  realizing every day more and more the magnitude of the natural resources and potential of those Territories  is fostering a more widespread policy of genocide which would reduce what remains of the African peoples to the status of mere third-class citizens deprived of all rights.119.	Africa would not be surprised if tomorrow  in accordance with the poles of interest as we can discern them on the current geo-political map of the exploitation of southern Africa  the systematic Balkanization of this region were undertaken at the very moment when Mozambique and Angola are to achieve independence.120.	We are only too sensitive to what happens in this strategic region  where the scope of the international economic interests at stake has direct repercussions on the military involvement of certain great Powers in the Indian Ocean  and continuously conjures up the specter before us of a possible partition of the emergent States  a partition that could be used for a control so ominous for the balance in Africa  particularly that area of Africa where structures are already very fragile. It is no accident that whichever way you turn you find the same forces supported by the same metropolitan countries attempting to perpetuate their grip on these sensitive regions121.	Is it not revealing that just a few months after the coming to power of the Portuguese military junta we are witnessing new imperialist maneuvers the sole purpose of which is to mortgage the inalienable rights of the peoples of the so-called Portuguese territories to liberty? The formation of a so-called liberation front of the enclave of Cabinda  a movement not recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  is surely a constituent part of a new strategy of imperialism which would lead to the balkanization of Angola and which recalls to us the sad realities of the recent past: the tragedies of Katanga and Biafra.122.	That is the meaning of a  situation that we have ceaselessly denounced  namely  that imperialism will never cheerfully agree to its own defeat in the so- called Portuguese territories  and that it will attempt the impossible to keep itself in power through its agents.123.	Solidly behind the struggle of the heroic people of Angola  so honorably led by the Movimento Popular de Libertao de Angola [MPLA ] in "" e spirit of African liberty and dignity  the Government of the Republic of Guinea condemns such machinations and holds the Fascist element of the Portuguese military junta and its imperialist allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] alone responsible for this situation.124.	We would clarify our position on the colonial question and say that we are in favor of Africa having a greater capacity to protect itself and to meet the various dangers which continue to beset it as if it were only a field of experimentation.125.	To come back to the responsibility of the United Nations  it is regrettable that a name such as that of Namibia  where the situation is getting gradually worse  is considered to reflect the failure of our Organization rather than the perverse blindness of an imperialist structure  persecuting  exploiting and murdering so many of our people on the soil of their ancestors. The case of Namibia  where the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Namibia is to expire without the slightest improvement in the status quo  is sufficient to indicate the urgency and firmness with which the United Nations must act if this Organization wishes- to preserve its authority  its mandate and its purpose.126.	For us  mention of the situation along the Mozambique Canal and the southern third of Africa involves mention of the situation that we are witnessing along the shores of the Indian Ocean  where the people of the Comoros  in unity and territorial integrity  wish to take charge fully of their own destiny without any insidious subjugation. |4 this regard  and recalling the declaration of 26 August last of the Government of the administering Power of the Comoros  a declaration to the effect that the consultation of the population on the independence of the Archipelago would take due account of the natural identity of the territory  that is to say  its geographical frontiers  excluding a plurality of statuses for the different islands  my delegation considers that in order to give logical effect to such a view  it is essential to permit the return of all Comorian citizens residing outside their country.127.	Within the same context  we hope that the process of decolonization begun in the Comoros will be extended to what is known as French Somalia  as well as to the other colonial territories in Africa and elsewhere.128.	The so-called Spanish Sahara remains a problem and a matter of concern to African countries  and to all peoples who love peace and justice. That is why my delegation takes sincere pleasure in the spirit of lofty understanding which our brothers in Morocco and Mauritania have displayed in their statements on this problem.129.	Africa can count on the habitual wisdom and the competence of the International Court of Justice in reaching a just solution of this problem. However  the Republic of Guinea  faithful to the ideal of justice which inspires all peoples  faithful above all to its so often repeated determination to tolerate no foreign occupation of any fragment of our continent  will continue to work by the side of all peace-loving peoples and demonstrate vigorously to the Spanish Government that it is time  high time  to return to the so- called Spanish Sahara its long-denied liberty. We are sure that by so doing the Spanish Government will win a worthy place of history  and will thus guarantee the future of its interests in that territory  restored to its proper owners  who will freely make their own decisions.130.	We also wish to recall that we share the concerns of all those countries that have coasts on the Indian Ocean  which has been declared a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]  and which should be one. In this regard  in accordance with resolution 3080 (XXVIII)  whereby the General Assembly calls upon the great Powers to halt the escalation and expansion of their military presence in the Indian Ocean  to eliminate from this region all bases and military installations  and to co-operate to this end with the Ad Hoc Committee set up by resolution 2992 (XXVII)  my delegation firmly supports the appeal addressed by the coastal States of the Indian Ocean to the United States and the United Kingdom to give up their project to enlarge the naval air base on the island of Diego Garcia  the dismantling of which should and indeed must be contemplated in the interest of the peace and security of the peoples of that region.131.	Within the same context  and to a large extent  all the great Powers  taken individually or collectively  must put an end to their search for zones of influence  which today has led to the proliferation of military bases throughout the world. This state of affairs  far from solving the problems posed by the competition  not to say the rivalry  which persists among the great Powers  is a dangerous threat to international peace and security   the strengthening of which is more than ever necessary given the current concerns of the peoples of the third world  who need to wage their battle for economic and social progress in peace and harmony.132.	The events which have occurred in Africa  more particularly in the Territories administered by Portugal  show that the independence of colonial peoples is an inexorable process. Respect for this process is a sure guarantee of the improvement of international relations in the sense that it makes possible the evolution and development of the universal community in the most rational and peaceful way. For history is not made up of intentions or promises  but rather of specific facts which mold the processes of history and determine its successive phases of development towards the accomplishment of the destiny of each striving nation.133.	If we are able to remember  it is because we are able to hope. And it is thus that we remain open to all currents of thought which  through effort and action  subscribe effectively and democratically to the principle of dignity. That is why  believing that detente is not something which merely happens to suit private interests  we believe it will strengthen human understanding in the service of the full realization of man's destiny.134.	We want peace and development for ourselves and others; we hope for happiness  as does everyone. The third world  too  wishes this the third world which has hardly had time to stanch the wounds of the last war but is drawn away from that task by the sounds of new wars.135.	Learning the lessons of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held recently at Caracas  particularly on the problem of the regime to govern the sea-bed  it is interesting to recall that today more than in the past national sovereignty of States seems to embrace an ever wider field. It is well known that positive international law sanctions this and that the sovereignty of a State applies to the national territory and the air space above it  all delimited by de facto or de jure frontiers of the State in question. The juridical protection and determination of this status is of extreme political and strategic importance for the international community. To delimit the zone of territorial waters over which there shall be full and unobstructed exercise of State sovereignty has become one of the most imperative concerns of States and of the international community.136.	The Republic of Guinea  for its part  in 1964  delimited its territorial zone  which it considers to be a zone having a direct bearing on its security and the development of its economy. In this very territorial zone it has been carrying on important prospecting work  both on fishing resources and on mineral and energy resources  which has led most happily for the future of our people to discoveries of immense economic potential  whose exploitation is reflected in the priorities in our five-year economic and social development plan. Now  it is at the very time when we are linking and will continue legitimately to link these discoveries with our prospects for rapid economic growth that we see the organization and intensification of an all-out movement by certain Powers designed to reduce the ocean space of States.137.	In any case  the Republic of Guinea reaffirms that it will not reduce  under any pressure or for any reason whatsoever  its minimum limit of 130 nautical miles of territorial sea -confused here with the economic zone. Conscious of the need for international communications and trade  Guinea will  however  grant freedom of navigation to nations  individuals and corporate entities which ask for it  just as it will facilitate the laying of submarine cables and pipelines. We recall that our country has never impeded freedom of navigation  which certain maritime Powers have abused by bringing into our territorial waters a number of pirate trawlers to engage in the systematic pillaging of our fishing resources and thus threaten criminally to deplete our fishing zones. But  if we do not have the right to mortgage the future of our people by permitting this exploitation under any condition  we are very much aware of the economic interdependence of all nations and the fact that our fate is indissolubly linked with that of mankind.138.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly on primary commodities and development was a decisive turning-point in the history of our Organization. We heard representatives of developing nations which  in spite of their persevering efforts to ensure the rapid economic development of their countries  are thwarted in their determination by the persistent inequality which prevails in international economic relations. The international economic order will continue to be detrimental to developing countries and is being marked by an aggravation of the existing inequality in the rates of economic growth in developed countries as compared with the developing countries. Attempts to counter this disastrous trend have really not produced any satisfactory results.139.	The main difficulty lies in the selfishness of the most highly developed countries which are unwilling to give up their privileges and refuse to change a system which promotes their own prosperity at the expense of the countries that produce primary commodities. The disappointing results of the first United Nations Development Decade are familiar to everyone. The Second Decade does not seem to be giving any further grounds for hope. The disruption resulting from this disparity in the distribution of wealth may have even more sinister effects on the whole of the international equilibrium  and the crises that have already occurred in the energy field attest to the depth of the malaise which is a feature of the present international situation.140.	The monetary crisis that we are now witnessing has had a most adverse effect on developing countries  while the responsibility for it lies exclusively with the industrialized countries  which alone should bear its consequences  In the circumstances  it would be an illusion to expect short of a miracle any reduction in the gap which at present exists between the industrialized and the developing countries by the mere growth of a few sectors of the economy of the latter. Faced with the depletion of the world's natural wealth and over-consumption which profits only one side  the developing nations which own vast quantities of most of the primary commodities necessary for the survival of the imperialist economies are ever more exploited and sometimes even plundered. The gap which separates them from the industrialized Powers far from narrowing  is getting wider and deeper  and they know it.141.	The situation thus created and the long experience accumulated by the developing countries in the course of their arduous struggle for independence and sovereignty have now led these peoples both to an awareness of their state as proletarian nations which are becoming ever more proletarized and at the same time to the conviction that they can change everything.142.	The international community is now undeniably approaching a new stage in its history: a radical challenge now exists to an economic order that has become outmoded. As was so correctly written by President Ahmed Sekou Toure: ""We must deliberately break out of the present situation. To do this  what we need it not evolution but revolution."" We need this to permit the establishment of a new economic and trading order in the interest of all peoples. No matter how remote the victory may be  its inevitability mobilizes us ever further for the sake of the noble ideals of justice which it implies.143.	Another aspect of the problem of development was raised quite recently by the World Population Conference at Bucharest. Much was made of the ""population explosion"" factor as a danger which might slow down the economic and social development of third-world countries. The revolutionary people of Guinea places the human element above everything else as an expression of the existence of peoples and of the worth of the individual which is an important social component.144.	The economic imbalance that has been mentioned and the inadequacy of resources in face of the immense needs of peoples are problems deriving from the failure of the systems of distribution of wealth available to mankind to adapt to the real requirements of harmonious democratic progress. As a result  from the strictly demographic point of view  the developing countries must have a predominantly young population. Such a structure will make it possible effectively to place demography at the service of development. Hence  in our view  it follows that the question is far from being solely a demographic problem but  rather  the result of a whole complex of problems of development and planning and the utilization of human resources. It is there that the remedy is to be applied.145.	In the final analysis  concrete action and a historically just solution for the countries with under-developed productive power can only mean an all-out struggle to reduce the death rate to a minimum and to intensify education and professional training  all based upon planning  which alone can reflect the scientific organization of labor.146.	The Guinean Revolution has chosen to make the economy its revolutionary policy and not the politics of its economy. That is why economic problems must be studied in relation to the real needs of the peoples. But imperialism and capitalism always make use of the economy  not to liberate peoples  but to exploit them. To that policy the Republic of Guinea will never stop saying ""No"".147.	In conclusion  my delegation would like to state once again the need to overhaul the Charter of the United Nations. That need is all the more urgent because our Organization  which had 52 Members when it was created  now has 138  of which three fourths are from the third world. The United Nations  conceived as an instrument to serve mankind  must take account of the economic  political and social development of mankind and must not remain a frozen  rigid institution in a world in perpetual flux. That is why the Republic of Guinea will continue to condemn the well-known veto right  whose continued existence amply demonstrates the lack of democracy that unfortunately still marks our Organization  which is supposed to be democratic and just.148.	The delegation of Guinea  faithful to its fundamental political views  to its ideals of true freedom  peace  justice and democratic and social progress  will make its full and whole-hearted contribution to the work of this session."
"48",2678,"GMB",29,1974,"It is indeed a pleasure and a privilege for me to take this opportunity to join all those colleagues who have spoken before me to express the deep satisfaction and sense of fulfillment which we all share in Ambassador Bouteflika's assumption of the high and responsible office of the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. His unanimous election is a clear testimony to the high personal regard  esteem and confidence which he enjoys in the Assembly  as well as the recognition of the great respect and consideration which we all have for his great country and people. We are proud indeed of the leading role which Algeria  a sister African country  has always played and continues to play with tenacity and devotion in the cause of freedom  justice and peace for all mankind. We are fully confident that with his experience and background  and his total dedication to peace  freedom and justice  his term of office as President of this august Assembly will be crowned with success.264.	May I also pay tribute to and congratulate his distinguished predecessor in office  Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador  for the efficient and successful manner in which he directed the work of the twenty eighth session of the General Assembly as well as the historic sixth special session.265.		On behalf of my Government  I would also wish to pay tribute to our able and distinguished Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whom we had the pleasure of welcoming in the Gambia earlier this year  for his unswerving dedication to the principles and purposes of the Charter and his constant and untiring efforts for peace and justice throughout the world.266.	It is with great satisfaction that my delegation welcomes the admission of three new Members to the Organization during this session. Considering the close proximity between the Gambia and GuineaBissau  and the affinity and complete solidarity between our peoples  I take particular pleasure in welcoming the Republic of GuineaBissau. Throughout their struggle for freedom and national sovereignty  we have always stood by our valiant brothers and neighbors. I am certain that our two small but determined countries will continue to cooperate in every field for the advancement of our peoples and for the maintenance of peace and justice. As we welcome GuineaBissau to the United Nations  we cannot help but express our hope that very soap Angola and Mozambique will also take their rightful place in the community of nations.267.	I also wish to welcome Grenada and Bangladesh  two sister countries in our great Commonwealth  and look forward to closer relations and positive cooperation between our countries and peoples for creative works of peace and progress for all mankind.268.	We extend our deep sympathy to the Government and people of Honduras in the disaster which has brought distress and suffering to that country. We sincerely hope that timely assistance by the world community will enable the brave people of Honduras to surmount their present difficulties and that life will soon return to normal in that great country.269.	I should like to reiterate here today the abounding faith which the Republic of the Gambia places in the United Nations for achieving  maintaining and guaranteeing global peace. At the same time we realize that world peace is hard to attain without freedom and justice for all. But freedom and justice cannot be realized in an international economic system fraught with inequities  exploitation and indifference. We therefore believe that the present world economic system needs to be drastically restructured to reflect the aspirations and expectations of the vast majority of mankind  particularly the peoples of the developing world.270.	The recent sixth special session of the Assembly  which met to discuss raw materials and economic development  demonstrated the growing concern with which those problems are viewed. The United Nations has a vital role to play  not only in ensuring world peace and security  but also in redressing the present inequitable world economic system. In effect  the two things are inseparable  for without doing the latter we cannot succeed in the former.271.	The developing countries are struggling to build up their economies with a view to improving the standard of living of their people; but inequitable terms of trade  imported inflation and  recently   the energy crisis are together neutralizing all efforts in that direction. More needs to be done to find lasting solutions to those problems; and while the search for such solutions goes on  let us not forget the plight of the least developed countries  which are the hardest hit of all.272.	In these days  when war has become so costly and destructive  so terrible in its impact and so unpredictable in its results  it is incredible that Members of the Organization still resort to it to settle their disputes. My Government is totally opposed to the threat or use of force for the settlement of disputes  believing as it does that in the United Nations we have the machinery for the peaceful settlement of differences among nations.273.	We welcome the change in attitude evinced by the new regime in Portugal towards the liberation of the Portuguese territories in Africa. The recognition of the inalienable rights of the peoples of those territories to freedom and self-determination has not been achieved without much suffering and sacrifice. But the suffering and sacrifice have not been in vain. It is to be hoped that the United Nations and its specialized agencies will in due course rally to the call of those countries for assistance in the difficult task of nation building.274.	The freedom and independence of Angola and Mozambique will  of course  create a new situation in the southern part of Africa. The struggle against the bastion of racial repression  apartheid South Africa  is bound to be intensified and a confrontation between black and white appears to be inevitable unless South Africa changes its apartheid policy in time. It is sincerely to be hoped that the leaders in South Africa will see reason before it is too late. Similarly  the racist regime of Ian Smith in Rhodesia should take stock of the situation and come to honorable terms with the African majority  to avert a holocaust.275.	The international community has a heavy responsibility in ensuring that the fundamental rights of peoples everywhere are respected. Enslaved and oppressed peoples will always fight to assert their freedom and their rights. The theater of hostilities could therefore shift from IndoChina and the Middle East to southern Africa. My Government accordingly believes that the struggle against racism and oppression is a global responsibility which no Member of the United Nations can escape.276.	In referring briefly to the situation in the Middle East  I would again call for a speedy solution to the problems of that area. The present state of uneasy peace in that part of the world should not divert our attention from the necessity for Israel to withdraw from ail occupied Arab lands  and to respect and restore the rights of the Palestinian people. A people cannot be forcibly ejected from its territory and be expected to acquiesce in the illegal and immoral acquisition of that territory. So long as the basic cause of the conflict in the Middle East -the forcible ejection of the Palestinians -remains  the region will continue to be a hotbed of hostilities  war and destruction.277.	When the sixth special session convened  thanks to the farsighted vision of the President of the great country which the President of this Assembly represents  there was a glimmer of hope that at last the consciences of Member States had been awakened to the array of grave economic and social problems which threaten the very existence of the third world. It was expected that this would impel the developed world to demonstrate a greater moral and political commitment to the realization of our development goals. Despite those hopes  the international monetary crisis  imported inflation  the deterioration in the terms of trade and aid  and prevalent drought conditions continue to pose grave problems to the third world. No one will deny that the least developed countries are having to bail out fast in order merely to keep afloat. For the developing countries it would appear that aid will have to be accompanied by a disproportionate amount of high-quality technical assistance  to execute rather than to advise. Emergency aid must also go hand in hand with broad development efforts. Such development efforts  if immediate  will have to be based on inadequate data  with relatively high risks. But for many of us poorer nations it is that or nothing.278.	On the question of inflation  it is unfortunate that in the industrialized countries this phenomenon is not only showing signs of gaining renewed strength but may well be accompanied by a sharp slowdown of economic activity -in other words a general recession in the industrialized world. The consequences of a persistent fall in export earnings  coupled with soaring prices for imported commodities  could be disastrous for the economies of many of us.279.	The Gambia  along with the other members of the SudanoSahelian subregion and other parts of Africa  has been facing for the past few years the problems of severe and prolonged drought conditions. In the Gambia  annual rainfall has decreased to an alarming extent over the past three years. This has resulted in reduced yields in some parts of the country and complete crop failure in others.280.	While local food production has drastically decreased  it has been revealed by our recent population census that approximately 10 per cent of the population are nonGambians  representing a rapid increase in migrants from surrounding countries over the last three years. That increase  which has no doubt resulted from the drought  has compounded our problems of procuring food  precipitated land problems relating to settlement and farming  and put an immense strain on our social and medical facilities. While friendly countries have been responsive to the critical and urgent needs of our drought stricken populations  continued and intensified international effort will be needed for the foreseeable future if those populations are to be brought back on the road to recovery. The drought conditions in certain parts of the world today must be regarded as a global problem  thereby strengthening the sense of solidarity and genuine good will that is required if we are to meet the challenge of such natural calamities.281.	In Caracas  a little over a month ago  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea adjourned its work at the end of a 10 week session. I am pleased to reiterate our sentiments of admiration and gratitude to the friendly Government and people of the Republic of Venezuela for the warm hospitality  solicitude and attention which characterized the stay of our delegation in that country.282.	The Gambia is a developing country  dependent predominantly on an agrarian economy and under difficult constraints of Sahelian soil and unfavorable climatic conditions over the last few years. Nevertheless  my Government continues to ensure that the resources available to support our dense population and to provide for its material progress and protection are utilized to the full. Thus  we attached a great deal of hope to the deliberations and outcome of the Caracas Conference. The reports we have received so far on the work of the Conference have given us cause for guarded and cautious optimism. I regret to say  however  and without prejudice to the positive achievements of the Conference  that we have been persuaded to suspect that noble and well-intended declarations made at the Assembly were not given full practical effect at the Caracas Conference. It is the view of my delegation that the rich industrial and technologically advanced nations  which for so long dominated the world and commanded its resources  aimed at maintaining at Caracas a virtual status quo between the rich and the poor countries  thus serving to perpetuate the domination of the disadvantaged by the rich and powerful. My delegation regrets this attitude  but hopes that when the Conference resumes its work in Geneva next spring the rightful aspirations of the developing countries for a balanced and just regime for the exploitation of the resources of the seas and oceans beyond territorial limits will be matched by the appropriate political will of the rich  technologically advanced and privileged nations. If these hopes are fulfilled  the result would then augur handsomely for peace  justice  and the orderly exploitation of the resources of the global sea and for the equitable sharing of the proceeds for the benefit of all mankind.283.	The problems of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  however  do not rest here. There is also the situation among the developing countries: the coastal vis-a-vis the landlocked and other geographically disadvantaged States. It is therefore the view of my delegation that  with regard to the proposed exclusive economic zones  the only sensible and realistic approach would be to adopt the OAU Declaration on the Law of the Sea adopted by the Council of Ministers of the OAU at its twenty first session  held at Addis Ababa in May 1973  and at its twenty-third session  held at Mogadiscio in June of this year. This Declaration not only recognizes the sovereignty of the coastal States over the proposed exclusive economic zones and all their resources but will also allow the full participation in the exploitation of the living resources of the zones by neighboring landlocked and other geographically disadvantaged States.284.	We remain confident that in the present circumstances the continued efforts of the United Nations under its noble Charter represent a fountain of hope. The tenets of the common heritage of mankind  the equal sovereignty of all states and peoples  and the peaceful  orderly settlement of disputes  if given full rein  will surely bring peace  progress and prosperity to all. It is in this context that the Gambian delegation welcomes and supports the proposal  put forward by Morocco [2249th meeting  para 204] and Mauritania [2251st meeting  para. 162]  that the problem of Spanish Sahara be referred to the International Court of Justice.285.	Finally  I should like to register my Government's support for the untiring efforts that are being made to usher in a new era of international peace and understanding. It is my conviction that the prevailing spirit of detente between the superPowers will be further extended to cover the politico-economic relationship between the developed and the developing worlds. Global peace cannot endure in the midst of affluence for the few and poverty and penury for the many  and it behooves us all to rededicate ourselves to the search for solutions to the vexatious problems confronting the international community."
"49",2754,"GNQ",29,1974,"Permit me first of all to extend  on my own behalf and on that of my delegation  our most sincere and warm congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  the Foreign Minister of Algeria  on having been elected to the high post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly.37.	His unanimous election is a significant confirmation of his diplomatic and political qualities. My delegation takes the deepest pleasure in this circumstance and is very much encouraged and derives great comfort from the fact that the difficult task inherent in the office he holds will always be fairly and wisely carried out by such an outstanding son of the African soil of Algeria. I cannot conceal the pleasure and satisfaction of my delegation at seeing him occupy the presidential chair in this Assembly because my country admires and highly appreciates our valiant brothers  the people of Algeria  to whom we are bound by so many close social and political ties and with whom we have maintained and continue to maintain good relations of frank brotherhood and understanding within the context of the unity and the strengthening of the African continent and international peace and security. My delegation pledges its close co-operation with the President for the success of this session.38.	This is a most appropriate opportunity for me to express in this Assembly  on behalf of my Government and on my own behalf and that  of my delegation  most sincere appreciation and gratitude to the valiant fraternal people of Guinea-Bissau which for more than 11 years has been waging an armed struggle against Portuguese colonialism and has by its own efforts seized its independence. We are today celebrating its victory  which has been consummated by its full membership in the United Nations. To this valiant brother people my delegation offers the warmest possible welcome to this Organization; we pledge ourselves to work alongside it and together with it for the total emancipation of all the peoples of the world and in particular of those parts of the world still under the domination of colonialism.39.	We cannot forget that the independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and its subsequent admission to the United Nations was the result of an arduous struggle  filled with sacrifice and self- denial throughout many years. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau has demonstrated its maturity and ability as a sovereign State and my Government is firmly convinced that it will play its proper role effectively as a Member of this Organization. For my country  the victory won by the Republic of Guinea-Bissau against Portuguese colonialism constitutes one of the most significant victories in the struggle undertaken by Africa against colonialism to rid mother Africa of colonialism was perhaps the most notable victory because it is a victory achieved over the Olympic champion of colonialism in that continent. At a time when the flag of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is flying at the United Nations  my delegation would like to commemorate an illustrious son of Africa from Guinea-Bissau who devoted his whole life to and gave it for the salvation and emancipation of his people. I refer to the great revolutionary Amflcar Cabral. May his memory long endure!40.	My sincere congratulations go also to the States of Bangladesh and Grenada  which have now joined the international community of the United Nations  thus once moire bringing the universality of the Organization closer to reality. My Government is sincerely confident that the participation of those new States Members of this Organization will contribute to improving the efficiency of the United Nations. We extend the warmest possible welcome to those new Member States.41.	With regard to the universality of the United Nations  my delegation believes and is totally convinced that this is one of the strengths of the Organization  helping it towards the full and effective achievement of its universally acknowledged objectives. This universality  along with the political good will of Member States  is the essential condition without which all our efforts to achieve the objectives of the Organization would lack consistency and it may be claimed that these two elements - universality and the political good will of the Member States - constitute the sine qua non for the success of our Organization. We therefore take pleasure in the fact that  with the admission of the new Member States  we have achieved almost total universality in the United Nations; and  as a supplement  my delegation would like to make an appeal to all States to redouble their efforts so that those parts of the world which are today  still under the yoke of colonialism will win their liberation from that evil which has inflicted indescribable suffering on mankind. In this connexion  I should like to commend the co-ordinated action undertaken by the United Nations ever since its historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. 42.	The root of the evils from which the world is suffering today lies in the inequality of rights to which peoples are subjected and which brings in its train an unjust distribution of resources. The colonial system is the one which primarily generates this human injustice and has done so for centuries. The struggle for liberation by colonial peoples as a consequence of this injustice is entirely justified  in the view of my delegation  by their claim to the legitimate rights to which they are entitled: liberty  human dignity and the inalienable right to self-determination and independence. The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  under its President- for-Life  Francisco Macias Nguema Biyogo  resolutely supports this legitimate struggle of the colonial peoples  whatever form it takes  as the only means by which the peoples suffering from colonialism can be heard by their oppressors. That this has become the rule.is due to the very nature of colonialism  since the imposition of colonialism could never be negotiable by dialog at least not in the way it was imposed by the  various colonial Powers in Africa.43.	Some may think that this struggle of the colonial peoples for their liberation constitutes a breach of the peace and a disturbance of order. But those who hold this belief and make this contention may be forgetting that peace has never existed in colonial Territories  because their peoples lack the fundamental right to liberty and thus  by definition  they have never had peace. My Government has a deep concern for international peace and security  as was stated by the President-for-Life on the historic day of the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea:""Peace is our third watchword. We were born in peace  we achieved our independence in peace and this peace  internal and external  under whose sign our nation was born is something that we must maintain at all costs. We are entering the international community with the Arm determination to do everything in our power to promote the cause of peace.""44.	It is for this reason that  beginning with the countries in Africa and other parts of the world which are suffering under colonialism and ending with the mayor disturbances to peace in the Middle East  Cyprus and the zones of IndoChina which are still the scene of hostilities  my Government cannot remain indifferent to the circumstances which have given rise to the devastation of those areas  circumstances which  because of their nature and origin  are liable to jeopardize international peace and security. We would like to appeal to the forces directly or indirectly involved in those hostilities to reconsider their positions and find proper solutions.45.	As Members of the United Nations we are all only too keenly aware of the role we are supposed to play and we are perfectly well aware of our duties  rights and obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. The importance of strict. observance of these obligations is fundamental  and peace * to which we all so much aspire  lies precisely in the strict observance by all Members of our duties and obligations  which today many subordinate to the satisfaction of their ambition to dominate. The situation could be very simple if we had a vigorous  energetic and mature political will.46.	My delegation would very much like to commend the co-ordinated action of many Members of the United Nations aimed at the decolonization of those parts of the world which are still under the domination of colonialism. In this respect  we enthusiastically applaud what has been done so far by the new Portuguese Government with regard to itsAfrican colonies. As the representative of the Portuguese Government- stated from this rostrum on 23 September  we hope that General Spinola will not disappoint us and that words and agreements will mean a commitment on the part of the Government of Portugal  contracted before the eyes of the international community  to guarantee the independence and integrity of its colonies and that there will be no resort to habitual Machiavellian maneuvers which are so familiar to us as the doings of neocolonialism.47.	As I have said before  we view with pleasure the attitude adopted by the new Portuguese Government. But my Government does not consider sufficient what has been done so far and we do not have too much confidence in it. My Government hopes that immediate independence will be given to the rest of the Portuguese colonies in Africa secure  not a fictitious  independence  and independence which will be in keeping with the rights of the African peoples and give them the possibility of exercising their sovereignty. That will be of immense credit to the people of Portugal and its Government. In spite of the fact that their name has been tarnished during the three centuries of their colonial rule in Africa  this will make it possible for the African peoples to feel ourselves true friends of the Portuguese people.48.	One of the measures which my Government believes to be urgent is the de facto immediate recognition of all liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAJU\ as legitimate representatives of the colonial peoples  their protection and the provision of guarantees for them so that they can freely put into effect their programs of action without any kind of repression. In spite of the plurality of political movements which may exist in the colonies  the important thing is to recognize them and to let them work. The multiplicity of political parties is something which has been experienced by almost all the African peoples that are today independent and does not constitute any obstacle to the granting of independence. What is needed is to allow the liberation movements to work freely and to grant them facilities to carry out their programs. They themselves will do whatever is best for their peoples. That is a path which we have all trodden.49.	In contrast to what is happening today in the Portuguese colonies in Africa my. delegation views with profound concern the scant progress achieved towards the emancipation of the African peoples of Namibia  Zimbabwe^  the Sahara and so on  because of the disdainful and deaf attitude of the Administering Authorities which disregard the various resolutions adopted by this General Assembly. The permanent occupation and foreign administration of Nive  Guam  Pitcairn  the Gilbert and Ellice Islands  Solomon Islands  the Seychelles and New Hebrides  American Samoa and St. Helena  the British and the United States Virgin  Brunei and the Malvinas Islands  and the Comoro Archipelago  still continue to be one of the serious obstacles to the full and effective attainment of the objectives to which we are devoting our efforts.50.	My Government is fully convinced that the decolonization of all parts of the world still under foreign domination is of fundamental importance for the balance of social  international justice. I should like to stress the subject of the independence of peoples  since my Government finds it a fundamental factor in the achievement of social justice and for international peace and security. This independence presupposes the right of all peoples to conduct their own political  social and economic lives. Foreign intervention in these matters has led only to disturbances in their lives from the very beginning. Any country by virtue of its being a sovereign State is perfectly able to adopt the political  social and economic system which it believes is most appropriate to its interests. That does not imply that it cannot share in the benefits of the rest of the international community  provided that that does not mean any intervention in the affairs of others. What country in the world would agree that another country should conduct its destiny?51.	All peoples should enjoy the freedom of independence  and respect for that independence on the part of all others is vital for good international relations. My Government respects the independence of the other countries of the world. For this same reason my Government sets no limits on maintaining relations with all countries of the world that love peace. My Government is convinced that world peace lies precisely in this total and absolute sovereignty of all countries of the world and a respect for and recognition of that sovereignty by all others. Failure to respect that sovereignty  I think I may maintain without fear of error  has given rise to practically all the conflicts to which we have been witness today.52.	In spite of the atmosphere of the easing of tension  and understanding and tolerance that can be observed today in international relations  particularly between the great Powers  my Government is not sure that peace between peoples has been entirely achieved. We are somewhat concerned still at seeing that the absolute sovereignty of the peoples is not being exercised as fully as it might be and frequently is not respected by many Members of our Organization that have imperialist ambitions. The conflicts in the Middle East  Cyprus  Cambodia and Viet Nam are nothing more than the consequence of a violation of this fundamental right of all peoples. Foreign intervention in these hostilities with a view to imperialist domination has made ever more difficult the easing of tension and the-establishment of dialog between the parties to the conflict.53.	The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  no matter how tolerant it may be  will never permit its sovereignty to be slighted and will always reject countries of an imperialist regime which pursue this policy. We reaffirm our faith in the idea that through peaceful coexistence  rapprochement between peoples will become ever more successful and in this way the dream of our forefathers  which is also our own dream  can be realized  to see all the nations of the world living in an atmosphere of peace  understanding and tolerance.54.	It may be asserted today that the ideological struggle has lost pride of place and has been replaced by peaceful coexistence which is identified today with non-alignment. Indeed  at the present time we see visiting each other very frequently Heads of State and Government with different ideological doctrines  often very much opposed to one another  and also agreements being signed between these Heads of State. This constitutes a precondition for the replacement of tensions and differences which characterized the recent past by understanding among States today.55.	My Government  which advocates the policy of non-alignment  does not define it  as some have tried to do  by somewhat distorting it and claiming that it is another kind of alignment. My Government interprets non-alignment as a symbol of the actual emancipation of every State. We the non- aligned countries place our sovereignty and independence before any kind of political doctrine. Our only doctrine is based on the sovereignty and independence of countries: in other words  the freedom of every people to exercise its legitimate rights without foreign influence. We are entirely convinced that the perfection of one leads to the perfection of the whole  and if each State can consider that it is enjoying perfect peace and freedom  consequently this will be true of the peace and freedom of the world community as a whole.56.	My Government  in referring to areas of hostilities  appeals to the parties to subordinate their ambitions and individual appetites to an attempt to And appropriate solutions. The human lives lost in Cambodia can never be justified by the Fascist Government of Lon Nol. It is well-known by all how legitimate is the struggle of the Royal Government of Prince Sihanouk  who was the victim of imperialist aggression  when the sovereignty of the Cambodian peoples was trampled underfoot  and when that popular and democratic Government was replaced by another puppet government  guided by remote control by imperialist reactionaries. My delegation is convinced that this General Assembly will find a solution  a way to restore the legitimate rights of the Royal Government  recognized today by most countries which are Members of this Organization.57.	The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  as I stated earlier  no matter how tolerant it may be  will never belong to that category of governments which is contemptuous of the sovereignty and independence of peoples. Therefore  at the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly  from this rostrum [2154th meeting  para. 47]  we gave public notice of the breaking off of our diplomatic relations with the Zionist State of Israel because of its policy of imperialist annexation; and while that State continues to occupy independent Arab territories and to ignore the rights of the Palestinian people  the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea will not reconsider its position. The international community must react to the aggressive attitude of these States and respond positively to the-appeal of our Organization for respect for the rights of oppressed peoples. My Government does not tolerate aggression because it is contrary to the objectives of the United Nations  nor will we stand by and see the rights of peoples trampled underfoot.58.	In its international relations  my Government asks nothing more than that its rights should be respected by others  just as we respect theirs. When one protects a criminal  one runs the risk of being his victim. I believe that acting logically is the sensible thing that can be done by the Members of the United Nations  and I say that without any partisan considerations. That applies to countries which support regimes like South Africa and Rhodesia. The comportment of the Government of South Africa is nothing but a flagrant violation of resolutions of the General Assembly and open defiance of the Organization. All my Government can do with regard to that country is require that it respect the Charter and strictly apply the provisions of Article 6 thereof.59.	Those who believe that the purpose of the United Nations is to foment disturbances in the world and to take advantage of those disturbances to divert the attention of the world community  or allow them to be exploited by some interested parties  are mistaken. For instance  in the Korean peninsula  in spite of the time the United Nations Force has been stationed there and the efforts that have been exerted by this Organization  the Korean people have not been able to achieve their longed-for reunification because of difficulties resulting from the stationing in their country of foreign forces which use the name and the flag of the United Nations to make any kind of fruitful negotiation impossible. We would like to make clear our conviction that  as that people matures politically  reunification will be achieved peacefully by means of constructive dialogue between the North and the South  without foreign intervention.60.	My delegation continues to consider that the joint communique issued on 4 July 1972 by North and South Korea2 constitutes the basis for any negotiations. The General Assembly must object to the use of the name of the United Nations and its troops to complicate a solution to the problem of the Korean peninsula. That would increase the prestige of this Organization and would encourage the harmonious development of contacts between North and South. We are sure that in the not-too-distant future the entire Korean nation  as a unitary political entity  will participate in the work of our Organization as a fully fledged Member. The Korean people  which has a very high human potential  with its traditions and unique culture  deserves to be heard here as a Member of the United Nations.61.	The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea believes it to be the political right of all peoples to solve their own problems without any foreign intervention. But that political right will not be effective if countries cannot exercise the same sovereignty in the economic and social realms. However  apart from that right of the peoples  my Government considers that co-operation among States is vital and has always emphasized th. necessity for a balanced world economy. The interdependence which  from the very beginning  the peoples of the world have always experienced is obvious proof of the need for economic co-operation among States. Peoples must come to an understanding in spite of their ideological differences. Only in that way can there be trade on a basis of mutual advantage.62.	Fortunately  the United Nations is the most appropriate forum in which the peoples of the world can come together and deal with each other. It is the best place for the efforts of all of us to be combined in order to meet the most elementary needs. My delegation is confident that this session of the General Assembly  without prejudice to what has been done at previous sessions and in other forums of the United Nations  will tackle the problems of economic co-operation among nations  giving it the highest priority and dealing with it with the attention and care it deserves.63.	One of the primary objectives of the United Nations  as our historic Charter states so clearly  is to unite the efforts of all the peoples of the world to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security  to save succeeding generations from the afflictions of hunger and poverty  and to provide the best living conditions in accordance with human dignity. If all those conditions are fulfilled through the provision of economic justice  the Organization will have played its proper role. My country  like all other countries of the third world  is not fighting for any power or political hegemony. That is the dream of the great Powers. If there really is democracy in the United Nations  as we hope  it will be possible to eliminate items on nuclear weapons from its agenda and to replace them by items affecting the lives of human beings.64.	That is the feeling of the majority. Within this context  my delegation would like to repeat at this session of the Assembly the attitude of the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea with regard to the World Population Plan of Action  adopted by the World Population Conference which has just been held in Bucharest. My country understands and has had experience of the problem of overpopulation  a problem affecting certain parts of the world. But  unfortunately  we cannot support a demographic policy which would have us exercise birth control. We are convinced that the countries affected  both economically and socially  by the uncontrollable growth in population understand that in other parts of the world the situation is completely different. That is the case in my own country  the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.65.	We are not convinced that poverty and illiteracy  which are so symbolic even today of the third world  or the international economic imbalance which now exists in some countries will be  as certain Powers like to maintain  consequences of the present size of the world population or of future population growth. My Government cannot believe this because  in its opinion  the improvement in prices of raw materials in view of the profits made by the industrialized countries and the equitable distribution of material goods constitute the proper basis for bringing about a better world free from the social and economic difficulties we are experiencing today.66.	In view of this fact  my Government believes that demographic policy should be pursued unilaterally by each and every one of usv without any foreign influence in accordance with the conditions  possibilities and needs of each country .67.	The world today is a vast battlefield. We  the countries of the third world  are struggling for our independence and our right to sovereignty while the great Powers are fighting for hegemony and domination. But the nature of mankind itself does not necessarily lead to war  for peoples have a natural tendency to draw closer to each other. My Government thinks  that in spite of these struggles  there is essentially no such thing as a rich country or a poor country  because the balance of the comparative needs of peoples to a certain extent may be considered stable since we all have needs that depend on each other. This is an undeniable truth which has influenced the conduct of peoples throughout history. My delegation is firmly convinced and very much hopes that the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which is to be considered by the Second Committee in agenda item 48  will constitute a very valuable instrument for influencing the conduct of States in economic matters  thus averting the abuses which have been continually committed by many countries.68.	In summary  my Government reaffirms its faith in the idea that decolonization of all parts of the world still under colonial domination and respect for the independence and sovereignty of States will contribute effectively to the restoration of international peace and security. We reaffirm our faith in the objectives and principles of the United Nations  mainly peace  security and economic and social progress. We reaffirm our conviction that through peaceful coexistence tensions among nations will be replaced by understanding and tolerance. We are firmly convinced that by means of co-operation among all the peoples of the world solutions will be found to overcome all the obstacles which today hinder the social and economic progress.69.	I would not like to Conclude my statement without conveying to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the Secretary-General  the gratitude of my Government for his merits and for the efforts which he has made in the search for feasible solutions to the problems faced by this Organization and particularly for his interest in decolonization  peace  international security and the economic problems of the world."
"50",2797,"GRC",29,1974,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Greek Government  and on my own behalf  I should like to express our deep feelings of satisfaction at your election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. These feelings are even more profound because the work of this Assembly will be conducted by one of the outstanding pioneers of the non-aligned countries and movement and  at the same time  by an inspired promoter of the idea of a sincere and close political co-operation among the Mediterranean countries.179.	In view of the traditionally friendly relations between our two countries  Mr. President  I hardly need to assure you that the Greek delegation will spare no effort in order to assist you in the fulfillment of your difficult task.180.	I should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Benites of Ecuador  for the efficient manner in which he carried out his duties. Mr. Benites not only showed an exceptional diplomatic skill throughout a year marked by many complex international problems but also presided with great success over the sixth special session of the General Assembly.181.	My delegation would like also to pay a special tribute to the unremitting efforts of the Secretary- General to attain the objectives of the Organization and to ensure the maintenance of peace and security in the world.182.	Furthermore  I should like to welcome  on behalf of my Government  the admission of three new Member States to the Organization. Greece wants to extend to the Governments of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau its sincere congratulations and its best wishes for their progress and prosperity.183.	I shall now proceed to express the views of my Government with respect to some of the main items on our agenda. It is obvious that the new Government of Greece  which enjoys the widest possible popular support and expresses the democratic aspirations of our people  will have to reassess some fundamental aspects of our foreign policy in the light of developments which have taken place within and outside our country. The Greek Government is convinced that differences in the political and social systems among countries constitute no obstacle to the promotion and development of friendly relations among States. We consider that these relations can be easily extended to a wide range of co-operation in various  fields of activity within or outside the context of multilateral relations in the United Nations and other international bodies.184.	We believe in the principles which are the foundation of this Organization and the only source of hope for the maintenance of peace and security in the world. These principles are: respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of States; non-interference in the domestic affairs of others; and condemnation of every kind of imperialism  expansionism and colonialism  especially in their most recent forms  and most particularly of economic imperialism  chauvinistic expansionism or disguised colonialism.185.	We now wish to turn to another item which has been on the agenda since the twenty-fourth session of the General Assembly the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security adopted at the twenty-fifth session [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. This text could by itself prove if proof were needed that the Organization is short neither of good ideas nor of noble ideals. What the Organization is short of is the will of some of its 'Members to implement the ideals and the political courage to avoid the use or threat of force in international disputes.186.	Paragraph 1 of the Declaration solemnly reaffirms:""the universal and unconditional validity of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as the basis of relations among States irrespective of their size  geographical location  level of development or political  economic and social systems and declares that the breach of these principles cannot be justified in any circumstances whatsoever"".187.	Paragraph 2 calls upon all States to refrain ""from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State"".188.	Paragraph 3 solemnly reaffirms:""that  in the event of a conflict between the obligations of the Members of the United Nations under the Charter and their obligations under any other international agreement  their obligations under the Charter shall prevail"".189.	Paragraph 5 solemnly reaffirms  among other things:""that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal . . ."".190.	I have quoted a small part of the Declaration only to stress from this rostrum that there is no need to adopt any new texts for many decades to come if we are all prepared to abide by those already existing. That is why my delegation is in favor of emphasizing the need for every Member State to apply strictly the principles of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security in every respect and in all cases.191.	We think that the same remarks should be repeated in connexion with another item on the agenda  the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in contemporary international relations. To try to find ways and procedures for enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations resolutions is tantamount to searching for the ""golden mean"" between obsolete extreme nationalism and the still non-accessible ideal of a central international authority.192.	Greece has supported the initiative of the Romanian Government in respect of this item of the agenda since its inception. We now more than ever think that the role of the United Nations should be reinforced  especially in the highly sensitive region of Cyprus and in the Middle East. I shall deal later in this intervention with the present situation in Cyprus and in the neighboring region  a situation entailing serious risks for international peace and security.193.	My delegation was gratified to read in the introduction to the Secretary-general's report on the work of the Organization [see Al960IlAdd.l  sect. VIII] that some progress had been made in the work of the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations  despite the complexity of the issues involved. We also noted with satisfaction that the same Committee and its Working Group continued their efforts to work out agreed guidelines for the purpose of carrying out peace-keeping operations.194.	In the opinion of my delegation  supported by the recent experience of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus [UNFICYP]  any peacekeeping operation  in order to be successful  should be predicated on the following conditions and guarantees. First  there should be powerful enough and efficient peace-keeping forces. Second  it should be strictly forbidden for any national military force to attack or to exert pressure against the peace-keeping forces. A system should be set up permitting the issuance of an immediate and automatic international sanction whenever such an attack takes place. Third  no impediment or obstruction should prevent peacekeeping forces from implementing the relevant Security Council resolutions.195.	We fear that  if our Organization does not take measures according to these general guidelines  very soon the peace-keeping operations will become ineffective  the contributing countries will be unwilling to send their troops into troubled areas and the whole peace-keeping task of the Organization will totally collapse.196.	The Secretary-General  as well as other speakers  expressed these same apprehensions at the 1793rd meeting of the Security Council on 15 August last  when  after resumption of their aggression in Cyprus  Turkish troops deliberately attacked some units of UNFICYP and killed and wounded several of its members.197.	In this connexion  we feel obliged to state that the ""credibility of the United Nations . . . and the respect of its Members for the decisions of its main organs -to use the words of the Secretary- General- cannot be saved by resolutions such as Security Council resolution 359 (1974)  by which the Council ""Deeply deplores the fact that members of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus have been killed and wounded"". This shyness on the part of the Council in regard to naming the aggressor cannot but entail in the long run an encouragement to other potential aggressors towards perpetrating such crimes and violating the Security Council resolutions.198.	The arms race and matters related to disarmament continue to be an important part of the General Assembly's agenda. A world disarmament conference would undoubtedly stimulate efforts towards disarmament and infuse a sense of urgency in this field. It would facilitate the exchange of views on this subject of paramount importance and allow a useful summing up of the progress achieved in this field hitherto. It is to be hoped that some concrete steps will also be taken to expedite future international action in this area. In order to achieve these aims  the Conference should be adequately prepared  and all States—and in particular the nuclear Powers—should participate.199.	The review conference convened under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation .of Nuclear Weapons which is to take place next year will  we hope  have the results expected by all peace-loving countries and peoples.200.	We are also fully aware of the capital importance of the present phase of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks for the future of international peace. Moreover  the Greek Government is determined to assume an active role in the present phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. The individual or joint action undertaken by the smaller States participating in that Conference is an important corollary to the negotiations being carried out by the United States and the Soviet Union. Although the great Powers have a special responsibility for the maintenance of peace  a truly peaceful international order cannot be established if the smaller States do not fully assume their own obligations and responsibilities. That is all the more true following the events we have witnessed recently in Cyprus.201.	Another question related to the problem of disarmament and arms control is that of the prohibition of weapons which might cause unnecessary suffering or have indiscriminate effects  such as napalm or other incendiary weapons. We all know the results of the work done in Geneva in this connexion by the Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts. However  we all know also that one of the countries which voted in favor of General Assembly resolution 3076 (XXVIII) last year used napalm bombs this year in Cyprus even against civilians  hospitals  forests and the units of UNFICYP.202.	The new Greek Government has aimed at the full restoration of human rights and civil liberties in Greece. We are gratified to be able to state here that  upon the new Greek Government's assumption of power  all political prisoners were liberated  exiles were permitted to return to Greece  freedom of opinion and freedom of the press were re-established  and a rapid process towards the reactivation of all democratic institutions was initiated. Tragically enough  that happy evolution coincided with the suppression of human rights in Cyprus as a result of the Turkish invasion of the island. Human rights concerning residence  freedom  ownership and the lives of men and women are being violated at this very moment.203.	During the past seven and a half years the Greek people had experienced an unprecedented suppression of their human rights and civil liberties. In the struggle to regain their freedom  the Greek people turned for support to the international institutions responsible for the implementation of the law governing the international protection of human rights. Questions relating to the situation in Greece were unsuccessfully brought to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights and its subsidiary bodies. I am citing this example because it reflects a fundamental weakness of the United Nations system for the protection of human rights. My Government strongly urges that the implementation of the instruments concerning the international protection of human rights be strengthened  and will support any initiatives in that direction.204.	Today  when the colonialist Powers have abandoned or are in the process of abandoning their colonies  we are witnessing here in the United Nations the astonishing event of one Member of the Organization trying to colonize another. I am  of course  referring to the Turkish performance in Cyprus.205.	As far as Greece is concerned  its struggles against colonialism  fascism and imperialism are well known and proved by its attitude during the two World Wars. Today  that struggle continues by peaceful means. We are at the side of the oppressed peoples  and we offer our unreserved support to the nations of Africa still under the colonial yoke.206.	Our position concerning racial discrimination is also clear-cut and unequivocal. It is not by accident that Greece  which has in its 3 000 years of history experienced all possible social and political phenomena  has never known racial discrimination.207.	My delegation is particularly happy to state that in all questions that matter  Greece stands at the side of our African friends not only because their aspirations are legitimate  but also because the Greek people has worked its way  and continues to do so  through every single stage of the struggle the African peoples are waging today towards the attainment of freedom  economic independence and development.208.	Turning now to international economic conditions  I must express the increasing concern of my delegation at the present disarray in world economic affairs and the unprecedented nature of the problems to be solved.209.	The post-war system of international economic co-operation is disintegrating under the pressures of inflation and monetary disorder. Poverty and hunger continue to afflict most of mankind  and the disparity in living standards and economic and social achievements between developing and developed countries continues to grow.210.	Contrary to earlier expectations  the so-called internationalization of consumer societies did not benefit the poor masses in the developing world. As the continuing deterioration of the world economic situation demonstrates  unless new principles are accepted and emergency measures are taken by the international community we shall have to face a bleak future indeed.211.	The conclusions of the recent special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development in particular  the Assembly's Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order will be reviewed at the current session. It is regrettable that the Economic and Social Council has not been able to reach a decision on action regarding the Program of Action on the Establishment of a NewInternational Economic Order. It is up to the Second Committee of this Assembly to maintain the momentum that has been engendered by the special session. The Second Committee is offered a unique opportunity to initiate fundamental changes in the system  as the present crisis has already given rise to new perceptions of economic relationships and to recognition of the need for the less developed countries fully and effectively to participate in international decision-making on economic issues. Fortunately  there is growing evidence that new development policies are being designed to raise the well-being of the poor by increasing their ability to participate in the development process. Such policies can actually promote rather than hinder economic growth.212.	We believe that the Declaration and the Pro-gramme of Action adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly are the foundations upon which to build and redress the present economic imbalances in the world economy. We also believe that it is within the framework of the United Nations that those problems could be solved and a new economic order could emerge. It may be that the present institutional set-up of the United Nations is inadequate to deal with all the complex issues involved. If so  then one should proceed with the necessary changes in order to implement the emergency program.213.	I may add that the delegation of Greece attaches particular importance to the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States as approved in principle last June in Mexico City. In our view  the draft Charter which will be considered in the Second Committee under agenda item 483 constitutes a well-balanced document that would certainly strengthen the new international economic order and help the most disadvantaged countries of the third world.214.	After dealing effectively with the short-term problems  one should accept a new economic strategy which is now reaching policy-making circles in both industrial and developing countries shifting attention from the high abstractions and generalities of economic growth to the immediate and critical needs of our societies.215.	I think we have to praise the World Bank for having taken important' steps in this direction by supporting a strategy stimulating a new and more humane order of priorities  and also IMF for its efforts to deal with the immediate and urgent question of balance of payment difficulties and recycling of surpluses.216.	It would be wrong to believe that the oil price explosion was the only  or perhaps even the major  cause of the present instability/ However  at the present juncture of the world economy one cannot exclude economic or financial disintegration  national isolation and a search for more self-sufficiency in many countries  thereby enlarging the pathetic contrasts that exist between the industrialized and the developing countries. A chain reaction of destructive forces may be set in motion should we not live up to the expectations for a new international economic order.217.	Concerted international efforts  coupling a long-term program with an immediate emergency action  would help us to move away from the present threatening phase of great instability and grave dangers.218.	Greece  as a major seafaring nation and at the same time as a country almost surrounded by the sea  attaches particular importance to the development of the law of the sea which has been taken in hand under the auspices of the United Nations. It should be our common endeavor to arrive at agreed principles governing the sea spaces and to prevent arbitrary unilateral actions. The new concepts of the ocean bed as a common heritage of mankind and of an exclusive economic zone should be harmoniously developed along with the maintaining of the basic concept of the freedom of the seas for peaceful navigation  which is the lifeline linking the nations in the exchange of goods and persons. The protection of the marine environment and the rational use of the resources of the seas should find adequate expression in this new law. It goes without saying that in this framework the continental and the insular territory of States should be accorded equal treatment  thus securing the indivisibility of State sovereignty and non-discrimination between continental and insular populations.219.	We firmly believe that the law should strive to establish clear-cut and objective rules  avoid vague or ambiguous provisions  leave little room for arbitrary or unilateral action by States and thus prevent disputes which might arise in a legal vacuum. We shall continue in the next session or sessions of the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to make our contribution in this spirit.220.	I now turn to one of the most difficult problems the Organization has ever faced that of the Middle East. Since the beginning of the conflict Greece has stated that this problem cannot be solved by force. Once more this position was vindicated by the October war.221.	Greece has had the opportunity to stress time and again the principle  repeatedly confirmed by Security Council resolutions  that acquisition of territory through military conquest is inadmissible. No war can solve political problems.222.	Turning to the treatment of civilian populations in occupied areas  the Greek Government is of the opinion that a strict application of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War should be a minimum standard to be applied in every occupied area of the world  under any circumstances.223.	Generally speaking  we believe that no problem can find a peaceful and lasting solution if the relevant resolutions of the Security Council are not implemented by all parties involved and if there is no willingness on the part of those concerned to apply strictly the principles of the Charter.224.	The inclusion of the question of Palestine in the agenda of the present session is considered by the Greek delegation as proof that the.General Assembly is not Unwilling to deal with present realities. Problems like the Palestinian question cannot be solved by looking away from them. On the contrary  a serene and democratic exchange of views in this supreme international forum is always likely to make a possible solution more attainable.225.	The already tense situation in the Middle East has been further aggravated in recent months by the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. On 15 July a coup  condemned by all of us  was staged to overthrow Archbishop Makarios  the legitimate  elected President of the Republic. This coup was not directed against the Turkish Cypriot community of the island. That fact was recognized by both the leader of the Turkish community in Cyprus and the Turkish Prime Minister  who both issued public statements to that effect. During the fighting while the coup was in progress  not a single Turkish Cypriot was killed or injured. Yet five days later  large Turkish invasion forces were landing in Cyprus and the Turkish Air Force was launching indiscriminate attacks against unarmed civilians  under the flimsy pretext of protecting the Turkish Cypriot minority on the island  which  I repeat  had not been harmed in any way.226.	The situation we are faced with today is as follows. The territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus  an independent and non-aligned State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Commonwealth  has been seriously imperiled. Its very identity is jeopardized. A substantial part of its territory is under occupation by a foreign invasion force  which has openly stated its intention to Stay on the island  having expelled the indigenous population of the area.227.	At the Geneva Conference  convened at the request of the Secretary-General to seek ways and means to implement Security Council resolution 353 (1974)  of 20 July 1974  we were presented with an ultimatum to accept either of two plans  which had certain features in common. Both provided for a physical separation of the two communities  with a forced exchange of population.228.	In effect  the territory claimed for the Turkish Cypriot minority  representing 18 per cent of the total population  was to be 34 per cent of the island. What is more  it was to include the most fertile lands  which yield 70 per cent of the agricultural produce of the country  which represent 60 per cent of the industry  80 per cent of the tourist business  100 per cent of the mining industry  the main fresh-water reserves and the only deep-water port of the island all that on the pretext of protecting a small minority. When the Acting President of Cyprus  Mr. Clerides  asked for a 36-hour recess  in view  of the-outrageous Turkish demands which were tantamount to partition and to condemning the vast majority of the people of the island to a life of want and misery  Turkey refused to grant the 36-hour recess. Two hours later  the Turkish troops were on the move again  sowing death and destruction  killing United Nations troops  bombing hospitals and schools. Repeated cease-fire calls by the Security Council went unheeded. Turkey even ignored the ceasefire proclaimed by its own Prime Minister on 16 August 1974. Turkish troops finally came to a halt two days later  after having occupied 40 per cent of Cyprus  and caused an appalling refugee problem reminiscent of similar problems in the area  by uprooting 200 000 people from their homes.229.	All this was sanctimoniously dubbed by the Turkish Prime Minister and by the Turkish press as. a ""peace-keeping intervention"". The military leaders  however  who four years earlier had elaborated the plan for this operation  had another name for it. They called it ""Attila"" unconsciously or perhaps unwittingly identifying it with the chieftain of the Huns  known to history as the scourge of God.230.	It is publicly claimed that Turkey was entitled to take action in Cyprus by the provisions of the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee signed by Greece  Turkey and the United Kingdom.231.	The Treaty does indeed mention ""unilateral action"" to be taken by all the guarantor Powers after consultations with the other parties have failed. However  it does not  and could not  mention military action  which would be in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Yet Cyprus was invaded by overwhelming military forces without any prior consultations between the guarantor Powers.232.	The Treaty of Guarantee  as its title implies  specifically guaranteed the constitutional order of Cyprus  and such action as it contemplated was to be directed towards the re-establishment of that constitutional order if ever it came to grief. Yet we were asked at Geneva  and we are still being asked today  to accept an entirely new constitutional framework for the island  a framework never discussed with and much less accepted by its people.233.	The Treaty guarantees the territorial unity of the Republic. Yet we are asked to agree to its partitioning.234.	The Treaty guarantees the independence of the Republic. Yet the substance of the Turkish plan  if accepted  would lead either to the complete abolition of that independence through the annexation of the two parts of Cyprus to Turkey and to Greece respectively or to the establishment of a Turkish protectorate over the island. For how can anyone doubt that with the northern part of the Republic under Turkish Cypriot control  and with the geographical proximity of Turkey  the central federal government envisaged by the Turkish scheme could be anything else but submissive to the slightest whim of Turkey ?235.	The Treaty guarantees the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus. But can a State any State  be truly sovereign without being independent?236.	International treaties are being invoked only to be openly violated. For weeks  for months  we have been watching the rape of a small non-aligned country by its far stronger neighbor. Repeated injunctions of the Security Council of our Organization have been either flouted or ignored. A new and enormous refugee problem is in the process of creation  and human suffering is being used again without much prudence  as a lever for political advantage.237.	Greece has repeatedly declared  and I am glad to be given the opportunity to solemnly reiterate from this rostrum  that Greece has no ulterior aims in Cyprus. As a signatory of the Nicosia agreements  it is committed against enosis and against partition. It has taken the position that the Republic of Cyprus is and must remain an independent and sovereign State and that its territorial integrity must be respected by all; that as an independent and sovereign State  the Republic of Cyprus is and should be free to follow the foreign policy of non-alignment or any other policy that best suits its interests.238.	Finally  Greece has stated on several occasions that no foreign Power  including the guarantor Powers under the 1960 Treaty  has any right whatever to impose upon the people of Cyprus constitutional arrangements of its own choosing. This is a matter of the exclusive I repeat: exclusive - domain of the people living on the island and  it is up to the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to determine freely by common agreement the institutions under which they want to live  and the emphases is on the word ""freely"" -not in the shadow of 40 000 foreign troops and over 200 tanks  nor under the pressure of the ordeal of 200 000 refugees.239.	Let me say in this respect that phased reduction of troops and armaments  in view of the latest developments  is not the answer to this particular problem. Whether 40 000 or 20 000 Turkish troops remain on the island is really immaterial when the other party is totally disarmed.240.	The issues are now clearly drawn. The question is  what is the United Nations going to do about it? As far as Greece is concerned  the United Nations must either act in accordance with She Charter or admit failure.241.	Our Organization is based on the rule of law. It embodies the hopes and aspirations of the great majority of nations for their advancement in peace and security. Its executive organ  the Security Council  was charged with the enforcement of its principles and was endowed with appropriate powers to do so. Again  within the Security Council the five permanent members have been entrusted by the Charter with special responsibilities. Yet most of them have not risen to the challenge of their duties and of their prominence.242.	The tools are there. Is there a will  or are we going to sit idly by and complacently watch the enforcement of another kind of rule that of the law of force and of conquest? If we do  we shall revert to ""square one"". If we do  every small nation  and especially the non-aligned ones  will live in fear of its larger and stronger neighbor. If we do  we shall flounder in the morass of our own moral weakness and go the way of the late League of Nations.243.	What is needed at this critical moment is courage and determination  for not only does the future of the United Nations as a guarantor of peace hinge upon a solution of the Cyprus problem but the international order in general is also at stake.244.	It is inconceivable that after the massacre of the two World Wars the whole world  represented in this Hall  should watch  as a mere spectator  the drama of the destruction of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of a small non-aligned and unarmed State by the military forces of a strong neighbor. It is a stigma on our civilization and a shame to the whole world that more than 200 000Cypriot refugees should have been driven from their homes and compelled to live in the open  with winter knocking at the door. The whole world must move swiftly to put an end to this aggression that sets civilized mankind several centuries back.245.	Any attempt to solve the Cyprus problem by the force of arms would open a permanent source of trouble in the sensitive area of the Middle East and would lead to unforeseeable complications. The United Nations must act with courage and determination. The tragedy of timidity has already led to two world conflagrations. Let us draw the necessary lesson in order to prevent a major international disaster.246.	The people of Greece and the Greek Government have faith in the moral and political values enshrined in the Charter. They believe in the will of the vast majority of mankind to live in an orderly and safe international society. They are confident that right will prevail over might and that our Organization will once again prove its strength  its vitality and its usefulness.247.	I pray that this faith  this belief and this confidence shall not be disappointed."
"51",2840,"GRD",29,1974,"Mr. President  it behooves me at the outset to reiterate the congratulatory expressions which were extended to you by my Prime Minister when he addressed the Assembly on the opening day [2233rd meeting]. My delegation has become very aware of the high esteem in which you are held  and we look forward to your capable guidance of the business of the current session. In our opinion  this points to a new direction in the affairs of the United Nations.62.	In this context  permit me to express also our sincere and deepest congratulations and commendations to our two other new Member States  Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau. We look forward to working together in the spirit of brotherly co-operation with them  within the framework of this Organization.63.	At this juncture  I would like to seek your per-mission  Mr. President  to express to the Secretary- General  Mr. Waldheim  the appreciation of my Government and my delegation for his proven dedication in his tireless work in the cause of peace and the fulfilment of the objectives of the Charter. We are indeed fortunate to have an individual of his stature so ably performing this role  at a time when stature in individuals  as in nations  is so sorely needed.64.	I would also like to voice my country's deep appreciation to all the representatives who  during the present session  have expressed kind words of welcome to Grenada in their statements. My country will always remember the warmth of their greetings  and we reciprocate most cordially their statements of friendship. Also  we take this opportunity  to convey our appreciation to those other nations which have manifested their friendship to Grenada at this time.65.	May I also express our sincere condolences and sympathy to the Government and people of Honduras  through the Honduran delegation  on the occasion of the terrible natural disaster which that country suffered as a result of the recent hurricane. To my delegation  the word ""hurricane"" identifies one of the many natural disasters with which we are faced today  and it is synonymous with the Caribbean region and Central America. Grenada having suffered  in 1955  from one of the most devastating hurricanes in history  my delegation and the Government and people of Grenada fully appreciate  in the most realistic way  the gravity and the immeasurable extent of the tragedy which has befallen the people and the land of Honduras.66.	On this most important question of natural disaster  my delegation notes with particular interest the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the item relating to assistance to countries in cases of natural disaster [item 60]  and looks forward to some more meaningful and effective action on an international level to lend practical assistance to those countries and peoples who  from time to time  are the hapless victims of the ravages of such disasters.67.	The interdependence of all nations  large and small  has proved to be the outstanding feature of international relations in this part of the twentieth century. There is continuing talk  a great deal of talk  of a new world order which will ensure for nations and peoples a more equitable use and distribution of global resources to face and meet the demands of the future. Priorities have been set  and many fruitful United Nations meetings and conferences have deliberated at length on the common theme of interdependence of peoples including the sixth special session of the General Assembly  the World Population Conference  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  and  too  the forthcoming World Food Conference to be held in Rome in November. Underlying the substantial work of these and other historic meetings is this common link running through their agendas like a golden thread.68.	In varying forms and with different results  we are being taught the same lesson namely  that we are one global people  inhabiting Buckminster Fuller's ""Global Village"". We must act in concert one with the other  or perish through disunity and lack of common vision. Grenada recognizes that the degree of success the Organization attains in solving  or re-solving  the major issues of the day  economic  political or social  will greatly depend upon the climate   prevailing in international relations.69.	In the next few years  should we ignore this vital factor  or through political short-sightedness fail to develop it properly  the world as a whole will suffer.70.	The Prime Minister of Grenada stated recently at this podium  ""... Grenada stands today as a free nation  a nation committed to the cause of world peace"" [2233rd meeting  para. 299]. It is the intention of my Government and my delegation to support the United Nations  and to co-operate to the fullest in its attainment of the lessening of international tension.71.	International tension is caused by international insecurity. International insecurity  Grenada believes  can and must be eradicated by our unified re-dedication to the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security adopted at the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly [resolution 2734 (XXV)].72.	I would like to affirm my Government's total commitment to facial equality. In Grenada our people continue to live  as we have done over the past years  in harmonious and fraternal brotherhood  without distinction of color  race or creed. Consequently  we have achieved a climate of solidarity and freedom in every aspect of our national life. My Government believes that racial justice is one of the essential requirements for international peace and progress.73.	In this context  I would like to state that my Government condemns policies of racism in all its forms and manifestations  and joins in calling upon those Governments which pursue these policies to put an end to such abhorrent practices.74.	My Government's belief in racial equality ties in with its policies of equality of the sexes  policies which my Prime Minister  Mr. Eric Gairy  touched on in his address before the Assembly. Mr. Gairy said:""It is also precisely because of our faith in the sanctity of the equal rights of men and women that we have enshrined in our Constitution the provisions which guarantee that the rights of Grenadian women are equated to those of Grenadian men  especially in the context of citizenship  thereby setting a precedent for this aspect of human equality within the commonwealth of nations."" [2233rd meeting  para. 296.]75.	The women of Grenada have long been the backbone of our society. Unlike our counterparts in some developed countries  we have for generations played a dual role as mother provider and head of the family. In Grenada  too  women have equal political rights with men. They serve as government ministers  as cabinet members  and as active members of Parliament  and it is well known that Grenada was the first country within the Commonwealth of Nations to recommend a lady who held the high position of Governor. I might add that women are also active in business and in the professions  and there are women's organizations that have been working hard towards the total improvement in the status of our women.76.	My Government recognizes the contribution and the untapped potential of our women  and reded- icates itself to the eradication of all customs  laws  attitudes and practices which discriminate against women in any society in any part of the globe. Women comprise more than half of our society  and  in terms of human-resource power  they constitute an important factor in the over-all progress and development of all nations. My Government therefore feels that if women are to take their rightful place in society  all inhibiting laws  attitudes and practices must be immediately removed.77.	And regarding our continuing campaign to secure effective ""woman power""  permit me to quote a recent statement of the Secretary-General in which he said: ""The equality of the sexes is a necessary pre-requisite for social and economic development  and a stimulus for world peace"". This reflects our senti-ments and our pplicies exactly.78.	The proclamation designating 1975 as Inter-national Women's Year [resolution 3010 (XXVII)] has certainly given added stimulus to my Government in its promotion of the equality of the sexes  and we fully support and express our desire to participate meaningfully in the programs of the year.79.	By our membership in this international Organization  we have undertaken a formal commitment to the rule of law in all aspects of our international relations. In my country's domestic governmental program  the rule of law will be the very bedrock upon which our policy is based  and this also was clearly enunciated by our Prime Minister in his address to the Assembly. We are proud of this tradition and very happy at being able to seize the historic opportunity afforded us  through membership in the United Nations  to conduct our international affairs on the basis of observance of the rule of law. In this fellowship  and with this essential prerequisite  we join the Organization.80.	It is extremely significant that newly independent nations large or small  rich or poor seek to join the ranks of the United Nations  and Grenada  of course  is no exception. Over the past three decades we have carefully followed the course and the progress of this unique world body  and we are resolute in our belief that the United Nations  by embracing all peoples and countries  is creating the true community house for all mankind. The effectiveness of the Organization lies precisely in the unanimous support of its Members and in the degree of solidarity achieved through open debate  frank discussion and democratic free exchange. It is important that the strength of the Organization  guided by the strength of the principles entrenched within the Charter  is never underrated nor undermined. In this same spirit of solidarity  Grenada offers itself whole-heartedly to the service and the purposes of the United Nations  and we open our arms to all brother nations as faithful members of the world community.81.	There has been endless reference by Members to the near total. universality of the Organization. Indeed  universality of membership and the political good will of Member States are the twin pillars of the United Nations.82.	My country is happy  as I said earlier  to be part of this rapid progress towards universality of the United Nations  and in this connexion  I today appeal to all countries to reaffirm their resolve and hasten their efforts to assist in the removal of the remaining shackles of colonialism. To the colonial system  with its perpetration of vast human injustice and endless exploitation of native peoples  must be attributed the blame for many of the ills of developing countries over the past several centuries. The Government of Grenada has always unswervingly supported the inalienable right of all peoples to self-determination and full independence.83.	My Government  which in February this year attained full freedom and independence for the people of Grenada after many centuries of colonial domination  fully supports and endorses the idea that inter-national peace and security will be greatly enhanced and preserved by the emergence of more and more countries from colonial domination into the arena of national independence. Correspondingly  we  sub-scribe to the respect for independence and the inherent sovereignty of States that form the very basis of the Charter of the United Nations.84.	In the rapidity of political  economic and social change with which we are faced  the concept known as ""future shock"" is manifesting itself on a daily basis to nations and individuals alike. In the smaller States  we are increasingly becoming the victims of this greatly accelerated rate of change within modern society. Today the artificial boundaries between the worlds of economics and politics are becoming more blurred; any remaining lines of demarcation separating those worlds are being finally erased by the energy crisis  the imbalance of world supply and demand for food  and an often precarious detente.85.	We have recognized the fact that political independence  through a vital and necessary milestone on the long and thorny road to self-determination  is but a catalyst in the process of real national independence. Economic viability  with the consequent improvement in the quality of life  is the goal that we seek for our people and generations yet unborn  and it is in this context that we view with pleasure and anxious expectation the establishment of the Pro-gramme of Action on the Establishment of a Nev International Economic Order by the General Assembly at its recent sixth special session convened as a result of the positive vision and initiative of the non-aligned and other developing countries. It is clear that emergency measures have to be urgently taken to maintain the momentum of the proposed new economic order  which will benefit the developing countries in particular. This is the time to effect concrete improvements in the lives of millions of third- world peoples. It is now up to the General Assembly's Second Committee to seize and utilize this golden opportunity.86.	We noted with considerable interest the promise made by President Ford of the United States of America to provide help to developing nations in the most vital areas of need. We believe that President Ford's statements were made in all sincerity and good faith and  therefore  we are hopefully looking forward to their implementation.87.	While we realize that we have achieved full political independence which has enabled us to take our rightful place as a Member nation  we are acutely aware that as a developing country our ultimate goal is to make a meaningful contribution to world peace through economic independence. Many developing nations find themselves still at the mercy of multi-national corporations and are victims of economic servitude to the developed nations as suppliers of their agricultural raw materials and as markets for their expensive manufactured goods.88.	As I said  we welcome the resolutions adopted at the sixth special session earlier this year  which could well prove a turning-point in economic relations between rich and poor countries  and we look forward to meaningful and positive action on the part of the United Nations and thie .more developed countries to bring about substantial and constructive economic improvement for the developing countries. We look forward  too  to increased direct assistance in helping ur> to exercise effective sovereignty over our own natural resources of land and sea  and so ultimately to preserve and maintain our people's political sovereignty.89.	We affirm our Government's policy of economic self-reliance  self-help and self-sufficiency to achieve our national goals and objectives. However  this does not mean that we would not encourage foreign capital and expertise. In fact  we have a very healthy atmosphere for investment in Grenada  and we are in particular encouraging foreign investment in private enterprise. What we hope for is a more equitable distribution of profits and a program of training which would enable our people effectively to hold managerial positions alongside non-nationals.90.	We in Grenada  as a Caribbean nation  will continue to support all our regional institutions in their economic and fiscal policies and  at the same time  will aspire to enter into relationships with international monetary institutions with a view to finding realistic ways and means of bringing about viable and self-sustaining economic growth for our country.91.	In the 1970s and beyond  we anticipate greater economic co-operation  too  with our Latin American neighbors and our African brothers  and wider economic interdependence with the rest of the world as a result of the efforts of the sixth special session.92.	The establishment of a new economic order is essential if a ray of hope is to be seen for a reversal of the widening of the gap between developed and developing countries. We are concerned and  indeed  anxious for the economies of small countries such as ours  whose agricultural export earnings are keenly affected by the vagaries and ravages of weather  as well as market prices over which we have absolutely no control.93.	While we welcome the attempts made by the Organization to alleviate the economic problems of developing countries  we still feel the need for a greater and more comprehensive understanding of our problems by the more developed States Members of the Organization  and we look forward with keen anticipation to a sharing of technological expertise  experience and economic strategy to combat spiraling inflation  poverty and economic dependence.94.	As a small island State  we are fully aware of the vital importance of the vast untapped resources of the sea-bed to our developing economy and we know that we shall be soon involved in the race for the riches of the sea. It is important that a nation should not suffer because of its size and that in keeping with the Charter  the United Nations should ensure that economic justice is achieved for all. While we recognize the just interests of others those of the land-locked States and those with limited access to the sea we must face the reality of our inescapable reliance on the resources of the sea to supplement our limited agricultural resources. It is therefore extremely heartening to us that the special needs of island States were recognized at the recently concluded session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in Caracas. We look with hope to the establishment of a just and equitable order of allocating to all countries the resources of the sea-bed  and the preservation of this ""common heritage of all mankind"". My country intends to participate in the next session of the Conference in 1975 and we anticipate a final treaty which will ensure the protection of all interests.95.	On the seemingly perpetual question of disarmament  my country deplores the dangerously vast resources utilized by certain Powers in their development of  research work on and proliferation of nuclear weaponry. We believe that the fragile framework of peace is being threatened by this continuing development of the destructive power of sophisticated weapons. The awesome annual expense being directed to increasing regularly these nuclear arsenals would without doubt serve humanity to a far better purpose were it devoted to increasing the volume of development co-operation. Grenada feels that the tremendously valuable research on nuclear energy should be used expressly for peaceful purposes  and that more of the resources of major Powers should be diverted to the production of food and agricultural products for the improvement of the level of existence of third- world peoples in particular.96.	Grenada is a peace-loving and life-loving nation. We support all initiatives for the effective curbing of the arms race  the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  and the reduction of military budgets of certain Member States with a consequent diversion of the funds saved to the provision of tangible assistance to developing countries. Our irrevocable convictions will not permit us to do otherwise.97.	I emphasize  in conclusion  that the continuing emergence of developing countries into independent nationhood has led to the creation of a new dynamic force in today's world  which is certainly influencing the trend of international relations. Grenada looks forward to making its own contribution to the endless task of ensuring lasting peace  economic justice  and maximum social progress for all of our peoples. With our belief in the principles of the Charter  we join you in working together towards achieving these goals."
"52",2885,"GTM",29,1974,"First of all in addressing this Assembly I should like to express the sorrow of the people and Government of Guatemala at the tragedy which at this time has thrown the Republic of Honduras into mourning and  with that Government  the entire family of Central American Nations. The devastating storm which raged through the Caribbean Sea has caused tremendous material losses in various countries of Central America and has strewn death and desolation in that sister country  to which we are bound by very close historic ties and a common destiny. These relations cause us to feel in our own flesh the sorrow that has afflicted the people of Honduras. I should like from this rostrum of the United Nations to convey the feelings of brotherly solidarity on behalf of the people and Government of Guatemala to our neighbors in Honduras at this tremendous catastrophe that has struck them  and may our voice be joined With those of other countries which  from this same rostrum  have appealed for international co-operation to assist the people of Honduras to overcome the serious emergency which it is confronting today.167.	I am not going to convey to the President  Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika one more congratulation on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I shall pay him a sincere tribute of admiration and respect for his great talent  his brilliant qualities as a statesman and the very valuable contribution which both he and the members of his delegation have always made to the achievement of the purposes and principles of the world Organization. I should rather congratulate the General Assembly for the wise decision that it took in choosing him as President for such an important and delicate task  a choice which I am sure will be the guarantee of the success of our deliberations at the current session..To that end  I offer the loyal and resolute collaboration of the delegation of Guatemala.168.	In coming before this Assembly  Guatemala repeats once again its unswerving faith in the effectiveness of the efforts we are making to maintain throughout the world a peace founded on justice and the attempts to attain and guarantee the maximum of well-being for all of mankind.169.	This faith that the peoples of the world have placed in the world Organization is the reason why  year after year  the number of its members grows  and as of this session we are gratified to count in our midst Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. My delegation extends a warm word of welcome to these new Member States.170.	The course of events and the evolution of world politics in recent times lead us to cherish well- founded hopes that  day by day  the relaxation of tension will become more marked  which will enable States to resolve their fundamental problems through friendly dialog and conciliatory negotiation and to avoid explosive confrontations and an escalation of violence which feeds on nationalistic passions. We hope that it will put an end to acts which today strew terror and death in various regions of the world.171.	The international law of the United Nations  which enshrines the fundamental principles of the equality of States  non-intervention  self-determination  respect for the territorial integrity of States  good faith in the discharge of contractual obligations  the prohibition of recourse to the threat or use of armed force or aggression against another State for the settlement of international disputes  respect and protection for the rights and fundamental freedoms of the human person these will be the unswerving laws followed by the new Government of Guatemala over which General Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garcia is now presiding and whom I represent today in this Assembly .172.	My Government  concerned to bring about effective  social justice  has undertaken specific programs aimed at raising the standard of living of the people of Guatemala  and is devoting what resources are available to improving the levels of living of the less fortunate classes and to attempting to find a solution to their vital requirements  despite the difficult circumstances obtaining in the national economy as a result of growing inflation and the energy crisis which today is affecting most of the countries of the world. Nevertheless  we are determined to fulfill  in so far as possible  the legal and moral undertakings to which we are committed in accordance with the norms prevailing in the international community today.173.	For this purpose  we require from countries the understanding  solidarity and co-operation which have so often been mentioned as imperatives for the present community of nations if it is to attain a just world order  since the circumstances of contemporary living throughout the world impose a closer and more equitable relationship among States. To this end it is essential to undertake an in-depth revision of the economic models prevailing in relations among States. In Latin America; 'particularly  the joint action of the countries of the region is aimed at a just channeling of their trade relations with highly industrialized nations  strengthening the inalienable right of developing nations to have access to suitable technology and to adopt a policy of defense of the basic export commodities of a great number of American States  such as coffee  sugar  cotton  beef and bananas among others.174.	The United Nations  through its competent bodies  is called upon to play a most important role in this field at the world level. A priority task for the developing countries is to ensure a just and equitable relationship between the prices of raw materials and of manufactured goods exported by our nations and the prices of the products they import from the industrialized nations. We must also counteract the trend towards the stagnation or reduction of the real prices of basic commodities; we must promote the production of primary materials in the under-developed countries that produce those commodities and agree on the inclusion of those countries in a system of trade preferences in accordance with their degree of economic development.175.	The problems of food shortages as well as of shortages in raw materials  inputs and services which most severely affect developing nations are an indication that  despite the exhausting efforts made by the peoples of these countries  a greater spirit of co-operation and understanding will be needed on the part of the others who enjoy more favorable conditions  especially as regards an appropriate treatment of international trade relations  the timely and inexpensive supply of the goods that contribute to the stability of the economy and the broader availability of technological and scientific advances.176.	This decision  it must be understood  is based on ethical and just principles which in no way may be interpreted as a condition of adherence to political blocs of any type. Our adherence to democratic principles is inherent in our national character and will in no way depend on the granting of preferences or on external conditions.177.	We are convinced that  regardless of political  economic and social differences among them  the States have the duty to co-operate among themselves to obtain mutual benefit from their economic relations in order to attain the objectives of their national development.178.	Within this spirit of understanding  of tolerance and of universal bonds an order of stable peace may be attained  which is the supreme aspiration of the United Nations. Such basic principles of international coexistence are contained in the Draft Charter on the Economic Rights and Duties of States which is to be considered during this session of the General Assembly and which is destined to become one of the basic documents in the future international legal order. Among its most important provisions we must emphasize those regarding the promotion of collective economic security and the economic development of States and  with regard to the latter  those providing for general disarmament and the utilization of the resources thus released for application to the needs of developing countries. Equally important are the provisions giving each State sovereignty over the wealth and natural resources within its land and maritime jurisdiction.179.	Furthermore  the United Nations has given capital importance to protecting the environment  sponsoring to that end various meetings and the establishment of an organization to deal with this question. We consider that environmental policies must be adopted in accordance with the needs of economic growth in order to safeguard health and the possibilities of improving the standards of living of the peoples and to provide that competent national bodies in the various countries share their knowledge  experience and documentation.180.	Guatemala participated with the utmost interest in the World Population Conference which was recently held in Bucharest  as well as in the preparatory activities which have been undertaken at the regional level  with the awareness that the problem is a justifiable concern for mankind. It defended as fundamental premises the principles of respect for the dignity and freedom of man and respect for the sovereign decision of each State on the basis of its particular circumstances. That is why  in general terms  we have given our approval to the world plan prepared at that conference  since it included recommendations which coincide with the policy my country follows  which is aimed at improving the quality of life of its inhabitants  at economic and social development and at affirming the independence of peoples.181.	In celebrating the first year of the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination  as undoubtedly will be noted in the report* requested from the Economic and Social Council by the Assembly  in resolution 3057 (XXVIII)  sincere interest has been noted  if not absolute adherence to this campaign. All States have expressed their willingness to co-operate in the implementation of the Program prepared in 1973 and annexed to the resolution; the directives of which may be a guide for more effective action  since the vigilant attention given has emphasized some grave and dramatic events  vestiges of discrimination or results of dislocation in the social integration of some regions of the world  to which the influence of the United Nations must be extended. The mixture of races  the biological value of which is also found in the social environment  has been a natural catalyst  but  even where there is no racial discrimination properly speaking  there is need for a greater integration of sectors of the population; with lower economic and cultural resources  in regard to which timely assistance could promote higher levels of living and better living conditions. Accordingly the Government of Guatemala supports all measures adopted by the Organization against discrimination of all kinds and at this time expresses its satisfaction at the fact that the United Nations has opportunely proclaimed the year 1975 to be International Women's Year [resolution 3010 (XXVII)].182.	In connexion with the proclamation of the International Women's Year  during which the merits of women will be extolled  and as a consequence of which the path to full equality will be opening up to women  I am happy to say that my country  in this regard  has encouraged the greatest possible participation of women in political  professional  educational and working life. It is thus that more than 50 per cent of the posts in the public health and education sectors are occupied by women  and there is no legal discrimination whatsoever with regard- to their electoral and civic rights or their right to free access to culture. In the educational system we see an ever-increasing number of girls and women attending school  with the result that the illiteracy rate among them is falling. However  we recognize that there are still centuries-old limitations which interfere with the social equality of women  but we trust that legislation and the action we have taken will open the way to an ever-increasing degree of development and that these national efforts will be considerably increased by the promotion of support which the United Nations may provide.183.	Since we are interested in recognizing the personalities who through philanthropy and their actions have contributed to establishing suitable living conditions for man  we consider the United Nations as a proper forum to pay a tribute to Fray Buiivume de Las Casas  since five centuries after his birth his thoughts are still with us  among them one of the great aspirations of this Organization  the protection and defense of the essential rights of man  to which the illustrious bishop of Chiapas and Verapaz in the former captaincy general of Guatemala devoted his most noble endeavors as a true pioneer of the declarations of human rights we have today.184.	As is well known by the States represented in this Assembly  the position of Guatemala has always been in solidarity with that of the countries of Latin America and other continents in the struggle to attain the liberation of all peoples under the yoke of colonial regimes and particularly to eliminate that system from American territory. There are numerous proofs of this attitude in the records of various committees of the General Assembly  particularly the Fourth Committee  as well as of the plenary meetings of the Assembly.185.	In the same spirit  Guatemala took part in the work of the group of countries that drafted the supremely important resolution 1514 (XV) of the General Assembly  which included a paragraph stating that ""any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations"".186.	With that single reservation  which excludes the secession of territories from its scope  Guatemala continues to maintain its anti-colonialist position unwaveringly and its firm adherence to the principle of the self-determination of peoples. In that spirit it will support every Assembly resolution aimed at freeing peoples that are still under colonial oppression.187.	The obsolete  anachronistic system of colonialism still persists in the Americas and in some enclaves occupied by Powers from outside Latin America  despite the fact that sovereignty over them legally belongs to American States. Such is the case of the Guatemalan Territory of Belize  the restitution of which by the United Kingdom has been demanded by my country for more than a century. This claim has been maintained uninterruptedly  based as it is on unimpeachable legal principles and all kinds of efforts have been made  within the canons of international law  to find a solution. In the last 10 years new roads have been zealously explored  and numerous formulas have been tried in an effort to reconcile the just claims of the Guatemalan nation  as well as its legitimate rights over the territory which was taken from it  with the most honorable aspirations of the people of Belize  who also are interested in freeing themselves from colonial domination  and to whom my Government reiterates its feelings of sincere friendship and of respect for their local traditions and institutions.188.	We trust that the dialog will continue between the parties to this century-long dispute  with no efforts spared that might lead to a solution which would satisfactorily reconcile Guatemala's territorial rights with those of the people of Belize. In the meantime  until there is such an understanding that will permanently ensure the peace of the region  Guatemala once again expresses its definite reservation with regard to its sovereign right over the Territory of Belize  at present occupied by the United Kingdom.189.	In its traditional spirit of international brother-hood and solidarity  Guatemala views with satisfaction the possibilities of attaining greater harmony and understanding among the countries of the Central American region and of speeding up the process of integration of the countries of the regional common market  an essential factor for its development. All efforts aimed at attaining these objectives will have our entire sympathy and support.190.	In concluding the statement  I should like to express my Government's hope that the deliberations of the Assembly  with the goodwill and mutual understanding of the States here represented  will lead to the solutions so urgently required for world peace and to meet the serious economic and other problems confronting our peoples today  and for the achievement of the aspirations to freedom  security and well-being of all the inhabitants of the earth."
"53",2931,"GUY",29,1974,"It is in no mere subservience to tradition that my first words in the general debate of the twenty-ninth session should be of gratitude to the President of the twenty-eighth session  our good friend Mr. Benites of Ecuador  and of congratulations and salutations to you  Sir  on assuming the presidency of the Assembly.42.	To Mr. Benites  of our own region of Latin America  we are twice indebted for the wisdom  the calm and the mature experience that guided us through the special session as skilfully and as safely as they had guaranteed our passage through the twenty-eighth session.43.	And our congratulations to you  Mr. President  are enhanced by the special pride and satisfaction reserved for rejoicing in a kinsman's triumph; for have we not worked with you as comrades over many years in the councils of the non-aligned movement and in the several consultations which have brought us together in the causes of the Third World? It is reassuring that  in sealing your presidency with unanimous acclaim  the Assembly should have demonstrated the capacity and the resolve to be itself infused with that spirit of dynamism which today so pervades the environment of the international community  and of which you yourself  Sir  are so much a symbol.44.	And as we welcome your election  so we rejoice in the admission to membership of the three new States—Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau— for each of which the people of Guyana reserves a special sentiment: for Bangladesh  with which we watched through the travail of birth and with which we work in the fellowship of the Commonwealth for Grenada  with which we have shared 300 years of the unique West Indian experience -an experience of European wars of possession  of slavery  of indenture and the plantation system  of a protracted colonialism and the struggle for social  economic and political justice  of the steady growth of identity and of the structures of regional unity and with which  out of that varied past  we share now the expectation of a long future of working together in the fraternity of our Caribbean community as we seek  to build just  progressive and free societies; and for Guinea-Bissau  with whose yearnings for liberation we identified  though a continent away  and in whose success in the struggle we exulted as a beginning of the crumbling of the remnant ramparts of colonialism and oppression in Africa. Each in its different way  Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau  represents a further victory for the hallowed crusade of self-determination  a crusade whose foremost international champion has been the Organization itself.45.	The admission of Bangladesh draws attention in a particularly poignant way to the obligations of the world community for operations of relief and rescue in relation to natural calamities  particularly in developing States with little or no reserves for dealing with them. The disaster that struck our sister Latin American State of Honduras on the very eve of this Assembly only serves to reinforce these obligations. It is clear that there is still much more that we must do to equip the United Nations to discharge these burdens on behalf of the international community. The resources currently at the disposal of the Secretary-General are far too limited for effective immediate response?  and far too much must inevitably be left to the charity of friends and the mobilization of international anguish. This twenty-ninth session of the Assembly should take prompt action to enable the Organization better to discharge an obvious and a non-controversial responsibility and it must  meanwhile  lend its urgent voice to the appeals of the Secretary-General and of the States concerned for the provision of the immediate assistance so desperately needed.46.	Together  the admission of the three new States brings us closer to the goal of a United Nations that is representative of all of mankind. But we must not forget in our rejoicing those impediments to universality that persist. In particular  the admissions of Grenada and of Guinea-Bissau remind us of the victories for decolonization yet to be won in the Caribbean and in Africa.47.	In our own region  our brothers in Belize- a member State of our Caribbean community- are currently being denied independence not through the unwillingness of the colonial Power to withdraw or indeed through their own lack of enthusiasm for self-determination but  as this Assembly has already itself borne witness  because of the threat of total absorption which they face once the metropolitan Power is withdrawn the threat of a virtual smothering at birth. The time has surely come for the acceptance of those realities and rights of such settled communities and States that history itself has consecrated and for the abandonment of proprietary contentions that have their dubious origins in another age and are rooted in another colonialism. It is intolerable  and it is indeed alien to the noble traditions of Latin America  that  at this late hour  a people should find the exercise of their right to self-determination thwarted by expansionist ambition. This Organization must ensure that its mandate for decolonization is nowhere so frustrated.48.	In Africa  it is most heartening that the Government of Portugal now takes its stand with courage and without equivocation on the side of self-determination and human dignity; and that  even as the twenty-ninth session was commencing  significant practical advances towards independence were being made in Mozambique. Among those who spoke out in condemnation of past policies  let us likewise be uninhibited in applauding present trends and assuring Portugal of our support for all constructive programs in furtherance of them. And to that assurance we must imply more than passive appreciation. The free States of Mozambique and Angola  like the State of Guinea-Bissau  whose first anniversary of independence we celebrated last week  will require massive assistance from the international community if the triumph of self-determination is not to be overcast by the calamity of economic disaster. It is not too early to commit international resources on the scale that will be essential to the inevitable task of reconstruction. This twenty-ninth session should not pass without the necessary decisions being taken to that end.49.	The consummation of the struggle for liberation in Mozambique and Angola is  of course  both a vindication of the struggle itself and a renewal of confidence in the eventual victories that must be won by those other movements for liberation for whom victory may not be immediately at hand. But that confidence will only be justified if it does not degenerate into complacency. Self-determination in Mozambique and in Angola does not represent the end of the struggle for freedom in southern Africa. Namibia  Rhodesia  and South Africa itself will remain a charge upon the conscience and a claim upon the courage of free men everywhere.50.	The momentum generated at the international level in recent years by the movement for freedom in southern Africa has played an important  indeed a vital  role in the present prospects for victory. A loss of that momentum might even now impair those prospects; but  no less serious  a loss of momentum at this stage of partial victory would be an indefensible squandering of the tactical and psychological advantages that have been gained for the campaigns of liberation elsewhere. Mozambique and Angola will be free. Let their places be reserved at the thirtieth session. What we need now is to redouble the effort  to re-energize the struggle  to press home the advantages mindful always that the forces of racism and oppression will grow more desperate as they retreat behind their last defenses.51.	Let us mark the promise which this session brings of major gains for freedom in southern Africa with a renewal of commitment not merely to a continuing but indeed to an escalating struggle in which the collective will of this Organization and of all its legitimate Members are brought to bear upon the final victories. And what better way to do so than for this Organization to act decisively as the Assembly has just done on the report of the Credentials Committee [2248th meeting] and  consistent with required procedure  to formally withdraw from South Africa those rights of membership which its gross  persistent and insufferable violations of the Charter forfeited long ago.52.	And the case of Namibia represents a special challenge; for it is an international Territory in respect of which the Organization has assumed particular responsibilities. The positive actions just taken by the United Nations Council for Namibia whose current President it is Guyana's honor to provide in exercising its legislative power to secure the resources of Namibia in trust for the people of that Territory and in establishing in Zambia the Institute for Namibia are welcome assertions of the responsibility of the international community in advancing the struggle for freedom. The time is ripe for us  through the instrumentality of the Security Council  to take the further steps that may be necessary for ensuring that the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa is speedily and irrevocably terminated.53.	Nor can we forget  in passing  those divided States whose condition of division continues to contribute to their remaining outside the Organization. Let us  consistent with our commitment to universality  help to create conditions through which the peoples of all those lands may settle the internal issues of fragmentation without the interference  or even the inter-locution  of external forces in whatever garb they may be attired or from however far or near they may come.54.	And as we try to create conditions that will assist in resolving those issues that keep the divided States outside the Organization  let us be alerted by the lessons of Cyprus to the threat to national independence and sovereignty of States already within the Organization. The people of Cyprus have suffered a tragedy of immense proportions. None of us  but particularly those of us who come from plural societies  can fail to be profoundly moved by the setback to national unity that has followed in the wake of the misguided adventurism that marked the beginning of these events.55.	There will be time hereafter to judge those events and those who contributed to their conception and their execution. What is needed now  above all else  is to help our brothers in Cyprus to bind up the wounds of their shattered society  to help them in their efforts to preserve the integrity of the State and to place at their disposal our collective good offices and the protection  and indeed the superintendence  of the United Nations itself in guaranteeing that integrity and the capacity of Cyprus to continue to play a constructive role in the affairs of the world community. To that process of recuperation many States may be able to make a modest contribution  and the opportunity that now exists to broaden the base of the international effort particularly to broaden it beyond the confines of super and major Powers should not be lost.56.	While that effort is being assembled  and whatever may be the eventual political and constitutional solutions  we cannot afford to ignore the humanitarian problem which cries out urgently for solution and which  if unrelieved  will make the task of finding solutions immensely more intractable. The dislocation of a large proportion of the population of Cyprus demands the immediate attention of the international community. The fact that the numbers themselves are small compared with other human calamities of this kind with which the international community has been obliged to deal in the past should serve only to quicken the pace with which programs of relief are agreed upon and put into execution.57.	There is still a chance to save Cyprus from deteriorating into yet another embattled zone petrified in division by the patronage of major Powers. There are clearly men of good will on all sides ready to work tirelessly to avoid so dismal a prognosis. In the days and weeks ahead let the Assembly  let the Organization  let all Member States  help them to find those ways out of the present darkness.58.	We join the Secretary-General in paying homage to the members of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force who gave their lives in Cyprus. But the lessons we must draw from that tragedy  the acknowledgment we must make for their sacrifice  is that there is need for the international community to rethink its approaches to peace-keeping  to the scale of peacekeeping operations and to the difficult questions of authorization  of control  of command and of supply that need to be settled  and settled along lines compatible with current needs of international peace and contemporary concepts of international action.59.	The international community  like all communities at the national level  must sometimes learn hard lessons out of the experience of great tribulation. Perhaps out of the Cyprus experience the international community will learn some lessons about peace-keeping. Perhaps we shall be led at last to a perception of the Organization's true role in preventive peace-keeping -a functional role  consistent with national sovereignty  of maintaining international order and preserving the integrity of States more effectively than we ever can do through token forces assembled in the aftermath of conflict.60.	The important developments in peace-keeping in the wake of the recent crisis in the Middle East and the present unhappy experience in Cyprus should certainly provide justification for a major effort during this session to advance the issue of international peace-keeping as one of the major mandates of the Organization under the Charter. Strengthened by contemporary insights of the global unity of mankind and the concomitant interdependence of men  we should not permit past impediments to consensus on this issue to obscure our prospects of future accord and we should not  therefore  be deterred from pursuing it anew.61.	But while at this twenty-ninth session we deliberate the political issues of peace-keeping and disarmament  of decolonization and apartheid  of the crisis in the Middle East and the situation in IndoChina  it is the economic issues confronting the world community and impressing themselves upon the daily lives of people everywhere that will demand our most urgent attention and our most penetrating examination and debate.62.	That we should have reached the stage where all Member States acknowledge the priority character of these issues is itself a notable advance. There was285a time  not so long ago  when  to the developed world of east and west  these Were the peripheral issues of the international dialog  relegated almost to the category of ""any other business"" on the international agenda. It can no longer be so. For these issues are now as critical to the prosperity of the developed world as they have always been to the survival of the developing.63.	It would have been encouraging had we reached this unanimity of concern from a position of principle responsive to the mandates of the Charter  but in truth we have not. Despite the inevitable failure of a succession of international palliatives to redress the economic imbalance between the rich and the poor countries of the world; despite the mounting frustration  the cynicism and  indeed  the resentment of the world's under-privileged; despite even the gradual emergence of a global consciousness  a planetary awareness of an interdependent world community despite all these  the developed countries  for the greater part  but with some important exceptions  refused to come to terms with the need for fundamental change. It required the catalytic compulsions of the energy issue to force recognition of the need for a new international economic order. Even so  it was with a sometimes reluctant developed world that we reached a halting consensus at the sixth special session on the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S'VI)] and of the Program of Action to implement it [resolution 3202 (S-VI)].64.	With the special session on raw materials and development behind us and the special session on development and international economic co-operation in 1975 ahead of us  it is essential that these pressing economic issues occupy a major part of our time at the twenty-ninth session. This general debate can serve an important purpose if  through frank exchanges  we can advance the dialog of change and close the gap that Obviously still exists between the expectation of the poor and the intent of the rich.65.	To close that gap we must reach agreement on the purposes of our endeavors  on  Our basic aims and objectives. In the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order we have agreed on the rhetoric of change. In the Program of Action we have identified together some of the mechanisms by which it might be initiated. But have we agreed upon the philosophy of change? Have we reached from our different starting-points an accord on the ideology of international economic reconstruction?66.	If the search for consensus at the sixth special session has meant no more to the developed world  or to major parts of it  than minor modifications of the international economic system to appease the claimant demand for change or  worse still  a process of minimal adjustment of positions within the existing system to meet the particular needs of what might appear to be a transient emergency and there is  let it be admitted  evidence enough that to several developed States that search for consensus meant only the one or the other if this is really so  then we are still far from that agreement on a common purpose which is the precondition of co-operative action. And for so long as that discord persists at the level of objectives neither the rhetoric of the Declaration nor the mechanisms of the Program of Action will contribute significantly to the resolution of those basic economic issues which will persist in demanding our attention. Without the energizing spark of mutual commitment  the former will be a lifeless parchment and the latter a withered blueprint  both destined for the international archive of lost causes.67.	If  however  we are to persevere in pursuit of mutuality; if we are to proceed by consensus  as we are almost threateningly urged to do -as indeed both principle and expediency enjoin the developing States to do- then let it at least be clear to all engaged in the dialog that that mutuality  that consensus  must relate primordially to the philosophy of change  must be founded in a joint response to the seminal questions. What kind of world is it which we must strive to change? What kind of better world is it to which we seek to move? If we are not agreed upon those essentials of change  consensus on the mechanisms of change is a meaningless concept and the search for it is bound to end in futility  in frustration and  inevitably  in confrontation. But if we can reach agreement upon these essentials  real and genuine agreement supported by the conviction that it is in the ultimate interest of all States to advance that transformation  then the Declaration adopted at the sixth special session will possess the quality of an organic instrument of our new world community and the Program of Action wiK be a living charter of progressive reform.68.	I cannot and do not purport to speak for all the Third World; but I suspect that the view from Guyana's corner of the developing world is much like the view from many another Third World window. And I suspect that our vision of the world as we seek to move from it is much like the vision of the remaining two thirds of the world's people who yearn for change. Perhaps for this reason it is easy for me to adopt the description given of our contemporary scene by one of the distinguished economists of the Third World  Mr. Mahbub al Haq of Pakistan  speaking recently in commemoration of a great internationalist of the developed world who understood our view and shared our vision:""He would have been greatly saddened"" -said Mr. Haq- ""by a world which was so divided economically as to have about 20 per cent of the population enjoying about 80 per cent of the world income. We have today about two thirds of humanity living if it can be called living at all on less than 30 U.S. cents a day. We have today a situation where there are about 1 000 million illiterate people around the world  although the world has the means and the technology to spread education. We have about 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the children in the Third World suffering from malnutrition although the world has the resources to give adequate nutrition to all of its population. We have maldistribution of the world's resources on a scale where the developed countries are consuming about 25 times more of the resources per capita than the developing countries. We are in a situation where in the Third World millions of people work incredibly hard for very miserable rewards. It is easy to be sophisticated about it and to explain it all in terms of stages of development; but it is not likely to carry much conviction in our countries where people toil in a broiling sun from morning till dusk for mere subsistence and for premature death without ever discovering the reason why.""It is one of the more heartening and indeed more hopeful realities of our time that those words were spoken in the propitious environment of Sweden in a keynote address at a seminar on development and independence held in commemoration of the work of Dag Hammarskjdld.69.	That picture of our modern world is  I believe  fairly representative of the vieW from the third world generally. It may look slightly better for a handful of developing countries; it will look slightly worse for several. But its essentials are unchallengeable and the need for its rectification must be self-evident. It is on that issue of rectification that we must seek consensus  consensus that we will employ our intellective talents and our technological skills  consensus that we will indulge our humanism no less than our instinct for survival to change the world while there is still time to do it by volition.70.	How many of us  developed or developing Member States of this Organization  have not determined to reject a national society founded on such gross inequities? How many States have not in fact been established on the basis of rebellion against such injustices? And for how many of us are not these distortions an outrage to the tenets of our national philosophies of social and economic justice? Why  then  do we permit these feudal structures to persist in the community of States  and how long do we really believe they can survive without rendering indefensible a strategy of change through dialog?71.	Whether we are going to end these inequalities and injustices and distortions  whether we are going to build on this planet an egalitarian world community in which the world's income is more fairly shared  in which the world's resources are more evenly consumed  in which the quality of human life derives from belonging not to the world's minority elite but to the human race itself -these are the issues on which we need to reach accord. I have no wish to oversimplify the matter. It is easy to pay lip-service to these objectives  and it is fashionable to do so. It is much more difficult to elevate them to an ethos of international life and to translate that ethos into the practical reality of living. And yet  is there an alternative  if we are indeed to proceed by consensus?72.	If we are  therefore  so to proceed in earnest  the developed world must be ready to accept change that is truly fundamental. The world's economic system lbs at the base of the world's economic inequalities  injustices and distortions and that system itself must change in radical ways  some of which the Program of Action has already identified. I wish merely  in terms of the philosophy and the ideology of change  to allude to but one aspect of this process. Aristotle long ago perceived a fundamental truth which is as valid today in terms of relations between States as it was 2 000 years ago in terms of relations between people within States. ""As between unequals""  he asserted  ""equity itself demands non-reciprocity"". You cannot  he was showing us  change the basic condition of relative inequality except by unequal inputs. If the weak are to be made strong  if the poor are to be lifted out of their poverty  if the under-privileged are to enjoy an equal share  they must  as against the strong  and the rich  and the privileged  be specially advantaged; and the equalizing mechanisms required for redressing these imbalances must inevitably alter in radical ways the very system which produced and sustained them.73.	What all this means is that if we are to reach consensus on the philosophy of change  the developed world has first of all to care enough about what happens in the third world and to its people; has  in the second place   to acknowledge that its own long-term interests require profound modification of the status quo; and has to care enough and be enlightened enough to accept the sacrifices and the dislocations of change; and to accept them  not carpingly as temporary inconveniences to unbridled national prosperity  but nobly and with pride as a new way of life fashioned so that all men may share in the prosperity of our human effort.74.	We believe  of course  that a mature self-interest ought to dictate the need for consensus on these terms; that our perceptions of an interdependent world make it inevitable that these changes must be wrought; that the demographic reality of the twenty-first century in which today's developed world may be but a mere 10 per cent of the population of our planet makes it essential that they should be wrought long before these disparities become even more absurd than they are at present.75.	But consensus on such a philosophy of change will not emerge out of old attitudes and old approaches. It is not the consensus of the market-place or that which speaks out of the barrel of a gun. It cannot be a consensus extracted by competition or dictated by power. Our search for consensus must be guided  instead  by a new ordering of values  of values which derive from the imperatives of the human condition in this last quarter of the twentieth century.76.	Ever since the emergence of human life on earth many years ago  there have been innumerable hazards to man's existence. They have come from time to time in varying forms  not infrequently from man himself through internecine war. Some of those hazards remain; but the crisis of our time derives from the very success of mankind  from his very success in survival and in his building of a global community that now truly possesses the earth  a community that daily grows more interdependent as our human needs press ever closer to the limits of our small planet. Over-consumption in one place today frequently means scarcity in another; and it also exacts its own deprivation in the environment of the indulgent.77.	Our human condition has changed fundamentally; but the organization of human society has not responded to this basic change in man's relationship to his world. We still have a community of mankind in which many are weak while others are strong; in which many are poor while others grow more enriched; in which many are sick even while science 'conquers disease. The perception of the finiteness of our planet must produce an awareness that all these major problems are interrelated; Food security  problems of population  pollution of the environment  the distribution of the new wealth of the sea and of the scarce non-renewable resources of the land  the elimination of poverty  malnutrition and illiteracy  respect for the inherent dignity of man -all these must be taken together on the agenda of human survival. And in that debate  the antediluvian politics of competition and of power must yield to the politics of world order. When it does -but only when it does- consensus on that philosophy of change  which may be the precondition of man's survival on this planet  will no longer be beyond our grasp.78.	It was precisely because we had not reached consensus on these fundamentals of change that our development decades and what has up to now been the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] have failed to produce significant change  have failed to effect even the token transfer of resources from the developed to the developing world which was their modest ambition. If we do now agree to embark upon effective international economic reconstruction  one of the primary objectives of the equalizing mechanisms we devise must be a significant transfer of resources from the rich nations to the poor; for herein lies the very heart of change  and it is in this area more than in most that we will test the strength of the commitment of the developed world to meaningful reform.	79.	In this regard  two factors need to be acknowledged. The first is that if we are to secure a significant transfer of resources from the developed to the developing countries  if we are to redistribute the world's wealth along more equitable lines  the equalizing mechanisms which we adopt may have to be highly innovative. In the area of trade  for example  mere access to markets may well not be enough. It will certainly not be enough where the assumption is that such access will materially assist the developing State through expansion of exports produced on the basis of cheap labor  for concepts of cheap labor which serve to perpetuate the inequalities of the present system can themselves provide no foundation on which to commence the process of reconstruction. In any transfer of resources designed to eliminate the most stark inequalities of the contemporary scene  therefore  the developed world may well have to face for at least some period of time not ju. an end but  indeed  a reversal of the patterns of trade on which the industrialized societies grew strong: the pattern of buying cheap and selling dear.80.	It is a measure of the persisting absence of consensus between us on these fundamentals that much of the criticism that continues to be directed to the members of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries [OPEC] proceeds on the assumption that this .system of low negotiated prices for primary products and high invoiced prices for manufactured goods is somehow preordained and consecrated and that any departure from it  let alone its reversal  borders on heresy and intolerable impertinence.81.	More particularly  however  experience has shown how easily real improvement in the export receipts of the developing countries can be frustrated by rapid inflation in the developed world. If the problem of achieving meaningful redistribution of the world's income is going to be tackled with a new resolve  then the implementation of schemes of indexation can no longer be postponed. In order to achieve concrete progress with such schemes  we may have to be content  at least initially  with something less than a perfect technical solution. If it be so although the most recent UNCTAD studies appear to confirm the technical feasibility of the system let us nevertheless proceed. We cannot continue to further postpone decision because of an infinity of unresolved subtleties. The patience  not to say the capacity for economic declension  of the developing countries must not be assumed to be endlessly extensive.82.	The second factor is the more obvious one of the emergence of new strengths within the developing world  strengths that derive in large measure from the unity and resolve of the third world and from practical co-operation within producer associations established by developing States in defense of their right to just terms of trade. OPEC is but one of these associations. Others have already been established  not just on the basis of the experience of OPEC  but in response to the awareness that has been emerging over a number of years that developing producer States  separately weak  can multiply their negotiating strength several times over in dealings with the developed world and its multinational corporations if they act in concert and sustain their unity. The emergence of the new strength which these associations bring to the developing world ought to be a factor of the most profound significance in motivating the developed world both to reach consensus on change and to reach accord on the mechanisms for bringing it about.83.	The choice between consensus and confrontation is not a choice which will be determined by the developing world. It is a choice that will be dictated by the developed. In any such choice the developing countries must inevitably prefer the former; but if consensus is unattainable and if confrontation is imposed  then there at least exist some levers of strength through which in the last resort a net transfer of resources might be secured.84.	But let me make it clear that when I speak in this context of a net transfer of resources  it is of a transfer from the developed to the developing States as a whole  a shift of income towards all parts of the developing world. Transfers whose effects are so gross as to create new disparities or new areas of elitism; transfers that are so indiscriminately imposed that they fall equally upon the poor as upon the rich  but with far grayer consequences for the former; or transfers whose base of recipiency is so narrow as to encourage and facilitate a recycling of resources back to the developed countries -such transfers do not fulfill their true potential as equalizing mechanisms and they are questionable symbols of commitment to an egalitarian world community.85.	But other equalizing mechanisms may be at hand. Certainly  in our effort to redress existing economic imbalances  the new resources of the sea and the sea-bed and the vast potential of outer space can play a unique role. Conceptualized already as a heritage of mankind  what ideal opportunities they provide for creating mechanisms for bringing about a more equitable over-all distribution of the world'sresources. If we are  indeed  to reach by consensus the goal of global justice  it should be in the interest of the developed States to maximize the returns from these new resources to the peoples of the developing world. But this  also  involves a commitment to fundamental change on the part of the developed world and a willingness to accept constraints on excessive aggregations of wealth in the interest of achieving this end.86.	There are  of course  important contributions that the developing countries themselves must make to the fulfillment of the goal of an equitable international economic order. IHs axiomatic that just economic relations between States will not fulfill the ambition of an egalitarian world community unless they are made to serve the cause of economic justice within States. The installation and preservation of just societies within the developing world must be as much the consequence of as it clearly is the paramount reason for the securing of a regime of economic equality between all States. For this reason  if for no other  we must accept that the status of human rights everywhere in the developed and in the developing worlds  of civil and political rights  of economic  social and cultural rights  are  and must continue to be  the legitimate concern of the international community  and that their most gross and patent violation must demand the attention of the Organization. The imperatives of economic justice and of respect for the dignity of man once marshaled in the cause of human survival cannot be halted at national frontiers.87.	And  of course  the developing countries may well be able to do much to help themselves through more effective economic co-operation in such important areas as trade  transport  industrial development  transfer of technology  and monetary and financial arrangements. The non-aligned movement  pursuing concepts of economic self-reliance  has already adopted an action program for economic co-operation between the non-aligned countries and other developing countries along these lines  and the Assembly has given its blessing to assistance for these efforts from the United Nations [resolution 3241 (XXIX)]. More direct trade between developing countries  through shipping routes that run not merely north to south between developed and developing States  but east to west in the southern zone of the world  may yet significantly enlarge the prospects for development of at least some developing countries. Certainly  such arrangements can contribute greatly to lowering the level of dependency of third world countries and effect qualitative changes in prevailing international economic relationships.88.	Most of these developments -all  indeed  save the last -depend essentially upon the ability of the developed and the developing worlds to reach consensus through dialog. This urgent necessity makes it essential that we utilize the United Nations system to maximum advantage in pursuing that dialog and in maintaining  for so long as it is maintainable  the options for consensus.89.	It follows that the Organization must be made the focal point for the dialog of development and for the establishment of the new international economic order  and that present efforts to transfer that dialog to and to install the machinery for decision-making in  multilateral associations controlled by the developed world must be resisted.90.	How deeply indebted we are  all of us  to the Prime Minister of Australia for reminding us  in the eloquent and forthright language of progressive internationalism  of the primacy of this role of the United Nations in the search for solutions to our current problems.91.	But our need for dialog does draw attention to the unique service which can be rendered  and rendered now  by other institutions  by institutions old and new  which bring together segments of the developed and developing worlds in an environment of genuinely free consultation. Mankind stands greatly in need of consensus-building mechanisms of every sort and at every level between the developed and the developing countries. Indeed  never before has there been as great a need to use these institutions and mechanisms for reaching consensus in the interest of the international community as a whole.92.	But if we are to use them to this end  we must be mindful of their potential for contributing to that global consensus toward which we work. These consensus-building mechanisms include existing institutions  like the British Commonwealth  that bring together on a basis of ever-enlarging intimacy and understanding States old and new  industrialized and developing  States of north and south  of east and west  States pluralistic and multiracial -a microcosm  indeed  of the world community- embryonic institutions  like that emerging from the new dialog now begun in the Americas  deriving not from old traditions of hegemony but from new insights and possibilities of co-operation between all the States and I repeat  all the States of the hemisphere; incipient associations  such as that which now seems possible between the European Economic Community and a group of some 40 or more States of Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific -a relationship which  eschewing a passing neocolonialism  now seeks to explore the potential for economic co-operation between the world's most powerful economic grouping and States that individually are among the weakest  but together are not without strength  and to do so on terms consistent with the wider international objectives of the new economic order.93.	In all these groupings  and more  there must be pressed into service the search for global consensus on which rests our best hope  perhaps our only hope  not merely for establishing the new international economic order we have already proclaimed  but of evolving that consensus on an egalitarian world community without which our other expectations would be utterly illusory.94.	If this session is to help to turn us away from the dangers of confrontation  I suggest with(all humility that it is on the intensive search for consensus of this kind and of this quality that we must all agree to embark  developed and developing States alike  both here in the United Nations and in those other organs of. international consultation that provide opportunities for the understanding and reconciliation which persistent dialog inevitably brings."
"54",2974,"HND",29,1974,"Coming from a region of destruction and death  I speak from this rostrum in pain  with the single purpose of appealing  on behalf of a people who today owing to a natural disaster is living the most tragic moments of its history  to the humanitarian feelings of the States of the world represented here.2.	Last week  a tropical storm of devastating force was unleashed on the Atlantic coast of Honduras  sowing destruction and death. The consequent climatic changes led to torrential rains  uninterrupted for several days  which caused violent and extensive floods  spreading damage over the entire national territory and leaving in their wake mourning  desolation and loss.3.	The very dimension of the tragedy makes it impossible for us to give exact information on human and material losses. Suffice it to say that so far it is estimated that 10 000 persons have died and that of the 600 000 persons inhabiting the areas most affected by the storms  and who are deprived of their means of livelihood  more than 100 000 are homeless.4.	To see these figures in the right perspective  it is necessary to bear in mind that the total population of my country is less than 3 million.5.	The backbone of the economy of my country is broken; 85 per cent of the harvests of the main exports and consumption products have been destroyed and water covers and will continue to cover for some time what used to be the fertile fields that constituted the greatest wealth of my country  making it virtually impossible to restore them for a long time and in some cases causing irreparable damage.6.	Honduras is essentially an agricultural and cattle raising country  and a very high percentage of the national production in these areas was concentrated in the affected region.7.	As though this was not sufficient mortally to wound a poor and small country  our industrial centers are located in the area of the greatest destruction and in many cases they will have to close down  while in other cases they will have at least to reduce the rate of their operations for a long time  thus aggravating the already high rate of unemployment.8.	The damages to the infrastructure -roads  bridges  railroads  power-lines  drinking water systems  port facilities and so on- are simply catastrophic. The effort required for reconstruction is still incalculable.9.	Preliminary technical estimates set the losses at approximately $1 000 million. And this in a country whose gross national product is far below that amount.10.	In the face of the Honduran tragedy  the international community has demonstrated its solidarity and responded with alacrity. From the four corners of the world we have received contributions which have helped in meeting our enormous need for food  clothes  medicines and supplies. To all the nations and organizations which  in one way or another  have come to our assistance  I should like  on behalf of Honduras  to extend our profound and lasting gratitude.11.	The people and Government of Honduras are stoically doing all that is humanly possible  devoting all their efforts and resources and working 24 hours a day to meet the most urgent needs brought about by our tragedy. And we are unshakably resolute in facing the responsibility of reconstructing our wounded homeland with total devotion. Unfortunately  we understand that our own efforts  intensive as they may be  will not suffice and that we urgently need massive assistance on the part of all States of goodwill.12.	This is the reason for my presence on this forum. I am grateful for the special opportunity granted to me to address the Assembly. I come as the representative of a poor and proud people who need help. We have confidence in the international ""organizations and in the feelings of human solidarity of all nations and we hope that assistance will be speedy and generous. I am profoundly encouraged in that hope by the fact that the group of Latin American States has authorized me to tell you that it feels the tragedy afflicting Honduras as its own and as one of continental scope.13.	God's will  which puts us to the test  at the same time gives us strength to bear this test and the confidence that in the world there are sensitive people ready to extend a friendly hand to us. I appeal today to their consciences since in supreme moments of anguish and pain a wounded people can only offer its unshakable will to survive and its endless gratitude to those who accompany and assist it.

"55",3045,"HTI",29,1974,"The twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly opened last year in an atmosphere of political detente. It was preparing to consider the economic and social objectives of the Charter in order to ensure for the world a dynamic balance when war broke out in the Middle East  We then witnessed the collapse of all hopes; we saw world-wide runaway inflation  upheaval in the international payments system and the resurgence of latent conflicts. Human society was shaken to its foundations and the twenty-eighth session  which had opened under promising auguries  ended in disappointment and disarray.2.	Those events suffice to show that the delegation of the Republic of Haiti justly appreciates the magnitude of the mission entrusted to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika in guiding the work of this twenty-ninth session. We wish to assure him of our co-operation and offer our warmest congratulations on the high mark of confidence shown him  which is furthermore a tribute to the tradition of struggle  courage and clear understanding of the valiant people of Algeria.3.	The events which overshadowed the term of office of the President of the twenty-eighth session  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  enabled him to confirm his reputation as a skilled diplomat  who guided the work of that session with competence and devotion. The delegation of Haiti offers him its most sincere compliments and renews the expression of our esteem and appreciation.4.	Despite the trepidation of the international community  the United Nations has nevertheless lost none of its vitality. The year 1974 will have been most fruitful in specialized conferences. After the sixth special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development  Caracas and Bucharest came one after the other to draw the world's attention to the need for an international legal regime for the sea and for population problems. Soon delegations from all over the world will be going to Rome to consider the fundamental question of feeding people. That activity is the work of the Secretary-General  to whom the delegation of Haiti pays tribute.5.	All those activities undertaken within the frame-work of the Organization reflect an ever clearer awareness of the common destiny of peoples and the need for concerted solutions to the pressing problems of mankind. They have contributed to reducing the compartmentalization of ideologies. They have mitigated political antagonisms and shown the dangers of the gap between the industrialized and the developing countries and they have clearly indicated the elements of an exceptionally grave economic situation.6.	The warning was given by the United Nations itself when  on the occasion of the last special session  on raw materials and development  the Secretariat showed  in irrefutable documents  that the world economic prosperity registered in the course of the 1950s and 1960s  which was based on ""a strong and stable demand""  is declining to the point of placing mankind on the threshold of a crisis as acute as that of 1929. We discovered that the economic system of the period following the Second World War had not given sufficient importance to international social justice that could bring about a more equitable distribution of wealth among peoples.7.	In fact  sustained economic growth and the constant rise in the volume of international trade which characterized the last two decades benefited only industrialized countries  whose trade flow in 1970 was estimated at more than $300 billion  whereas that of all the developed countries was barely $50 billion  while their total indebtedness was close to $80 billion.8.	To that overall inequality in the distribution of wealth  in which the seeds of division  disquiet and anxiety had already been sown  was added the resumption of hostilities in the Middle East in October 1973  which aggravated the discrepancy in the third world between the situation of the oil-producing countries and that of those lacking oil resources.9.	The moratorium on oil exports to the industrialized countries of the West followed by their reduction  as well as the rise in prices  certainly affected their economic expansion  accelerated their inflationary processes and disrupted their way of life; but the countries hardest hit by those measures are those of the third world  which are finding it extremely difficult to pay for their oil-based energy needs and  because of generalized inflation  even more difficult to purchase the capital goods they need.10.	All these facts indicate the interrelationship between political and economic questions and the interdependence of peoples. They impose the need for global co-operation in order to minimize the horrors of this generalized economic crisis and to satisfy the aspirations of all men for well-being  social justice and peace.11.	Besides these grave problems  which are essentially economic  conflicts and upheavals of every kind continue to endanger international security. The Government of Haiti  aware of the threat to mankind of these so-called localized tensions  renews its dedication to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  where it is always possible to find solutions to the questions on our agenda. We reaffirm our confidence in the wisdom and reason of representatives attending this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly and invite all parties concerned to negotiate with a view to removing the causes of their resentments and to settling their disputes.12.	Many no less serious political problems were satisfactorily solved  enabling this Assembly to welcome the delegations of Bangladesh  Grenada  and Guinea- Bissau  to whom we extend our warmest welcome. The delegation of Haiti especially welcomes the representatives of Grenada  and we transmit to them the wishes of the people and Government of Haiti for the prosperity and well-being of that new State now in a position to enhance the prospects for harmony in the Caribbean region.13.	My delegation is happy to express once again the sense of brotherhood and solidarity of the people and Government of Haiti for the people and Government of Guinea-Bissau  whose independence  acquired at the cost of great sacrifices  brings to mind -170 years later- the struggle waged by Africans to create the State of Haiti. The delegation of Haiti  in welcoming Guinea-Bissau  is naturally thinking of the destiny of the populations of Angola  Mozambique  Namibia and Rhodesia. We welcome with satisfaction the happy outcome of the situation in Mozambique  which will become independent in June 1975  and we hope that the same will occur with Angola.14.	As regards the populations of Namibia and Rhodesia  still the victims of neocolonialism and of racial discrimination  we convey to them the sympathies of the people and Government of Haiti  who are convinced that their courage and steadfastness will oust from their territory the last vestiges of an outmoded era.15.	It is a truism to say that international problems reflect the internal situation of States. Thus  the President for life of the Republic of Haiti  Mr. Jean- Claude Duvalier  being aware of his national and international responsibilities  has adopted a series of measures to guarantee both social peace and the harmonious development of the nation. In order to ensure control over the development of our natural resources  certain contracts are being revised; monopolies granted to private companies working in key sectors of the national economy are now being reconsidered whereas tax exemptions are granted to encourage agricultural production and the establishment of industrial units.16.	These reforms  which proved to be essential to economic recovery  will be followed by the establishment of new administrative structures now under consideration. These will bolster the efforts made in the economic and fiscal fields/Tin this vast undertaking  the Government of Haiti is happy to have received moral support and financial and technical assistance from many friendly Governments which have recognized the humanitarian nature of the political and economic changes brought about to promote the social well-being of the people of Haiti.17.	It remains for us to hope that international financing organizations will manage to simplify their procedures for granting assistance so as to give practical effect to the resolutions adopted for the benefit of the economically least endowed countries in the world. For now more than ever before  as the Secretary-General has stated  the international community faces difficulties that are so complex that ""no nations  however rich or powerful  can remain immune  and which no nation can hope to confront and resolve successfully on its own."" [See A/9601/Add. 1  sect. /.]18.	The appeal of the Secretary-General for agreement and co-operation deserves to be heard and borne in mind so that mankind may be able to face present problems successfully and ensure its future. This is the hope of the delegation of Haiti on the occasion of this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly.The twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly opened last year in an atmosphere of political detente. It was preparing to consider the economic and social objectives of the Charter in order to ensure for the world a dynamic balance when war broke out in the Middle East  We then witnessed the collapse of all hopes; we saw world-wide runaway inflation  upheaval in the international payments system and the resurgence of latent conflicts. Human society was shaken to its foundations and the twenty-eighth session  which had opened under promising auguries  ended in disappointment and disarray.2.	Those events suffice to show that the delegation of the Republic of Haiti justly appreciates the magnitude of the mission entrusted to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika in guiding the work of this twenty-ninth session. We wish to assure him of our co-operation and offer our warmest congratulations on the high mark of confidence shown him  which is furthermore a tribute to the tradition of struggle  courage and clear understanding of the valiant people of Algeria.3.	The events which overshadowed the term of office of the President of the twenty-eighth session  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  enabled him to confirm his reputation as a skilled diplomat  who guided the work of that session with competence and devotion. The delegation of Haiti offers him its most sincere compliments and renews the expression of our esteem and appreciation.4.	Despite the trepidation of the international community  the United Nations has nevertheless lost none of its vitality. The year 1974 will have been most fruitful in specialized conferences. After the sixth special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development  Caracas and Bucharest came one after the other to draw the world's attention to the need for an international legal regime for the sea and for population problems. Soon delegations from all over the world will be going to Rome to consider the fundamental question of feeding people. That activity is the work of the Secretary-General  to whom the delegation of Haiti pays tribute.5.	All those activities undertaken within the framework of the Organization reflect an ever clearer awareness of the common destiny of peoples and the need for concerted solutions to the pressing problems of mankind. They have contributed to reducing the compartmentalization of ideologies. They have mitigated political antagonisms and shown the dangers of the gap between the industrialized and the developing countries and they have clearly indicated the elements of an exceptionally grave economic situation.6.	The warning was given by the United Nations itself when  on the occasion of the last special session  on raw materials and development  the Secretariat showed  in irrefutable documents  that the world economic prosperity registered in the course of the 1950s and 1960s  which was based on ""a strong and stable demand""  is declining to the point of placing mankind on the threshold of a crisis as acute as that of 1929. We discovered that the economic system of the period following the Second World War had not given sufficient importance to international social justice that could bring about a more equitable distribution of wealth among peoples.7.	In fact  sustained economic growth and the constant rise in the volume of international trade which characterized the last two decades benefited only industrialized countries  whose trade flow in 1970 was estimated at more than $300 billion  whereas that of all the developed countries was barely $50 billion  while their total indebtedness was close to $80 billion.8.	To that overall inequality in the distribution of wealth  in which the seeds of division  disquiet and anxiety had already been sown  was added the resumption of hostilities in the Middle East in October 1973  which aggravated the discrepancy in the third world between the situation of the oil-producing countries and that of those lacking oil resources.9.	The moratorium on oil exports to the industrialized countries of the West followed by their reduction  as well as the rise in prices  certainly affected their economic expansion  accelerated their inflationary processes and disrupted their way of life; but the countries hardest hit by those measures are those of the third world  which are finding it extremely difficult to pay for their oil-based energy needs and  because of generalized inflation  even more difficult to purchase the capital goods they need.10.	All these facts indicate the interrelationship between political and economic questions and the interdependence of peoples. They impose the need for global co-operation in order to minimize the horrors of this generalized economic crisis and to satisfy the aspirations of all men for well-being  social justice and peace.11.	Besides these grave problems  which are essentially economic  conflicts and upheavals of every kind continue to endanger international security. The Government of Haiti  aware of the threat to mankind of these so-called localized tensions  renews its dedication to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  where it is always possible to find solutions to the questions on our agenda. We reaffirm our confidence in the wisdom and reason of representatives attending this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly and invite all parties concerned to negotiate with a view to removing the causes of their resentments and to settling their disputes.12.	Many no less serious political problems were satisfactorily solved  enabling this Assembly to welcome the delegations of Bangladesh  Grenada  and Guinea- Bissau  to whom we extend our warmest welcome. The delegation of Haiti especially welcomes the representatives of Grenada  and we transmit to them the wishes of the people and Government of Haiti for the prosperity and well-being of that new State now in a position to enhance the prospects for harmony in the Caribbean region.13.	My delegation is happy to express once again the sense of brotherhood and solidarity of the people and Government of Haiti for the people and Government of Guinea-Bissau  whose independence  acquired at the cost of great sacrifices  brings to mind -170 years later- the struggle waged by Africans to create the State of Haiti. The delegation of Haiti  in welcoming Guinea-Bissau  is naturally thinking of the destiny of the populations of Angola  Mozambique  Namibia and Rhodesia. We welcome with satisfaction the happy outcome of the situation in Mozambique  which will become independent in June 1975  and we hope that the same will occur with Angola.14.	As regards the populations of Namibia and Rhodesia  still the victims of neocolonialism and of racial discrimination  we convey to them the sympathies of the people and Government of Haiti  who are convinced that their courage and steadfastness will oust from their territory the last vestiges of an outmoded era.15.	It is a truism to say that international problems reflect the internal situation of States. Thus  the President for life of the Republic of Haiti  Mr. Jean- Claude Duvalier  being aware of his national and international responsibilities  has adopted a series of measures to guarantee both social peace and the harmonious development of the nation. In order to ensure control over the development of our natural resources  certain contracts are being revised; monopolies granted to private companies working in key sectors of the national economy are now being reconsidered whereas tax exemptions are granted to encourage agricultural production and the establishment of industrial units.16.	These reforms  which proved to be essential to economic recovery  will be followed by the establishment of new administrative structures now under consideration. These will bolster the efforts made in the economic and fiscal fields/Tin this vast undertaking  the Government of Haiti is happy to have received moral support and financial and technical assistance from many friendly Governments which have recognized the humanitarian nature of the political and economic changes brought about to promote the social well-being of the people of Haiti.17.	It remains for us to hope that international financing organizations will manage to simplify their procedures for granting assistance so as to give practical effect to the resolutions adopted for the benefit of the economically least endowed countries in the world. For now more than ever before  as the Secretary-General has stated  the international community faces difficulties that are so complex that ""no nations  however rich or powerful  can remain immune  and which no nation can hope to confront and resolve successfully on its own."" [See A/9601/Add. 1  sect. /.]18.	The appeal of the Secretary-General for agreement and co-operation deserves to be heard and borne in mind so that mankind may be able to face present problems successfully and ensure its future. This is the hope of the delegation of Haiti on the occasion of this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly."
"56",3089,"HUN",29,1974,"I should like to extend to Mr. Bouteflika my cordial greetings and warm congratulations upon his election as President of the General Assembly. This is an expression of the greatest esteem which the peoples of the world have for his country  the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria find for its representative. I am certain that under the guidance of that experienced statesman  this session of the General Assembly will contribute to the strengthening of peace and security and the settlement of yet unsolved problems.88.	The general debate of the Assembly is drawing to a close. This makes the situation of those taking the floor now much easier; we agree with a good many of the statements made during the debate and we feel that it is needless to speak of every question in detail.89.	The views of my Government regarding current problems of the international situation are plainly expressed in the Hungarian-Soviet joint communique following the recent highly successful visit to theSoviet Union by a Hungarian Party and Government delegation headed by Janos Kadar.90.	In the judgment of my Government  the inter-national atmosphere has considerably improved  and detente has become a main trend of international life. It cannot be overlooked at the same time that attempts are being made to slow down and even to stop this favorable development.91.	The General Assembly debate has so far demonstrated that in the process of detente a great part is being played by the improved bilateral relations between the. socialist and the developed capitalist countries  especially the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. The meetings of the leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States have been significant not merely from the point of view of relations between the two countries  but also because they have promoted the solution of highly important international problems. We note with satisfaction that Gerald Ford  the new President of the United States  has also come out in favor of the policy of peaceful co-existence. We hope that co-operation between socialist and capitalist countries will continue for the sake of detente and in order to bring about a solution of international problems.92.	The people of my country have been following with particular interest everything related to the strengthening of peace and security in Europe  because the development of the situation in Europe is of paramount importance to peace of the whole world. The improvement of the situation in Europe has been substantially advanced by the fact that countries of the capitalist world have acknowledged the situation established after the Second World War  by recognizing the German Democratic Republic in terms of international law  and also by the fact that it has become possible to normalize relationships between the European socialist countries and the Federal Republic of Germany. However  one cannot leave out of account the fact that some reactionary forces attack the practice of co-operation with the socialist countries and have been calling into question the equal rights of the German Democratic Republic and violating the four-Power Agreement on West Berlin. All of this is playing into the hands of the opponents of detente.93.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is still working in Geneva. The holding of the conference and the prospective results of its work can be appraised as a significant contribution to the strengthening of international security which  under the Charter  is the principal task of the United Nations.94.	However  the Conference has had to cope with serious difficulties and still has difficulties ahead of it. Some delegations want to divert attention from the basic problems of security and co-operation to secondary issues. In our opinion  there is not a single problem before the Conference to which it would be impossible to find a solution acceptable to all participants. For that very reason we hope that the second stage of the Conference will very soon conclude its work and that the third stage can open at the highest level.95.	The favorable trend in the European situation is overshadowed by the events in Cyprus. The extremist circles of NATO have long been striving to bring Cyprus in one way or another under their influence and to establish military bases on that island. They are now trying to divide the island country. In contempt of the Security Council resolutions  they are seeking to impose a ""solution"" that will  essentially  exclude the people of Cyprus from any discussion concerning it.96.	My Government condemns the flagrant violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We have from the very beginning advocated the restoration of the right of the legitimate Government of Cyprus  the implementation of the Security Council resolutions on Cyprus  and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. Respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the non-aligned State of Cyprus must be ensured.97.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic fully agrees with the proposal of the Soviet Union that an international conference be convened under the auspices of the United Nations to work out proposals for guaranteeing the independent existence of Cyprus. The United Nations should also do its utmost to make sure that the problem is resolved as soon as possible. It is in this spirit that my delegation has supported the inclusion of the question of Cyprus in the agenda and will take part in its discussion.98.	Favorable events have been occurring in Europe also. According to all indications  the Portuguese Government is breaking with the shameful past and wishes to participate in international co-operation. In Greece  the military junta that had engineered the coup in Cyprus has collapsed. The first statements and acts of the new Greek Government indicate a positive change in the foreign policy of Greece. We welcome that trend.99.	More than a year and a half has elapsed since the signing of the document entitled ""Agreement on ending the war and restoring peace in Viet Nam""  signed in Paris on 27 January 1973. Certain auspicious steps have been taken in implementation of this historically important Agreement  but several provisions still remain unfulfilled. Since January 1973  because of the unceasing offensive operations of the Saigon army  the guns have been silent for hardly a minute in South Viet Nam; action follows upon action to seize new territories; the Saigon army burns down villages  compels thousands of people to abandon their homes  and keeps tens of thousands languishing in its jails.100.	The International Commission for Control and Supervision has for months been reduced to inaction. The Saigon Administration refuses to grant to the military delegation in Saigon of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam the immunities and privileges which are indispensable for normal work and which are defined in the Paris agreement and recognized in international diplomatic practice. In such circumstances  the Joint Military Commission of the two sides is incapable of working  and consequently the normal activity of the Inter-national Commission for Control and Supervision lacks juridical foundations and practical guarantees.101.	On the other hand  the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam is taking initiatives in an effort to carry out fully the provisions of the Paris agreement  as is made clear in its six-point proposal made public on 22 March 1974.102.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic emphatically condemns the schemings of the Saigon Administration and the external forces backing it  and demands that all provisions of the Paris agreement be put into effect without delay. We think the United Nations should deal with the South Vietnamese signatories on a footing of equality. It should make sure that the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam is granted the status of observer at the United Nations.103.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic has been pleased at the progress made in the Laos settlement. As far as Cambodia is concerned  my Government supports the struggle of the patriots against the Lon Nol regime which has usurped power in that country. We are of the opinion that Cambodia can be lawfully represented in the United Nations only by a delegation of the Royal Government of National Union.104.	As regards the conflict in the Middle East  only initial steps have been taken towards a comprehensive and just settlement. We  for our part  highly appreciate all positive steps to bring about a settlement in the Middle East  regardless of which country may initiate them. But we condemn the attempts being made to freeze the present situation  to postpone any settlement and to maintain tension in the Middle East. We have good reason to suspect that there are some who are striving to torpedo the Geneva Peace Conference. We know from a statement by the Prime Minister of Israel that the Israeli Government is against any multilateral talks; that instead  in an effort to split the ranks of the Arab countries  it wishes to hold bilateral conversations. It seeks to enforce all this by continued arming and. even by armed provocations. In this they are playing with fire  which is a very dangerous game. If such machinations continue  a renewed outbreak of fighting in the Middle East cannot be ruled out. The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic condemns the actions of Israel and its disregard of the resolutions of the Security Council.105.	A major aspect of the Middle East problem is the safeguarding of the national rights of the Arab people of Palestine. My Government is one of those that have advocated discussion of the Palestine problem as a separate item of our agenda. We hope that this debate will bring us closer to a solution.106.	A just settlement is also being impeded by the efforts of international reaction to drive a wedge be-tween the Arab countries and their sincere friends  the socialist countries. However  the Middle East crisis cannot be resolved without the participation of the socialist countries. Those who are against this really want to impede the achievement of any settlement. We think that the forces seeking a lasting and just peace in the Middle East must demand an immediate resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference  because that is the most appropriate forum  in the present circumstances  for working out the ways and means for achieving a solution.107.	The Hungarian Government has joined the sponsors of subitem (a) on the question of Korea entitled ""Withdrawal of all the foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations"". My Government supports the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea towards the peaceful unification of the country. It hopes that the United Nations will also do its share  that it will not tolerate any further abuse of its flag after a quarter of a century  and that it also will get all foreign troops withdrawn as soon as possible.108.	To judge from the example of efforts to establish a security system in Europe  it would be useful if action were taken also in other areas of the world to guarantee the security of peoples living there. It would be of particularly high importance in this respect for the proposal of the Soviet Union for a collective security system in Asia to be implemented.109.	The Hungarian people have a profound under-standing of the feelings of peoples fighting for their national independence. We are glad that after long struggles the colonies of Portugal are now winning their independence. However  we must not forget that there are still many peoples living in colonial situations and fighting for their freedom. Racial discrimination still prevails in many territories. It is the duty of the United Nations to assist those peoples in their struggle for liberation and in the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination.110.	It is heartening that the views of most Latin American countries on several important issues of our day coincide with or are close to the views of the socialist countries and the progressive non-aligned nations. A growing number of Latin American countries are normalizing their relations with socialist Cuba and taking an increasingly resolute stand for the repeal of discriminatory measures and in defense of their independence and sovereignty.111.	A year ago  the lawful Government of Popular Unity in Chile was overthrown by a Fascist military junta. Although the military dictatorship has gone to every conceivable length to consolidate its position  it has been unsuccessful. A mass manhunt is still going on for followers of the lawful Government and for democratically minded Chileans; many innocent people are sent to prison  to concentration camps  or are brought before the firing squads  which carry out death sentences. Governments  organizations and movements all over the world and millions of ordinary people have raised their voices in protest against the brutality of the Chilean junta. My Government and the entire Hungarian people condemn the Chilean military junta and demand that it put a stop to this bloody terror and release imprisoned innocent patriots. There can be no doubt that the junta has not only caused irreparable damage to the Chilean people but has also been instrumental in hampering the process of international detente.112.	The events of international life have indicated that political detente has made considerable progress. But political detente must be completed by military detente  since only in this way can it be made durable and stable. It is of capital importance that the arms race should be slowed down and ultimately stopped altogether. A few important steps have been taken in this field as well. The agreements between the Governments of the Soviet Union and the United States on the limitation of strategic arms are an auspicious start. My Government is looking forward to further results from the relevant Soviet-United States talks.113.	Both the General Assembly and other inter-national forums have quite rightly paid particular attention to the subject of nuclear disarmament  including the definitive prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  as well as the renunciation of the use and threat of force. Strict compliance with the obligations assumed under resolution 2936 (XXVII) adopted by the General Assembly could be a significant contribution to the strengthening of peace.114.	At the sixth special session  the importance has yet again been confirmed of resolution 3093 (XXVIII)  adopted at the last session on the initiative of the Soviet Union and calling for a 10 per cent reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council. With this recent initiative  the Soviet Government has directed the attention of the General Assembly and of world public opinion to a problem which  if left unsolved  could entail almost unimaginable consequences  threatening the human environment and even the sound development of mankind as a whole. We are confident that the good will and the active support of Member States will make it possible to work out without any delay an international convention on the prohibition of action to influence the human environment for military purposes.115.	The Hungarian Government continues to believe it necessary that the proposal for the convening of a world disarmament conference should *be implemented at the earliest possible date. The Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has completed its work. Its report [A19628] has been drafted and submitted to the General Assembly. During the debate on the issue  the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations stated their opinions and only a few of them opposed the convening of the conference. We believe that the time has come to take concrete action in this respect.116.	At the Vienna negotiations on mutual reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe  certain NATO circles have been disregarding the principle of equal security  which they themselves accepted  and wish to gain unilateral advantages at the expense of States members of the Warsaw Pact. Of course  this delays the process of arriving at an agreement. An agreement on this question would be important  as it would contribute to the further improvement of the European political atmosphere and would open the way to the conclusion of similar agreements concerning other regions of Europe. '117.	At its sixth special session on raw materials and development  the General Assembly took a great step forward by trying to give a comprehensive picture of the problems of international economic relations and by working out measures designed to solve those problems. I wish to state here that the Hungarian Government is prepared to co-operate in the implementation of measures approved at the sixth special session.118.	In my statement  I have had to speak also about dangers threatening the spread of international detente. We are convinced  however  that the process of detente cannot now be obstructed for long. Powerful forces are in favor of peace  security and a closer co-operation among the peoples the socialist community  the national liberation movements  the developing countries which have followed the road of progress  the non-aligned countries and the peace-loving working people of developed capitalist countries. The policy of those leaders of developed capitalist States who have taken into account the realities of today's world is also very important. We have no doubt whatsoever that the combination of these social factors will make the process of detente irreversible. Consequently  we most certainly do not share the view that detente is a transitional phenomenon and that it has now come to an end. This kind of propaganda is meant to serve certain well-known negative aims.119.	The statement by the representative of the People's Republic of China in the general debate [2252nd meeting] is an indication that there has been no change in the Chinese position. The Chinese representative has again cast aspersions on the Soviet Union and on forces advocating progress and socialism  and he has no constructive proposal to make. It is today clear to all that this attitude plays into the hands of the enemies of international detente.120.	The Government of the Hungarian People's Republic fulfills the wishes of its people when  together with the other countries of the socialist community  it participates in efforts aimed at the strengthening of international peace and security. My Government lays great stress on the development of bilateral relations between the Hungarian People's Republic and countries with different social systems. We attach especially great importance to the development of economic ties  for it is precisely good economic co-operation that can serve as the most solid basis for sound relations in all other fields. My Government strives to ensure that the discriminatory obstacles impeding the development of economic relations will be removed.121.	The representatives of the Hungarian People's Republic have been displaying considerable activity at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  at the Vienna negotiations on mutual reduction of armed forces  at the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and elsewhere. Everywhere they have been active in a spirit of mutual understanding and have been working to reach agreement without delay.122.	The Hungarian People's Republic complied with a request from the parties directly involved in the Viet Nam conflict when it undertook to become a member of the International Commission for Control and Supervision. It was guided by a sincere desire to promote  in close co-operation with the three other members of the Commission  the implementation of the provisions of the Paris agreement  out of a desire to contribute to the restoration of peace in South Viet Nam. It is firmly determined to serve these aims and not to bow to any pressure applied to it to make it divert from this course.123.	The Hungarian People's Republic maintains friendly relations with the Arab States fighting for their just cause. We are their friends and stand by them in their struggle in defense of their freedom and independence  as well as in times of peaceful construction.124.	My Government takes a very favorable view of the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries  and notes that it stands up ever more consistently against the enemies of the independence of developing countries  and of peace and progress  and against imperialism and its allies. Hungary supports the progressive efforts of the non-aligned movement.125.	As can be seen from my statement  in the recent past the role and importance of the United Nations have increased. This is essentially because the Organization has reached a stage of its development at which it can already play a positive role in promoting the political settlement of conflicts that threaten to lead to a crisis.126.	The Hungarian People's Republic supports those initiatives which are taken with a view to putting into effect the purposes defined in the Charter  but we are opposed to such proposals  for example  as the revision of the Charter  as it would entail a decline in the effectiveness of the United Nations.127.	In conclusion  I wish to extend  on behalf of my Government  our greetings of welcome to the de-legations of two new States Members of the United Nations  the People's Republic of Bangladesh and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. From the very outset  my Government has supported the claim to membership in the United Nations of those two States which were born in a struggle for liberation  and it has not hesitated to recognize them as independent sovereign States. We are certain that their participation in the work of the United Nations will be most useful.128.	I also greet the representatives of the newest member of the Latin American group  Grenada  and I wish their country prosperity."
"57",3136,"IDN",29,1974,"Mr. President  I am profoundly pleased and privileged to offer you the sincere congratulations of Indonesia's delegation upon your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your statesmanship and your untiring efforts and well-known accomplishments in the cause of peace and a more equitable world order are justly recognized throughout the international community. We are confident therefore that  although the problems before this Assembly are grave and many  we will  under your guidance  be able to find satisfactory answers to them. The fact that you have been called upon to serve in this post of distinction at the present moment gives my delegation added satisfaction  for we see in you not only an eminent son of Africa and of the Arab nation but also one of the outstanding leaders of the non-aligned world as well. At a time of great opportunity as well as oT great challenge  the non- aligned countries have an important role to play in the promotion of global peace  progress and prosperity. It seems to my delegation most appropriate that these forces for peace and progress are exemplified in the person of the President of the General Assembly.2.	My delegation would also like to take this opportunity to convey its deep appreciation to the outgoing President  the representative of Ecuador  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who has shown admirable qualities of leadership in a period marked by momentous events.3.	It is with great satisfaction that my delegation welcomes the new Members of the Organization. Representing a country situated so close to southern Asia  my delegation takes special pleasure in welcoming Bangladesh to membership in the United Nations. The admission of this new State manifests a further step in the efforts to heal the wounds of war and strife in the recent history of the region and  it is to be hoped  marks the beginning of an era no longer plagued by enmity and distrust but characterized by friendly relations and close co-operation.4.	I would further like to welcome Grenada as a fellow Member in our midst. My delegation is convinced that Grenada's commitment to the principles of the Charter and the goals of the United Nations will enable it to play a significant role in the work of our Organization.5.	Our warm welcome also goes to Guinea-Bissau upon its admission to the United Nations  as we greeted with equal joy its berth as an independent nation on 24 September 1973. The process leading to the independence of Guinea-Bissau was a long and arduous one  spanning almost twp decades of political struggle and 10 years of uninterrupted and determined armed struggle. Guinea-Bissau's entry now as a full-fledged partner in the work of the Organization for global peace and progress cannot but be greeted with deep satisfaction.6.	My delegation expects that before long we shall also have the pleasure of welcoming Mozambique and Angola as Members of the Organization.7.	In expressing our satisfaction at the admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations  we in Indonesia welcome the recent changes in Portugal's policy vis-a-vis the colonial Territories under its administration. A new page has now been opened in the history of Portugal's relations not only with those Territories but also with the continents of Africa and Asia and with all freedom-loving peoples in the world. This development indeed constitutes a beacon of hope for all those who are still fettered by the bonds of colonialism  apartheid and racism. But until all peoples who are still denied their inalienable rights to self-determination achieve their rightful place in the world community  the United Nations should not slacken its efforts to further the process of decolonization.8.	The past year has witnessed profound political  economic  social and technological developments which have themselves caused fundamental changes in relations among nations and peoples. As I have just remarked  it has been a year notable both for its great challenges and for its great opportunities.9.	On the one hand  the international community has been confronted with problems of a magnitude and complexity unprecedented in our experience; on the other hand  these very conditions have offered unique opportunities to the Organization and to the world at large. If we possess the necessary vision and courage and  above all  the required political will  we may yet utilize these opportunities in order to lay the foundations of new economic and political relationships that would move the world closer towards the establishment of a more just and more durable order and towards a more equitable distribution of the world's wealth.10.	The need for change in the character of inter-national relations is now universally recognized. It is clear  however  that as to the nature and the timing of such change  as well as with regard to the modalities of achieving it  wide differences of opinion still exist within the international community.11.	Concurrent with the recognition of the need for change  there is a growing awareness that the problems now confronting the world cannot be resolved by any single nation or group of nations acting on its own; they can be overcome only by the joint efforts of the entire world community which recognizes that global interdependence requires global cooperation.12.	One encouraging result of this new awareness is that the United Nations has been called upon to play an ever-expanding role as the organ of the inter-national community best suited to dealing with the problems created by our increasing interdependence. Thus it may be useful to take this occasion to scrutinize the record of the Organization over the past year and to evaluate the manner in which the United Nations has exercised its growing role in the new international situation.13.	One of the gravest challenges posed to the Organization last year was how to cope with the renewed outbreak of full-scale hostilities in the Middle East  which again jolted the world dangerously close to the brink of global conflict.14.	My delegation is satisfied that the United Nations proved itself capable of meeting that challenge. The substantial role that the United Nations played in establishing the cease-fire in the Middle East and in arranging the troop disengagement agreements in the Sinai and on the Golan Heights is generally recognized. The Organization was equally instrumental in the creation of the United Nations Emergency Force  which has enabled it to act firmly in maintaining the cease-fire. And it is a particular honor for Indonesia to be able to contribute a contingent to the Force at the request of the Security Council.15.	While we may thus be reasonably satisfied with the role that the United Nations has played and will continue to play in the Middle East  my delegation must reiterate its view that unless the root-causes of the Arab-Israeli conflict are removed and until some fundamental requisites are met  no lasting peace can be achieved in that troubled region.16.	An integral and just solution of the Middle East problem can be achieved only if all relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions are implemented consistently. Israeli aggression must be terminated and all Arab territories occupied since 1967 must revert back to their lawful owners. The Holy City of Jerusalem must be returned to Arab custody and Israel must rescind all measures it has taken to alter the status and character of that City. Furthermore  my delegation is convinced that the Middle East will remain an arena of conflict and bloodshed as long as the Palestinian people are denied their fundamental rights  including the right to self-determination.17.	Indonesia is encouraged by the prospect of peace that has been opened by the Geneva negotiations. But whatever success these negotiations may achieve in all other fields  a satisfactory solution of the Palestinian aspect of the problem will remain a condition sine qua non for the return of a stable peace in the Middle East. The participation of Palestinian representatives in all talks affecting their future is  therefore  a matter of great importance.18.	It is with these considerations in mind that Indonesia joined many other delegations in proposing that the item entitled ""Question of Palestine"" be included in the agenda of this session [AI9742 and Add. I-4}.19.	Hardly had the initial foundations been laid for a peaceful solution of the Middle East problem when another challenge presented itself before the Organization. In July this year the world was startled by the coup d'etat against President Makarios of Cyprus. This event  and the Turkish intervention which followed  has given the Cyprus problem a dangerous dimension.20.	What we see in Cyprus is the tragedy of two communities compelled by realities to live together but unable to agree among themselves how to do so in peace and harmony. In their implications  how-ever  the recent developments in Cyprus go beyond the unhappy fate that has befallen its two communities  as these developments not only imperil the independence and territorial integrity of that country but also pose a serious threat to the peace and security of the Mediterranean region.21.	My delegation is deeply aware of the complexities of the problem and of its long and bitter political background. It is not easy  nor is it necessary  to try to apportion the blame to one or the other party  as the two communities must continue to live together. What is of cardinal importance now is to get all parties concerned back to the negotiating table to create conditions in which it will be possible for the people of Cyprus themselves to determine their future.22.	Indonesia holds the view that Cyprus should remain an independent  sovereign and non-aligned country. A new constitutional framework should be worked out that can guarantee the rights of each community and enable them to live in harmony with one another  so that a true Cypriot national identity may develop.23.	Allow me now to turn to a conflict in a region nearer to Indonesia. I refer to the ongoing war and bloodshed in IndoChina. The peoples of Asia and  for that matter  people all over the world are gravely concerned that  almost two years after the signing of the Paris agreement  peace still proves elusive in Viet Nam. This agreement could provide a basis for resolving the long and bitter conflict  which in its toll of human lives and material damage far exceeds the magnitude of either the Middle East or the Cyprus conflict. My delegation notes with regret  however  that there is as yet little evidence of the necessary goodwill of the parties directly concerned to implement the agreement  especially that part providing for a political settlement. Thus the situation is allowed to deteriorate  increasing the likelihood of full-scale war again breaking out in Viet Nam.24.	Indonesia has been in a position to make a modest contribution to the efforts to implement the Paris agreement on Viet Nam through its membership in the International Commission of Control and Supervision. Indonesia will continue to serve in the Commission as long as it thinks that its participation can indeed contribute to the restoration of genuine peace in Viet Nam.25.	In the same way  the tragic situation in the Khmer Republic is a source of deep concern to Indonesia. The sacrifices in human lives and suffering which this conflict has exacted  as well as its potential to cause wider instability in the region  make us fervently hope that a peaceful solution to this problem will be achieved through negotiations among the contending factions of the Khmer people themselves. The way in which this problem is now being presented to the Assembly  therefore  cat es the greatest misgivings to my delegation.26.	It remains Indonesia's considered view that the Khmer people should be given the opportunity to resolve their own problems in peace  free from out-side intervention or imposition  and to decide for themselves the leadership they want and the system of government under which they choose to live.27.	We are against the idea cf the imposition of a government and a leadership on the Khmer people by the United Nations. We would fully support United Nations intervention in the Khmer problem  however  if indeed such intervention would lead to the ending of the fighting among the Khmers and to a peaceful overall solution.28.	We are convinced that to impose a leadership and a government on the Khmer people by United Nations resolution will not bring about a solution to the conflict  will not end the fighting and the blood-shed among the Khmers  but will  on the contrary  intensify and prolong them. Thus  it would be a tragic irony indeed if the United Nations  after so many years of non-involvement in IndoChina  now suddenly decided to intervene  not to bring peace but  in effect  to encourage and prolong conflict and bloodshed among the Khmers.29.	If the United Nations is to take action  then to my delegation's view  it would  be more in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter if the General Assembly were to appeal to the contending parties to stop the fighting and start negotiations for a peaceful solution acceptable to all the Khmer people. In this connexion  I would like to refer to the offer made on 9 July 1974 by the Government of the Khmer Republic in Phnom Penh  to start negotiations  with no preconditions and with any representative of the Khmers on the other side  in order to find a peaceful solution to their conflict and end the killing among brothers. My delegation believes that this offer should be welcomed by the Assembly as one fully in conformity with the spirit of all United Nations endeavors to seek peaceful solutions to problems through negotiation.30.	Allow me now to reiterate briefly my Government's position with regard to the question of national leadership in Cambodia.31.	We have nothing against Prince Sihanouk or the so-called ""Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia"". In fact  the Indonesian people respect Prince Sihanouk for his role in the struggle of the Khmer people for independence and sovereignty. But the Khmer Parliament his own Parliament elected by the Khmer people in accordance with the Khmer Constitution  deposed him  and he is now making his claim to national leadership as an exile  from the capital of a foreign country.32.	As a matter of principle  Indonesia is against the recognition of a government-in-exile as long as there exists in the country itself a national government which is lawfully established and accepted by the people on the basis of their own constitutional processes.33.	If the Assembly were to embark upon recognition of such regimes in exile this would not only be tantamount to interfering in the domestic jurisdiction of a State but would indeed set a precedent which would endanger the very structure of the United Nations. Today this question concerns the Khmer Republic; tomorrow it may concern another country  perhaps one of those which now support the idea of recognizing a regime in exile because of feelings of solidarity with a person or a group representing certain political beliefs or because of emotional considerations. I would strongly suggest  therefore  that the choice be allowed to remain with the people and that the United Nations not be permitted to introduce the practice of imposing a government upon a people.34.	Ranging further afield in the Asian region  my delegation notes with regret that in the two years following the joint communique of 4 July 1972 issued by the Governments of North Korea and South Korea  the dialog between them has achieved little progress. Prospects for reconciliation have been further diminished now that this dialog has been indefinitely suspended. We believe that it would be useful for both sides to resume their interrupted dialog at an early date and exert renewed efforts to implement the principles enunciated in their joint communique.35.	This year the Assembly is again considering the question of Korea. My delegation agrees with the view that the United Nations should end its military presence in Korea. It is indeed high time that the state of war which still formally exists between the United Nations and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was terminated. However  as the United Nations military involvement in Korea is based upon a Security Council resolution  it is the view of my delegation that the Assembly should request the Security Council to take promptly the necessary action for the termination of such United Nations military presence. At the same time  my delegation thinks that an alternative machinery should be found to guarantee the continuation of the cease-fire along the armistice line  and that the United Nations should assist  in whatever way is possible  in the efforts of both parts of Korea to achieve reunification through peaceful negotiations.36.	As far as the presence of foreign troops in a country is concerned  it has always been Indonesia's conviction that such presence will not contribute to peace and security. As for ourselves  we cannot accept the presence of foreign troops or foreign military bases on our country's territory. However  every sovereign State has the right to conclude bilateral agreements with other States to allow such presence on its territory for national defense purposes  and as long as it is not directed against another State.37.	If there are focal points of crisis on the Asian scene  there is also a brighter side to the picture.38.	It is with great satisfaction that Indonesia welcomes the formation of the Provisional Government of National Union in Laos. We hope that this achievement will usher in an era of peace and stability in a country that has been a bitter battleground for more than 20 years. We also hope that these developments in Laos will equally contribute to the improvement of the political climate in the region  and serve as an example worthy of emulation by contending parties in other parts of IndoChina.39.	Recent developments in South Asia have  as I remarked earlier  opened a new chapter in the political history of that region. Thanks to the statesmanship displayed by the leaders of India  Pakistan and Bangladesh  the door is open to a new era of greater peace  mutual co-operation and understanding.40.	It is with particular satisfaction that my delegation refers to the developments in South-East Asia  specifically with regard to the efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] to foster more effective regional co-operation. Whereas ASEAN was initially founded to promote economic  technical and cultural co-operation  it has also provided the opportunity to the member countries to deal with political aspects- of regional problems as well. We are pleased to note that these activities have led to the development of increasingly closer patterns of co-operation  which in turn have strengthened the Association as a whole  making it more viable and meaningful to its members. Last year's decision to establish a permanent ASEAN secretariat in Jakarta is another logical step forward in the Association's efforts to consolidate its gains  and to give greater coherence to ASEAN.41.	As part of this policy of devoting our efforts and resources to the economic betterment of our nation in conditions of peace and tranquility  Indonesia  together with other nations in the region  has consistently endeavored to maintain the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace  free from great-Power rivalry and military escalation. To this end  Indonesia has given active support to Sri Lanka's initiatives concerning the Indian Ocean as well as to the relevant United Nations resolutions on this important issue. However  much remains to be done if this idea is to materialize.42.	It is with deep concern that my delegation views the increasing military presence of the great Powers in the region of the Indian Ocean  which poses a serious setback to the efforts of the nations of the area to keep great-Power arms rivalry out of the Indian Ocean.43.	We should like to urge the great Powers concerned not to continue on their path of arms com-petition in the Indian Ocean  as the pursuit of such a path will endanger the peace and tranquility not only of the area  but of the whole world.44.	The international community has been seized for a long period with the problem of establishing a new regime of the sea  one which will not only guarantee the sound management and equitable distribution of the ocean'.s wealth  but which will also accommodate the diverse and conflicting national interests created by existing outdated rules of the law of the sea or by the existence of legal vacuums. As an archipelagic State  Indonesia  by virtue of its geographical composition  attaches the greatest importance to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. This composition brings with it special needs and imperatives relating to the maintenance of Indonesia's national sovereignty  political unity and territorial integrity. At the same time it also entails special responsibilities relating to the interests of the international community  responsibilities 'which the Government of Indonesia has always been willing to shoulder and to discharge  now and in the future.45.	Indonesia expects  on the other hand  that other States  especially those which  on the basis of previous practice  are enjoying a privileged position in the use of the seas  will adapt themselves to the changes that have taken place and are now taking place in the world. The issues involved in a reformulation of the law of the sea should be approached on the basis of sovereign equality and equity and not on those Of power relationships  either economic or military.46.	While noteworthy and encouraging progress has been recorded in several fields in the political sphere  it is dismaying to find that this is not matched with commensurate progress in the field of economic and social development.47.	The picture here is one of gloom and pessimism. In this respect  the world is still starkly divided be-tween developing and developed countries. And it is becoming abundantly clear that  despite strenuous efforts to reverse the trend  the gap between the developing and the developed countries continues to widen with each passing year while the burden of international poverty is increasing rather than declining.48.	This is certainly not a new subject. But it will continue to be raised at every opportunity  not only to demonstrate our concern and anxiety  but also to underscore the point that such an imbalance in international economic growth cannot be conducive to a peaceful  stable and just world order.49.	The series of global crises  thoroughly exposed and analyzed during the sixth special session of the General Assembly last May  has thrust into prominence the inescapable reality of interdependence among nations  the inter-connexion of problems and the necessity of joint and concerted action to solve them.50.	The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-Vl)]  together with the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)]  adopted by the special session  provide us with a broad framework for concerted action to help rectify the inequities and injustices of the present economic system.51.	The world cannot continue to be apathetic or unresponsive to the basic problems of the developing countries which are facing inadequate food supplies  rapid population growth  unemployment  sharp price increases of capital goods badly needed for development  and technological backwardness.52.	As regards the food problem  the assessment of the world food situation clearly shows that  unless effective actions are taken quickly  the food crisis will soon assume catastrophic proportions particularly affecting the developing countries. The forth-coming World Food Conference  therefore  should  in our view  agree on an effective program of action  comprising co-ordinated international efforts to secure the flow of food aid and provide for world food security and a long-term world food policy. Such a program should lead to a fundamental remedy of recurrent world food scarcity  inter alia  by increasing food production in the developing countries.53.	Closely connected with the problem of food is the problem of rapid population growth in a great number of developing countries. The convening of the World Population Conference in Bucharest last August is testimony to the universal recognition that the population problems faced by many countries are problems of world-wide magnitude and concern which require concerted national and international actions to achieve their solutions.54.	The World Population Conference adopted a World Population Plan of Action as a constituent part of overall economic and social development policies. This Plan of Action has underlined the fact that whatever population policy is pursued  rapid population growth in the years to come necessitates an acceleration of economic and social development through a more just utilization of resources  capital and technology  in the spirit of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.""55.	The efforts to expand and diversify markets for the commodities  semi-manufactured and manufactured products of the developing countries continue to be adversely affected by world-wide inflation and recurrent international monetary instability  at a time when there is urgent need for increased export earnings and enlarged employment opportunities. The multilateral trade negotiations which are designed to give a new impetus to ever greater liberalizatioiTof trade and the improvement of the international framework for the conduct of world trade have not even begun. The decline of official development assistance to developing countries has further affected efforts for the sustained economic and social development of these countries.56.	It is essential  therefore  that substantial progress also be made in these vital areas of trade and development assistance which are crucial to the efforts to establish a new world economic order. In this context  in the interest of both the developed and developing countries  we earnestly hope that the developed countries could display the required political will by removing whatever reservations they may still have in order to enable the speedy implementation of the Declaration and the Program of Action. Only in this way and by collective efforts on the part of both developed and developing countries can we move toward a more just  more prosperous and more secure world.57.	The draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which will be considered under agenda item 482 and which is still being negotiated at present  will certainly enhance the realization of the new economic order. It is to be hoped that these negotiations will be concluded successfully to enable the timely submission of the draft to this session of the General Assembly for consideration and adoption. The adoption of this Charter will  we believe  also facilitate the work of the proposed institutional machinery to deal with transnational corporations  whose role and activities exercise an increasingly important bearing on international relations.58.	The whole process of restructuring the present economic system will culminate in September 1975 in the seventh special session of the General Assembly  which will be devoted solely to development and international economic co-operation. All of us have a vital stake in the success of that session and all efforts should therefore be made to enable it to contribute fully to the establishment of the new international economic order.59.	The Indonesian delegation is also looking for-ward to the successful conclusion of the mid-term review of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  to be held in April 1975. The findings and conclusions of this review will be of particular importance to the smooth conduct of our deliberations in the forthcoming special session.60.	There should also be no doubt that this special session will take into account the results of the World Population Conference  the World Food Conference  the multilateral trade negotiations within the frame-work of GATT and the Second General Conference of UNIDO  all of which have an important bearing on the realization of the new international economic order.61.	The successful conclusion of the special session will undoubtedly have a positive effect on our efforts to reach agreement at the fourth session of UNCTAD on the new approaches now being initiated by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD in the important areas of commodities  financial and technical co-operation  economic co-operation among the developing countries and transfer of technology.62.	Within the current changing international situation it is worth while noting two developments which will determine in a significant wry the stability and resilience of Indonesia in particular and the region of South-East Asia in general during the second half of this- decade. I refer to Indonesia's second development plan and to the co-operation of the nations of South-East Asia within the framework of ASEAN..63.	Our second five-year development plan  which started in April 1974  is a continuation and acceleration of the development efforts made during the first five-year development plan. In the second plan  increased food production  the development of agro-allied industries and infrastructure remain the central points of our development strategy. Increased efforts will be made towards accelerating growth in the production of natural resources  including mineral products. The benefits to be derived from those sectors will  we believe  contribute significantly to an increase in domestic products and to the easing of foreign-exchange constraints on development  as well as to the creation of new employment opportunities. That  in turn  will induce a better distribution of wealth and income.64.	In attaining our national development objectives  natural resources will therefore be optimally exploited consistent with the preservation of environmental conditions and the protection of the interests of future generations. The involvement of the people in the development process and in social welfare development will also become focal points of our second development plan.65.	AH those activities will need huge funds  far greater than before  in order to increase the momentum of development and to enable us to improve the standard of living of the people. It is the policy of the Indonesian Government  therefore  to direct all efforts to the maximum extent possible towards mobilizing its financial resources for development  including its domestic resources  and at the same time towards increasing export earnings.66.	The magnitude of Indonesia's development efforts is exemplified by the fact that Indonesia's per capita income still falls in the lowest income brackets on the international scale  due to the size of our population and its high growth rate. That fact has necessitated substantial food imports  which continue to exert a considerable drain on our foreign- exchange reserves. By way of illustration  despite steady increases in our food production  our annual imports of rice and fertilizers remain on the order of $US 1 500 million. The recent favorable development in Indonesia's balance-of-payments position should therefore be viewed in the perspective of our huge import requirements to fulfill the basic necessities of the people and of our increased development activities  which far exceed Indonesia's present financial capabilities. Consequently  external development assistance will be required for a further period to complement our domestic financial re-sources.67.	For those reasons  the Government of Indonesia regretfully finds itself unable at this stage to contribute to the proposed Special Fund to be established under the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. That should not  however  be interpreted to mean that Indonesia does not want to participate in any effort to enhance development co-operation among the developing countries through the machinery of certain specific development funds. In that regard  I can mention Indonesia's active participation in the initiation of the Islamic Development Bank  which is to be established soon and to have as its declared objective the mobilization of financial and other resources and the promotion of domestic savings and investment among its members.68.	In the same vein  we might also mention the recent decision of the secretaries-general of ASEAN to the effect that specific measures will be taken to alleviate the problems of raw-materials shortages among its members. In that particular case  Indonesia will make an effort to provide some form of aid to the other members of ASEAN within its limited capacity.69.	With regard to regional co-operation with ASEAN  that organization has now entered its second stage of operations . Whereas the first stage was devoted to consolidation  in the second stage ASEAN will have to move more rapidly towards actual realization of economic co-operation in various fields. Particular reference must also be made to co-operation in the industrial field  which will lead to concrete results in the form of setting up ASEAN industrial projects to provide the goods and services necessary to raise the people's standard of living and to improve economic viability.70.	Our summary review of some of the problems and challenges which the international community will have to face now and in the immediate future clearly shows how crucial a role the United Nations can and must play within the prevailing pattern of global interdependence.71.	In the light of the all-encompassing process of transition and change through which the world is going  and in the face of problems it is far beyond the scope and capacity of single nations to contend with  there seems to be dawning a new realization of the necessity to forge a fundamentally different kind of global co-operation and global co-ordination among the nations of the world. No international organization other than the United Nations possesses the inherent capacity  universality and credibility to assume the indispensable task of acting as the central instrument and principal catalyst in this common venture.72.	I cannot  therefore  but whole-heartedly endorse the plea of the Secretary-General  so eloquently summed up in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [Al9601IAiid.l]  that the widest possible effort and political will on the part of all Member States should be mustered so as to enable the Organization effectively to meet the overwhelming challenges of our time and to be truly fashioned into a lifeline to a better human society in the future."
"58",3183,"IND",29,1974,"Mr. President  I have already had occasion to congratulate you on your unanimous election  and also to welcome the three new Members to our Organization. On the present occasion I am happy to convey to the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our appreciation of his ceaseless endeavors in the cause of peace and in the fulfillment of the principles and purposes of the Charter. We are fortunate indeed in having him as our Secretary-General today  when his views are needed on collective and co-operative action to tackle the diverse and urgent problems facing mankind at present.73.	In the 29 years of its existence the United Nations has come to represent the overwhelming majority of the peoples and nations of the world. While this is indeed a matter for satisfaction  it is the few remaining areas of darkness that command our attention. I refer to the flagrant violation of the human rights of the majority of its people by the Government of South Africa  to the blatant refusal of South Africa to vacate Namibia  and to the continuance of the illegal racist regime in Zimbabwe. These continued affronts to the conscience of mankind are nagging reminders that  as long as some members of the human race are in bondage  the others are not wholly free. In our view  this Assembly should therefore consider more effective means of compelling these regimes practicing racism to respond positively to the collective will of the world represented by the United Nations.74.	It is a matter of particular satisfaction to us to welcome the new wind of change in Portugal. Guinea-Bissau has attained independence and world recognition by admission to our Organization. We welcome the installation of an interim Government in Mozambique representing the will and aspirations of its people  and we look forward to welcoming Mozambique soon in our Organization as an independent and sovereign member. This is an irreversible trend and we are confident that the people of Angola will also win their freedom soon in conditions of peace and honor. India is appreciative of the decision of the present Government of Portugal to liquidate its colonial empire. This decision will enable Portugal to assume its proper place in the world of today  a place befitting its distinct history and rich culture. I am glad to say that Portugal and India have decided to re-establish diplomatic relations and to develop cultural relations between the two countries.75.	Now I should like to turn my attention to the areas of conflict. Recent events in Cyprus remind us of the fatal danger of neglecting  until too late   the potential causes of conflict. In 1960 we saw the freeing of Cyprus from colonial rule and its birth as a sovereign  independent and non-aligned State  whose bi national character was guaranteed by some external Powers. In retrospect  this curious system of external guarantees has proved to be unwise in principle and self-defeating in practice. Recently  one external intervention led to another and a threat to world peace and security was thus created. It is the people of Cyprus who suffered greatly as a consequence and all our sympathies are with them in this moment of crisis and uncertainty in their lives. But the fact that all States without exception have declared their respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of non-aligned Cyprus is a good augury  for it provides the essential elements for a durable structure of peace and a return to constitutionality. We welcome the negotiations taking place directly between the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus which have been arranged with the assistance of the Secretary-General. We hope that their talks will also encompass future internal constitutional arrangements  and that agreement can be reached at an early date so that the withdrawal of foreign forces now in Cyprus becomes possible. The non-aligned countries have already declared their willingness to be available for any assistance that they can render.76.	The situation in the Middle East may freeze into another period of neglect  if the momentum towards a solution of the basic problems slows down. Only the rapid and full implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) can lead to a just and enduring peace. The restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people is another cornerstone in the structure of a lasting peace. Israel's refusal to vacate Arab territories captured as a result of aggression is a continuing provocation to the Arab States and negates the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. If the catastrophe of another war in the Middle East is to be avoided  Israel should end its aggression and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people should be restored to them.77.	The war in Cambodia shows no signs of ending  which is a matter of deep concern and anguish for us. In South Viet Nam  violations of the Paris Agreement continue to take place  with the legacies of external interference persisting and jeopardizing the prospects of early implementation of the provisions of the Agreement. How much longer are the peoples of IndoChina destined to suffer the ravages of war with all its frightful weapons? In South Viet Nam international efforts should be directed to the fulfillment of the constitutional provisions of the Paris Agreement. The people of Cambodia should be allowed to determine their future free from external interference and in conditions of peace and security. In Laos we welcome the formation of the Provisional Government of National Union  which is a testimony to the wisdom and statesmanship of the Laotian- leaders. We hope that this development  which has terminated several years of hostilities  will create conditions of peace and progress for the Laotian people.78.	In our part of the world  I am happy to report that tangible progress has been made in creating an atmosphere of good neighborliness. The Simla Agreement of 3 July 1972 provides a good and common basis for India and Pakistan to turn away from a period of confrontation and conflict to one of peace and co-operation. We have made special efforts to implement the Simla Agreement and  in spite of unfortunate delays  the two countries have concluded some agreements designed to normalize relations. The latest agreement signed at Islamabad on 14 September 1974 provides for the restoration of communications and travel facilities  and we hope that the progress achieved so far will lead to more agreements in other fields and to an era of peace and prosperity for the peoples of India and Pakistan.79.	We are actively engaged with our other neighbors to develop and extend bilateral and mutually beneficial co-operation in newer fields. The maritime boundary agreement with Sri Lanka is a significant example. Similarly  mutually satisfactory agreements on borders and other long-pending matters have been concluded with Indonesia  Burma and Bangladesh. Our relations with our other neighbors  Afghanistan  Bhutan and Nepal  are characterized by the spirit of mutual understanding and the desire to co-operate for our mutual benefit.80.	Our underground peaceful nuclear explosive experiment of 18 May 1974 must be seen in the context of our endeavor  at the national level  to develop our natural resources and capacities to the fullest extent for the benefit of our people. The international community has long recognized that nuclear explosive technology can be of great value in the development process. The non-aligned countries had also stressed this in the Declaration adopted by the Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries  held at Lusaka from 8 to 10 September 1970. We have no intention of making nuclear weapons. I wish to reiterate once again in this forum our firm and consistent policy to use nuclear energy and technology solely for peaceful purposes.81.	I should now like to say a few words about the areas of challenge that face the world community. Since the end of the last world war  the principal challenge to mankind has been the discovery of the basis for lasting world peace and security. In recent years  we have seen the evolution of a period of detente and a general relaxation of tensions among the great Powers. We welcome this development as a positive contribution to removing dangers of global conflict. However  the process of detente between the great Powers will have more meaning for the rest of the world if it takes into account the interests of all countries and if the benefits of detente are used to meet the challenges that face mankind  especially disarmament and development.82.	Disarmament has been the subject of continuous discussion in multilateral forums since the days of the League of Nations. But progress was slow  and the arms race entered a qualitatively new phase with the stockpiling of nuclear weapons to such an alarming extent that they are capable  if used  of destroying their targets five times over and obliterating all signs of modern civilization. India feels that nuclear dis-armament should receive the highest priority in our deliberations  for it provides the key not only to the prevention of wars of mass destruction but also to the release of resources for tackling what the Secretary-General has called the other ""ancient enemies of mankind poverty  disease  natural disaster"" [A/9601/Add.I]. Progress towards disarmament is possible only if nuclear-weapon States abjure all nuclear weapons and accept equal obligations with the rest of the world community. We support the early convening of a world disarmament conference after adequate preparation and with the participation of all States.83.	The holding of the Caracas session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was an event of outstanding importance. Significant progress was made  as nearly 150 countries worked to reconcile their interests  which were sometimes widely divergent. As a developing country with a long coast-line  India attaches special importance to this .Conference. With several years of preparatory work behind us  it. is our hope that further progress will be made towards an equitable and universally acceptable treaty on the law of the sea during the third session of the Conference to be held in Geneva next year.84.	During this year there have been major changes in the international economic scene. This world body dealt with the problems of development not only in the sixth special session held earlier this year but also in the World Population Conference which has just concluded in Bucharest  and it will deal with them further in the World Food Conference which is to be held in November. We are particularly appreciative of the fact that for the first time population questions have been accepted as an integral part of the developmental process. We hope that the World Food Conference will be a first step in tackling  at the international level  an important problem which so far has been neglected by the international community.85.	The problems of development will acquire ever greater urgency and importance with the rapid depletion of natural resources and the increasing population of the world. They are already assuming global proportions  and their effects will be felt everywhere. They cannot  be solved nationally or regionally  because there is already a growing and irreversible trend of interdependence among nations. Only global solutions can cope with global problems. Every problem today is virtually a world problem and calls for a world response.86.	The earth's resources are finite  and so is its capacity to absorb wastes. The world is in the grip of economic forces that appear to be uncontrollable. There is rampant inflation as well as stagnation in production. These phenomena have aggravated an already iniquitous situation with extremes of poverty and wealth in the world. In some parts of the world there seem to be no limits to the appetite for consumption  while in other countries millions of people are short of even the essentials of simple and plain living^ such as food  clothing  housing and medicine. The future growth of the developing countries is at the mercy of the high world prices of fertilizers  fuel and industrial goods. What are the global options available in this grave economic situation? It is not enough for the affluent countries to confine their concern to monetary fluctuations. There is an imperative need to help the countries most seriously affected by the current economic crisis. Any long-term global balance between demand and supply and natural resources must take into account  first and foremost  the requirements of those countries.87.	We welcome the statement of the Secretary- General in the thought-provoking introduction to his report that ""it is an underlying assumption of the United Nations that no problem of human relations is insoluble [ibid.]. It is in that spirit that we view the decisions of the sixth special session which are designed to pave the way to a new international economic order. While we appreciate the efforts made by the Secretary-General in trying to maintain the momentum generated by the special session  we note that he has himself pointed out that ""failure to sustain international action and collective responsibility may easily put in question the actual survival of millions of people"" [ibid.].88.	An emergency operation has been entrusted to the Secretary-General to provide immediate practical assistance to the most seriously affected countries  which have been rendered unable to meet the mounting costs of their essential imports [resolution 3202 (S-VI)  chap. X]  The responsibility for their present predicament is clearly not their own; they have been reduced to this precarious situation by economic events outside their control. In recognition of this fact  the sixth special session decided that emergency measures were necessary for assisting these countries  and it also envisaged the necessity for medium-term assistance to them. However  we are disappointed at the offers received so far of help for these countries. If tragic consequences to many countries and general disillusionment as to the effectiveness of international co-operation are to be averted  assistance must be forthcoming quickly and in adequate measure.89.	Perhaps at no time before in human history has mankind been confronted with problems of the present scope and scale. And at no time before has man been so conscious of the unity and common destiny of his own kind. Nor has he ever been in a better position than now to regulate his resources  his consumption and his environment in such a manner as to meet his material and spiritual needs. There is no forum more appropriate than the United Nations for meeting to the full extent the challenges facing us. There is no better time than the present  and the lead can only come from those who are blessed with the means to do so."
"59",3229,"IRL",29,1974,"Mr. President  I wish at the outset to convey to you the very warm congratulations of the Irish delegation on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is doubly fortunate  since your personal wisdom and experience will guide our deliberations  and you represent a country which in both the political and the economic spheres has a record of initiative and leadership.26.	My delegation wishes  too  to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Benites of Ecuador  Who guided the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly with brilliance and juridical sagacity.27.	It is my privilege to be the first after the address of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh to welcome Bangladesh to the United Nations. The Prime Minister's moving address has emphasized to us the urgent and terrible problems which face many parts of the world none more so than his stricken country.28.	We particularly welcome Guinea-Bissau as a new Member State. Its gallant struggle for freedom has been vindicated and its presence here today reflects the rebirth of democracy in Portugal  whose previous regime's colonial policy I described at the previous session of this Assembly [.2125th meeting] as doing an injustice to the Portuguese people  their traditions and their past contributions to human knowledge and culture. We hope soon to greet the newly emerging independent States of Mozambique and Angola. My delegation wishes to pay a special tribute to the inspiring and heart-warming address delivered here on Monday [2239th meeting] by the Foreign Minister of Portugal and to offer to his country our congratulations and most whole-hearted support in the new phase of its history which is now opening.29.	To Grenada  the Isle of Spice  we also give our warm felicitations. As the Prime Minister  Mr. Gairy  has said [2233rd meeting]  the presence here of Grenada is an expression of faith in fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of man which underscores the principle of self-determination.30.	The world that we have inherited from the past has had its own equilibrium. Supply and demand have been kept more or less in balance by the price mechanism; the spheres of influence of the great Powers have remained more or less stable over a full generation; and even within particular regions of the world where local conflict situations have existed  a political balance has been maintained  disrupted only infrequently by the outbreak of conflicts  which have in each case been successfully localized.31.	The fact that such a balance has existed throughout the past generation has obscured for many the fact that the relationships which have found themselves more or less in equilibrium during this period are themselves in many instances inherently unjust and therefore unstable. The equilibrium has in fact in many respects been a false one  reflecting an inherited balance of forces that has no objective justification other than the fact that it has secured a certain short-term stability in world affairs.32.	We in this generation now face the consequences of the understandable  but perhaps near-fatal  neglect by those who have gone before us of the fundamental problems involved in this false equilibrium. We face the problem of setting right imbalances between and within nations and social and economic injustices on a global scale  as well as the problem of creating a new world political equilibrium that will reflect the rights of peoples vis-ct-vis each other a new equilibrium that will replace a pattern of international relationships that owes all too much to injustices inherited from history.33.	It is only in the past decade that rich and poor nations alike have for the first time come to a full realization of how unjust is the present distribution of the world's resources and how inequitable is the sharing of power between the world's peoples. This belated realization brings with it  naturally  a desire to set things right  to create a true equilibrium in place of that false equilibrium that has hitherto existed between the nations of the world.34.	That radical changes in the relationships between rich and poor nations and in the distribution of the world's resources are urgently needed is now common ground among all but the most selfish and most reactionary. A new sense of mutual commitment between nations and peoples has been a feature of the past decade in world affairs and has begun to influence the attitudes of nations and their political leaders towards each other.35.	The problem of putting right a world structure which is so evidently and pervasively wrong is not  however  going to be easy to solve; on the contrary  it seems likely to prove frustratingly intractable. For  unjust though the economic and political equilibrium that has hitherto existed in the world may be  it is an equilibrium  and a delicately balanced one at that. We have seen on a number of occasions in recent decades how in the sphere of power politics even a marginal shift in the political balance between the super-Powers can endanger world peace.36.	In the economic sphere also we are learning at this time how sensitive is the equilibrium that has hitherto existed among different groups of nations in the world the United States  the countries of Western Europe and other industrialized countries  the State-trading countries  the oil-producing countries  the producers of other raw materials and those countries which are not endowed with natural resources. For the past 12 months the world economic system has been reverberating with the shock-effects of a sudden readjustment in the terms of trade between the oil-producing countries and the rest of the world  and to a lesser extent between other raw material producers and the rest of the world.37.	So finely balanced are the economic and social structures that have grown up through the centuries  and so accustomed have most peoples  especially in the developed world  become in recent decades to a regular annual increase in their real incomes  that the impact of a sudden adjustment in real incomes of even 5 or 6 per cent has proved dangerously disruptive and threatens the economic and perhaps even the political stability of some countries.38.	Moreover  the chain effects of any disruption of this balance are so immensely dangerous to the economy of the whole world and all its peoples  poor as well as rich  that all who are concerned with securing a more equitable distribution of wealth and power throughout the world have been forced by these recent events to consider carefully the manner in which this objective can be achieved without doing more harm than good to the poor as well as the rich  not merely in the short term but indeed over an indefinite period ahead. We have to face the unpalatable fact that already the sudden shift in the terms of trade has sparked off an unprecedented inflation  and that a world recession  the effects of which would inevitably hit the poorest and weakest worst of all  and with which we are most ill-prepared to deal  now threatens.39.	There will  no doubt  be those in the world who try to draw from this the conclusion that however great the injustices that blemish the international order it may be more prudent to leave these untouched than to attempt reforms whose unanticipated shock- effects on the system might in the short and medium run be harmful beyond any gains that can be achieved. This  however  would be a counsel of despair  for the economic  social and political injustices prevailing in the world are so great  and are now so clearly seen to be so  that no counsel of reason could prevent or inhibit efforts to set them right.40.	Whether we like it or not  the old order has to change  and it is clear that  rather than seek to persuade those who suffer under this system to hold their hand lest worse should befall them  we must set out to plan a readjustment of the relations between nations and between economies on a scale large enough and at a rate rapid enough to secure acceptance by those who suffer most from the injustices of the present system. This readjustment must  however  be prepared and planned sufficiently skilfully to ensure against the danger of shocks so great as to increase still further the sufferings of those who are the losers from the present unjust equilibrium.41.	The onus for such plans and preparations lies upon the ""haves"" of the world; it is they who must  not only in their own enlightened self-interest but also in the interest of the rest of the world  seek the means of putting right what is so evidently wrong  at a pace and in a manner  as I have said  that will secure the confidence and trust of those who suffer from the present system.42.	This I take to be the message from the sixth special session of the General Assembly and from the meeting in Mexico of the Working Group on the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  established by UNCTAD; and no doubt it will also be the message that will come within the next couple of months from the World Food Conference in Rome.43.	The inequities in the distribution of wealth in the world are not  as some have perhaps simplistically believed  merely the immediate consequence of past colonialism. Many inequities are rather the product of a technological gap which formerly made colonialism possible but which remains an equally formidable force after the end of the colonial system. Other inequities in the distribution of wealth are the product of an unequal distribution of raw materials  with which the nations of the world are most unevenly endowed. Others  again  may reflect massive disparities of size as between different nations: disparities of geographical size  which is often relevant to the range of raw materials available; or of population size  which determines the scale of the domestic market and therefore  to a degree  the possibilities of mass production.44.	We are just learning at present to understand the full complexity of the unequal distribution of wealth as we see how increases in the prices of oil and raw materials aid the economies of only some developing countries  and damage  in certain in-stances disastrously  the economies of others less well endowed. What seemed up to a year ago a relatively clear-cut  although not easily soluble  problem of two sets of nations  rich and poor  is now universally perceived to be much more complex  involving First the developed countries  which are suffering the consequences of increased oil and raw material prices; secondly  the oil-producing countries  whose resources have overnight been increased on a scale which  for some at least  creates problems of disposal and investment; thirdly  a range of other raw-material-producing countries  some of them great gainers from the rise in the price of certain raw materials  some less markedly benefiting because of a less fortunate pattern of raw material production  and some even losing because the prices of their raw materials have not risen at all; and  fourthly  that group of countries with no raw materials to speak of  which are now far worse off than ever before.45.	That is  surely  the primary lesson brought home to all of us at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  convened earlier this year on the inspired initiative of your country  Mr. President: the complexity of the problem. The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (5-K/J] stresses in its paragraph 3 ""reality of interdependence"" and the fact that ""the prosperity of the international community as a whole depends upon the prosperity of its constituent parts"". And the complexity of the interests which must be reconciled is reflected in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VI)].46.	In my delegation's view  the solution to the imbalance of wealth in the world must include three essential elements: first  there must be an assurance of a continued long-term improvement in the relative prices of raw materials from developing countries vis-a-vis the prices of industrial manufactures.47.	Secondly  there must be an assurance to those countries which  because of their lack of natural resources  may be expected to lose rather than to gain from such a continued price adjustment of long- term and continuing aid of a kind  and on a scale  that will enable them to share fully in the continuing redistribution of world wealth  and  over a period of time  to secure self-sustaining economic growth.48.	My own country has not in the past played as full a part as it should have done in the provision of development aid to countries much less well off than itself. We have  however  quadrupled our development aid program in the past 18 months and have committed ourselves to a continued expansion of the real volume of this aid designed at least to-treble it again within the next four or five years.49.	But  thirdly  there must be  as between the developed world and the developing countries  whether endowed with raw materials or not  a transfer of technology to bridge that most fundamental gap which  as I said a few moments ago  remains a formidable force perpetuating the division of the world into the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" even after the end of the colonial era. The forthcoming Euro-Arab dialog  in which my country as a member of the European Economic Community will be participating  will  I hope  among other things  lead to a beginning of such a transfer of technology in favor of one group of developing countries and could perhaps  if successful as we hope it will be provide a model for similar arrangements between other groups of countries.50.	But pending the development of a long-term plan comprising inter alia these elements  we must ensure as a preliminary step that there is no recurrence of the disastrous cycle of gross fluctuations in the prices of raw materials which has in the past inflicted such misery on poor countries dependent on raw materials for their livelihood and disrupted the markets of the industrialized countries  whose stability is important to the world as a whole.51.	In other words  the benefits gained by many poor countries as a result of the rise in the prices of raw materials in the past couple of years must by some means be substantially guaranteed pending the development of arrangements that will assure to them a continued  steady future growth of real income from these sources. The European Community  in its negotiations with the associated African  Caribbean and Pacific countries in Jamaica two months ago  undertook some first tentative steps in this direction which will  however  need to be reinforced and to be extended much more widely if the trading gains secured by the raw-material-producing countries in the last couple of years are to be maintained.52.	Next  as part of the immediate program demanded by the urgent needs of the present situation  there must be an adequate emergency fund to help those developing countries which  because of their lack of raw materials  have merely had their poverty made even more absolute by these recent price movements and have  in some instances  been threatened with actual starvation  as we have just heard in moving terms from the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. The efforts to get an emergency fund of this kind off the ground have been frustratingly slow  and have hitherto evoked a somewhat uneven response from those whose means impose on them a severe responsibility in this matter. A number of countries  including those of the  European Economic Community and a number of the oil-producing countries  have tried in their different ways to give a lead in this matter  but this lead has yet to be followed on a scale large enough to offer an assurance that the action to be taken in respect of this aspect of the problem will be in any degree commensurate with the urgent need.53.	Finally  and equally urgently  effective international action is required to prevent the impact of the recent sudden deterioration in the terms of trade of the industrialized countries from precipitating a world recession. Almost a year has now passed since the increase in oil prices  and well over a year since some prices of raw materials started to move sharply upwards  but there still seems to be a dangerous hiatus in the redirecting of surplus funds not being spent on current consumption or investment by those who have received them; these funds are not yet working their way back into the system on a scale sufficient to maintain world economic activity. Moreover  as between the countries within the industrialized group of nations  no adequate progress has yet been made with smoothing out the uneven distribution of the impact of these events on somewhat differently placed national economies  nor has there been on the part of most of these countries sufficient progress in tackling the inflationary impact of the sharp price increases they face  which now threaten to precipitate a dangerously sharp second-stage wage cost inflation within many of these States.54.	What I have just said concerning the need to replace a false equilibrium in the economic sphere finds its application also  I believe  in the political sphere. There was a time when the world political balance seemed to be a function almost exclusively of the relationship between two super-Powers. We see today clearly that this is no longer the case; quite apart from the new situation created by the return of China to its rightful role as an active world Power  by the emergence of Japan as one of the world's major industrial Powers  and by the coming together of nine of the countries of Western Europe in a new European community  there has been the emergence of the group of non-aligned countries. Moreover  the relationship between the two super-Powers has settled into a more stable pattern and the confrontation that existed between them has  to a degree  been replaced as a source of world tension by local conflicts in various parts of the world  some of which carry in themselves  however as others have already pointed out in this debate the seeds of a threat to world peace.55.	At the same time  the former simple balance of terror between the nuclear capabilities of the two super-Powers has been replaced by a new  increasingly dispersed  and therefore perhaps increasingly threatening  proliferation of nuclear weapons and of the means to create them. The dangers posed by these developments  and the 'need for effective action to deal with them  were rightly stressed here last Monday by the Secretary of State of the United States  Mr. Kissinger [2238th meeting]. As a country which a decade ago played a constructive part in the initiation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]  Ireland is particularly concerned at the recent evidence of a breakdown in the safeguards then introduced and will join in any effort to restore tight control over the spread of nuclear weapons.56.	These new problems cannot be met by old  simplistic solutions; they require a far more sophisticated approach  one that will involve many nations in the exercise of statesmanship and self-restraint. What frankly is frightening is that here in the political sphere as in the economic sphere the achievement of a new and more equitable world equilibrium  one that would be acceptable to the world's peoples as well as to their Governments  seems to be beyond the competence of our existing international institutions  as we work them today. The kind of international order needed to cope successfully with these problems demands an institutional structure far better organized and far better disciplined than that which we now have.57.	This poses great problems for the world's nations: for the super-Powers  which will find it difficult to accept any constraint on the freedom of action which their potential for destruction has hitherto given them; for the former colonial Powers  which cannot find it easy to adapt to the loss of their ancient privileges; but also for the new States  those like my own  with half a century of independence behind them as well as those which have secured their sovereign freedom only within the past decade or two. For all of us newer States the acceptance of constraints on our individual freedom of action in the interest of stability  and even of the survival of the world  must be somewhat irksome coming within decades  or even only within years  after we have achieved our long-sought independence.58.	No country can  however  escape from the constraints imposed by the situation that faces the world today. In southern Africa  in the Middle East  in Cyprus and in Northern Ireland  to name but four parts of the world  there are dangerous situations  each of which owes its potentially or actually explosive Character to the world's too ready acceptance of past festering injustices a failing to which the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom  Mr. Callaghan  referred in the course of his address yesterday [2240th meeting] and to the failure of one or other party to these disputes to face up to the inherent instability of a situation that momentarily may have seemed to favor their interests.59.	In Cyprus an inherently unstable situation was made even more dangerous by the emergence in Greece of a military dictatorship which was far too readily tolerated  and even aided  by some members of the world community. When that regime eventually succumbed to adventurism in Cyprus  the uneasy balance in that island foundered  bringing misery and death to the Cypriot community  Greek and Turk alike.60.	The disproportionate response by Turkey to the events precipitated by the coup in Cyprus has brought in its train tragic hardship and dislocation to the Cypriot population and a threat to the sovereignty and independence of Cyprus as a State. We trust that negotiations will permit the speedy and safe return to their homes of all those  from both communities  who have been uprooted  as well as the full restoration to Cyprus of its right to sovereignty and independence.61.	The course of events in Cyprus has not made the task entrusted to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus any easier  and we share the sorrow of those countries whose soldiers have died under the flag of the United Nations in the cause of peace in the island. We also wish to pay homage to the devoted and unflagging personal efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  to bring communal leaders of Cyprus together in a dialog of peace.62.	It is our earnest hope that from the tragic drama of Cyprus in recent months  the participants and the rest of the world too may learn that attempts to resolve conflicts of communal rights by forceful means not only can bring greater hardship to the communities in whose name the actions were taken  but can also damage the international machinery available under the Charter for the solution of such problems and can undermine the principle that lies at the heart of the Charter itself the sovereign equality of States.63.	In the Middle East  the unwillingness for so long of Arab States to recognize the right of Israel to exist and the reluctance in turn by Israel to recognize and work towards a resolution of the problem of the Palestinians have together contributed to instability  and thus to repeated armed conflict.64.	In southern Africa the same danger of confrontation persists. Happily  as I noted earlier  the emergence of a democratic Government in. Portugal is helping to resolve this problem peacefully in several of the Territories involved; but these developments serve only to stress the urgency of a movement towards a solution in the rest of southern Africa  which has been suffering from the intransigence of its white minority regimes and from their shortsighted determination to perpetuate injustice in defense of a perverted concept of ""civilization"".65.	Within the past couple of days there have been reports from South Africa that the Government of that country may be about to announce a significant change in its policy with respect to Namibia. My delegation hopes that those reports are well founded  not merely for the sake of the Namibian people  whose welfare in the future is the special responsibility of this Organization  but also in the hope that such a development might mark a first step by the Government of South Africa away from its past policies which have cut it off from the rest of the world.66.	We in Ireland have also suffered in our turn from a failure on the part of those who had the authority to do so to tackle in good time the problem of injustice to the important nationalist minority in Northern Ireland. The explosive situation which inevitably developed from this failure burst into open conflict in 1969. This conflict increased fears on all sides  and even though many of the long-standing injustices were gradually rectified  self-righteous and ruthless men the members of the illegal Irish Republican Army were able to exploit the situation by claiming to act as defenders of a threatened minority. Their ruthlessness in the years that followed provoked from paramilitary groups amongst the majority indiscriminate retaliation against innocent members of the minority and the consequent cycle of violence has been compounded by cases of lack of judgment or lack of discipline on the part of security forces trying to cope with the situation. In an atmosphere where all live in fear of violence from any one of several sources  reason cannot easily prevail nor moderate policies gain the widespread support they need to bring a term to the crisis racking the Northern Ireland community.67.	The aim of my Government is  by initiating constructive policies and by rejecting the pursuit of mere self-interest  to work towards the calming of passions and the achievement of peace with justice in Northern Ireland. Accordingly  since the last session of the General Assembly we have made it clear that we abjure irredentism  that we accept that the factual position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom can be altered only with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.68.	Unhappily  even that clear statement  which we offered to incorporate in a solemn agreement to be registered at the United Nations  has failed to persuade the majority section of the community in Northern Ireland to accept the terms of a widely acclaimed agreement reached last December at Sunningdale in England between the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom and the parties to a power-sharing Government in Northern Ireland  which at that time commanded a majority in the then recently elected Northern Ireland Assembly. That agreement provided for participation by both sections of the people of Northern Ireland in the government of the area an arrangement which actually operated successfully for a period of five months  and for an institutional structure between North and South that would have given expression to the close economic  social and cultural links that bind together the two parts of Ireland.69.	It is tragic that this solution to the problem  despite its initial good reception and despite the support given to it by the United Kingdom Government and opposition parties and by the Government and opposition in my own country  failed as a result of a recrudescence of intransigence amongst the majority section of the Northern Ireland community. But we have not abandoned our efforts to secure a solution along these lines and to achieve acceptance for it amongst both sections of the community in Northern Ireland on a scale that will ensure its success. We have not been deflected from our efforts at conciliation by the rejection of the agreement reached at Sunningdale nine months ago. We remain convinced that the principal elements of that agreement are essential to any enduring solution. And  in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  we shall continue to pursue the path of conciliation in the cause of peace.70.	I know that in our efforts to resolve this problem within the island of Ireland  and in co-operation with the United Kingdom Government  we have the support of the world community.71.	I should like to end by referring to the question of human rights  including safeguards against torture  a problem which increasingly is attracting the concern of world public opinion. My country takes the view that human rights transcend all questions of national sovereignty. We formally reject the view that any country has the right to infringe on basic human rights  let alone use torture within its territory  or to be free from inquiry  from inspection  or from condemnatory action by the international community in respect of such breaches of the rights of man.72.	We ourselves accept the jurisdiction of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights in respect of such matters and have fully accepted the obligation to justify our domestic actions before these tribunals. To the extent that the United Nations code of human rights is less effective than that of the Council of Europe  we would wish that it be strengthened and rendered less open to evasion  and more capable of protecting individuals every  where from arbitrary acts by Governments."
"60",3276,"IRN",29,1974,"Mr. President  I wish at the outset to congratulate you most sincerely on your unanimous election to the presidency of the present session of the General Assembly. We recognize your numerous qualities  both as a diplomat and as a statesman  and we are certain that you will conduct our work here with distinction and success. Your election is not only a recognition of your personal qualities but also a homage to your country  to the Arab nations and to the great continent of Africa where a great step towards decolonization has been made  Which we hope will be a decisive one.36.	Another reason to rejoice is the admission of three new Member States  to the representatives of which I should like to extend a welcome in the name of my country and of my delegation. We are convinced that the contribution of Bangladesh  Guinea- Bissau  and Grenada will be most fruitful for the Organization in its strides towards achieving universality.37.	I should also like to express our thanks to His Excellency Mr. Leopoldo Benites for the admirable way in which he presided over the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.38.	Finally  to our Secretary-General I wish to renew our support and the expression of our confidence.39.	Significant events have happened in the period since the preceding session of the General Assembly  some of which have changed the world scene beyond recognition. At this late stage of the general debate  however  I do not wish to comment upon all  or even most  of these developments. I shall dwell only upon the global economic situation and the question of the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. But  before reviewing these two questions I wish to say a few words on the situation in the Middle East  in the Indian sub-continent and in Cyprus.40.	The October war last year changed the whole picture of the Middle East. The establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force last October at the height of the crisis  followed by agreements on disengagement of forces  marked the beginning of a new era in the tragic history of the Middle East protest. Thus  a glimmer of hope emerged on the horizona political landscape which had remained sombre for such a long period of time. However  there is not much reason to be over-optimistic  and there can hardly be any doubt that unless the root causes of tension are removed  military conflicts may recur.41.	As I said in this Assembly last year  negotiations among parties can only be undertaken if there is a reasonable guarantee of withdrawal by Israel from occupied Arab territories and of implementation of all the other provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  including recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.21 do not intend to stress the serious potential consequences of the intransigent policies pursued by Israel  nor do I need to emphasize the adverse effects of such policies on the sorely needed trust which must be painstakingly built between the parties involved in the Middle East tragedy.42.	As was demonstrated by the war last October  the physical security of Israel can by no means be guaranteed by the occupation of Arab lands  and the only viable alternative continues to be the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which provides the best practical framework for the realization of a just and lasting peace.43.	Peace and security in the Indian sub-continent is one of the essential elements of my country's foreign policy  and in order to preserve it we shall continue to seek the friendship and co-operation of all parties concerned. In this connexion I should like to express the satisfaction of my Government over the developments in the sub-continent  culminating in the recent agreement which will open the channels of communication among the countries concerned and pave the way for the resumption of full diplomatic relations between Pakistan and India. It is hoped that further efforts will be made to settle outstanding problems between the parties concerned through peaceful means.44.	Regarding the implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  which is item 31 on the agenda  I should like to make a brief reference to a statement made by His Imperial Majesty to the countries of the Indian Ocean for the purpose of studying and establishing extensive ties of economic co-operation between the countries bordering on that ocean. Such co-operation is bound to assist the efforts that have been undertaken here in the United Nations for that same purpose. I would also add that we are maintaining friendly relations that are constantly growing with all the other nations of the subcontinent as well as with adjacent countries. In this connexion I wish to emphasize the excellent state of our brotherly relations with Afghanistan.45.	In Cyprus  we were most concerned when the military coup took place  and we immediately said that the status of Cyprus as an independent and sovereign State  based upon international agreements  should be safeguarded as should the rights of the Turkish community on the island. While the reasons which prompted the Turkish military action in Cyprus are understandable  we are convinced that in the long run the problem can only be solved through negotiations among the countries and communities concerned on the basis of the independence of Cyprus and the observance of the legitimate rights of both the Turkish and Greek communities. The Government of Iran hopes that the problem will be solved as soon as possible because  apart from the political problem  the fate of more than 200 000 refugees is at stake.46.	The plight of refugees is not unfamiliar to us. Indeed  we are at present confronted with such a problem ourselves. About 100 000 Iraqi-Kurdish refugees all of them women  the elderly and children have flooded into Iran as a result of calamitous and heart-rending bombings. The Government of Iran has already allocated more than $100 million for the care of these refugees. But it is evident that money  food and housing alone cannot alleviate all their sufferings.47.	It was not my intention to speak here today of the relations between my country and Iraq. Indeed  fol-lowing upon the talks between the delegations of the two countries at Istanbul last August  it was agreed that I should meet my Iraqi opposite number here in October so as to enter into discussions with him  and I felt that  in accordance with the very spirit of a bilateral agreement reflected in Security Council resolution 348 (1974) for the ""creation of a favorable atmosphere"" that would encourage these talks  we should abstain from repeating what all Members of our Organization are already familiar with  particularly through the letters addressed by our permanent representative to the President of the Security Council.48.	I note once again that  to my great surprise  at the very time when the talks are to be resumed  the representative of Iraq [2262nd meeting] has once again launched groundless accusations in the United Nations. This strange conduct has been repeated over the years  and is all too familiar. Our wish  nevertheless  as we have indicated on a number of occasions  is to settle our differences peacefully and on the basis of the United Nations Charter and the recognized principles of international law and international practice. Of course  I could take up  point by point here  all the allegations of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq and reply to them  but since no new point has been raised  the refutation of those groundless accusations can be found in the many letters addressed to the Secretary-General and to the Security Council  distributed as official Council documents. Moreover  our position in this respect has been stated on numerous occasions from this rostrum  and I shall therefore not dwell on these matters. Nevertheless  I am prepared  if necessary  to provide all the necessary clarifications that may be called for  should it be the intention of the head of the Iraqi delegation to enter into further controversy.49.	Before dealing with the world economic situation  I should like to clarify one point. Voices have been heard in recent weeks trying to relate the present economic disorder to the increase in the price of oil. There has been talk about artificially rigged  distorted  exorbitant and outrageous prices. According to their ominous prophecies  unless these prices are lowered immediately  the world could be heading towards disaster. There have even been implied threats that the flow of foodstuffs to the oil-producing nations might be cut off.50.	Such assertions might impress the uninitiated layman  but they fail to convince the sober  worldly- wise observer. Indeed  in the course of the present debate  two heads of State and many foreign ministers  including representatives of some non-oil-producing nations  have already rebutted those assertions and have dealt with the subject in a most convincing fashion. Nevertheless  considering the fact that Iran is a major oil-producing country  I consider it my duty to set the record straight.51.	It is often said that the plight of the world economy and inflation were by-products of the rise in the price of oil. The fact is  however  that the rate of inflation began to escalate and to assume astronomical proportions some few years f>go  thereby eroding the purchasing power of the oil-producing countries. Each year the producers of raw materials have had to give more of their products to import the same  if not a lesser  amount of machinery and manufactured goods from the industrialized countries - a process that  as we have stated time and again in the past  has led to a systematic impoverishment of the developing nations  while at the same time the industrially developed nations have proceeded to enrich themselves further.52.	At the same time  despite assertions to the contrary  the higher oil prices have had little inflationary impact; for according to the statistics -and I am not referring to our own statistics  but rather to those made available by experts of the industrialized countries themselves - imported oil accounts for as little as 0.45 per cent of the rate of inflation in the United States  and only about 1.5 per cent of the current inflationary trend in the Western European countries  while in all those countries the general price rise approximates an average of 12 per cent. In other words  the disorder in the world economy and in monetary markets preceded the oil price rise and was due mainly to mismanagement of the economy in the European States and in America  as well as to excessive consumption in the more advanced countries.53.	The reasons that prompted the oil-producing countries to raise the price of their product were  however  manifold.54.	First of all  in a competitive market the price of any commodity should be comparable to the price of its closest substitute  which in the case of oil must take into account the cost of obtaining energy from other sources  such as coal  shale oil and atomic energy. Similarly  the price should reflect what is termed the ""opportunity cost"" of the commodity. Thus the price of crude oil used as a source of fuel should correspond to its alternative value when used as a base for petrochemicals.55.	Secondly  the components of the selling prices in the major importing nations were in no way equitable to the oil-exporting countries: for every dollar paid by the consumer for oil  only nine cents reached the producer  and the rest went mainly to the oil companies in the form of profits  and to the Governments of oil-importing countries in the form of taxation.56.	Thirdly  it must be recognized that oil is a non-renewable commodity  and therefore the Governments of oil-producing nations have a duty to their peoples and to future generations not only to take measures to conserve this highly valuable asset  but also to trade it on optimum terms.57.	Fourthly  for nearly a quarter of a century  the uninterrupted supply of cheap oil from the developing countries served as the main factor enabling the industrialized countries to raise their production levels  expand their exports  improve their balance of payments and accumulate excessively large foreign exchange reserves  as well as save their own solid fuel resources. It therefore follows that in the period in question there was a net transfer of resources from the developing countries to the developed countries.58.	Throughout that period  the multinational oil companies controlled the flow of supply and therefore the demand and fixed the price of (oil at their own discretion  unilaterally. Their price policy bore no relation to the true value of petroleum: it was a deliberate policy of the rich countries of the world  designed to keep energy prices below their true value. Thus  for example  the posted price of Iranian crude oil was fixed by the oil companies at $US 2.17 in 1947. Thirteen years later  the posted price had dropped to $US 1.79  and remained the same throughout the 1960s. At the same time  the developing countries had to import their requirements from industrial countries at ever-rising prices. Between 1947 and 1973 the price of 28 commodities  excluding crude oil  increased by an average of more than 350 per cent. The increasing consumption of low-cost petroleum combined with its declining price in industrialized nations contributed greatly to the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor countries that is  the developed countries advanced at a rapid rate at the expense of the outproducing countries. However  those countries that had become rich at our expense never paid any attention to the tragic problems of the developing countries and did not even consent to allocate 1 per cent of their gross national product to the development of the under-developed countries.59.	As regards Iranians have constantly taken into account the problems facing the developing countries  and as soon as readjustment of the price of oil became a reality we started giving bilateral as well as multilateral aid to developing and developed countries alike a matter to which I shall refer later. We are also aware that recycling is necessary and have therefore begun negotiations to that effect-. But that can be done only through reasoned deliberation and mutual discussion. Accusations or threats against the oil producers do not solve anything. The sixth special session of the General Assembly had the merit of seeing the problem from the right angle and devoting itself to examining and recommending practical solutions to the problem of raw materials and development.60.	In the main  what emerged from the sixth special session of the General Assembly was a Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and a Program of Action [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)). Those decisions constitute historic landmarks in the evolutionary process of the international economic system. Whatever shortcomings might be evident in the two documents adopted by the special session  we cannot deny that that session was a turning-point in the economic environment of our world  and  more particularly  in relations between the industrialized and the developing countries. More vividly than ever  they have brought out in bold relief the new reality of the condition of interdependence prevailing among nations regardless of whether they belong to the developed or developing regions of the world.61.	It has also been conclusively demonstrated that the time when certain industrialized countries ruled and were able to take decisions that committed the whole world belongs to the past. Instead  a new era has dawned in which it is clear that the seemingly overwhelming problems of the world can be tackled adequately only within the framework of relations based on co-operation and equality among sovereign States.62.	That is the kind of potential transformation in the international economic situation to which my august Sovereign was referring in his message of 5 April 1974 to the General Assembly on the opening of the sixth special session when he said:""... Nothing better reflects the spirit of our time than the fact that this special session  unlike previous ones  emanates not from war and conflict among nations but comes out of a growing recognition of interdependence among them. . . .""The time has now come to make a beginning towards a more rationalized world economy. This means  among other things  that the raw materials in the hands of the developing nations should maintain constant and real value in relation to the prices of goods imported from the industrialized market. Trade must be made an instrument of progress for all while recognizing that the prosperity of the poor need not diminish the affluence of the rich.""363.	However  the economic imbalance persisting in relations between developing and developed countries is so serious and the process that continues to widen the gap between them seemingly so inexorable that action can no longer be confined  as in the past  to corrective or ad hoc measures. If we are to succeed  we shall have to make a concerted effort to carry out a major review of the concepts and practices underlying the international economic system. Real structural changes will have to be instituted if we are to evolve a new economic order' based on equity  sovereign equality  interdependence  common interest and cooperation among all States. And in this context it is to be hoped that the industrialized countries of the world will not fail to take advantage of the opportunities which now exist for co-operating with others in finding suitable solutions.64.	For its part  Iran remains fully aware of the need to co-operate with other countries  especially the developing ones. I shall not attempt here to give a detailed picture of my Government's wide-ranging efforts in this respect  but it perhaps bears repeating that the total amount of Iran's bilateral and multilateral commitments to other countries has already reached $9 000 million.65.	Measured by any yard stick be it gross national product  per capita income  oil revenue  size of population or any other criterion that amount heads all contributions. Indeed  the total amount of our assistance relative to our gross national product exceeds the contribution of any other country in the whole history of development assistance.66.	Furthermore  negotiations have been in progress with UNDP with a view to increasing and diversifying the assistance which Iran is supplying to the developing countries through that body  to which our country has become a net contributor. Although Iran has made substantial emergency and development aid available to the developing countries during the current year  it has nevertheless decided to make a contribution of $20 million to the United Nations emergency operations.67.	It was also with a view to alleviating the burden imposed upon developing countries because of the rising prices of foodstuffs  raw materials and industrial goods  and in order to take a major step towards bridging the gap between the rich and poor nations by effecting  for the first time  a real transfer of resources  that  on 22 February 1974  His Imperial Majesty proposed the establishment of a new special development fund which would be fully responsive to the urgent needs and requirements of the developing countries.68.	That special development fund would be set up with an initial capital of $2 000 million to $3 000 mil-lion to be financed jointly by the oil-exporting as well as the industrialized countries. To guarantee an objective  fair and impartial approach  the fund was to be administered by a governing body in which all the oil-exporting  industrialized and aid-receiving countries would be equally represented on a one-man  one- vote basis. The establishment of such a voting mechanism would give a new content to the concept of multilateral assistance.69.	Yet the results of our efforts towards the establishment of the fund have not been very encouraging so far. However  undeterred by the results of its international efforts  Iran has eagerly and in all good faith been following its own program of assistance on a bilateral as well as on a multilateral basis along the lines I have already outlined above.70.	In any case  the continuation of the work so nobly conceived during the sixth special session is by now assured. The over-all review of the implementation of the Program of Action adopted last spring has been assigned to the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly devoted to development and international economic co-operation  which is to meet next year prior to the thirtieth regular session. Perhaps by then some of the reservations which marked the adoption of the consensus regarding the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of the Program of Action will be less categorical.71.	Whereas the lack of any appreciable progress in the field of disarmament has been among the more dismal aspects of recent international life  we are  nevertheless  pleased to note that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament has recommended an expansion of its membership  and that the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has finally convened and has completed its work. It must  however  be recognized.that in the field of disarmament no significant progress has been achieved with regard to substantive matters.72.	As I pointed out in this same forum last year  it is our view that a disarmament program should be devised which will continue to maintain a constant link between the partial measures and the ultimate goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international control.4 In the absence of such a program  and until the goal of general and complete disarmament is achieved especially when we see that the world has made no progress towards peace and stability and that the United Nations has never been weaker countries cannot fail to look after their own defense requirements.73.	We all know that meetings take place for the sake of discussion and  once in a while  recommendations are made or decisions are taken  but we do not witness their implementation especially when they are concerned with the maintenance of peace and security. Nevertheless  efforts aimed at the achievement of the goal of general and complete disarmament must continue to be pursued  and I can say that  as far as Iran is concerned  we have not failed to do our part in a constructive spirit. We have felt that  in this connexion  there appears to be no justifiable reason for the lack of adequate and effective negotiations  especially on the question of the cessation"" of all nuclear weapons tests and the prohibition of chemical weapons  which the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly requested to be dealt with as matters of ""first"" or ""high"" priority.74.	While I am on the subject of disarmament  I wish to express my disappointment at the lack of progress with regard to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons which has not been as thorough or wide-ranging as expected. The world of today is precariously poised on the threshold of a new age in which countries will increasingly move from the use of the more traditional sources of energy to that of nuclear energy. A; host of forces social  economic  demographic and technical have converged and conspired to give rise to this impending revolution in the field of nuclear technology. In a world  then  where the uses of atomic energy are about to be proliferated  it becomes all the more imperative that the existing international framework for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons should be strengthened.75.	As a result  while by no means abandoning a global approach with regard to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  the world has become more acutely aware of the pressing need for collateral measures in dealing with the problem on a partial or regional basis. Thus  the continent of Africa was the subject of General Assembly resolution 1652 (XVI) of 24 November 1961 in which Member States were called upon to refrain from testing  storing  or transporting nuclear weapons in Africa and to consider and respect the continent as a denuclearized zone. Subsequently  by its resolution 2033 (XX) of 3 December 1965  the General Assembly endorsed the Declaration on the denuclearization of Africa issued by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity in July 1964.76 Furthermore  the outstanding success  to date  of the Treaty of Tlatelolco  which entered into force in 1969  and which prohibits nuclear weapons in LatinAmerica  has blazed a trail which others might follow with equal profit.77.	It is considerations such as those I have cited above that prompted my august Sovereign to propose the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East a few years ago and to send a message to this effect to the opening of this session of the Assembly. Inspired by His Imperial Majesty's proposal  my Government has  as you know  requested the inclusion of an item entitled  ""Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East""  in the agenda of the current session. As we have indicated in our explanatory memorandum accompanying this request:""While prospects for implementation of an all- encompassing denuclearization scheme in the region of the Middle East appear now to be more promising  greater access by States to nuclear technology has rendered the danger of nuclear weapon proliferation and a concomitant collapse of the non-proliferation structure  a more acute problem"". [SeeAl9693]78.	It should be readily apparent to any thoughtful person that  given the political conditions prevailing in the region  if nuclear weapons were developed or acquired by any country  the other countries in that area would be rapidly overwhelmed by a ruinous  senseless and potentially disastrous nuclear arms race. Furthermore  the astronomical costs involved in building an inventory of such weapons of mass destruction and in elaborating a viable system for their delivery  would divert resources which are urgently needed if the socio-economic aspirations of these countries are to be adequately realized.79.	It is our intense sensitivity to the monstrous problems that would be created if nuclear arms were ever to invade the region of the Middle East and to the great challenge facing all of us to prevent such an eventuality from occurring  which makes my Government fervently hope that the General Assembly  during the current session  will commend this proposal to the attention of the States of the region and make a recommendation to those States as soon as possible to achieve this objective and report back to the General Assembly.80.	Of course  many problems and complexities need to be faced and overcome as we move from the realm of aspiration to that of implementation at the operational level. Among others  the question of defining the geographical concept of the Middle East  the limits of the denuclearized zone and of an adequate safeguard system  will have to be settled.81.	My Government wishes to avail itself of this opportunity to express its deep appreciation to the Egyptian Government for its valuable support in co- sponsoring our proposal  and to all other countries that have expressed their support. The urgency of the situation and the complexity of the road to be traveled summon us all to engage purposefully in an early effort to foster the establishment of a nuclear-weapon- free zone in the region of the Middle East in as expeditious a manner as possible.82.	By taking the necessary action  the General Assembly will clearly demonstrate its concern about this matter  which is of such vital importance to the peace and security not only of our region  but of the entire world. Indeed  it will represent the taking of a historic step towards a more secure and a happier future for us all.83.	To cope with the complex problems of today  anachronistic concepts and methods must give way to approaches based on new realities in the world  a world in which no country or group of countries can alone provide leadership or can dictate their terms. Such problems can only be dealt with through a spirit of mutual accommodation  dialog and co-operation.84.	Peace for the world and prosperity for our peoples are goals we all seek to achieve. To this end  we who have always acted in accordance with the principles of the Charter  are prepared to engage in a dialog to find a rational basis for the solution of the existing problems in a manner which would safeguard the interests of all concerned without prejudice to our legitimate rights under the Charter."
"61",3323,"IRQ",29,1974,"Mr. President  it is indeed a source of gratification to see the international community expressing its confidence in you by electing you to the Presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. Such confidence reflects the appreciation felt by the inter-national community towards your fraternal Arab country  which enjoys an eminent position on the African continent and among the non-aligned countries. It also reflects the high status and the positive role of the non-aligned countries within the international community. Your unanimous election is in fact an expression of appreciation and respect for your person and for your capabilities as an astute and eminent statesman. While extending to you my heartfelt congratulations  I should also like to express our gratitude for the efficient manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  conducted the meetings of both the previous session and the sixth special session.22.	Our world today is facing grave situations and challenges which put the United Nations and its procedures to a test  the outcome of which will determine not only the Organization's effectiveness in fulfilling its mission but also its very existence. In spite of the positive developments in the climate of international relations in recent years within the context of the policy of detente and the diminished likelihood of a nuclear war  the majority of the peoples of the world are still suffering acutely from colonialist domination  from the threat of aggression  and from poverty. Furthermore  in various regions of the world there are still many hotbeds of tension and danger which threaten international peace and security. In the forefront of such regions is our own Arab area  which has over a long period of time been the victim of the worst forms of aggression. It has witnessed at the same time the continued inability of the international community to find effective solutions to the problem. Representatives are no doubt well aware of the perils involved in this situation.23.	What is indeed most disturbing is the fact that this forum  which is supposed to be a forum of justice  should witness strange methods being applied by their authors to threaten States which are exercising their natural rights and defending their legitimate interests. This is one of the manifestations menacing the inter-national community today.24.	Iraq  a country which has only recently rid itself of the last traces of colonialist domination and of the ugly manner in which its natural resources were being exploited  strongly believes that international relations should be firmly based on understanding and co-operation  on the solution of problems through peaceful means based on mutual respect  and on noninterference in the internal affairs of other States. It decidedly welcomes the steps already taken towards the relaxation of international tension and considers them as positive developments. At the same time  we also believe that detente cannot be fully achieved and will always remain threatened  unless the peoples of the world are guaranteed their full rights to freedom and sovereignty and to the pursuit of their legitimate interests. This cannot be achieved unless serious action is taken to remove the causes of aggression and tension throughout the world  particularly in our Arab region. Moreover  there is also the necessity of eliminating racial discrimination  from the evils of which many peoples are still suffering  particularly on the African continent.25.	It is a source of gratification that the current session should witness the admission to membership in the world Organization of a number of emerging States  namely the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. We should like to take this opportunity to extend our warmest greetings and best wishes to the new Members  in consonance with Iraq's consistent advocacy of the principle of universality for the international Organization. The admission of these States to membership in the United Nations is an affirmation of the fact that the struggle of peoples for freedom and sovereignty is bound to be crowned with success. It is also a full confirmation of the statement made by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report ""that the march of colonial peoples towards self-determination and independence is an irreversible process of history"" [Al960llAdd.l  sect. IX].26.	This is evidenced by the positive developments on the African continent during the past year. Following the accession to' independence of Guinea- Bissau and the transfer of power to the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] as a prelude to the proclamation of the independence of Mozambique  hope has been further strengthened that the other Territories still under Portuguese domination will attain their independence. We consider these developments a triumph for the Portuguese people themselves  who  because of colonial policies  have incurred great losses and suffered many tragedies. Portugal now has the opportunity to establish normal relations based on friendship and co-operation with all the countries of the world  including Iraq.27.	Yet  in spite of those positive developments on the African continent  the racist Government of South Africa persists in its defiance of the United Nations and of world public opinion by its continued occupation of Namibia and by the practice of its hideous policy of apartheid against the indigenous population. We are gratified at the resolution adopted by the General Assembly calling upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa [resolution 3207 (XXIX)]. For our part  we call upon the Security Council to respond to that resolution and to reconsider the membership of South Africa in the United Nations. The very presence of the representatives of the racist Government of South Africa in the United Nations is a contravention of both the Charter and the principles of human rights.28.	With regard to Rhodesia  we wish to reaffirm what we have always declared concerning the necessity of supporting and implementing United Nations resolutions by making such resolutions binding  in the real sense of the word  upon all States. We believe that the British Government bears a special responsibility for the removal of the racist regime in Rhodesia  and that it should in all seriousness assume that responsibility. The presence of the racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia in our contemporary world constitutes an insult to the entire world and a shame which it must bear. The international community is called upon to employ all effective means to obliterate this insult.29.	Among the problems posing a threat to international peace and security and urging the international community to find just solutions for them is the continued tension on the Asian continent. The Vietnamese people still suffers from various forms of outside foreign intervention on the part of the United States  a situation which the Paris Agreement  signed two years ago  had supposedly terminated. The Vietnamese people is still bleeding profusely because the Saigon Administration  with encouragement from the United States  is not abiding genuinely and seriously by the terms of the Agreement.30.	As for Cambodia  because of the support given by the United States to an illegitimate regime controlling only a small area of the country  its people is still suffering from the evils and agonies of war. As a result of that situation  the international community should grant that people the rights to express its opinion  which includes occupation by its lawful Government the Government of National Union of its seat in this international Organization as the legitimate representative of the Cambodian people.31.	Regarding Korea  Iraq has welcomed the steps taken along the road towards the reunification of the Korean people and the removal of foreign occupation forces stationed in South Korea. We call upon the United Nations without any further delay to put an end to the exploitation of both its name and flag in covering up the continued presence there of the forces of occupation of the United States. We also demand that the Korean question be given a greater measure of attention which would provide conditions propitious for the reunification of the Korean people and the removal of a center of tension from that part of the world.32.	Among the new important events arousing the attention of world public opinion and constituting a serious threat to peace is the crisis in Cyprus. We wish on this occasion to affirm our basic position regarding this question and to express Iraq's support for the independence of Cyprus  its sovereignty  its territorial integrity and its continuance as a non-aligned State. We call upon all parties concerned  including Turkey  our friendly neighbor  and Greece  to which we are bound by friendly relations  and the inhabitants of the island to co-operate with each other with a view to finding appropriate solutions to this crisis in accordance with the foregoing principles and on the basis of respecting and safeguarding the rights of the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus.33.	Among the chronic questions included in the agenda of the General Assembly is the question of disarmament. Despite some achievements of the United Nations in the form of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex] and the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space  including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies [resolution 2222 (XXI)  annex]  our world is still in need of further efforts and co-operation with a view to arriving at effective formulas and solutions in this respect.34.	There are numerous sensitive areas in the world which are now threatened with grave dangers because of the presence in them of nuclear weapons. While we support the designation of the Indian Ocean and its geographical extensions as a zone of peace and the South-East Asian area as a zone of peace and co-operation  we also support in principle all proposals relating to the elimination of nuclear weapons from those areas and from the entire world.35.	We wish also to stress that there is a very small margin of difference between the peaceful and non- peaceful uses of nuclear energy. That fact was also emphasized by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  in which he stated: ""Available scientific evidence shows that there is little essential difference between explosive devices for peaceful purposes and those for nuclear weapons."" [A/9601lAdd.l  sect. X.] In the circumstances  we believe that equal rights and opportunities should be recognized for all countries in this respect. At the same time  an attempt should be made to arrive at a serious and responsible agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy which would preclude its use for military purposes.36.	One of the distinctive features of the current session is the inclusion again in the agenda of the question of Palestine. There can be no doubt that Palestine is one of the major and most important issues of our time. Because of the question of Palestine  the Middle East has for more than a quarter of a century been exposed to a state of acute tension which has strongly affected and continues strongly to affect world peace on a large and serious scale.37.	While we express our satisfaction at the inclusion of that just cause in the agenda of the General Assembly  we should like to express our point of view in an unequivocal and specific manner.38.	At the outset  it must be pointed out yet again that the Palestine question is not a result of the Zionist aggression perpetrated against the Arab countries in 1967. The issue has not arisen only today. That aggression and the current grave situation in the Arab area are but consequences of the Palestinian problem. In our opinion  it can be summed up as the question of a people expelled from its homeland by force of arms and by foreign invaders who established in that country a Fascist  racist and colonialist regime  one that cannot be justified save by the perpetuation of aggression  expansion and the fanning of the flames of war  counting on the support of colonialist forces with illegitimate interests and policies in the area  foremost among which is the United States of America. In our opinion  any attempts to ignore that historical and realistic aspect of the Palestine question would lead to a complete failure to find an appropriate solution to the problem and failure to consolidate peace and stability in the Arab region.39.	Security Council resolution 242 (1967) unjustly and illogically refers to what it calls the problem of refugees without even a reference to their identity and to the causes and circumstances of their displacement. It has now become necessary to reconsider that historic injustice  and at the same time we deem it to be incumbent upon the world Organization not to commit another grave blunder when re discussing the problem by overlooking the greater part of the truth in the interest of acknowledging merely just one part of it.40.	The Palestinian people  which has been subjected to various forms of persecution and suffering over the last 25 years and which has struggled and is still valiantly struggling for the attainment of its legitimate rights  is fully entitled to return to its homeland and to exercise its right to self-determination in that land. Those rights must be exercised without any hindrance from the Fascist and racist hegemony of the existing Zionist military regime  and they must be exercised within a genuine democratic framework. In order to be faithful to the Charter of the United Nations and to its principles  the international community must extend full and undiminished recognition to those rights which have been attained and certainly will be attained by all the oppressed peoples of the world.41.	The Fascist racist regime now established in the land of Palestine constituted and still constitutes a hotbed of aggression and tension in our area. The perpetuation of that entity and the continuance of unqualified support for it from the United States of America expose our area to a very grave state of tension. They also threaten the peace and stability of the entire world with untold perils. The October war shook the world last year  but the world should expect greater dangers if present conditions remain unchanged. A great deal was said last year concerning the attempts to arrive at a peaceful solution to the problem of the territories occupied by the aggressors in 1967. That occupation  however  still continues; and the Zionist leaders still persist in the colonization and the annexation of territories in defiance of the resolution of the United Nations and of world public opinion. What really calls for condemnation is the fact that the United States of America is still acting irresponsibly  and contrary to its alleged intentions by providing the Zionist usurpers with enormous amounts of arms and huge sums of money in addition to political support in all fields  including the support rendered within this very international Organization. Instead of discharging its international responsibilities  in cooperation with the international community  by forcing the usurper and aggressor to withdraw unconditionally  the United States of America continues the pursuit of its policies  thus exposing security and peace in the area and the entire world to the gravest perils.42.	Faced with such a situation  we wish to state our opinion that the Arab people whose lands were occupied in 1967 and the Arab people in Palestine which owns the historical right to its national soil are fully entitled to resort to all appropriate means to liberate their land and to recover their rights; it behooves the international community to stand by them and to give them all the support and assistance to which they are entitled.43.	If the international Organization has acted correctly and taken a concrete  positive step by its decision to reconsider its position regarding its relationship with South Africa  then it is high time that the United Nations reconsidered its position concerning the membership of the Fascist  racist regime established in the land of Palestine. By stating this  we call upon the General Assembly to recall the conditions of membership laid down in the Charter of the United Nations itself and to recall also the resolutions of the United Nations which have stressed time and again the rights of peoples to self-determination as well as the necessity of liquidating colonialism in all its forms from the entire world.44.	We have often spoken from this rostrum about the critical situation existing along the Iraqi-Iranian frontier ever since the Iranian Government unilaterally abrogated the frontier treaty concluded between the two countries in 1937  and by so doing  Iran was in contravention of the provisions and principles of international law and of the customs observed among the members of the international community and in international relations. Since then the Iranian Government has committed a long series of encroachments upon Iraqi sovereignty on Shatt-el-Arab and all along our land frontier. During the past years  the Iranian military forces have perpetrated numerous acts of aggression against our frontier areas. We were compelled to defend our land and sovereignty. Furthermore  the Iranian Government has openly and continuously interfered in the internal affairs of our country.45.	Bearing in mind the principles of coexistence between neighboring countries  and with the genuine desire of resolving problems through peaceful means and of establishing good relations with our neighbors  we in Iraq have been pursuing throughout the past years a policy of self-restraint  and we have been trying to confine disputes and clashes to the narrowest possible limits. Accordingly  Iraq has always called upon the Iranian Government to negotiate with a view to resolving differences through peaceful means. Among the prominent steps taken within this context was Iraq's declaration of the resumption of diplomatic relations with Iran on 7 October 1973 and the fact that it called upon Iran to negotiate. Unfortunately  the positive attitudes of Iraq were not similarly reciprocated by the Iranian Government which precipitated matters to the point of creating crisis situations through military acts of aggression committed against our borders by the Iranian forces throughout these years. We were thus compelled to refer the matter to the Security Council which decided to send a representative of the Secretary-General on a fact finding mission  The representative was requested to submit a report in this connexion  and he duly fulfilled the task entrusted to him.146.	The result of the good offices of the Secretary- General was that the two sides did come to an agreement on four points which included the consolidation of the cease-fire  the withdrawal of military concentrations all along the frontier  and the preparation of propitious conditions for bilateral discussions without any preconditions.47.	In implementation of the foregoing agreement  Iraq took the initiative of inviting Iran to make the necessary contacts with a view to the withdrawal of the concentration of troops along the borders. However  the Iranian side has so far not responded to that initiative despite the lapse of five months since the adoption of Security Council resolution 348 (1974) of 28 March 1974. Iraq also took the initiative of inviting Iran to hold bilateral discussions. Meetings were indeed held between the representatives of the two countries between 12 and 28 August last in Istanbul  and this resulted in an agreement on an agenda for further talks to be held at a higher level. On this occasion we should like to express our thanks and appreciation for the positive efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General and his special representative  in conformity with the will of the Security Council as expressed in the resolution of March 1974.48.	The present situation constitutes a state of grave tension in the Arab area which is already fraught with danger. Such a situation  if allowed to continue  can lead to dire consequences. As an independent country  Iraq is determined to preserve its independence and its sovereignty. It will spare no effort and it will do its utmost to defend itself against any violations. At the same time  Iraq fully appreciates the urgent need to put an end to the hotbeds of tension in the area  and the need to establish friendly relations so that they may prevail among the peoples of the area which are already bound together by strong historical ties. Consequently  Iraq is fully prepared to exert all possible positive efforts in order to arrive at appropriate and equitable solutions to the problems pending between the two countries in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of good neighborliness and coexistence between countries.49.	The question of the Sahara now under Spanish administration requires an urgent settlement. The termination of foreign domination over the Territory is considered a basic matter which should not be postponed any further. It is our sincere hope that the Government of Spain  with which we have maintained close relations of friendship  will co-operate and respond positively to the Arab parties concerned in order to put a final end to its domination over that Territory. For our part  we consider the Moroccan intention  proposed at the 2249th meeting  to refer the matter to the International Court of Justice as a logical and sound move leading towards a solution to this problem.50.	A quick glance at the current international economic order clearly indicates the incapacity of that order to absorb the quantitative and qualitative changes which the world has witnessed during the last two decades. That order is now suffering  more than ever before  from the symptoms of an imminent collapse. The successive waves of economic inflation which the world has experienced and the plummeting of the rate of growth of national incomes  in real terms  in many countries  as well as the disturbed balance of payments of those countries are clear indications of the dangers ahead.51.	The international community has become fully conscious of this grave situation and has realized the responsibility incumbent upon it to consider the causes and find solutions. Iraq  as President Ahmed Hassan Al-Bakr has declared  was among the first countries to call for discussion of the question within the framework of the United Nations. The appeal was made in a letter addressed by President Al-Bakr to the President of the United States last February  and the discussion took place at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  which was held as a result of the initiative of our Algerian brothers. At the special session the Assembly adopted a Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)]. That Declaration represents  in the view of many developing countries  including Iraq  the minimum of what is required. However  some industrial States attempted at the fifty-seventh session of the Economic and Social Council to shirk their responsibilities by voicing their objection to the texts of documents already agreed upon at the special session  thereby seeking to create obstacles to their implementation. We call upon those States to reconsider  and reconsider carefully  the consequences which may result from such attitudes. We also urge them not to damage their own long-term interests for the sake of ephemeral benefits.52.	It is indeed very regrettable to see some major industrial States failing to abide by the obligations of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  in spite of the passage of several years since its adoption and in spite of the adoption by various bodies of the United Nations of resolutions recommending its implementation.53.	It is really regrettable that accusations and threats should be hurled from this rostrum at developing countries which are exercising their natural right to sovereignty over their natural resources and seeking equitable prices for such resources. Those developing countries have suffered for hundreds of years from miserable conditions  as a result of the dominance of the major colonialist Powers and their monopoly of those resources in blatant disregard of the legitimate interests of their owners and of the interests of the international community at large. It is strange indeed that the developing countries  notably the oil-producing countries  should be held responsible for the inflation which is now rampant in the industrial countries. In that connexion  we should like to mention the following facts.54.	First  the international economic order in general and the international monetary system in particular have been suffering from chronic ailments for a long time. On the practical level  the international monetary system  the foundations of which were established by the Bretton Woods agreements in 1944 2 collapsed in 1971 when the United States declared its relinquishment of its obligation to exchange the American dollar for gold  and vice versa  at the fixed parity laid down in the agreement - $35 per ounce of gold. The United States adopted that measure under the pressure of a continuous deficit in its balance of payments which began in the early 1950s as a result of its military and non-military operations outside its territorial borders  and of the successive waves of economic inflation from which its economy has been suffering and is still suffering.55.	Secondly  the inflation from which the world is suffering today can be attributed in the first place to the nature of the economic order in the capitalist world. The recent wave of inflation began long before the oil-producing States started fixing more equitable prices for oil and oil products. This became only too clear in the prices of manufactured goods. In point of fact  economic inflation is a chronic ailment in the capitalist countries. It brought about ruin for many of those countries even before the discovery of oil in most of the countries which are now producing it.56.	Thirdly  the price of oil  like the prices of any other commodity  is determined by economic variables on a world scale. It is therefore unreasonable to view the energy problem and the price of oil in isolation from the prices of other raw materials  foodstuffs and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods. That is why we believe that what is called the energy crisis should be called instead ""the cheap-energy crisis""  because the price of oil  a commodity which is in the course of depletion  will always remain below its real value  not because it is a fuel used for heating but because it is a basic factor in running the machinery of economic life in the entire world.57.	Fourthly  the incredible profits made by oil companies constitute a major reason for the uneconomic increase in the price of oil in relation to the final consumer. To state an example  the profits of the seven major oil companies amounted in 1973 alone to more than $8 000 million  most of which was made outside the United States. That amount exceeds the total investments made by the oil companies in the Middle East area in the period from 1954 to 1970.58.	Fifthly  the high taxes imposed by the Governments of the oil-importing Western States upon that commodity constitute the second reason for the uneconomic rise in the price of oil to the final consumer. Studies made by the Organization of Petroleum- Exporting Countries [OPEC] show that the share received by the oil-producing countries from the price paid by the European consumer in 1967 was only 7 9 per cent  whereas the revenues of the oil-consuming Governments accruing from the taxes levied on oil accounted for 47.5 per cent of that price.59.	Some officials in the industrial countries say that we are using our natural resources as a weapon for exercising political pressure. That is indeed strange  coming from people who are using their own commodities to exercise political pressure. We wish to stress from this rostrum what we have always said: that American strategy in exploiting the energy crisis in that way is aimed not only at the oil-producing countries  particularly the Arab countries  but also at the interests of Western Europe  Japan and all the countries of the third world. We believe that as a developing country we are capable of understanding and safeguarding the basic interests of the third world  to which we belong  at the same time as we respect the legitimate interests of all other States. We refuse the tutelage of States which have never proved that they are safeguarding the interests of poorer countries. We also refuse any kind of threat  whatever form it might take.60.	On this occasion I should like to say that the Government of the Republic of Iraq  through bilateral co-operation with many of the developing countries and the non-aligned countries  has given assistance of more than $500 million to those countries throughout the current year alone.61.	We could have devoted more time to reminding those who are speaking at this session of basic axioms derived from modern and ancient history. But we prefer not to do so out of our belief that attempts at misrepresentation cannot deceive the struggling  developing countries which have known colonialism in both its old and new forms and which have experienced all its various methods.62.	If the United Nations has not been able so far  and for reasons that are beyond the power of most of its Members  to achieve the noble purposes enshrined in the Charter  we have not yet given up hope. We believe that despite all the foregoing problems  the Organization remains an indispensable instrument for the creation of an international community where security  peace and co-operation will prevail."
"62",3370,"ISL",29,1974,"Permit me to congratulate the President on his election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I wish him all success in that high office  and he can feel certain of the full confidence and support of my delegation.354.	Allow me also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General and his staff for their tireless efforts in promoting the cause of the United Nations and thus the cause of peace in the world.355.	I would also take this opportunity to join my colleagues who have welcomed the new Members of the United Nations: Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. We look forward to their co-operation and contributions to the work of the Organization.356.	A new Government was recently formed in Iceland. Participation in the United Nations is a basic element of the foreign policy of that new Government  as has been the case of all Icelandic Governments since we joined the United Nations in 1946. The Icelandic people fully realizes the necessity of global co-operation in all fields of human endeavor. We feel that the United Nations is the proper instrument to make that co-operation successful. We also realize  that that co-operation is possible only with the full and effective political backing of the United Nations by the international community.357.	Recent events have again shown the necessity to make the United Nations more effective in times of crisis. It is indeed tragic that the problem of Cyprus is with us again. The solution of 15 years ago was found only after much bloodshed  and the recent fighting has added a new chapter to a story already sad enough. We hope that all parties concerned will scrupulously respect the cease-fire now established and wilL make it possible for the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations to carry out their important and difficult task.358.	Allow me at this point to offer my sincere condolences to those Governments whose soldiers have been killed or wounded in carrying out their peace-keeping duties for the Organization.359.	It is our firm belief that a lasting solution of the Cyprus problem can be found only through peaceful means and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations  and it is of utmost importance that in all further negotiations the resolutions of the Security Council be fully carried out. And  of course  any solution must be based on respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus itself.360.	The situation in the Middle East remains enormously complex and precarious. The wisdom and patience shown in the recent disengagement agreements indicate a welcome trend which we hope will lead towards a solution of a more permanent nature. Any solution should take into account all relevant considerations  including the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. Here again  in this area  the most useful role of the United Nations peace-keeping forces cannot be over-estimated.361.	The question of decolonization has been on the agenda of the United Nations for many years. At this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly we are in the happy position of being able to welcome Guinea-Bissau as a Member and to welcome the establishment Of a provisional Government in Mozambique. We have in the past in this forum heard severe criticism of the Portuguese Government for its colonial policy. Today it is most gratifying to be able to praise the new Portuguese leadership for the important steps that are being taken in conformity with the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations to grant independence to the populations of the Colonized Territories.362.	Unfortunately  in other parts of southern Africa the African population is still being severely suppressed. All reasonable steps must be taken to bring to an early^ end the flagrant violation of human rights which is being committed in the area.363.	The Korean question was discussed at the last session of the .General Assembly more usefully  perhaps  than could have been expected. The conclusion  acceptable to both parties to the dispute  expressed the hope that further bilateral discussions aimed at peaceful reunification could take place. Regrettably  that has not been so. Whether discussions during this session will carry the question any further towards a solution remains to be seen. But  in any case  it is to be hoped that some further progress on this longstanding problem can be made in the nearest future  leading to a peaceful reunification of Korea.364.	The world situation demands that all efforts be made to enhance detente  to increase co-operation and to bring about effective disarmament. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has not yet -despite long discussions -produced satisfactory results. There is some uncertainty as to the outcome  but we feel it is of great importance that solutions be found to the weighty questions the Conference is now dealing with. 365. The situation is similar as regards the even more complex talks in Vienna on mutual force reductions in Central Europe. Progress has been slow. But we hope that those discussions will at an early date have positive results as we consider the outcome of both those series of discussions as a significant test for future developments.366.	Little headway has been made in the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union since the last session of the General Assembly  but the resumption of the negotiations renews our hopes for an agreement.367.	Nuclear tests have been continued and expanded. This sounds a new warning and shows the urgency of reaching an international agreement on a comprehensive ban on the production and testing of nuclear armaments. It is of course essential that disarmament agreements also contain provisions for a ban on the production and possession of chemical weapons.368.	While attempts are being made to solve all these armament problems  overwhelming as they sometimes seem  it is also important to look ahead and try to envisage what kinds of new problems in this field we might possibly be faced with in future years and then try  if possible  to avert them before they become acute. For this reason we look with favor upon the initiatives taken for the discussion of potential new threats in this field during this session of the Assembly.369.	Never before in the history of the United Nations have economic matters been discussed at such a high level as they were in the sixth special session of the General Assembly. That special Session has helped deepen the awareness of the increasing economic interdependence of the whole world. It is our hope that we can speed up significantly the efforts aimed at reducing the economic gap Which exists between the industrialized and the developing countries  This is one of the most urgent questions that the international community faces.370.	The Special Program to provide emergency relief and development assistance to the developing countries most seriously affected [see resolution 3202 (S-Vl)  sect; X] has got off to a slow start. A serious economic dislocation is now affecting most countries of the world  some to a disastrous degree  stifling their economic development and adding to the hunger and misery of millions of people. The Icelandic people are most sensitive to this human suffering and the Icelandic Government therefore in June this year contributed to the Special Program of emergency assistance.371.	My country has been severely hit by these recent economic developments. We are to a greater extent than most countries dependent on international trade  having to import all the oil products we use  much of the food  and practically all our requirements of raw materials. Our principal export item -fish and fish products has generally suffered a considerable reduction in price  This turn of events has led to serious economic difficulties in my country with tremendous inflationary pressures.372.	It is evident that an important aspect of these problems is. the question of a rational and just utilization of the world resources  which has.never been more urgent than now  given  on one hand  the technical means we possess and  on the other  the rapidly increasing world population.373.	The problem of energy resources has been highlighted lately by the greatly increased prices of petroleum products. The limitations in the potential supply of these products seem to make it imperative that other sources of energy. be developed. May I suggest that the United Nations has a role to play in this field by acting as a co-ordinator of research to this end. In this connexion  I wish to point to the tremendous latent geothermal potential  the utilization of which has only just commenced. 374.	My country   which depends almost entirely on the resources of the sea for its economic survival  is  as many representatives know  especially interested in the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. In the view of my Government the recently concluded session in Caracas achieved its purpose in clarifying basic alternatives and reducing their number. We are all indebted to the Government of Venezuela for providing excellent facilities for the Conference and also for providing the services of Mr. Andreas Aguilar  who performed his functions as Chairman of the Second Committee of the Conference with great distinction.	375.	Sixty States which had not been members of the preparatory committee for the Conference had the opportunity of explaining their views and being brought into the negotiating process and that objective was admirably accomplished. It was clear that no final solutions would emerge from the Caracas session  since the work proceeded on the basis of the consensus principles  and that further time would be required for the negotiating process. However  in all fields the basic issues are now reasonably well established and it is to be hoped that the forthcoming session in Geneva next spring will proceed to adopt a reasonable package solution.376.	On the basis of the discussions at Caracas it is now already possible to visualize the outlines of such a package solution. In our view it will consists of a territorial sea of 12 miles  an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 miles  a reasonable solution with regard to the continental shelf area beyond 200 miles  freedom of navigation in the economic zone  unimpeded passage through straits used for international navigation  a balanced solution for coastal State jurisdiction in connexion with pollution and scientific research  the recognition of equitable rights for land-locked States and a strong authority for the international sea-bed area which would safeguard the interests of developing countries in the proceeds from that area.377.	To my Government the most important issue is the formal adoption of an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 miles  which is now a firmly established concept that enjoys the support of the overwhelming majority of the Members of the international community. I want to use this opportunity to express the satisfaction of my Government with regard to the policy of many Governments that previously were opposed to this concept but have now given their support to it. We look forward to the continuation of the Conference on the Law of the Sea and we are confident that a solution of these matters is now well within reach. It is our hope that agreement will be reached next year with regard to an exclusive economic zone of up to 200 miles and other related otters at the Conference on the Law of the Sea  that Governments which plan to extend their coastal jurisdiction to that distance can proceed on the basis of an international convention.378.	I am not saying that the alternative would be utter chaos  because there already exists sufficient support for unilateral action in this field  if the cooperative efforts should fail  an eventuality that we all should strive to prevent. A solution in the  near future along the lines now indicated through the work of the Conference on the Law of the Sea would be the logical and reasonable result of the tremendous work which has been devoted to the problems involved. In view of this fact I want to use this opportunity to express my Government's admiration for the leadership provided by Mr. Amerasinghe  President of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The international community is greatly indebted to him for his endeavors which  I am sure  will culminate in the successful completion of the task of the Conference. Our thanks also go to the chairmen of the committees of the Conference and other officials of the Conference who have shown great devotion to duty. I wish them luck in the further exercise of their great responsibilities.379.	This is the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Twenty-nine years is indeed a very short period of time in the history of civilization. Admitting that  we ail realize how important a foundation the United Nations has created in this relatively short period of time to increase and strengthen co-operation between the nations of the world for the. benefit of mankind.380.	It is the most valuable recognition of the importance of the United Nations that none of us would like to see the world today without the Organization.As long as we all have this firm belief in the necessity of the United Nations  we are indeed on the right path leading us to a better and more just world in spite of the fact that we have not been able to progress as fast as the more optimistic had hoped and therefore we have sometimes had considerable disappointments through the years.381.	In this connexion I think it is encouraging for all of us if we recall the world situation 29 years ago. Then  almost two thirds of the 138 Members now represented in this Hall were colonies and their peoples were without the freedom  sovereignty and independence they now fortunately enjoy. Then there was very &Ue international co-operation for the furthering of. human rights and very few efforts to avert hunger and poverty in the world. And then there was no international institution to mediate in armed conflicts between nations and act as a peace-keeping force.382.	Because of the existence of the United Nations we are now living in a much better world than existed 29 years ago. Therefore we all must continue to strengthen the Organization  in the firm belief that we are contributing to a better world of tomorrow. That belief can and will  if we let it guide us in our work here  bring us each day closer to our goals. That belief is of the utmost importance for us all  since it is equally acceptable to the developing and the developed States  to the poor nations and the rich  and therefore we can unite under its banner for the creation of a more peaceful and a more just world."
"63",3417,"ISR",29,1974,"At the outset of my remarks  I wish to associate myself with all those who have expressed sorrow and sympathy at the disaster which has befallen Honduras.213.	Next  a special word of congratulations to the new Members of the United Nations—Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. The Jewish people  which was deprived of its independence for hundreds of years  is  perhaps more than any other  in a position to value the significance of national sovereignty and spiritual freedom. In the name of Israel and its people I wish them prosperity and progress.214.	Likewise  I cannot refrain from extending my warm greetings to Portugal  which has chosen the path of decolonization and of its own liberation from the burdens of empire.215.	And now  turning from those who have gained their freedom to those who have not  I am in duty bound  both from a human and a Jewish point of view  it draw the attention of this Assembly  and  thereby  that of world opinion  to the suffering and distress of a small Jewish community numbering 4 500 souls  all that is left of the ancient Jewish community of Syria  which is subjected to unceasing oppression.216.	Human rights are indivisible  and the freedom of the individual concerns us all. I am ""my brother's keeper"": it is in this spirit of international solidarity that I express the hope that the Jewish community of Syria will  as an act of humanity  be finally allowed to go.217.	In turning now to the situation of another Jewish community -the Jews of the Soviet Union  numbering more than 3 million—I voice the hope that the Soviet Government will recognize and respect the national rights of this Jewish group and permit those who so wish to leave for Israel and be reunited with their families and their people. The Jewish people  divided a? it is between East and West  has always been the first and principal victim of wars  both hot and cold  and is second to none in its yearning for peace and detente. Conflict with Powers great and small is not our desire  but we can neither keep silent nor rest until the right of every Jew to go to Israel is recognized.218.	The Soviet Union  as a multinational State  cannot indeed it has no right to ignore the aspirations of members of the Jewish national group to full national life in their historic homeland. It is not possible to solve the problem of the rights of the Jewish people in the Soviet Union  a problem anomalous from the national point of view  by means anomalous in human and moral terms. The granting of permission to go to Israel to those who want to go will not only solve an agonizing Jewish problem which is unique in human history  but  I believe  will also provide the solution for a Soviet problem with which the Soviet Government has struggled for many years.219.	In expressing appreciation for what has already been done  I appeal to the Soviet Government to show greater generosity  to cease harassing those who have applied to emigrate  to release the prisoners of Zion  to open the gates  and they will earn the praises of civilized men everywhere for their humanity.220.	Our world is at a crossroads: on the one hand  affluence  waste and indifference; on the other  starvation  short expectation of life and untold suffering. Each of the States Members of the United Nations  and the Organization as a whole  must  as soon as possible  base its economic  technological and political cooperation on the concept of one world  all of whose parts and policies are interconnected. If not  the most gloomy of prophecies on the fate of humankind will be realized  and this at a time when man has reached the heights of scientific and technological advance. Unlimited resources to eliminate starvation and sickness are at hand. What is lacking is the goodwill  human responsibility and governmental understanding to establish a new international system which will advance mankind to lives of greater dignity and happiness  lives without war  lives of plenty and spiritual satisfaction. To this end it would be well to examine anew the existing international in order to see whether it is able to cope with these great and urgent tasks.221.	Social justice is a concept which is no longer confined to the boundaries of States. Our world is now faced with stark alternatives: to proceed along the false path  whose end cannot be seen  of a widening gap between rich and poor nations; or to embark on constructive international cooperation.222.	As Jawaharlal Nehru so wisely put it: ""The law of life should not be the competition of acquisitiveness but cooperation  the good of each contributing to the good of all.""223.	The alternatives faced by our generation are cooperation or decline. {Let us cooperate. Israel  though small in size and limited in resources  and itself still in the stage of development  is doing its best to cope with the manifold problems of a poor and semiarid land  and with the integration of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Nevertheless it has in the past provided such assistance as it could to other developing countries in all continents in the fields of science  education and economic and social development  and will gladly extend such aid in the future.224.	One year has passed since the Yom Kippur War -a bloody encounter started by Egypt and Syria  reinforced by contingents from other Arab States  and enjoying the material and political support of the Soviet Union. More than 2 500 Israeli soldiers lost their lives in that war  more than 12 000 Egyptians and more than 3 000 Syrians and others. Most of them died in the bloom of youth and left bereaved parents  widows and orphans behind them. Israeli prisoners were savagely maltreated in Syrian and Egyptian prisons. More than 40 000 men were wounded  and many permanently disabled. The agony of bereavement of the widows  of the orphans and of the disabled is shared equally by the peoples on both sides of the lines.225.	Following this war the Security Council adopted resolution 338 (1973)  paragraph 3 of which reads:""The Security Council""Decides that  immediately and concurrently with the ceasefire  negotiations shall start between the parties concerned under appropriate auspices aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.""226.	It is not to the credit of the Security Council that it was only in October 1973 -24 years after the signature in 1949 of the General Armistice Agreements between Israel  Egypt  Jordan  Lebanon and Syria- that it specifically called for peace negotiations. That  at any rate  was progress and it is better late than never. But why did so important and essential a resolution have to wait until the end of the sanguinary war of October last?227.	The disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt  and between Israel and Syria  also represent a measure of progress. Since the 1967 Arab Summit Conference in Khartoum  with its triple negatives -no peace  no recognition  no negotiations- this was a first positive step. It was taken in the light of the experience of the war  and as a result of the constructive initiative of the United States and of the remarkable efforts of its Secretary of State  Mr. Kissinger.228.	But here  too  the same grave question presents itself: why did that come so late  and why only after bloodshed? After all  partial arrangements could have been reached without war  and before the war  both in the Suez Canal area and on the Golan Heights. In 1971 Israel responded affirmatively to the American proposal for proximity talks for a partial agreement with Egypt  and there was no reason why  as time went on  we should not have responded in the same way to proposals for similar talks with the other neighboring States. It was the other side that rejected the proposal and thus killed that constructive initiative for no good reason. In the event we did finally have face-to-face talks  that is to say  something more than proximity talks  at the first session of the Geneva Conference  at the negotiations between Israel and Egypt at kilometer 101 on the CairoSuez road  and on the occasion of the signature of the agreement with Syria in Geneva. Why then should this have been done at the cost of tens of thousands of casualties on both sides?229.	If further proof were required  the October War showed clearly that there is not  there cannot be  and there never will be  a military solution of the ArabIsrael conflict  which persists beyond all reason and beyond all political realism: a conflict which saps the very marrow from the bones of all the peoples of the area and  despite the extensive resources of our area  debilitates their economies and their societies.230.	Let us look at the facts. In this war the aggressors enjoyed three marked advantages which  under normal circumstances  should have been decisive: first  overwhelming strength in manpower and modern sophisticated weaponry; secondly  initiative; and  thirdly  surprise. Yet despite these great advantages the citizen army of Israel rapidly overcame the effect of the surprise  halted the forward movement of the attacking forces and passed over to a bold counteroffensive which brought Israel troops well beyond the former ceasefire lines in the Golan Heights and into large areas to the west of the Suez Canal  thus surrounding the Egyptian Third Army. I do not think that any particular military expertise is required to realize what would have happened to the aggressors' forces if  at that stage  the Security Council had not hurriedly called for a ceasefire  which  of course  it did not do earlier  before it became clear that the wheel had turned in Israel's favor.231.	That is the essential difference between an Israeli victory and an Arab victory. If the Arab armies had triumphed  the world would have witnessed an act of genocide  whereas the Arab defeat was limited to the field of battle  and in fact opened the window to the beginnings of reason and to a small step  a very small step  in the political sphere.232.	If  despite the advantages which the Arab armies had in manpower  armaments  initiative and surprise  these were the results of the October War  what could another war bring  besides more victims  and more suffering? Another war like that would only create new complex problems the solution of which will be infinitely more difficult.233.	I do not mention these things with joy  but with sorrow. I do not wish to exult in the Israeli victory nor to embarrass Egypt and Syria. On the contrary  at this time when it is the duty of us all to make a special effort to advance towards a political settlement  it is incumbent that all refrain from provocative statements and disparaging slogans. I recall these things only because I want to repeat  and to emphasize  that there can be no military solution to this pernicious conflict. Reinforcement of the armaments of the Arab countries might encourage new aggression but it cannot decide the issue in a new war.234.	After the October War  there can again be no doubt that not a single one of the problems encompassed in the ArabIsraeli dispute can be solved by war  and that  in the same way  there is no problem  including the question of the independent identity of the Palestinians  which cannot be solved by sincere negotiations between the parties. Let us therefore do our utmost to ensure that the unnecessary war of Yom Kippur 1973 will be the last war ever to be fought between Arab and Israeli.235.	Israel has naturally drawn its conclusions from the last war. But we wish to continue to progress along the political road  which opened after the war. However  if a new war is forced on us  we shall be ready. I hope and pray that our neighbors have also drawn conclusions from October 1973  and that they agree with us that it is time to finally abandon the course of armed force so as to devote their efforts consistently  patiently and seriously to the political option.236.	The disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt on the one hand and between Israel and Syria on the other  in which the emergency forces of the United Nations under the leadership of the SecretaryGeneral are playing a praiseworthy part  may provide a suitable opening. These agreements are not only military in character; they also have their political aspects.237.	First  the very fact of negotiations  sometimes indirect and sometimes direct  is a political and psychological step forward for all those who desire peace in our area and in the world.238.	Secondly  an emended period of tranquility at the fronts has also made a contribution to the creation of the new climate and also possibly of a new dynamic for a political solution.239.	Thirdly  the disengagement agreements include the following paragraph:""This agreement is not regarded by Egypt and Israel as a final peace agreement. It constitutes a first step toward a final  just and durable peace according to the provisions of Security Council resolution 338 (1973) and within the framework of the Geneva Conference.""5There is a similar paragraph in the IsraelSyria agreement.6240.	But the disengagement agreements and mutual observance of the ceasefire are not enough. We must go forward with negotiations  without prior conditions  keeping constantly in mind the idea of peace and mutual tolerance in order to plant the seeds of trust which are vital for the creation of an atmosphere of conciliation  compromise and understanding.241.	This objective is at cross purposes with the continuation of a state of belligerency  which not only contains within itself the dangers of renewal of hostilities  with all their horror and suffering  but also diverts the major part of the human resources and the wealth of the area to the buildup and maintenance of huge armies at the cost of its social and economic development. This useless aberration has already held back an entire generation  and its persistence will cause further suffering to millions.242.	There is a historical paradox here. The Middle East is one of the richest areas of the globe. It has natural wealth  fertile soil  abundant water for irrigation  international lines of communication  incomparable sites for pilgrimage and tourism and old  historic peoples possessed of ancient cultures and modern skills alike. But this bountifully endowed area is still  from the social and economic point of view  one of the most backward in the world.243.	It would not be difficult to prove that the expenditure of vast treasure on weapons of war and on the maintenance of huge armies is one of the main factors in this backwardness. The Soviet Union is doing no service to the people of the area when it counts weapons of war among its main exports to some of the countries of the Middle East as if these  and not means of production and technological agreements  can raise these nations from their misery. This Soviet policy  which is inspired by a one-sided  antiIsrael attitude and by incitement to intransigence and inflexibility  is one of the principal causes of tension in the Middle East and is used deliberately as a major means of Soviet implantation in a number of the countries of the area at the expense of their sovereignty. It is a policy that stands in stark contradiction to the spirit and objectives of detente  on which the hopes of all of us rest.244.	I am bound to state with emphasis that either detente will be global and apply to the Middle East as well  or there will be no detente at all. Detente which does not include the Middle East is without political or strategic meaning.245.	Peace and cooperation between the peoples of our region are needed not only to strengthen our economies and develop our societies but  not less vitally  to ensure the true independence of all peoples of the Middle East. There is no validity in a peace which serves the interests of one side only; and there is no substance in a peace dictated by one side to another or by a third party extraneous to both. Such a peace will always be precarious and temporary. As Albert Einstein once said: ""Peace cannot be kept by force; it can be achieved only by understanding"". Only a peace founded on respect for the interests of both parties can be genuine  stable and durable. The geo-strategic conditions which have evolved in the Middle East make such a peace possible  that is to say  a peace which will provide on the one hand a satisfactory solution for the interests of all the Arab States and also for the needs of the Palestinians  and on the other a solution for Israel's vital need for defensible borders.246.	Israel would be prepared to give favorable consideration to a significant territorial compromise  but it cannot compromise on its security. In short  I sincerely believe that it is possible to achieve peace agreements which will serve the reasonable interests of the parties to the dispute and will open a new chapter in the history of each of the States of the Middle East and of the whole region. But up to now the Arab States have  regrettably  pursued a sterile policy of ""not an inch""  while Israel has set her face towards peace  a peace of equitable compromise  even though it might be painful to both sides. In order to reach this lofty objective we would prefer negotiations for a full and integral peace agreement. But  if it transpires that the conditions are not yet ripe for this  the possibilities might be examined of reaching interim agreements  based on compromise  which will put an end to belligerency in its various components  that is to say  interim agreements providing for effective mutual security arrangements that in the course of time will lead to negotiations for a peace treaty which will determine  inter alia  the final borders.247.. Israel is cognizant of the existence of the question of Palestinian identity. It holds that it can and should be resolved in the context of the settlement of the dispute with its neighbor to the east. It is there  on both sides of the Jordan  that the great majority of the Palestinian population is concentrated. Moreover  most of the citizens of Jordan are Palestinians and most of the Palestinians are Jordanian citizens. It is also a fact that the area east of the Jordan is an integral part of the historic land of Israel or Palestine and that it is already the national home of the Palestinians. If there is any ethnic significance in the Palestinian concept it applies equally to the peasant  the townsman and the Bedouin east of the Jordan and to the peasant  the townsman and the Bedouin to its west. It is in the light of these considerations that the Israel Government  on 21 July 1974  resolved that:""The Government will work towards negotiations for a peace agreement with Jordan.""The peace will be founded on the existence of two independent States only—Israel  with united Jerusalem as its capital  and a JordanianPalestinian Arab State  east of Israel  within borders to be determined in negotiations between Israel and Jordan. In this State  the independent identity of the Jordanian and Palestinian Arabs can find expression in peace and good neighborliness with Israel.""248.	However  the Palestinian community in general must in no way be equated with the terrorist organizations. From my own personal acquaintance with this community I refuse to identify it  or at least its great majority  with the terrorist group known as the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  which is not a national liberation movement but the roof organization of disunited and splintered terrorist groups whose pretensions are not supported by the broad masses of the Palestinian population. It is a fact that more Arabs than Israelis have been killed by these organizations. It is also a fact that more terrorists have been killed in the armed clashes between regular Arab forces and the terror gangs and between the rival terror gangs themselves than by Israeli security forces.249.	These facts are obvious to anybody who cares to examine them. We refuse to recognize the PLO and we will not recognize it  because of its doctrines and of its deeds alike. The charter of Palestine  which embodies the political ideology of the PLO  stands in direct contradiction to the Charter of the United Nations. It denies absolutely the right of Israel to exist and postulates its destruction as a principal objective.250.	This ideology is accompanied by the criminal methods of warfare used by the organizations which make up the PLO  methods such as indiscriminate terror  deliberate murder of women and children  pupils and teachers  athletes at the Olympic Games  passengers on a Sw.ss airliner  chance visitors and Jewish and Christian pilgrims at airports  and Arab women workers in Galilee. In reality the situation here is not that of a subject people trying to liberate itself with its own underground forces  but of gangs of desperadoes imposing themselves on a people and attempting to form and dominate it by means of the destruction of another people: this at a time when there is ample room for two States  Jewish and Arab  to coexist in peace in the historic land of Israel or Palestine on both sides of the Jordan  their common border to be determined by negotiations.251.	It is of course no secret that with the* parliamentary situation existing in the General Assembly  the preconceived ideas held by a great number of those taking part here  and the irrelevant considerations which guide many delegations  a majority might concede the PLO demands. A resolution that would do so will be regarded by Israel as an arbitrary resolution  one impinging on its fundamental rights  illegal and not binding in any way. Every representative here would reject a resolution which strikes at the foundation of his country's being. One cannot ask of any nation to agree to its own elimination or to commit suicide.252.	Understanding for the needs of the Palestinians -certainly; satisfaction of the demands of arch murderers who appoint themselves as saviors- decidedly not.253.	I regret that many Members of the United Nations do not delve into this problem thoroughly  with the consequence that  either deliberately or through misunderstanding  they reward these murderers and in so doing stoke the fires in the Middle East. Israel will not submit to violence and terror. Terrorism is an infectious disease which knows no national frontiers. Many States have already paid the price of submission to terrorism  and I am afraid that the last word has not been said on the subject. Following the latest terrorist attacks in Paris and at the Hague  President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said: ""Violence  which is sometimes presented and justified as an avant-garde act  is nothing but the rising to the surface of those depths of barbarism and primitive cruelty of which humanity has devoted all its efforts to rid itself."" These are trenchant words  but there is need for action and for courageous cooperation in order to put an end to manifestations of terror before further disasters occur.254.	The essence of the PLO is terror. It is no coincidence that whenever a concrete proposal for a political solution is put forward  the PLO leadership rises up against any such peace initiative. Its insistence on including the question of Palestine in the agenda of this General Assembly session is designed  above all  to destroy the prospects of the political efforts at the very beginning. A debate on this matter cannot fail to poison the international atmosphere. Acceptance of the PLO demands may well condemn the prospects of the negotiating process to failure  just when the first ray of light has been glimpsed on the horizon.255.	Palestinians who wish to give constructive expression to their independent identity can be helped to do so in the context of the negotiations with Jordan. Moreover  I would not agree to a genera! settlement without including in it the satisfaction of the needs of the Palestinians. It is  after all  not Israel which has prevented the crystallization of what is known as ""Palestinian identity"". To the extent that such a desire existed among the Palestinians  it is the Arab States that have frustrated it during all these years. If not  how can one explain the fact that during 19 years of Arab rule in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank  this identity never achieved any definite form or full expression?256.	The joint communique by Egypt  Syria and the PLO in Cairo  on 21 September 1974  also deals a blow to the prospects of a constructive solution to the issue of Palestinian identity. In the same way that the PLO bends all  ts efforts to prevent political progress in the area  certain Arab States are whittling down the hopes for a solution of the Palestine question by granting the terrorist organizations the monopoly of representation of the Palestinians  when they know perfectly well that these organizations are not able to be a party to negotiations because of what they are.257.	There is no sadder example of the heartless attitude of the Arab Governments than the freeze they have imposed on the status of the 1948 refugees. It is true that many of them have been absorbed in the economies of the Arab States in which they now live  but there has been a deliberate policy to prevent a constructive solution to this sore problem in order to exploit human suffering for political and propaganda ends. If the problem in itself were not so sad I would say that there is nothing more ludicrous than the annual fundraising efforts of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to make up the deficit in its budget  and this at a time when the Arab oil States command the biggest monetary reserves in the world.258.	Israel did not adopt this course-not towards the 600 000 Jewish refugees who fled the Arab States stripped of all their possessions and not towards the survivors of the millions of Jews destroyed by the Nazis  with the blessing of the Mufti Haj Amin el Husseini  who found refuge among his own kind in Nazi Berlin and Fascist Rome. All of these were fully absorbed in Israel -economically  socially and culturally.259.	In the light of the vast economic opportunities which now exist in the Middle East  the refugee problem must and can be solved. Far more difficult refugee situations in other parts of the world have been solved long ago. Given goodwill -without which no problem can be resolved- the question of compensation for both Arab and Jewish refugees can be settled. Israel is contributing and will continue to contribute its share in the solution of this painful human problem.260.	There are those who foresee the approach of war on this or that front in the Middle East. As far as Israel is concerned  we shall faithfully observe the ceasefire and the separation of forces agreements  on a reciprocal basis  until they are replaced or supplemented by new agreements. But in the same way as we shall display the utmost goodwill in seeking to achieve balanced and constructive progress in the political sphere  we shall neither submit nor lend ourselves to the blackmail of threats of war or even of war itself.261.	We want to see progress in the efforts to achieve a political solution  both as an end in itself and as a means of avoiding war. In the face of the rapid rearmament of the other side  we shall strengthen our forces in order to prevent war or to gain victory if  God forbid  it should break out anew. At the same time  we shall continue to seek a settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. In other words  we shall prepare for the worst and hope and work for the best.262.	In one of his recent speeches  President El Sadat said that our generation must be satisfied with the end of belligerency and that the treaty of peace would be signed by the coming generation. I am astonished that so distinguished a statesman should renounce the great and historic opportunity to bring about peace and cooperation. I trust that this was not his last word. Peace should not be postponed to the next generation. It is the duty of the generations which have taken part in the war to overcome their differences and to assure peace for their descendants. Let us all do our best to secure peace speedily in our time. It is possible. In order to achieve it  one needs perhaps more courage than is needed for the decision to go to war. Let us all demonstrate both wisdom and courage for the benefit of all the peoples of our region."
"64",3464,"ITA",29,1974,"215.	 Mr. President  I should like first of all  on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy  Mr. Moro  and of the Italian delegation  to congratulate you upon your unanimous election. There are many reasons for my sincere congratulations: the ties which friendship and a common Mediterranean civilization have forged between our two countries; my Government's appreciation of the foreign policy of the Algerian Government; and admiration for your personal qualities as a statesman and a diplomat.216.	On behalf of the Italian delegation  I should like to pay a tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Benites and to thank him for having presided so ably and successfully over the proceedings of our twenty-eighth session as well as those of the sixth special session. In his person  the Italian delegation wishes to pay homage to the qualities of all the peoples of the Latin American countries  with which my country also has profound ties of friendship. And it is with feelings of solidarity that today I single out among them Honduras  which has just been struck by a tragedy which has deeply moved the Italian Government and people.217.	The Italian delegation also takes great pleasure in paying a tribute to the outstanding personality of the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  and in expressing its appreciation of his wise and persevering efforts  particularly in the search for just solutions to the crises which recently have again obscured the international political horizon.'218. .As many other representatives who spoke before me pointed out  we are confronted with an international situation which gives cause for serious concern. The Middle East question is still full of grave unknowns; the Cyprus crisis has exacerbated the problems between the two communities on the island and has made  relations difficult between two countries which are nevertheless bound by political ties; and the agreements on Viet Nam have not yet-yielded the peace which was expected.219.	Furthermore   the disarmament negotiations have not so far fulfilled the hopes of mankind  which aspires to live in a world free from fear.220.	Finally  the economic situation- the seriousness of which was drawn to our attention by the President of the United States of America- has led the Secretary-General  in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  to speak of problems ""which now confront the world community with a global crisis of extraordinary dimensions""  of ""upheavals"" and ominous ""portents"" which  far from being isolated events  are ""the symptoms of a profound malfunctioning of the global economy"" [AI960II Add.l].221.	Fortunately  we can also mention some encouraging events. These include  first of all  the admission of three new Members to the Organization  which gives us cause for great satisfaction because the United Nations is thereby drawing closer to one of its chief goals  namely  the universal representation of mankind.222.	The admission of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau has a special significance  because it is a sign both of improvement in the political situation on the subcontinent of South Asia- which gives good reason to hope for the future -and also of the acceleration of the process of decolonization  especially on the African continent.223.	In this connexion I should like to refer in particular to the Algiers Agreement between Portugal and Guinea-Bissau and to the Lusaka Agreement concerning the independence of Mozambique. These Agreements are important not simply because they will avert further bloodshed. The chain of events that brought to an end the authoritarian regime in Portugal and the joint communique concerning the implementation of United Nations resolutions issued at the end of the Secretary-General's visit to Lisbon  as well as the Algiers and Lusaka Agreements  show that freedom is an indivisible benefit which cannot be denied to others if it is sought for oneself. It shows  furthermore  the role played in the process of decolonization by the United Nations as a whole  by certain groups of States and by certain individual Member States.224.	In this respect I should like to mention three recent Italian statements.225.	On 10 June  the Italian Government indicated that it viewed as a positive development the opening of negotiations between Portugal and the liberation movements in its overseas Territories and pledged Italy's contribution ""aimed at ensuring the speedy realization of the right of the African peoples to self-determination and independence  in conformity with the principles of the United Nations"".226.	On 12 August  in announcing its recognition of Guinea-Bissau  the Italian Government issued a statement stressing that it had ""always expressed its support for the decolonization of the .Non-Self-Governing Territories and for the grafting of the right to self-determination and independence of peoples still under colonial rule"".227.	On 15 September  the Italian Government issued a statement which concluded with the following words:""Italy is glad to have contributed to the process of negotiations between Portugal and FRELIMO  thus facilitating contacts designed to help towards a better understanding of the objectives and the viewpoints of the interested parties. This clearly reflects the full and constant adherence of Italy to the objectives of self-determination and independence of peoples still subject to colonial rule  and also Italy's recognition of the role that can be played in bringing about peaceful decolonization by political forces which express the aspirations  of the peoples.""228.	All these statements were prompted by events connected with the decolonization of the Territories under Portuguese administration; but they have a broader significance because they reflect Italy's conviction that the gradual process of decolonization must be completed as soon as possible.229.	Similarly  Italy rejects all ideologies or policies based on racial discrimination  particularly apartheid. At the 2248th meeting  held this morning  again the Italian delegation demonstrated this rejection by voting in favor of the draft resolution in document A/L.731/Rev.l  although certain parts of its text give rise  in our opinion  to doubts of a legal character. My country reaffirms its commitment firmly to support the efforts of the Organization aimed at ensuring  as required of us by the Charter  ""respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion"" .230.	Many changes  have taken place in the almost 30 years of the life of the Organization. The Assembly will have to take account of these changes when it considers the proposals concerning the revision of certain provisions of the Charter  submitted by many Member countries  including Italy  with a view to enabling the United Nations better to face an international situation that is very different from the postwar situation  and which is evolving at an ever-increasing pace.231.	Meanwhile another useful  although more modest  objective could be attained  namely  the achievement of the maximum degree of rationality and efficiency in the use of the human and financial resources that the Organization already has at its disposal  paying special attention to the proper selection of staff and the prudent use of the Organization's funds.232.	I should now like to refer to the international economic situation. It is beset  as I have said  by disturbance of alarming proportions. On the one hand  per capita and national income are being eroded by a rate of inflation which the world has not known for more than a generation; on the other hand  we are facing the threat of a world-wide recession.233.	These developments are upsetting the political and social equilibrium of all countries and damaging their prospects of development. Furthermore  this could mean that  if everyone tries individually to limit the consequences of this situation or to escape them  we would all find ourselves exposed to a danger that might perhaps be even more serious: the danger that  as in the 1930s  international co-operation may give way to narrow self-interest and bring about a reduction in world trade which would be harmful to all countries without distinction.234.	To counter such a serious threat we must rely on the awareness we have today of the ties of interdependence which link the different economic systems. That interdependence  we must not forget  implies also a joint responsibility in the decisions we must take  either collectively or within the framework of our respective national policies  in order to ■ build a world-wide commercial and monetary order which will enable us  on a more stable and above all a more just basis  to go forward together along the path of development.235.	The initiative taken by the President of Mexico for the elaboration of a charter of the economic rights and duties of States is based on these fundamental principles of justice and stability. Italy Welcomed this initiative with great interest  and the Italian delegation hopes that the contacts that will take place during this session will enable substantial progress to be made.236.	The need for a more stable and just basis for international economic relations was  moreover  recognized by the General Assembly when it held its sixth special session last April.237.	In the absence of a new commercial and monetary order  the present Situation severely affects mainly those peoples who have not accumulated financial wealth and natural resources of their own  or have far top few  and so can offer  in terms of exports  nothing but their work. This is true of many developing countries  and especially the poorest among them. It is these that are most in danger of suffering from the irreparable consequences of the energy crisis  the monetary crisis and  perhaps  tomorrow  even from a serious economic depression. Italy has a feeling of solidarity with these countries because  while being at a different level of development  it is also lacking in natural resources and the world crisis is causing it problems out of all proportion to its own financial resources.238.	The future will depend on the extent to which genuine international co-operation and solidarity can be achieved in confronting the structural problems of the world economy with a view to ensuring a better and fairer distribution of the world's wealth  a more effective and better balanced utilization of resources and a better relationship between man and his environment. I am thinking in particular of such problems as energy  population  food  development financing  technological progress and the transfer of technology.239.	It was this conviction that prompted Italy to contribute  within the European Economic Community  to a positive response to the appeal by the Secretary-General for an emergency program for the benefit of the countries most affected by the present economic crisis. Italy views in the same light the relations between the European Economic Community and the countries of the Third World  whether they are associated with or eligible for association with the European Economic Community  or whether they are other countries with which my country maintains ties of traditional friendship.	240.	Only recently [2238th meeting] the representative of France  speaking as a representative of the country holding the current presidency of the European Economic Community  requested the inclusion in the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly of an item on the granting to the European Economic Community of observer status at the United Nations. This is an initiative which  among other things  will facilitate the task of associating the European Economic Community with the Organization in the quest for solutions acceptable to all.241.	As for the energy problem  the Italian Government has always felt that any confrontation between the oil-producing and the oil-consuming countries must be avoided by guaranteeing  on the one hand  the right of each country to dispose freely of the resources of its own territory  and by avoiding  on the other hand  a crisis in prices and supplies whose consequences would ultimately disrupt the economies of all countries.242.	This was the spirit in which Italy participated in international meetings on the energy problem  such as those of the Co-ordinating Group of Twelve  whose objective remains the rapid initiation of a constructive dialog with the producing countries. It was also in the same spirit that Italy supported the Algerian initiative for the convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly.243.	Italy  which depends for its energy resources almost entirely on foreign countries  and whose economic progress is closely linked to the development of international trade  is particularly sensitive to the needs of the developing countries  without whose co-operation and agreement no permanent solution to the economic problems of the world will ever be found.244.	To sum up: the right of the producing countries to utilize their own resources in a more rational manner; the need to stabilize prices at just and profitable levels for all; the channeling of earnings from oil exports into productive uses; stable economic co-operation between producers  industrial consumers and non-producing developing countries -these  in the Italian Government's view  are the principles that must guide us.245.	The need to adopt a global approach to these problems has  in any case  been recognized by the United Nations  as is shown by the three major initiatives which it decided with foresight to take this year. I am referring to the World Population Conference  the World Food Conference  and the Second General Conference of UNIDO to be held next spring.246.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  whose second session was recently held at Caracas  is part of the same pattern of international co-operation. It is to be hoped that in this field  which is so important to mankind  equitable solutions can soon be worked out which will reconcile the legitimate interests of different States with those of the international community.247.	It is quite clear that an appeal for international economic co-operation wilt be possible only if the maintenance of peace in the various parts of the globe is assured. In this respect  we are well aware that the question of the Middle East and the Cyprus crisis are a source of particularly grave concern to my country in view of the geographical position it occupies in the Mediterranean.248.	In the Middle East the tensions persist  and even seem to be growing more acute  despite some progress made  thanks to the efforts of the United States Secretary of State; this progress has led to the establishment of a negotiation framework situated  appropriately  within the United Nations system and to the conclusion of agreements on military disengagement  the observance of which is guaranteed mainly by the United Nations  I believe that a new and decisive effort will have to be made to overcome the differences which divide the parties directly concerned: this calls  first of all  for a courageous contribution from these same parties  in the conviction that their real interests require that a just and lasting peace  advantageous to all the peoples of the region  may be established through negotiations.249.	The purpose of such negotiations must be to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) in its entirety. In this decision the Security Council laid down the principles for a settlement of the Conflicts that would ensure the sovereignty and the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the area  within secure and recognized boundaries. The withdrawal from all the territories occupied after 4 June 1967  in accordance with the principles Of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force  is a  basic requirement for the restoration of peace. The security of all States in the area even more than the military equilibrium  which can never be adequate must be sought in a political agreement based on the conviction that coexistence between those States is not only necessary but also possible.250.	The other main aspect of the crisis in the Middle East concerns the Palestinian people  who cannot and must not be further deprived of the opportunity to decide their own future. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy  Mr. Moro  already had occasion to state in 1970 that this is a problem of a political nature  since the Palestinian people cannot be denied the right to a land of their own. Hence the importance of the debate on the Palestinian question  which the Arab countries have placed before this session of the General Assembly. Let us hope that the debate will be constructive  that is  inspired by a sense of fairness and realism  and that really useful suggestions for the peace negotiations may emerge from it.251.	In any case  it is essential^ as of now  that the progress of these long-awaited negotiations should not be jeopardized by military moves. In this context  we feel it is imperative to extend the mandates of the United Nations forces stationed in the Middle East  whose functions have been defined in the disengagement agreements. Italy hopes  moreover  that there will be no recurrence of terrorist acts which the international community cannot allow  whatever the motives behind them or of reprisals or preventive action  which we also strongly condemn  not only because these acts also cause innocent victims but furthermore because they mostly take place in the territory of Lebanon  whose integrity is an essential factor in the stability of the situation in the region.252.	As for Cyprus  the tensions which have punctuated the crisis with outbursts of violence -while this crisis was still latent were aggravated by the tragic consequences of the coup d'etat on 15 July. It is more important than ever to work out a solution that will take account of the legitimate aspirations of the two communities  affording each of them effective protection that will enable them to live together in peace and thus securely guarantee the maintenance of the island's sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence. This is the Wish of my country   which has always lent its unconditional support to the efforts of the United Nations in Cyprus  and which has given its backing to the action of the Security Council  most opportunely seized of the matter by the Secretary-General as reflected in resolution 353 (1974)  which forms the basis of subsequent recommendations 253.	In spite of the intervention of the United Nations  and the parallel intervention of various countries  the Conference held at Geneva did not produce the hoped-for results and we witnessed the recurrence in Cyprus of a tragedy which compelled tens of thousands of people to abandon their homes.254.	The talks recently stalled by the representatives of the two Cypriot communities  following inter alia the intervention of the Secretary-General  in order to remedy this tragic situation  deserve our encouragement  as there is reason to hope that political developments will emerge from them.255.	As to the substance of the problem  the nine countries of the European Community have made numerous efforts  both collectively and individually. These nine countries attach special importance to the speedy solution of a crisis affecting a region so close to Italy in consideration of the ties between the Community and the countries involved  which the nine members would like to see further strengthened. It is thus to be hoped that the parties will do their utmost to ensure the resumption of negotiations  with due respect for national dignity  on both sides  bearing in mind the changes that have occurred on the island since the Zurich and London Agreements on the understanding that the independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of the island are beyond question.256.	The problem of peace is not confined to its restoration in the areas in which there are conflicts or latent crises. It is  in fact  far broader in scope  being linked to the problem of security  which would be precarious if it continued to be based on the tenuous balance of mutual fear.257.	On the subject of disarmament  I have already spoken of the none-too-satisfactory results achieved thus far. It is to be hoped that the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament will be more successful than it has been so far in devising further disarmament measures  especially as it can count on the contribution of five new members.258.	With regard to the problem of nuclear weapons  the Italian Government reaffirms its support for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It is still preoccupied by the obstacles which seem to impede the attainment of the goal pursued by the Treaty  that is  the non-dissemination of atomic weapons. It considers it both possible and necessary to safeguard the prospects of a fuller utilization of atomic energy for peaceful purposes; to this end it hopes that  at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty  'the most careful consideration will be given to the possibilities of adapting the Treaty to the new international realities so that it convey the universal support which is an essential prerequisite for its success.259.	While on the subject of the non-proliferation Treaty  I should like to Call attention to its article VI  which places in an overall perspective the problem involved in arriving  through measures in the nuclear and conventional fields  at general and complete disarmament under rigorous and effective international control  which the entire international community wishes to attain! That is still a distant goal  and it wouldbe naive to underestimate the obstacles to be surmounted before reaching it  although a major step has already been taken in that direction with the establishment of a climate of detente in East-West relationships.260.	World detente presupposes detente between the great Powers  but detente cannot achieve its full significance unless the understandings between them are accompanied by persevering and constructive contacts with all other countries. Conceived  as it was  as the only possible alternative to the appalling danger of a nuclear conflict  the detente is slowly but surely acquiring a fuller political content. As a result of that development  it's  the longer simply a policy aimed at stabilizing international coexistence. The time has come to progress to an active phase of co-operation between States to seek a new model and new rules for the conduct of all international relations.261.	Those are the motives underlying the two major multilateral Conferences being held in Geneva and Vienna -the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Conference for a Reciprocal and Balanced Reduction of Forces in Central Europe. At those two Conferences  the countries of Europe given a common destiny by history  but so often made antagonists by the same history are playing a leading role in the conviction that a way must be found to overcome the artificial barriers of mistrust and hostility.262.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe aims at an in-depth discussion of the common problems of a group of countries whose understandings cannot be based on solid foundations unless they are accompanied by an improvement in relations between peoples and individuals. That European meeting  which is taking place as the first contacts are being made between the European Economic Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  is the outcome of an awareness of certain realities that are now established and whose recognition constitutes the basis for a lasting peace. In that spirit  which implies the intention to end the state of political uncertainty that has prevailed since 1945  there can be no doubt that the provisions of Articles 53 and 107 of the United Nations Charter must be considered obsolete.263.	Security and co-operation in Europe cannot be dissociated from security and co-operation in the Mediterranean  which is a natural political and economic extension of Europe. Italy has consistently  maintained that there is a link between the security of those two zones. It reiterated that view in June 1972  and particularly in November of the same year -that is  at the beginning of the preparations for the European Conference. That action resulted in the introduction into resolutions adopted at Helsinki of several paragraphs which  in referring to that link  enabled some non-European Mediterranean countries to state their views at the Geneva Conference.264.	In this statement  which is already quite lengthy  I shall not touch on other topics  such as the Atlantic Alliance  in which Italy loyally participates  convinced that it still plays an indispensable role in the maintenance of international stability and in the progressive opening-up of broader and more fruitful prospects for co-operation between peoples  including peoples with different political systems.265.	Special mention should be made of the opening of a Euro-Arab dialog  an initiative which resulted from the Arab Summit Conference of Algiers and the Copenhagen meetings in which you  Mr. President  and the country you represent played an important role. In encouraging that initiative  the European Community adopted an approach which is in keeping with its open character and which represents a logical development of the Mediterranean policy. The purpose of the dialog is to concentrate efforts to bring about ever fuller understanding and more active co-operation within a framework both organic and complete. The new relationship resulting from it can thus be viewed in a long-term development perspective  taking account of historical  cultural and social ties and economic complementarity -or  in a word  of the interests shared by the two groups of countries.266.	I should like to conclude this statement by pointing out that the fact that I have referred to these many international problems proves that the European Community is a concrete and active reality in both the economic and the political spheres. The results achieved should encourage further achievements. In fact  Italy is convinced that continued efforts should be made to bring the process of European unification  begun 25 years ago  to completion so that a new political order can effectively emerge in Europe and so that the union of Europe may become an even more decisive factor in the stability and harmonious economic development of the international community as a whole."
"65",3510,"JAM",29,1974,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica  I am proud to be numbered among those who have expressed their congratulations to you on your unanimous election as President of this session of the General Assembly. I do this not only because of your eminence as an outstanding statesman  but because your great country has played a tremendous role in the non-aligned movement  a role which is appreciated by all those who follow with pride the true revolutionary spirit of the Government of Algeria.246.	With these compliments I should like to add expressions of the highest regard for Mr. Leopoldo Benites  whose distinguished international prestige brought added lustre to this body when he officiated as your predecessor.247.	We welcome the addition to this family of the United Nations of the new Members—Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau -each of which brings some special quality to this great body. We are happy that Bangladesh has overcome the birth pains of nationhood and now takes its rightful place among us. To our beautiful sister island of Grenada  with which we share a common heritage  we extend a very warm welcome. Grenada is a full member of the Caribbean Community and participates actively in all the many regional institutions of the Commonwealth Caribbean. It  like us  faces the common problems of developing island nations. Guinea-Bissau may be said to have written its application for membership in the blood of its own brave African liberators. We welcome them all as willing participants in the struggle for the better life -which is the common purpose of this great family  the United Nations.248.	The Government and people of Jamaica extend their heartfelt sympathy to the Government and people of Honduras  who recently suffered a crippling blow from a Caribbean hurricane  It is our fervent hope that all its friends in this Organization will extend the hand of friendship and assistance to help to ensure its speedy recovery.249.	Jamaica wishes to pay tribute to all members of the peace-keeping forces of this body and especially to recall with reverence those who have given their lives in the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and peace.250.	The winds of change are indeed blowing through the continent of Africa. The events of the past year have justified the hopes  the sacrifices and the struggles of all those who sought to set Africa free from the bonds of persistent colonial domination. And the winds continue to blow -for we believe that the events which took place in the past few days in this chamber have laid the foundations for the final liberation of the continent.251.	The declaration of independence by Guinea- Bissau just over a year ago signaled the opening of the final act in the drama of liberation of the African community held by Portugal. The peoples of the world are learning much from the lesson of this liberation  the basic significance of which is the fact that it was the freedom fighters of colonial Portugal who assisted the liberals of their ""mother country"" to bring freedom and justice to the people of Portugal itself  and not the other way around. This is one of the political paradoxes of history  that it is the struggle for freedom by the fighting colonials that brings freedom and liberty to the colonizing Powers themselves. This will go down in history as the eventual realization that freedom is one and indivisible.252.	As we welcome Guinea-Bissau here  we look for the early accession of Mozambique and Angola to their rightful places as Members of this body  and we are heartened at the emergence of the new Portugal. We hope that nothing will interfere with the final processes of liberation of the Territories concerned. Jamaica and others who have given their full support in the struggle  will continue their vigilance towards ensuring the final outcome  encouraged by the new spirit of Portugal as expressed in this Assembly by its Foreign Minister [2239th meeting].253.	A few days ago this Organization took what my delegation regarded as a historic step towards the final act of liberation of the peoples of southern Africa who are held in humiliation and oppression by the vicious regime in South Africa. The events of that day [2248th meeting]  the results of the vote on the issue of the South African delegation's credentials and the move to have the Security Council study them mark a significant turn in this drama. The collapse of colonial domination in the former Portuguese Territories has forced many among the membership of this body to search their hearts; it has forced them to realize that a preoccupation with strictly legal forms and procedures can sometimes result in the perpetuation of gross injustice. The isolation of the South African regime has also threatened to isolate those who have persistently  by negative or by positive acts  protected them from the anger of the world and from the realities of the abhorrence in which they are held by most of the peoples of the world.254.	For I say to them  to condone apartheid and the daily humiliation of black people is to affront the United Nations itself  which body is concerned with the recognition of a respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex or religion. All Members of this Organization have a clear duty to fight against the forces of inequality and injustice. There can be no lasting peace while there is compromise by so-called freedom- loving nations in these matters. To compromise with freedom is to deny freedom.255.	While we have been heartened by the developments in those Territories of Africa which have been linked to Portugal  we note that there has been no progress towards resolving the problems of Zimbabwe and Namibia  whose peoples have been denied the exercise of their inalienable rights to self-determination. The liberation of the peoples of Zimbabwe and Namibia cannot be allowed to depend upon expediency instead of principle. The harsh tyranny operating in these two countries is being perpetuated by regimes which shamelessly abandon all principles of human decency in the obdurate pursuit of their political and financial interests.256.	Year after year  with monotonous regularity  this august Assembly has passed resolution after resolution condemning the perfidy of that evil spirit otherwise referred to as the Government of South Africa  which remains obdurate and stubborn in its defiance of the United Nations. This intransigence has exposed this body to the charge of shameful impotence and has left the implication that it is only by force  violence and bloodshed that those-still held in bondage in Africa can hope to be free. In this respect  how are we of the smaller nations to view the stance of those powerful nations which would have us regard them as friends? In the case of Zimbabwe and Namibia  there is far more reason and universal support for United Nations troops to settle the question of freedom and justice there than there seems to be in Korea.257.	Despite much criticism -probably unfair -the United Nations deserves some credit for providing the forum for those Member nations that have awakened the conscience of the world. This year has  however  witnessed the dismemberment of a small  independent country  by outside interference  and leaves open to question the security of small  independent nations.258.	Recent events have revealed massive interference in the internal affairs of States Members of this Organization. Jamaica condemns such interference from whatever quarter it emanates. We reaffirm our faith that respect for the sovereignty pf nations neither allows  first  interference by one State in the affairs of another nor  secondly  intervention in the affairs of a duly elected Government. We of the non-aligned group view with alarm this undermining of the sovereignty of States  which constitutes a form of aggression by one State against another.259.	There is evidence of a real fear of aggression reflected in the references which have been made at this session to Belize. We hear hypocritical references to -and I quote -""the firm adherence to the principle of the self-determination of peoples"" out of the very mouths of those who generate the cause of fear. How much respect can we pay to those who refer to ""the respectable aspirations of the people of Belize""  when the authors of those very words deny to those very people the natural God-given right to declare themselves free? Let those who profess to be anti- colonialist define that term. Let them go back to their own historical roots and recall the spirit of Bolivar  the great Liberator of Latin America.260.	Jamaica reaffirms its stand against all oppressors  whoever they may be  and appeals to all freedom- loving countries here to study and help to advance the just aspirations of the people of Belize. Peace and justice are the concern of all -not the least concerned is this colony  which  because of its status  has no voice here and which has remained for too long trembling in the limbo of fear between the threats of a neighbor  on the one hand  and the empty promise of independence  on the other. It is full time that this body  the United Nations  which is the repository of hope for the weaker nations  takes full cognizance of the regrettable situation in Belize.261.	The past year has witnessed the emergence of a new determination on the part of the developing countries to bring about fundamental changes in the international economic system. In the face of all the effort and all the display of evidence of progress and of national and international concern over the past decades  the simple and inescapable fact is that the part of the world occupied by the poorer countries has been losing the battle for progress. The widening of the gap between the rich countries and the poor countries is clear evidence of this fact.262.	The countries of the third world have called for fundamental change in the very structure and foundations of the world economic system. The sixth special session of the General Assembly -at which these issues were discussed and which saw the approval of resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)  embodying the Declaration of and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order marked a historic moment in our lives. We must move forward from this mark.263.	There are many factors which inhibit such forward movement. First and foremost  there is the lack of commitment on the part of some of the developed countries to the idea of such structural change. Some of these have made their position crystal clear  and my delegation views this situation with deep regret. Nevertheless  one of the encouraging developments in recent times has been the movement on the part of a number of smaller developed countries towards full acceptance of the proposition that such fundamental change is imperative. We welcome this significant development and urge these countries to give their fullest support to the search for the answers to the problems involved in implementing the Program of Action. We hope that in good time those other countries which are less enthusiastic -or even opposed to these aims -will join fully in the effort not only in the interest of the overwhelming majority of the peoples of the world  but  in our view  to the ultimate benefit of all countries and of all peoples.264.	The second major factor is our lack of full understanding of some aspects of the development process. In this connexion  we must review and revise thoroughly the assumptions  the goals and the methods of work  particularly within the United Nations system. We must raise our sights to the levels required to bring about the new system of international economic relationships envisaged in the Declaration and Program of Action. In the search for such solutions we need the ingenuity and the energies of all.265. The third factor concerns a series of crises which beset the world today and which relate to inflation  energy  the international monetary system  food supplies and population growth. These crises must be seen as a dramatic expression of the failure of the world economic system that we have known. They must be seen not  as some among us seem to feel  as a reason or an excuse for putting aside or diminishing the effort towards fundamental change in the system; but  rather  they should be regarded as a crowning justification for moving with greater determination and urgency towards a new economic order based on equity  sovereign equality  interdependence  common interest and co-operation among all States.266.. The fact that no country -no matter what its resources -is untouched by these events is a measure of the harsh realities of interdependence.267.	Ever since the emergence of global contact in trade and investment through colonialism and other devices  the world community has been interdependent. However  for the most part the experience has been that one sector of the world community has been almost wholly dependent on another. The members of the latter category -which in most cases have derived their economic and political strength from exploitation of the rest of the world- have nevertheless regarded themselves as being almost wholly independent of that group. Now we observe that a great deal is being said on the subject of interdependence. We repeat: this is not at all news to us. But we cannot refrain from observing that it is only the emergence of events which have seriously threatened the economies of the major countries that has led to this new understanding and emphasis on this phenomenon.268.	Today the third world is seeking a complete change from the old interpretation of interdependence. This requires: first  understanding by the developed countries of the desperate urgency to raise the standard of living of the peoples of the third world; secondly  acceptance by the developed countries of the need for an equitable distribution throughout the world of the material benefits which derive from the world economic system and which provide a basis for ""the good life""; and  thirdly  adoption and implementation by the developed countries of policies designed to achieve these ends.269.	This should be the new meaning of interdependence  and in order to make it a reality we need fundamental structural change in the world economic system. This is the link between interdependence and the new economic order.270.	The third world seeks not confrontation but parallel advancement -indeed  economic salvation. In our view  developing countries must exercise the discipline of the mutually distressed in order to avoid division among ourselves. May this discipline prevent individual members or groups that move towards the top of the ladder from neglecting their friends who remain at the bottom. In this respect I should like to make two observations: first  I commend the Republic of Venezuela  which has readily made substantial grants to assist some of the poorer nations that have been affected acutely by the energy crisis; and secondly  I express regret that  although there has been much talk and some action about stabilization and development funds  there has been a lack of sufficient meaningful progress in these matters.271.	Our role is to press forward now and together to work towards the establishment of the new economic order. The frightening alternative is unthinkable; at the least  it is a perpetuation of the old idea of inter-dependence  which means that some form of charity  such as aid  could readjust the intrinsic inequalities between the developed and the developing world. The real change to establish this new economic order will begin only after this new meaning of interdependence elicits two simultaneous movements: first  the acceptance by the developed nations of the meaningful involvement of the poorer countries in the decision-making processes of international economic bodies; and/ or second  the realization of the developing world that the maintenance of discipline among its members and concern for the welfare of its members  both collectively and individually  will ensure that we will not once more be divided.272.	We  a small nation  accept the political philosophy that the central objective of all government is the equality of man and the improvement in the quality of his life. The international questions of food  energy   population control and other problems  real as they are  are abstractions unless we relate them to the basic needs of the human individual. The developing world  whose only assets in most cases are its human resources  must never lose sight of this fact  or fail to remind our brothers stronger in material wealth of this fact. The great problems of the present as to how many million barrels of oil per day or millions of tons of wheat are produced are meaningless unless they relate to the necessity to feed and house the millions of needy people throughout the world still crying out for an answer to the question: ""How can I retain my human dignity and self-respect  house my family and feed my undernourished children?"".273.	Jamaica notes and welcomes the proclamation of International Women's Year [resolution 3010 (XXVII)] and reaffirms its belief that women must be given a greater role in political  social and economic development.274.	Our concerns are not merely about balance of payments; they are about the readjustment of the balance of human distress  which is so unevenly distributed. The condition of the. individual human being must be the center of our concern. Our response in Jamaica to the current emphasis on interdependence and economic co-operation is not conditioned either by injustices of the past or by threats of the present; it is the response of a small sovereign nation which desires sincerely to co-operate with others for the mutual benefit of all. We expect for ourselves and others a fair share of the fruits of our labor  and we demand a just portion of the proceeds of any joint development of our common resources. Our answer to the call for interdependence is that we want to change our role in this new economic order from that of sufferer to that of full participant in the world scene.275.	That is the tone of our response. It is a note dictated not only by the urgency of the moment but by a close reading of the facts of history. The facts show not only that the great empires of the past fell when they could no longer depend on the support of their colonies or dependencies  but also that today the developed countries need us as much as we need them. That is true interdependence.276.	This is not the petulant retort of the poor; it is a bold statement of fact: that interdependence requires among the wealthy nations a tremendous sophistication and a denial of vanity; indeed  it requires a dilution of arrogance  where blackmail  threats and all forms of intervention in other people's affairs are out of place. The empires of the past held together as long as their military hardware was the determining factor. Today interdependence and an economically healthy world must place full value on the qualitative contribution of the poorer majorities of the world.277.	My delegation and the Government of Jamaica which we represent are of the view that the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order must be the center and focus of the efforts and concerns of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and of each member country  and we expect that this session of the General Assembly will see the furtherance of these aims. A vital and integral part of these aims is the Special Program for emergency relief and development assistance to the countries most seriously affected by the prevailing conditions. We strongly urge here  as we have done elsewhere  the fullest and promptest attention to this matter.278.	We have heard from time to time comments  even complaints  about the devices to which developing countries have resorted in order to counteract what I would like to call the despotism of the minority. There have been adverse comments concerning the formation of associations of commodity-producing countries  which are mainly members of the third world. However  the formation of these associations has been forced on producing countries by the failure of the countries exploiting these resources to give them fair and equitable returns or to foster the transfer of appropriate technology and other benefits to any significant degree. There are complaints centered around the relatively recent phenomenon of the rising costs of raw materials. Yet the countries which complain say nothing at all of the long history of spiraling costs of their manufactured goods which are exported to the third world.279.	The spiraling costs of production of these manufactured goods reflect the rapid rise in the standard of living in the developed countries  as the wage levels of their workers have increased; thus  the rise in the standard of living in these countries has been achieved largely at the expense of the peoples of the third world  whose low wage-levels and standard of living are regarded as a part of the necessary  inevitable and immutable scheme of things.280.	The third world  for its part  has complained about the groups or blocs of the rich and powerful countries -for example  in the realm of international monetary affairs  the Group of 10  the club of the rich  whose members were in the habit of meeting and deciding on major issues and more or less instructing IMF on what it should do. In deference to the strong views of the developing countries  the Group of 10 gave way to the Committee of 20 4 which included representatives of developing countries on the basis of the existing constituencies in the Fund. Now we read of meetings in recent days of the Group of 5 -a new and even more exclusive club of not just the rich  but of the richest.281.	The question of the recycling of funds of the oil-producing countries is a concrete example of the need for a rational approach in dealing with specific international economic problems. Recent events have shown a strong tendency for those funds to move into the developed countries for their benefit. This points to the urgent need for a planned and controlled distribution of the flow of some of these funds into the developing countries which are in greater need of them.282.	A strong new ray of hope and promise for inter-national co-operation has recently emerged. The General Assembly in resolution 2340 (XXII) and subsequent resolutions over the period 1967-1973 invited the nations of the world to create a new legal order of the sea. I say this is a hopeful turn because the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  recently held in Caracas  saw the greatest collection of experts and representatives  deliberately and collectively seeking to redress the imbalance in the world order in a quest for a new regime of international justice. I repeat  hopeful  because in the Declaration of Principles  as well as in the procedures adopted by the Conference  this distinguished group made serious  strenuous efforts over a considerable period towards creating and preserving a new order of international economic justice designed to bring about control of pollution on a global scale  and the regulation of the orderly exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed  among other things. Never before had the international community attempted such a comprehensive task.283.	Today the revolution in the approach to the sharing of the world's resources and the acknowledgment of the rights and claims of the weak and poor among the nations  including the land-locked and otherwise geographically disadvantaged States  to the resources of the sea are firm steps towards establishing an era of permanent peace. This presents a very bright picture of community effort arid a shining example of the interdependence of man and nations without which the whole operation admittedly would be m exercise in futility. We certainly have moved far frown the days of Grotius  when the high seas and its treasures were regarded as belonging to nobody  or to the strongest Power. Today  the world realizes that this Conference has a new opportunity to put into effect accepted principles of justice where man's poverty takes priority of consideration over man's power. Even here  however  let me sound a note of caution: to bring satisfaction to the millions who expectantly await the finality of these deliberations  it is necessary to overcome traditionally nationalistic acquisitive postures and substitute political will and a new faith in mankind.284.	Finally  whether the activities occupying the attention of mankind be in the sea  on land or in the air; whether it- be the creation of more food  housing or otherwise to enhance the dignity of man; whether it be to assail the economic ills of the world: we need each other.285.	I would like to close  with words from one of Africa's illustrious sous  President Julius K. Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania  calling for co-operation among the developing countries in the creation of a new economic order  when he said:""We are not absolutely without allies when we demand reforms of the international economic system in the direction of justice. There is a growing number of organized groups within wealthy countries  and even a small number of wealthy Governments  which have recognized that the struggle for human equality and human dignity cannot stop at national boundaries.""I commend these words to you all."
"66",3556,"JOR",29,1974,"It is my pleasure  at the outset of my address to the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly  to join with those who preceded me in expressing my sincere and profound congratulations to the distinguished President of the Assembly  Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. Your election  Mr. President  is a personal tribute to your accomplishments and your struggle. It is likewise a tribute to the struggle of our brother people of Algeria.48.	I should like at the outset also to express the most sincere and heartfelt congratulations  and a fraternal welcome  on the occasion of the admission of three new States to our international family  namely Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. The admission of the two latter States to the family of the United Nations is further evidence of the twilight of the colonial era and its eclipse in the remaining Territories which for so many centuries have suffered under its yoke. It also heralds a new era of freedom and human dignity.49.	My Government  while acknowledging with appreciation the wisdom and far-sightedness which the new Government of Portugal has shown  hopes that Portugal will continue its enlightened policy of decolonization in the other territories which have not as yet achieved their liberation namely  Mozambique and Angola.50.	A cursory glance at the agenda of the current session  which consists of more than 100 items  conveys a clear picture of the broad and comprehensive scope of the present tasks which indeed constitute a permanent and continuous challenge of this universal Organization.51.	In the agenda there are certain items which have become our inheritance year after year either because of their importance and their recurring nature or  in many instances  on account of the failure of the United Nations to find appropriate and effective solutions  notwithstanding the United Nations resolutions pertaining thereto  which have expressed the will of the international community by categorical and absolute majorities.52.	On the agenda  and in the valuable report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization [AI960I and Add.I] there are items of considerable importance and gravity. These items form significant landmarks along the road  if not decisive cross-roads. It is incumbent upon all of us to accord them optimum and most expeditious attention before the position deteriorates and they become unnameable to solution.53.	I refer here to what the Secretary-General says in the introduction to his report concerning the sixth special session  which the General Assembly held in the spring of this year to discuss the situation regarding raw materials and development [Al960llAdd.l  sect. V]. We believe that these two matters constitute an embodiment of the great economic and social issues which confront the present international community.54.	It has become all too clear that the acute economic crises and social upheavals which the world is witnessing today are not isolated or unforeseen occurrences. Nor are they confined to one country or region. Rather  they represent a rapid deterioration  the inevitable outcome of which may well undermine the entire economic and social structure of the whole world. They are the outcome of several phenomena  including a population explosion in many parts of the world which does not seem to lend itself to any control  as was seen during the World Population Conference held in Bucharest during the summer of this year.55.	There is also the accelerating attrition and waste of the world's finite raw materials stemming from an inexorable consumer revolution  particularly in the developed countries  without regard for the rights and needs of succeeding generations.56.	There is also the revolution of rising expectations  which is pervading the whole world  as a result of increasing progress and awakened consciousness unprecedented in the history of the human race. While the World Population Conference dealt with an important element in the current international economic situation  Jordan looks forward with considerable interest to the forthcoming World Food Conference  scheduled to meet at Rome next November. It is our hope that the Conference will succeed in formulating a world food policy which will include the expanded production of food-stuffs  the equitable distribution of food and the establishment of a sound basis for world food security.57.	Last  but not least  is the deep and growing chasm between the developed and the developing countries  the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots""  whose efforts to catch up with the march of progress are being rendered more costly and difficult as a result of inflation  owing to which most of them are compelled to import  for reasons which have nothing to do with their own conditions but are rather the outcome of economic and social convulsions in the more advanced States and societies.58.	These fateful  vital issues were discussed in depth and detail during the sixth special session of the General Assembly and this is not the appropriate place to analyze them or pass conclusive judgments on them. However  I feel compelled to refer to them  for two reasons.59.	First  the current economic situation in the world affects the survival of hundreds of millions of the human race  particularly in the developing countries. Furthermore  the world today has become so inter-dependent that if one member is stricken all others feel the affliction  not in one area of life but in all its manifold manifestations.60.	Secondly  there are persistent and unfair attempts to explain the current world crises by placing responsibility on the shoulders of a group of developing countries which nature has endowed with one principal raw material petroleum. This is being done at a stage in technological progress at which petroleum plays an important if not a cardinal role. But  we are entitled to ask and Jordan  incidentally  is not an oil- producing country is the inflation which threatens the economy of every country in the world a product of today or even of the recent past  as claimed by those who wish to link it to the rise in petroleum prices during this year? Do we not all realize that the runaway inflation which is getting more and more out of control is the consequence of years of economic and social convulsions in the developed countries?61.	All States  big and small  rich and poor  are genuinely concerned about controlling the ever more devastating inflation  because a stable  reasonable and balanced criterion of value is an indispensable condition of the preservation of stability and confidence  which are the corner-stone of any sound economic or political world order. This can be achieved only by quiet dialog and objective appraisal in the search for appropriate solutions.62.	Diverting attention from the real causes under-lying the destabilization of the world economic order or attempting to find a single fictitious scapegoat for the present world malaise  will not serve the interests of any party. On the contrary  this compounds an already sordid situation.63.	The Government of Jordan wishes to acknowledge with approbation the initiative which the oil- producing countries have taken in the establishment of special development funds and programs to assist the developing nations of the third world in shouldering the burdens of the present and in -looking to a better future. It is our hope that good will may be followed by speedy and practical implementation because bureaucracy  as the experience of developed countries in carrying out assistance programs have taught us  often constitutes the major obstacle to satisfying the needs and the aspirations of peoples for a better life.64.	We are convinced also that the peoples of the third world  including the 130 millions of the Arab nations  will receive a fair share of all the investment and assistance programs which countries with a currency surplus intend to carry out in order that every part of our world may become an active and positive factor in the world economy rather than a burden on it.65.	This will also dissipate the myth that there are funds without peoples and peoples without funds. The Arab nations  in partnership with the peoples of the third world  are capable of absorbing a substantial ratio of any surpluses that may become available  for their own good as well as for the world economy as a whole.66.	Economic development and sound international dealings presuppose the existence of an international order based on justice in every corner of the globe. Peoples can never devote any thought to the precepts of normal life  to which we all aspire  so long as they are deprived of the elements of peace and national security for their peoples or their homelands. Let us add to this what certain people suffer as a result of racial discrimination which is contrary to all the values of the civilized world and which is the scourge of every country or people which allows itself to exercise this discrimination.67.	I am stressing this view because I represent a country that is an integral part of the greater Arab homeland and that has had to suffer aggression against its peace  security and territorial integrity. The share of such aggression falling to Jordan has been substantial.68.	The agenda of this twenty-ninth session is studded with items concerning the Middle East which are in essence and in reality derivatives of one basic problem  namely  the Zionist aggression in Palestine and the extension of that aggression over the past quarter of a century to include territories and peoples of neighboring Arab countries.69.	Thus  we have  for example  item 38  pertaining to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. I do not believe that anyone will disagree when I state that it is one of the oldest  if not the oldest  agenda item in the history of the United Nations. The tragedy of it all is that it pertains to the fate of one and a half million human beings who are still living a life of dispersal  deprivation and physical  as well as psychological  suffering in consequence of their forced expulsion from their homeland in 1948.70.	Under this item the General Assembly also receives the report of the United Nations Palestine Conciliation Commission  which in the early 1950s  and in co-operation with all parties concerned  strove to arrive at a just and permanent solution to the Palestine question  on the basis of the implementation of all General Assembly resolutions on this subject. All the parties concerned  including Israel  came to an agreement and initialed what came to be known as the Lausanne Protocol. But no sooner had Israel signed that instrument than it retracted and refused to ratify it. It consequently caused the loss of an historic opportunity to settle this dispute once and for all  thus sparing all concerned the wars and tragedies of the past quarter of a century.71.	Also on the agenda is item 40  which deals with Israeli oppressive practices against the inhabitants of the occupied territories since 1967; the violations of their human rights and Israel's systematic efforts to absorb their lands and transform their physical terrain and history. And while violations of human rights continue unashamedly  and unacceptably to our contemporary world  regardless of the guises and excuses under which they are perpetrated  they are nevertheless violations of the rights of humanity. They are reflected in the atrocious and irresponsible tampering by Israel with a civilization that has a legacy going back almost two thousand years. Before our eyes is the holy city of Jerusalem whose historical  architectural  religious and cultural legacy falls victim to the hammers of destruction  mutilation and distortion  regardless of its sacredness  its majesty and its eternity. The fact that it symbolizes the loftiest spiritual aspirations of humanity has not spared Jerusalem the agony of a ruthless metamorphosis.72.	The agenda also comprises a broad item under the heading ""The situation in the Middle East"" [item 109]  This simply alludes to the fact that Israel  which launched an all-out aggression against three Arab States  namely  Jordan  Syria and Egypt  in 1967  still persists in that aggression by its continued occupation of vast areas of Arab lands. And even though the war of October 1973 was a reminder to Israel that its expansionist aggression and usurpation of other people's lands could lead only to an explosion  it has reverted once again to dragging its feet. Israel has been declaring to the world that it is determined to grab this part or that part of Arab occupied homelands; that it would be ready to withdraw from a bit of territory here and a bit of territory there  arrogating to itself the option of which parts of our homelands and rights it would not wish to relinquish  and without showing any serious concern lest such an attitude destroy the possibilities of establishing a just and permanent peace in the Middle East  in accordance with the resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Security Council.73.	In historical hindsight it becomes abundantly clear that what happened in 1967 was a calculated and deliberate plan. If anyone has any doubt that this is so  let him look at how Israel  after occupying Jerusalem  the west bank of the Jordan and Gaza  went about absorbing those territories  in addition to occupying them. Let him witness how Israel today refuses to pull out  in any real or meaningful sense  from these occupied territories  notwithstanding the fact that the Arab States directly involved have agreed in unequivocal and categorical terms to accept peace  within the framework and provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and its subsequent concomitant resolution 338 (1973)  which confirms it. What excuse remains in the arsenal of Israel for re-fusing to relinquish the territories which it occupied by force of arms in 1967?74.	The agenda includes an item entitled the ""Question of Palestine"" [item 108]. And as the title indicates  it represents an initiative to restore the question to its roots and fundamentals  after it has lain in abeyance for more than 20 years. During all those years any discussion of the problem was restricted to subsidiary issues such as that of resolution 194 (III)  paragraph 11  which the General Assembly adopted in 1948 asserting the rights of the Palestinians to return to their homeland and properties and ensuring compensation for those who might choose not to return. I need hardly remind this distinguished General Assembly that the said resolution  along with many others  has remained ink on paper and is being stored under a thick layer of dust and indifference became Israel wished it to be so. The General Assembly has remained immobilized and incapable of doing anything about it.75.	The items to which I have referred will be dis-cussed in full detail when the time for their debate comes up. But I feel it is my duty  within the framework of this general debate to outline as clearly as possible the position of Jordan in regard to this question.76.	First  Jordan supports without reservation  like all its sister Arab States indeed  like all States of the world that are committed to supporting right and justice the full restoration of the rights of the Palestinian people.77.	Secondly  the rights of the Palestinian people have been victimized by the most flagrant of violations ever since 1948  when the majority of the Palestinians were forcibly expelled from their lands and from their homeland. Furthermore  the rights of the Palestinian people were once again trampled upon in 1967  when Israel occupied large areas of Arab territory within which live more than a million people. The rights of the Palestinian people quite obviously cannot be restored except on their own soil and in their own homeland  in accordance with the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations  and by their being enabled to return to their homeland through an ending of the occupation.78.	Thirdly  Jordan's direct historical  national and moral imperative is to do all it can  in conjunction with the other Arab States  with a view to restoring the territories occupied as a result of the grave setback suffered by the Arab States in 1967. This duty stems from Jordan's national commitment  as well as from the special relationship which identifies Jordan with the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people.79.	It should be recalled that  following the catastrophe which befell the Palestinian people in 1948 and which resulted in the loss of four fifths of their homeland  a voluntary unity was achieved within the framework of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan between the east bank and the west bank of the Jordan. That unity remained and stood firm until 1967  when Israel succeeded in occupying the west bank in its entirety  along with its occupation of other Arab territories.80.	Jordan will continue every effort for bringing about the total withdrawal of Israel  so as to make it possible for the people of Palestine to exercise their right of self-determination in their own homeland and on their own soil. This is a position which Jordan shares with all the other Arab States.81.	I wish to emphasize here that the only obstacle standing in the way of the Palestinian people in the exercise of their rights is the Israeli occupation and Israel's obduracy in refusing to implement the principles and resolutions of the United Nations.82.	In close proximity to our territory lies the island of Cyprus  with its Greek and Turkish communities  with whose ancient and valiant peoples we have the strongest bonds of fraternal friendship. Our people were dismayed  as were other peoples  by the national catastrophe that has afflicted this small and beautiful island. My Government offers its deepest condolences for the innocent victims from among the two communities who lost their lives. Jordan also expresses deep regret for the destruction that has been wrought upon the economic structure of the island. It is our fervent hope that the international community will  after the restoration of peace and amity in Cyprus  offer the necessary assistance to enable that country to rebuild its shattered economy.83.	The explosion of the situation in Cyprus  though its immediate cause was the mistakes of a handful of people who did not weigh the consequences of their acts  serves none the less as proof that a policy of sleeping through crisis situations and letting the fire smolder under the ashes  and failing to take serious initiatives with a view to solving deep-rooted crisis situations as was the case in Cyprus is the most short-sighted and most dangerous of policies. Time does not solve problems; it merely aggravates them. It is to be hoped that the tragic events in Cyprus will serve as a lesson to those who are content to leave crisis situations unresolved as is the case in the explosive Middle East because of either short-sightedness or lack of will  or both.84.	Jordan quite naturally supports the preservation of the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. We also believe that this should be based on the peace and security of the two communities  without allowing conflicting external interests in the world to stand in the way of such an accord. We hope that the leaders of the two communities will reach an agreement that will ensure such peace and security  without permitting external interests to aggravate the situation.85.	Jordan has followed with profound satisfaction the continuation of the policy of detente which was the central theme of the debate at its twenty-eighth session. I wish to stress in particular the attitude of detente which permeated the two major Powers  the United States and the Soviet Union  in their efforts to limit strategic weapons. But there is  as the Secretary-General has noted  a greater danger arising from the increasing proliferation of atomic capabilities among a growing number of States [A/96011Add./  sect. X]  The danger is particularly great in view of the fact that any differentiation between atomic capabilities for peaceful purposes and those for military purposes is inconsequential. It is a noteworthy fact that there are at present perhaps 12 States with the potentiality of becoming nuclear-weapon States  but which have not as yet signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XX//)  annex]. Some States have signed it but have not yet ratified it. This number may well double over the next few years.86.	It is the duty of the United Nations  and particularly of the major Powers  to do everything in their power -and to do it before it is too late- to ensure a firm and effective system to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. This can be achieved only on the basis of equality of treatment for all States within each region. If one State is permitted  either by silence or out of permissiveness  to acquire nuclear arms  it becomes impossible to persuade the other States of the region  which deeply feel this terrifying power hovering over their heads  to refrain from acquiring possession of such arms as time goes by. And therein lies the danger to world peace as a whole.87.	Jordan fully supports the proposal to declare the regions of the Middle Bast and of South Asia nuclear- free zones similar to the one declared in the case of Latin America  and approves the increasing attention that is being given to proposals to declare the continent of Africa a nuclear-free zone as well. This can become a plausible and serious objective only if each and every State within the regions concerned abides by it without exception.88.	The world today is passing through one of the most perilous periods in the history of the human race. On the one hand  this period holds out great hopes for the advancement of mankind; on the other  it is fraught with unprecedented dangers because of its potential for destruction. In many circles there is a growing feeling of inevitable doom. But we need not be unduly pessimistic because  given good-will  sound judgment and selflessness  we should be able to tackle and successfully overcome every problem that now appears difficult or incapable of solution.89.	Jordan  as an integral pa.*t of the Arab world  believes that the time has come for the Middle East to surge forward  with all the human and material re-sources at its disposal  in a renascence that will not only resuscitate its own great cultural heritage -it is the cradle of civilization -but also work towards the enrichment of contemporary civilization and culture  side by side with the other nations of the world.90.	Our nation looks forward with determination to becoming  shoulder to shoulder with the other peoples of the world  a positive force in shaping the present and the future. It will not tolerate a situation in which its causes remain but sordid and repetitive items at every session of the General Assembly.91.	The capabilities of our nation are still either dispersed or immobilized in consequence of the aggressions and the unlimited and unreasonable demands made upon it. These aggressions and demands are unique in that they run counter to the aspirations of all peoples for freedom  progress  and unrestricted international co-operation and amity. Hence  it is incumbent upon the United Nations not only to stand by the cause of right and justice  but also to strive firmly with a view to making it possible for the Middle East to become an area of peace  progress and justice  for the good of our region itself and of the world at large."
"67",3603,"JPN",29,1974,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Japanese delegation  I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. At the same time I wish to express my profound appreciation to Mr. Leopoldo Benites  the former President of the General Assembly. I wish to recall that Mr. Benites  with his broad perspective and objective judgment  superbly guided the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly  both of which were confronted with a number of difficult problems.74.	On this occasion I should like to extend my sincere congratulations and a warm welcome to the delegations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on their admission to the United Nations at the current session.75.	Against the background of the steady consolidation of detente among the major Powers  the world's today searching for a new international order based tin a just relationship among all States. However  it is also a sobering fact that the world of today is still confronted with the task of bringing about peaceful settlements of local disputes and tensions which have not yet been eradicated. At the same time the world is  on the one hand  exposed to the dangers of frequent nuclear testing and the further proliferation of nuclear weapons and  on the other  it is facing the grave challenge of finding a solution for diverse international economic and social problems which can well affect the whole of mankind. In the present situation of the world  which is confronted with problems of historic gravity affecting both peace and prosperity  it is my firm belief that the only course left for individual members of the international community is to work within the broad framework of international co-operation in seeking to achieve their own prosperity and peace rather than blindly seeking benefits solely for themselves.76.	The successive efforts the major Powers have made during the past few years to seek understanding and co-operation rather than confrontation have resulted in the promotion of dialogs even among States with different political and economic systems. Despite that trend  however  some parts of the world have witnessed the emergence of fresh tensions and disputes and have continued to suffer from instability.77.	With regard to the Korean peninsula  I believe that we should reaffirm the aspiration of the people of Korea to the peaceful reunification of their country  as manifested in the consensus reached in the General Assembly last year  and that we should continue  as. in the past  to follow developments in the question of Korea  keeping in mind the fact that both the Republic of Korea and North Korea still entertain a common desire to bring about detente through their dialog and increased contacts.78.	In Cambodia  to our deep regret  fighting still continues  and no breakthrough towards a peaceful settlement is yet in sight. I earnestly hope that the unfortunate state of affairs in Cambodia will be brought to an end at the earliest possible date through talks between the parties concerned. For this purpose  all the parties concerned should indeed devote serious efforts to achieving a peaceful settlement of the Cambodian problem  and the United Nations  for its part  should spare no effort to achieve this goal. In accordance with this belief  I consider it encouraging that the Secretary-General made the following statement regarding peace in Cambodia in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization: ""I hope also that the time will come when the United Nations may be able to play a more active role . . ."" [ibid.  p. 7].79.	With regard to Laos  the Government of Japan sincerely welcomed the establishment last April of a National Coalition Government for the reconciliation of the Laotian people  an event which may mark an important turning-point in the effort to establish a lasting peace in all of IndoChina.80.	In the Middle East  the trend towards peace has been gaining momentum since the fourth Middle East war  last October  and Japan  like other peace- loving countries of the world  entertains earnest hopes for the future progress of the Peace Conference in Geneva.81.	The problems which immediately confront the United Nations the situation in Indochina  the fourth Middle East war and the recent armed conflict in Cyprus seem to indicate that detente among the major Powers does not necessarily lead to immediate reductions in local tensions. In this regard I wish to commend the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations  which have played a significant role in the restoration and maintenance of peace  as well as in preventing the recurrence of fighting in the Middle East and Cyprus.- However  in view of the magnitude of the hopes entertained regarding the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations  the fact that all past operations were established on an ad hoc basis and that the United Nations had to improvise solutions to problems arising from their establishment and administration makes us apprehensive about whether the United Nations can take truly prompt and effective action in the event of similar emergencies in the future. Therefore I would express my sincere hope for the early establishment of guidelines for peace-keeping operations on the basis of lessons drawn from our past experiences. At the same time  I wish to assure the Assembly that the Government of Japan will continue  as in the past  to extend every possible assistance to peace-keeping operations.82.	Another area in which the United Nations is now expected to play an important role is in the solution of various problems with which the African countries are confronted  particularly in the attainment of self-determination and independence by the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and the abolition of racial discrimination. I firmly believe that the early solution of these problems will contribute immensely to the promotion of world peace. Accordingly  the Government of Japan welcomes the decision by the new Government formed in Portugal last April to recognize in principle the right to independence of the Territories under Portuguese administration Africa. I sincerely hope that it will not be long before these Non-Self-Governing Territories accede to independence by peaceful means and are admitted to the United Nations as peace-loving States. In the same spirit* I wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on its attainment of independence and to the provisional Government of Mozambique  established on 20 September  on its achievement of an important step towards full independence. At the same time  the Government of Japan wishes to reaffirm its unchanging and basic position in opposition to South Africa's policy of racial discrimination and to SouthAfrica's continued occupation of Namibia  as well as to the white minority rule in Southern Rhodesia. The Government of Japan will continue  as in the past  to observe strictly the relevant United Nations resolutions  including those requiring economic sanctions against Southern Rhodesia  and will continue to provide the fullest possible co-operation with the peoples of Africa for the early achievement of their aspirations.83.	At this point I wish to invite the attention of the Assembly to the emergence of a situation which; as I said at the beginning of this statement  should be a source of serious concern for all countries  regardless of their size and geographical position  in view of the dangers it constitutes for the survival of all mankind.84.	The first of these dangers is that of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. On 18 May this year after a lapse of 10 years  another State conducted a nuclear explosion for the first time. Meanwhile the nuclear-weapon States  for their part  conducted intensive nuclear tests  both in the atmosphere and under ground  within a short span of time  in defiance of the opposition of world opinion to these tests.85.	I cannot fail to express the grave concern of the Government of Japan over the possible consequences of the recent series of nuclear explosions which may well open the way to the further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world. To block such a dangerous trend towards nuclear proliferation is today undoubtedly a matter of the utmost urgency  and the concerted efforts of the international community are urgently required for the achievement of this goal. This is assuredly the well- considered view of the Government of Japan  which is now making the necessary preparations for the ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]  in keeping with its fundamental policy of dedicating itself to the cause of peace and renouncing nuclear armaments. At the same time  I wish to state with renewed emphasis that  for the concerted efforts of the international community to become truly effective  it is indispensable that the nuclear-weapon States  which bear special responsibilities  make positive contributions in keeping with those responsibilities.86.	As has been pointed out repeatedly in the past  any effective and fasting measures for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons require the efforts of the nuclear-weapon States  in particular efforts to promote nuclear disarmament  starting with a comprehensive nuclear test ban  and also efforts to produce tangible results leading towards the realization of effective measures to strengthen the security of the non-nuclear-weapon States.87.	In the field of the peaceful uses of atomic energy  we fully recognize the need to promote inter-national co-operation. To lessen the risk of further nuclear proliferation  however  we should not only strengthen the existing regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons but also bring nuclear activities of States not parties to the Treaty under safeguards equal in stringency to those of the Treaty. Here again  one can hardly overemphasize the necessity for States which supply nuclear technology and materials  and above all the nuclear-weapon States which are the principal suppliers to maintain a cautious attitude and manifest a spirit of co-operation with the purposes of the Treaty.88.	In view of the special importance and great urgency of preventing nuclear proliferation in order to maintain peace and security in the world  it is our firm-belief that the United Nations the Security Council in particular should seriously address itself to this question and should play a central role in dealing with this issue. In accordance with this conviction  I venture to propose that the Security Council be requested by the General Assembly to study possible measures which might be adopted by the United Nations for securing the more effective prevention of nuclear proliferation  taking fully into account the outcome of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to be held in Geneva next May.89.	I should like to observe  in connexion with my earlier reference to the special responsibilities incumbent upon the nuclear-weapon States  that the agreements reached between the United States and the Soviet Union early in July this year  and particularly the agreement pertaining to a partial underground nuclear test ban  do represent a valuable forward step towards the achievement of complete nuclear disarmament. However  I must state also that this agreement  although valuable  still falls far short of giving full satisfaction to the Government of Japan  and we hope that still further efforts will be made in this area by the States concerned.90.	It may be recalled that the Government of Japan submitted a draft convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament this year. In the same spirit  my Government welcomes the agreement reached between the United States and the Soviet Union last July under which they are considering a joint initiative on this matter. It is my sincere hope that the agreement thus reached between those two counties will produce a breakthrough to facilitate the solution of this problem.91.	I should like now to turn to the second problem that is of concern to the world community in its aspirations to peace and prosperity. This is the problem of the present instability in the world economic and social situation  including the problem of natural re-sources. As our position was made clear at the sixth special session of the General Assembly regarding the resources problem itself [2211 th meeting]  I should like to deal particularly with the role the United Nations should  in our view  play in the afU^'pt to solve such problems.92.	There exist innumerable problems in the various fields of the world economy  such as energy  natural resources  food  population  the sea and the sea-bed  and the environment  which vitally involve the very existence of mankind. Solutions should be sought for these problems with great urgency. I believe that most of them can be solved only through global  comprehensive and co-ordinated programs and  in this context  every country is looking increasingly to the role to be played by the United Nations  the most universal and comprehensive international organization.93.	We held the sixth special session of the General Assembly  on resources and development  last spring and the World Population Conference in Bucharest last August. In addition  the World Food Conference will take place in November. Those Conferences  together with the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which was held to establish a new legal order for the sea  provide good examples of the roles now being played by the United Nations.94.	In order for the United Nations to respond effectively to these problems  it has become increasingly necessary to combine and co-ordinate all the efforts of the United Nations family and to make integrated plans for that co-ordination. However  because of the insufficient co-ordination among various United Nations bodies  the activities of the United Nations system as a whole show duplications. There is a tendency for the activities of the United Nations system in the economic and social fields to proliferate without limit  because of the lack of serious consideration in fixing priorities for projects and in setting up new funds and institutions. It is abundantly clear that the United Nations activities will not provide an active and efficient response to the requirements of the age if this situation remains unremedied.95.	Therefore  for the purpose of discharging effectively its responsibilities in the economic and social fields  in response to the expectations of every country in the world  the United Nations assuredly must strengthen its capacity for comprehensively planning and co-ordinating economic and social activities in the United Nations system  with a view to utilizing efficiently our limited financial and human resources and concentrating these resources upon the activities that are most needed.96.	It is  in my view  the Economic and Social Council that should be the central forum for such planning and co-ordination. I should like to propose that the Council  taking into account the achievements of the World Population Conference  and the results that we expect from the World Food Conference to be held in Rome  should study concrete ways to co-ordinate programs carried out by bodies within the United Nations and outside  while at the same time formulating the vision of ""The Earth in the Twenty-first Century"" and ""The Future of Mankind"". I believe that  when such a study is made  the qualitative aspect  which takes into consideration the quality of life  should be fully considered  along with a quantitative approach to the problem of human existence  so that mankind  recognizing the interdependence of nations  can put into effect a rational distribution of the world's limited supply of food and other resources  permitting everyone to lead a life of dignity  worthy of human beings.97.	Although Japan is far from being rich in natural resources  it is endowed with high standards of education and technological proficiency. We intend  by utilizing this endowment  to provide financial and technical co-operation for the development of the world economy. In pursuance of those efforts  and in response to the request made at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  my country is now providing the most seriously affected countries with assistance in the forms of commodity aid  debt relief  and aid on a grant basis  by adding at least $100 million to the level of assistance achieved during the past year  with a view to contributing to alleviating the difficulties that confront those countries as a result of the energy crisis. I am glad to add that we are now considering additional contributions  if necessary. The contribution to which I referred is being provided in spite of the serious effects of the present energy crisis on the economy of my country. I should like to take this opportunity to express our strong expectation that all other potential donors will make similar efforts.98.	I believe it was made clear at the recent special session of the General Assembly that the traditional North-South concept  which has become accepted in the field of economic and social development  should be fundamentally reviewed. I say this because it is becoming obvious that the gap has widened between developing countries with natural resources and others with very limited such resources  and the necessity is being increasingly felt tKat all countries with the capability to assist  whether in the North or in the South  should strengthen their cooperation in helping to develop relatively less fortunate developing countries. This trend prompts a fundamental re-examination of the traditional concept of how aid should be given. In the provision of aid for development  it is essential to expand mutual co-operation from the. viewpoint of equity and solidarity  avoiding the creation of a particular group of countries enjoying prosperity while other groups suffer from severe difficulties. In my view  therefore  those countries which are endowed with capital and technology  as well as those with natural resources  have a duty  as members of the international community?* to co-operate in aiding the expansion and development of the world economy by utilizing their special assets. I firmly believe that the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  can acquire useful significance only by taking such an approach.99.	In view of the importance of all the subjects which I have mentioned  we cannot avoid confronting the problem of strengthening the United Nations. One of the problems we face is the fact that the United Nations is prevented from performing effectively and smoothly because of its accumulating budget deficit. I should like to take this opportunity to call once again on all Member States to take concrete action in order to find ways to solve this problem. Together with the strengthening of the financial basis of the Organization  it is also important to emphasize the reinforcement of the organizational framework of the United Nations. More than a quarter of a century has passed since the Charter was adopted  and there has been a great change in the international atmosphere in which the Organization finds itself. It would be desirable for us to face this change and prepare ourselves for future developments  bearing in mind that the United Nations should not become incapable of adjustment or lack the flexibility that the times require because of the gap between what was expected in the Charter and the changed circumstances. We have repeatedly stated that there is no change  of course  in Japan's support for the basic ideals of the United Nations and the principles of the Charter. But in view of the altered circumstances  we note that the question of Charter review has again been placed on the agenda of this session [item 95]. I should like to emphasize that our intention is to see the United Nations evolve  in fact as well as in theory  into the sole  comprehensive and universal international organization for world peace and prosperity  as the world enters into a new era. We should like to ask the understanding and the support of all Member States for Japan's hopes for this great Organization.100.	In this statement  I have made two proposals on the basis of my firm belief that the role to be played by the United Nations will become more and more important in the world of today  since the goal of a truly stable global peace is still distant  in spite of the basic trend towards detente.101.	The first proposal is that the General Assembly recommend that the United Nations  in particular the Security Council  study measures for securing the effective prevention of nuclear proliferation on the basis of the outcome of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The second proposal is that the Economic and Social Council  as the organ for the overall co-ordination of the economic and social problems of the world  be asked to formulate its vision of the future of mankind. Admittedly  the implementation of these two proposals is fraught with enormous problems  and it cannot be completed within a short period of time. Because of the importance and scope of the proposals  however  I am convinced that they deserve serious consideration by the United Nations which is dedicated to the promotion of peace and justice in the international community."
"68",3675,"KEN",29,1974,"Mr. President  allow me first to join the previous speakers in congratulating you on your unanimous election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. I have the pleasure also to bring to you and  through you  to the Assembly the greetings of my President His Excellency Mzee Jomo Kenyatta  who is a distinguished fighter for freedom and justice in the continent of Africa  and also of the Government and the people of Kenya. He  like the leaders and the people of your country  found after many years of reasoning and logical debate that the freedom of a people could not be recovered from colonialists peacefully. Your country and mine have a lot in common  and we therefore share the pleasure of your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. In conferring this high office on you and on Algeria  the General Assembly has manifested its confidence in your wisdom and distinguished qualities of leadership and experience. This year's agenda is heavy and the whole session is bound to produce developments with far- reaching consequences for the future. This is why we feel that a heavy burden is placed on your shoulders  and  therefore  my delegation will fully co-operate with you and give you all support possible in order not to make that burden heavier than it already is.2.	May I also take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  the Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations  for the able  dedicated and forthright manner in which he guided the affairs of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly. The success of the two sessions in no small measure depended on Mr. Benites.3.	It is also fitting that I should pay tribute to the Secretary-General and the staff of the United Nations for the good work they have done in the past year.The organization of the sixth special session and the efforts made to deal with the crises in the Middle East and Cyprus  in addition to the normal schedule  must have added extra demands on the Secretary- General and his staff. They all deserve our thanks and commendation.4.	It is my pleasure to salute and welcome in our midst  on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Kenya  the three new Members  namely  the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. My country has many affinities with these new nations. It has been Kenya's special pleasure heartily to subscribe to the Security Council's recommendations for their admission to United Nations membership. This is a major step towards the goal of the universality of the United Nations.5.	Guinea-Bissau deserves particular mention for its heroic struggle for independence and freedom  which ultimately had the result of liberating the peoples of metropolitan Portugal and setting the stage for what is happening now. We urge the United Nations and its specialized agencies  as well as individual Member States  to give Guinea-Bissau all the assistance possible in its effort of national reconstruction.6.	This year the General Assembly is meeting in changed circumstances with regard to the decolonization question. We have noted with satisfaction the attitude of the new Portuguese Government towards the evil of colonialism. What has taken place in Africa in the last few months leads us to believe that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of colonialism in that long abused continent. The new Government of Portugal deserves congratulations for what it has achieved so far and encouragement and support to complete  in the next few months  the task it has embarked upon. A delay may damage the good work and give the forces of exploitation and oppression a chance to show their ugly head again.7.	The irony of the situation facing Africa today is that  on the one hand  independence is on the horizon in respect of the Portuguese-occupied Territories  but  on the other hand  racist minority regimes still ruthlessly  blindly and fearfully entrench themselves in the belief that the misguided systems they champion have a future in Africa. That is the case with the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. !n that colony the rebel regime continues with impunity and glaring defiance to uproot  herd and displace the African population and forcibly to take their remaining lands  pass discriminatory legislation and faithfully and blindly copy South African crimes of apartheid.8.	These extreme measures of folly are blindly undertaken contrary to enlightened public opinion within and outside that Territory and in utter disregard of the norms of a civilized international community. The rebellious clique which champions the so-called independence in Southern Rhodesia should not delude itself. Those who have sustained that rebellion are to blame for the unpleasant consequences that their misdeeds will unleash in that part of Africa. The combination of support from the South African regime guilty of the crime of apartheid and other well-known nations is worthy of condemnation by all peace-loving nations of the world.9.	My delegation is pained that key nations with which Kenya enjoys valuable international co-operation in trade  commerce and political and economic relations are so deeply involved in the affairs of such widely unacceptable regimes. We call on them to support the United Nations in its endeavors to rehabilitate Southern Rhodesia and South Africa.10.	I wish to reiterate that my delegation is firmly of the following views. First  the United Kingdom remains the administering Power of that colony of Southern Rhodesia and must  by word and deed  exercise that power to stop the South African regime from slowly annexing that colony. Secondly  the principle of ""no independence before majority rule"" should be adhered to before a change in the status of the colony is effected. Thirdly  the African leaders and all political detainees must be released immediately and consulted before the eventual formation of a Government representing the majority of the peoples of Zimbabwe. Fourthly  all Member States of the United Nations should apply mandatory sanctions  as called for by the Security Council. At present  many Member States either openly support the breach of sanctions  as is the case with some known States  including those which initially called for them as an alternative to the use of force to quell the rebellion  or plead all manner of excuses as to why the sanctions cannot be enforced.11.	A dangerous situation persists in the southern part of the African continent  one that has been under the consideration of the United Nations since its inception. We have the oppressive  imperialist and expansionist regime of South Africa  armed to the hilt by its known collaborators  expending untold resources on arms from some well-known Member nations of the Organization. That regime is still scornfully occupying the United Nations Trust Territory of Namibia  in defiance of law and reason. It is extending its tentacles to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia  for purposes both of security and of economic and political expansion. The recent rail link between Southern Rhodesia and South Africa has the obvious effect of integrating the two regimes economically and evading the United Nations sanctions imposed on the colony of Southern Rhodesia. Internally  the regime is tightening its ruthless grip on the indigenous peoples  who are stripped of all human dignity and human rights and used as profit-production machines to fill the coffers of the interests currently brazenly defying the United Nations sanctions against the British colony of Southern Rhodesia.12.	In such circumstances of oppression  defiance and expansion and veiled discouragement of decolonization in southern Africa  the African States and the international community are in duty bound to review the implications of the arms buildup there. We have urged all nations that value human life to halt their sale of arms to South Africa  and to cooperate with the United Nations in taking corrective action by terminating commercial  diplomatic and consular relations with that country.13.	The voice of reason has gone unheeded. Many well-known nations from all corners of the earth not only continue to expand their financial and other relations with South Africa but also sell armaments to that country  which has continued to defy the United Nations with regard to Namibia and Southern Rhodesia. In our view  the time has come for the rest of Africa to pose the question? who indeed is a friend of Africa? Has the time not come for the African countries to shape their destiny in the light of the general interests they all share with the other Members of the international community? Is it not time that they chose either us or those regimes? These are legitimate questions to raise in the General Assembly for all to ponder.14.	Some Powers distinguish between arms for external defense and arms for internal defense. This is a meaningless distinction  in terms of the peace and security of the African continent. Such devious ways of avoiding their duties to the international community are not  however  confined to the sale of arms. In the field of trade  parent companies in many well- known countries have been giving franchises to local companies. Can anybody doubt that the profits derived from such transactions reach those countries that are at the forefront in denying that they have dealings With Southern Africa?15.	As I have already stated  the time is ripe for us in Africa to know  through deeds and not through empty words  who are the friends of Africa. Indeed  my delegation will spare no effort directed towards the removal of the delinquent racist regime of South Africa from the community of civilized nations. I must quickly add  however  that the primary aim of any international action should be to correct and rehabilitate South Africa  since we adhere to the principle of the universality of the United Nations.16.	Every nation  large or small  has the right to expect to live in peace and security. To every nation  therefore  the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security are of paramount importance. The small nations may not have a button to push to destroy the entire human race; but  if they are not at peace with one another  the threat to international peace and security is just as real  since  in the event of conflict  each nation has friends and enemies. The maintenance of international peace is therefore of cardinal importance to all  and is not the exclusive preserve of one or two mighty nations.17.	Despite the avowed intentions of all Member States to preserve peace and security  in the last few months the world community has been shocked: we witnessed in the middle of July an overt attempt to destroy by force of arms a Member of this Organization. I refer to the attempt by some Members of this Organization to destroy by force of arms the Republic of Cyprus  a non-aligned country whose makeup and history show many parallels with Kenya's  and with which Kenya has maintained close relations for many years.18.	In dealing with the problem of Cyprus  my delegation takes as a starting-point the fact that Cyprus exists as an independent  sovereign and full Member of the United Nations. We are happy to note that the Security Council has unanimously affirmed this [resolution 353 (1974)]. We believe that Cyprus will be assisted if all Member States respect its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity.19.	The problem of Cyprus is made to appear complex. However  at the root of it all is the fact that the people of Cyprus have not been given a chance to develop a sense of nationhood. They have been encouraged by external forces to accentuate their differences rather than to harmonize their common interests. We believe  therefore  that the first and cardinal step towards the solving of the Cyprus problem is non-interference by outsiders. I note in this regard that the Security Council has called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from the island [ibid.]. This is a basic requirement. We are confident that  encouraged by the international community  the Cypriot people will be capable of discussing their problems and solving them.20.	My delegation is aware of the territorial claims to parts of Cyprus made by outsiders. We are also aware of the treaties or guarantees imposed on Cyprus by the agreements of Zurich and Geneva of 1960 and would like to reiterate that we consider those Treaties to be inequitable and one of the underlying causes of the present crisis in Cyprus. We were doubtful of the sustained ability of those Treaties to form the basis of negotiations for the return of peace and constitutional government in Cyprus. Kenya was among the first countries to call for a more direct participation of the United Nations in assisting the Republic of Cyprus to solve its problems. We believe the communities should be encouraged to have more direct talks under the auspices of the United Nations  and that nothing that would aggravate the already delicate situation should be done in order to avoid the possibility of renewed hostilities that would lead to further loss of life. We are confident that with the support of the United Nations the problem of Cyprus will be solved.21.	One other area that continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security is the Middle East. This year  we meet hopefully in happier circumstances than was the case a year ago. A shooting war erupted then in that unhappy region. The Assembly and the Security Council were put under severe pressure. Fortunately  the joint efforts of all Member States  and especially those directly concerned  prevented the situation from becoming a major world disaster. A framework of negotiations to normalize the situation and to bring about a just and lasting peace was born.22.	Over the past 10 months  the international community has witnessed slow but positive signs of the will of the nations in that region to achieve peace. The disengagement agreements and the talks in Geneva are a welcome development. Kenya hopes that the experience gained over these months will not have been in vain. Rather  it will give the momentum required to intensify the search for ways and means of settling the outstanding problems on the basis of law  justice and mutual respect. Kenya believes that for a lasting peace the implementation of the following principles is essential: first  the recognition by all the States in the region of the right of each State to exist in conditions of peace and security; secondly  the recognition that the acquisition of territory by force of arms is inadmissible  and thirdly  the recognition that the rights of the displaced people of the area should under no circumstances be abused  overlooked  sacrificed or minimized  and it is for this reason that we consider that all the people and parties concerned in the problem of the area should be consulted and should participate in any discussions designed to produce a permanent solution.23.	Recent developments in the arms buildup cause some concern. They pose the question as to their intention. Is this buildup to strengthen international peace and security or is it intended to threaten peace and security? A comparison of the resources employed by many nations in the military buildup and in the social services paints a hopelessly lopsided picture. Over half the national resources are consumed in military arsenals. Yet  populations go without food  without education  without employment  without proper and adequate housing  to mention but a few social amenities. If the goals and principles enshrined in the Charter are to be achieved  then nations must take collective and individual acts to limit this dangerous buildup.24.	Kenya is committed to the ideals of peace and friendly relations with all nations. Kenya realizes that in order to meet the many challenging social  economic and political developments  a climate of tranquility in international relations is basic. It is for this reason that my delegation will encourage and support all moves towards achieving the ideals of disarmament.25.	Our commitment to peace and security leads us to refer to the situation in the Indian Ocean. This ocean is neighbored by an overwhelming number of small States whose basic goal remains peace and security. The increased appearance of the naval fleets of certain nations not famed for their love of peace causes general disquiet in the area. The competition between them in an area that is desirous of peace poses a serious threat to the survival of the nations of the area. Recent events in other parts of the world cannot but convince us that the presence of these fleets in our area constitutes a veiled threat to the independence of the small nations in that area.26.	We cannot fail to realize that  in the event of tension between these Powers in the area  many of the African States on the eastern seaboard would be paralyzed. We have a crucial stake in the peaceful state of the ocean. Kenya urges all without exception to support the creation of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean.27.	Although on balance the situation regarding peace and security has been unsatisfactory  there have been some encouraging developments in the Organization during the current year. One of the most welcome of these developments is the conclusion of the work of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression [see AI9619 and Corr.l]. All the members of the Special Committee  and particularly its Chairman and Rapporteur  deserve our congratulations for managing to conclude the work of defining ""aggression""  which has eluded the international community for the last 50 years. Although far from perfect  we believe that the definition that has been achieved will go a long way towards deterring potential aggressors and would assist the Security Council in its difficult task of determining the ""existence of any threat to peace  breach of peace or act of aggression"" as required by Article 39 of the Charter of the United Nations.28.	While the definition by itself will not end aggression  we believe that States will now have a yard-stick applicable to all Members of the Organization  big or small. While my delegation is not entirely happy with the provisions of the definition  we are well aware that it has been the result of a compromise. We shall  nevertheless  be able to support it as it stands in the hope that the General Assembly will be able to adopt it.29.	As we are assembled here  the international economic situation is the one most serious problem exercising the minds of the majority of the world community. The international economic problems created by the 1971-1972 balance-of-payments upheavals  the problem of galloping inflation and the problems precipitated by oil questions remain unsolved. As for us in Africa  the impact of these international problems has been even further compounded by the very real problems of drought  food shortages and desertification  thus presenting us with an eve l more ominous picture for the future.30.	Although it is true that economic problems and especially inflationary forces are rampant all over the world  it is important that the world community not lose sight of the fact that the ones who have been hit hardest by the recent international economic ailments are the peoples of the developing countries.31.	At the bottom of our problems has  of course  been the continued and acutely unfavorable trend in our terms of trade. The prices of our essential imports of manufactured goods have been increasing year after year in the wake of the inflationary processes domestically generated in the industrialized countries. On the other hand  the price our exports and of primary sources of development finance have been either stagnant or declining. We have raised this particular issue at numerous international meetings over and over again during the last decade and will continue to do so in the hope that the world community will one day address itself to the problem. The problem is the unrealistic prices of raw materials in relation to the price of manufactured products.32.	The economic interdependence of the present world has been more than underscored by the events of the last 12 months. The trade or monetary policies followed by individual or groups of Governments to deal with their economic  social or political problems can now no longer be ignored by the rest of the world community. The convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly last April was a belated but very welcome manifestation of the international recognition of this very basic fact of our times.33.	As for us  the developing countries  the convening of the session and the subsequent adoption of the two milestone resolutions the Declaration on theEstablishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)]  in which the world community solemnly proclaimed its united determination to work urgently towards that goal  and the Pro-gramme of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)]- were seen as the advent of a new era of genuine economic co-operation with the rest of the world for the good of all. We very much welcomed the Program of Action especially in the fields of trade liberalization  inter-national monetary reforms  food and fertilizer production  transfer of technology  industrialization and flow of development finance.34.	Unfortunately  and it is. a matter of deep concern and disappointment to us  we have over the last few months been progressively confronted with vigorous efforts aimed at either frustrating or altogether preventing the implementation of that very pivotal Program of Action. We are well aware of the fact that certain nations did express reservations after General Assembly resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) had been adopted. We accept their sovereign right to enter those reservations. But we do not accept those reservations as being of such importance as to nullify the decisions taken by the world community last April.35.	We appeal to those nations to re-examine once again their declared positions. The realities of our economic interdependence in the trade and monetary fields have already entrenched us in an era where we can no longer post-pone the development and implementation of new concepts  new options and an entirely new range of ground rules with which to tackle our current and progressively 'increasing economic predicaments. We are all collectively responsible for our common destiny  and it is therefore imperative that we make a more positive effort to perceive our interdependence and common destiny in a more en-lightened perspective. A civilization that guarantees enough food and drink and shelter to only a third of its people cannot survive.36.	During this session  food  or rather the lack of it  has been uppermost in the program of many Member States. Kenya will make its modest contribution towards the solving of this problem during the World Food Conference in November. Africa  which suffered from severe droughts last year  droughts that brought untold misery to many in the continent  cannot forget the lessons learned from that tragedy. We are thankful for the massive aid that poured in from all over the world  co-ordinated by th.e United Nations. As the lessons of that tragedy showed  Africa needs more than the ad hoc massive drops of food in the affected area. Africa  like most of the other developing areas  has sufficient rich productive soil. What it lacks is technology and resources to revolutionize its subsistence agriculture. Kenya  therefore  hopes that the developed countries will  during the Conference in November  in billing to consider the possible transfer of correct technology and make enough resources available to the developing countries so that they can achieve the aims of the Conference enough food for each person in the world in the shortest possible time.37.	The oil crisis concerns the entire international community. But  as I have stated earlier with regard to the general world economic situation  it is the small countries  like my own  that have been hit the hardest. The price increases have disrupted the development plans of many countries and  if not checked  could well result in total collapse of the economies of those countries. The solution to the oil crisis  therefore  is not of interest to the major consumers and producers alone  but to all of us. It is for this reason that we favor the solution of the problem within the context of the United. Nations. We believe that the collective responsibility in solving this crisis correctly falls under Article 56 of the Charter.38.	The first step towards the global approach to the solution of the oil crisis is not to indulge so much in apportioning blame. We cannot gain anything by distributing blame when the crisis continues to grow worse. What we need is for the oil-producing countries and the corporations that deal in oil to get together with the oil consumers under the auspice? of the Organization to formulate ways and means of solving the crisis urgently. The most dangerous way of handling this oil crisis is to do nothing now thus leaving all the parties to seek their salvation by hurting others. In the end we shall all be losers.39.	In order that the Organization could adequately assist Member States in solving the energy crisis  it is essential that new approaches and machinery be established within the system. We call  therefore  as an initial step  for the strengthening of the section which deals with energy in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This would put the Organization in line  indeed make the Organization take the lead  in what is already happening at the national level.40.	The second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was held at Caracas. I should like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude of my delegation to the Government and the people of Venezuela for the excellent arrangements they made to host the Conference which  as many have remarked  was the largest international Conference ever held. The fact that no final results were achieved should not in any way detract from the importance of the Conference and particularly of that session. A lot of progress  on which the successful conclusion of the immense task depends  has already been made at Caracas. The general debate on all the issues has been finalized. Concrete proposals on all the items are now before the Conference. What remains now is serious and business-like negotiations by all States with a view to harmonizing different positions and ai living at a generally acceptable convention.41.	I should like  however  to point out that we from the developing countries cannot afford the leisure of continuing these negotiations indefinitely. The Confer-ence heavily taxed our financial and manpower re-sources. We are determined t'.iat the next session of the Conference  scheduled for March to May 1975  should be the final one. Though a great deal of work remains to be done  we are convinced that with good will and a serious negotiating spirit  the Conference can bring its work to a successful conclusion.42.	We would be prepared to support a final ceremonial session. We shall not be willing  however  to support an endless series of sessions while some of the States represented engage in what appears to be a filibuster designed to block all efforts at changing the existing status quo on the exploration and exploitation of the wealth of the sea  which favors a few developed countries at the expense of everyone else. Changes inevitably are going to come. It is up to all the States represented to engage in a serious dialog in order to ensure that the changes will be equitable and fair to all; otherwise the changes may have to come from the unilateral action of States  which can lead only to further confusion in this field and will continue to be a dangerous source of international conflicts. The Kenya delegation will not be found wanting in making determined efforts to arrive at a generally acceptable convention during the forthcoming session of the Conference and we hope that all other States will co-operate in a similar spirit.43.	The whole world has been shocked and grieved at the terrible disaster that has afflicted Honduras  and  only yesterday  Peru  countries which have very close ties with my own country. On behalf of the Government and the people of Kenya  I convey our deep sympathies to the Government and the peoples of Honduras and Peru. These disasters underline once again the necessity for a more vigorous approach by the international community to the problem of emergency assistance in cases of disaster. Developing countries have been continuously at the mercy of natural disasters because they lack adequate machinery for pre-disaster warning or the means to combat disasters when they occur. We urge the speed-up of programs to train personnel from developing countries for pre-disaster warning  and the strengthening of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordination  so that loss of life and property can be minimized.44.	The events of the last few years  more so the events of the last 12 months  have shown how inter-dependent the international community has become. No longer can States sit back and say of an event happening in another part of the world  ""It does not concern us."" Technology has brought us so close to one another  yet paradoxically  old attitudes and prejudices have not disappeared. The pursuit of narrow national interests at the expense of wider international interests has at times brought the world to the brink of war. Rigid adherence to instructions has stifled constructive discussion in international forums.45.	Despite all these shortcomings  Kenya has faith in the United Nations. We hope that Member States will take appropriate actions to see that the structure and the orientation of the Organization encourage more harmony and co-operation for the benefit of all man-kind. Kenya  for its part  will continue to make its modest contribution in this direction."
"69",3746,"KHM",29,1974,"I am very happy to be able to associate myself with the previous speakers from this rostrum in conveying to the President  Mr. Bouteflika  my warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the Presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Under his impartial direction and because of his distinguished statesmanlike qualities  our debates will certainly be conducted in the necessary atmosphere of tranquility  thus enabling the Assembly at the present session to achieve its objective of bringing peace and stability to the world in keeping with the role of the Organization.3.	I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  whose tireless efforts for peace are familiar to everyone.4.	It is a particular pleasure for me to be able to repeat our feelings of profound admiration for Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who conducted our proceedings last year with such efficiency  such tried competence and total impartiality. His long experience in the United Nations and his warm-hardheartedness guaranteed the success of the work of the twenty-eighth session and the work of the sixth special session of the General Assembly.5.	Faithful to the principle of universality of the Organization  and thereby faithful to our fundamental policy of maintaining friendly relations with all countries without any distinction as to regime or political ideology  my Government is happy to welcome the three countries just admitted to membership in the United Nations—Grenada  Bangladesh and Guinea- Bissau.6.	I am sure that you will permit me  as Prime Minister of the Khmer Republic  to deal exclusively today with a question which for me and for all the Khmer people is one of the highest priority  that of the representation of Cambodia in the United Nations.7.	A draft resolution introduced last year by 33 nations asks the Assembly""to restore the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations  recognizing its representatives as the sole lawful representatives of Cambodia  and to expel the representatives of the Lon Nol group from the seat they illegally occupy in the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.""18.	This draft resolution  which was not considered at the last session  will soon be discussed here. What the sponsors of the draft resolution in derogatory terms call ""the Lon Nol group"" is the Government of the Khmer Republic  which in 1970 succeeded what was then the Royal Government as a fully fledged Member of the United Nations  and  as everyone will acknowledge  it has fully complied with all the obligations of membership.9.	As we approach a debate unique in the annals of the Organization  a debate which may have incalculable consequences with regard to the credibility of the Organization and to the subsequent fate of other Member States  the Republican Government considers it its duty to draw the attention of all nations of good will to the extreme gravity of the decision which the Assembly will soon have to take.10.	Indeed  never has a State  because it has changed its regime something which is a purely domestic affair seen its representation in the United Nations come up for discussion. In recent years in fact  in the last 12 months regimes hitherto considered as legitimate have collapsed under the pressure of the people or of the army. Who in this Assembly has asked that representatives of new regimes be kept outside the United Nations and that representatives of outgoing regimes should be kept on or called back?11.	There are many Members of the United Nations  in all parts of the world  which have to confront attempts at armed subversion whose main instigators are living abroad. This is the case  in particular  of some of the sponsors of the draft resolution sponsored by 33 countries  which calls for the expulsion from the United Nations of the Khmer Republic. This is also the case of a number of other Governments which  having recognized for many different reasons that we shall examine later the so-called ""Royal Government of Cambodia""  feel obliged to promote its entry into the Organization.12.	Do not the regimes which have taken this position realize that the precedent they are about to create may one day be used against them? If the United Nations were to reject a regime which  like ours  is in control of its capital  all the major and medium-sized towns  most of the economically important regions and much more than three fourths of the population of the country and this for more than four years  in spite of all the pessimistic forecasts made out of malice or misinformation by the self-styled specialists then what regime  I ask  even among those that criticize us  could be sure that  if in its turn it had to combat a substantial attempt at subversion  some heterogeneous coalition favorable to its enemies would not one day exclude it from the United Nations?13.	Would it not be playing with fire to deal such a blow to a Government which has been defending itself with ever-growing success against an unprovoked aggression and which is doing everything in its power  politically and diplomatically  to restore peace at home?14.	There has been no lack of warnings to this effect in the Assembly  the most significant perhaps coming from nations of South Asia  which understand the problems of the Khmer Republic better than most. All these friendly neighboring countries have urged their colleagues not to try to impose a Government in exile on a State. To act in this way  they have argued  would be to jeopardize the very structure of the United Nations.15.	The reference made by these Powers to a Government in exile is perfectly valid in so far as concerns the so-called ""Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia"". It is true that a certain number of Khmer Marxist leaders  although in 1970 they were in the anti-Sihanouk camp  obtained without any difficulty from the deposed Prince  who was anxious for vengeance  the title of ""Minister""  and are living somewhere in Cambodian territory  in the shelter of the forests and moving around constantly in order to avoid discovery. Yet they have nothing more to fear than our very small national air force. They claim  in order to explain the absence of any fixed residence  that only Phnom Penh would be an appropriate capital for them. But perhaps to make an impression on the United Nations  they may very soon decide to set themselves up in a provisional capital which they will proceed to abandon as soon as the debate is over.16.	The so-called Royal Government cannot  for all that  avoid being described as a Government in exile  since its top leaders at least according to their titles continue to reside outside national territory. First and foremost  this is the case with its ""head of State""  Prince Norodom Sihanouk  who has been in Peking for over four years; in spite of his representations and claims  the Khmer Marxists have been obstinately refusing him the right to return and live permanently in his own country. This is also the case with its ""Prime Minister""  Mr. Penn Nouth  who  in order to explain why he is staying in the Chinese capital  is invoking ""reasons of health"". This is also the case with its ""Foreign Minister""  Mr. Sarinn Chhak  and also the ""Minister of State for Special Affairs""  Mr. Chau Seng  and some others  who have never set foot in Cambodia since 1970.17.	You may recall that last year a spokesman for Governments in exile stated in the Assembly that  when a country is occupied by foreign troops  popular resistance is very often headed by a Government in exile. This representative obviously was thinking of the provisional Algerian Government which led the struggle against the French troops in Algeria from outside the country. However  one might point out  on the one hand  that the only foreign occupation forces in Cambodia since 1966 have been those of North Viet Nym and the Viet-Cong  and that  on the other hand  to our knowledge  Algeria was only admitted to membership in the United Nations after its Government had set itself up in Algiers pursuant to the agreements concluded with France.18.	In the case of the entry of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations a case in which certain delegations sought a precedent which could be used against the Khmer Republic we cannot but stress the fact that  when the People's Republic of China occupied the seat which up to that point had been occupied by the Nationalist regime of Taiwan  it had long been in occupation of all continental Chinese territory  including  of course  its capital  a situation which would not be more different from that of the so-called ""Royal Government"".19.	Among the nations which have recognized this ""Government""  some have done so out of ideological solidarity with the Khmer Communists  or because of great-Power ambitions with regard to IndoChina; others  again  out of sympathy towards a movement which  disguising its true nature  has awarded itself the resounding title of ""non-aligned and anti-imperialist""; others  again  because their leaders had friendly personal relations with our former head of State  Prince Sihanouk. There are many critics from every side against the regime of a small country like ours! So many worries for a Prime Minister who  in spite of all the respect owed to the representatives here  would have preferred not to have had to leave his capital where so many urgent  even tragic  problems beset him every day!20.	And for a Khmer  that is to say  someone who is anxious for understanding  friendship  good and cordial relations with everyone for a Khmer it is extremely painful to see his Government and people perpetually in the dock before the highest court of nations to which the unfortunate Khmer Republic has done no harm except perhaps in that it exists. It is true that in the international community our Republic does have many faithful friends  and we cannot express too much gratitude for their courage and their faith. We even have some in the third world itself  friends who have bravely resisted 'he pressures exerted upon them to abandon our defense. Unfortunately  we also have in the same third world enemies  some violent events at least the others much less heated  and who  I am convinced  would only come out against us reluctantly. Is there any need to remind you that among the sponsors of the draft resolution which would expel us from the United Nations there is only one Asian Power  precisely the one which is the protector  the financer and the harborer of the so-called ""Royal Government""?21.	As to the other Governments which are against us  they know us  above all  through the very black portrait which the vast propaganda machine of our enemies has painted of our Republican regime. Beset by numerous difficulties  perhaps we have not done enough to try to create a better image of ourselves abroad. However  we do not underestimate the intense diplomatic activity which has been carried on abroad by our former head of State  who has  to the benefit of the so-called Royal Khmer Government if only to show that he can still make himself useful drawn on the capital of the connexions which 15 years of authority and international meetings enabled him to accumulate. Thus  last year  at the non-aligned conference at Alger a conference from which we were banned  of course most of the participants voted  in spite of the reservations of our friends who were there  for a motion favorable to recognition of the so-called Royal Government. Some of the representatives to the conference told us later on that they would have much preferred not having to be involved in the Khmer dispute  but that somehow the heated spirit which prevails at major international meetings caused them to act as they did. We hope that  in the more tranquil atmosphere of the General Assembly  nations which are in that position will give more consideration to the fate of a people than to that of a single man.22.	The Khmer Republic has  as we said  been painted in very dark colors. In the eyes of Governments who have no observers on the spot  it has been described as a retrograde regime without any popular support and  of course  as a ""lackey of the American imperialists"". Furthermore  that regime has been pictured as being at the end of its tether militarily  incapable of defending what is claimed to be the small part of the national territory it has left against the irresistible assault of the so-called liberation forces. The latter description has succeeded in disturbing several Foreign Ministries  which  believing in the imminent victory of the ""Khmers rouges""  did not wish to be the last to recognize their ""Government"".23.	That caricature of the Khmer Republican regime has done it a great deal of harm. We should like here calmly to state the true position  anH we shall start with the military situation.24.	The real difficulties we encountered up to the middle of 1973 have now been entirely overcome. Totally reorganized  better commanded  with an appreciable improvement in its material position  our national army has for more than a year now been repelling all the assaults of the enemy: Khmers and communist Vietnamese. In September 1973 one month after United States tactical air support had been discontinued the Republican forces repelled  in hand-to- hand fighting  the major attack mounted by the Reds against the large economic center of Kompong Cham.25.	This year  after having lost control for a short time of the large rural center of Oudong the former Royal capital our forces  by means of a strong counter-attack  drove out the occupiers and re-entered the neighboring regions. The violent attacks later mounted by the communists against other large centers the port of Kampot  the provincial capital of Takeo and the provincial capital of Kompong Chhnang— ended in resounding defeats for the aggressor. Around the capital and the provincial towns formerly under enemy pressure  the situation has greatly improved.26.	Unlike the Khmer communists  who imprudently boasted of crushing the Republic during the last dry season  we have no intention of setting a date  even an approximate one  for the complete liberation of our territory. There may still be some disappointments or failures here or there. But what is certain today is that it is no longer possible for the enemy to win a military victory. We believe that sooner or later and sooner rather than later the enemy will draw the necessary political conclusions.27.	We should like the United Nations  which for years now has been discussing the very complicated problem of disarmament  to undertake to encourage  by all its political and moral means  the disarming of minds in countries like our own where for years now the worst kinds of acts of violence have been committed. We are of course happy to note the Organization's interest in the events in the Middle East. But should it not be as vigilant and active in matters of concern to us? The Khmer people firmly believe that the United Nations can contribute to ending their troubles. Before I left for New York  I myself received a delegation of Khmer farmers  refugees  who said this to me: ""When you are there"" that is  here at the United Nations ""tell those important people that all of our people are suffering; tell them that they must help us to make peace and  in the mean time  assist those who have lost everything"".28.	The representatives of a large community  the Islamic Khmers  our country-men of the Moslem faith  also spoke to me in moving terms. Refusing out of religious and moral conviction to espouse the cause of our enemies  they have suffered reprisals: their most beautiful mosques have been destroyed in five provinces and a large number of their hakims and imams have been murdered. Other mosques have been profaned by North Vietnamese troops  who sacrilegiously raised pigs there for food. Faced with the hostility of the Khmer Moslems  the communists have thrown old men into concentration camps  from which they have never returned. Healthy men and women have been subjected to a re-education program in which atheism is taught. Daily public prayer has been banned.29.	The venerable Hadji  the leaders of the Islamic religion in the Khmer Republic  said to me: ""Tell our brothers who represent the Moslem States in the United Nations about our deplorable plight"". Well  the message has been delivered  and it has been delivered by the Khmer Republic  which has recognized the Islamic religion.30.	It goes without saying that our enemies have not spared the large number of Buddhist monks in our country  either  whenever those monks have refused to be used as instruments for propaganda among the masses. Many monks in all the provinces have been arrested  persecuted and sometimes executed; their pagodas have been burnt as an example to others. The Christian religion  although there are very few persons of that religion in our country  has not been treated any better. We view that offensive  sometimes underhanded  sometimes brutal  against all the religions represented in Cambodia as the result of the particularly evil influence of the North Vietnamese officials who are the mentors of the Khmer communists.31.	The policy pursued by the Khmer Republic can be understood only if one bears constantly in mind the fact that  since 1966  its regions bordering Viet Nam and  since 1970  the major part of the territory east of the Mekong have been occupied by North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong forces; the number of such forces has varied  but it has never been less than several tens of thousands. Operating from the protection of our territory  those forces are mounting operations against the regime of the Republic of Viet Nam. A rather large part of our country has served and is still serving this time against our will as a rear base against a neighboring country  and that is in violation of our neutrality. The occupiers  whose presence Sihanouk had tolerated and who were receiving from their friends military material through Cambodian ports  ended up by acting in our country as if they were conquerors  driving out our peasants whose presence hampered their activities and openly mocking our powerless provincial authorities. What independent nation  devoted to its sovereignty and anxious to remain truly neutral  could have accepted the perpetuation of this intolerable and constantly worsening situation?32.	Even before the overthrow of Sihanouk  who bears a great responsibility in this matter  the Khmer Government which was then the Royal Government  but whose principal leaders were for the most part the same as they are today warned the Vietnamese communists to withdraw from our territory without delay. They gave a very swift reply: they attacked our forces in several provinces in the east and south of the country. We had at that time no more than about 30 000 ill-equipped men under arms. However  this handful of fighters  swiftly reinforced by young patriotic volunteers  gave a good account of themselves against these Vietnamese communist forces which were superior in numbers and in armaments when they  immediately after 18 March 1970  spread throughout the country in an attempt to overthrow in the briefest time possible the Khmer Republic  which was guilty of refusing them ""sanctuary"".33.	Our national army  our citizen volunteers  and our peasants valiantly resisted for 43 days  absolutely alone  the worst attack that Cambodia has ever sustained in this century. It was only and this is a date to remember on 30 April that United States troops from South Viet Nam entered Cambodian territory to a depth of less than 30 kilometers  less to save our Government than to clear the frontier regions neighboring on South Viet Nam  which was threatened. These troops remained for exactly one month in Cambodia  from 30 April to 1 June 1970. They never came back. This is the truth about the so-called occupation of Cambodia by foreign troops. For more than four years now there have been only Khmer troops in Khmer territory. We are harboring no foreign force or military base  contrary to what certain malicious Powers  who are confusing our country with other countries  persist in claiming. The number of Americans in Cambodia  including the entire civilian and military personnel of their embassy in Phnom Penh  does not exceed 200. To put an end to the charges made against us in this respect we are ready to receive in our country those of you who have in good faith been misled by the mendacious propaganda of our enemies. They can discover for themselves what the real situation is in our country  and we undertake  in advance  to facilitate the visit of United Nations envoys to any part of the territory controlled by the Khmer Republic  to open to them our military bases  our camps  without any reservation or limitation. They will be able to talk with whomever they like and to check on anything they consider important.34.	We would be curious to know if the other side is in a position to make such an offer of inspection by the United Nations. The so-called ""Royal Government"" has not  so far  allowed any foreigners to penetrate the zones which they claim to be liberating except  of course  for the North Vietnamese and Viet-Cong occupiers. The only foreign journalists there are those who have been captured when  side by side with our troops and at great risk to themselves  they were making an attempt to inform international public opinion honestly. About 20 of them disappeared in this way  and we are very worried about what has happened to them. It would  however  be interesting to see at first hand whether in the Khmer communist zones there are not any foreign troops or foreign bases. Our enemies will claim that they are being vilified when they hear me say such things. Well  they have an excellent opportunity to show their good faith by proposing  as we have done  an ""open door"" operation in their own territory  offering the same facilities to our Organization. Will they take this opportunity? If they do not  nations of good faith will be able to judge in what part of Cambodia there really are foreign troops.35.	It is true that until 15 August 1973 we enjoyed American tactical air support. It enabled our army to organize and to equip itself  and to grow to 250 000 men. It prevented the south of the IndoChina peninsula from falling to the Vietnamese communists. It is indeed clear that if a regime favorable to Hanoi had installed itself by force in Phnom Penh it would have assisted in every way that it could the communist forces operating in South Viet Nam as well as the subversive movement in Thailand. It was not cheerfully but out of harsh necessity that we accepted this air support  for those on the other side who were falling under these bombs were our own brothers. In the ""red"" zones there are many <people who do not even know what Marxism is  and who wish for nothing so much as the end to inhuman fighting and the return to peace and a decent life. Among the so-called liberation armed forces  how many fighters have been press-ganged into service and feel closer to the Republicans  who are defending traditional Khmer ideals  than they do to the intolerant and fanatical officers commanding them? But  I am afraid  bombs do not discriminate among their victims. 36.	Does the fact that we have accepted United States assistance make us their lackeys? The so- called ""Royal Government"" is very ill-placed to make this claim  being a ""Gpvernment"" which would not exist at all without the unconditional support and the ""loans"" that are really gifts from Peking; whose armed forces would be here guerrillas hopelessly making sporadic raids if^ they did not regularly receive an abundance of arms  ammunition and modern war material from certain socialist countries  primarily China.37.	The truth is that from the very depths of our heart we wish for nothing more than a rapid end to the conflict which is ruining our economy and destroying our villages  and which has created more than 2 million refugees; a conflict which has killed or crippled for four years now hundreds of thousands of our countrymen out of a total of 7 million. This blood bath  if it goes on  will finally wear out our country  which is so poor and weak that it would then inevitably be-come an unimportant satellite of either the East or the West  losing finally its very national identity. It is tragic to note that the predictions of all the Republican leaders are shared by our former head of State in Peking  where the press has taken up and reported words almost identical with our own just a few months ago. Surely it is paradoxical and tragic that the same man who so loudly approves the Khmer communists' rejection of any of our proposals to discuss the Khmer problem without conditions does not conceal from those around him that the ""reds""  as he calls them  are ready to fight for years longer to avoid a compromise solution that would prevent them from exercising power over all Cambodia.38.	It should be stressed that the obstinacy of the Khmer communists in rejecting any offer of talks with the Government of the Republic can be explained for more than a year  not by the prospect of an early military victory which they now know to be beyond their grasp but by the fact that they are waiting for a decision in their favor by the United Nations which will enable them  they believe  to win diplomatically a resounding victory that they can no longer win on the battlefield.39.	It is our duty to issue a solemn warning to the Powers which have an interest in Cambodia that  in such an event  as in the very worst moments we have been through in more than four years  our Government will never throw in its hand. On the contrary  with the support of its heroic armed forces and the vast majority of the patriotic people who do not want to see installed in their country a regime beholden to foreigners  it will strengthen its resistance. And not only will there be no return of peace  but for our unfortunate country there will open up the gloomy prospect of a cruel and interminable war in the course of which  I should like to point out  we shall not lack friends on the international or regional level. And  however much we love peace  we will never give in.40.	In a speech which he is making on this very day to mark the fourth anniversary of the Republic  our President  Marshal Lon Nol  after having expressed his hatred of the war which has imposed so much sacrifice on our people  states:""But let there be no doubt in the minds of our adversaries: we shall continue to fight  if necessary  to prevent ideas and concepts alien to our traditions being imposed upon us. In our struggle for our liberties  we enjoy the support and sympathy of many foreign countries.""41.	Peace will be restored to Cambodia only through conciliation  never by force. That is why  in his speech  the President of our Republic repeated the governmental appeal of 9 July ""to all Khmers and to all countries that love justice and peace for a dialog to be established which will put an end to this conflict"". It must be possible  he added  ""to agree on ideas  values and concepts which could guide the future of this country"".42.	A just peace for Cambodia  that is the desire of the vast majority of the nations represented in this Assembly. There are few who really wish to impose upon it a regime that its population does not want. Many still believe  however  that the so-called ""Royal Government of National Union""  which they are reminded on every possible occasion is ""headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk""  is truly a broadly based Government  really headed by the Prince  and able  if it came to power  to pursue a policy of neutrality and of true non-alignment. That belief is particularly widespread among friendly nations in the third world  although they have nothing but good intentions towards the Khmer people.43.	But it is not just because we deem it to be unlawful that  in this statement  we have constantly described the enemy Government as ""so-called"". And certainly not just out of an attempt to demean it  which would be petty. It is because we have every proof that behind this lofty title there lurks a different reality  a reality which all friends of an independent Cambodia—beginning with statesmen who have some personal friendship for Sihanouk—must realize.44.	First of all  there is no longer  if there ever was  a ""Royal Government"". The only person who is royal in this is our former King and former head of State who was deposed in 1970. Now he  who remains the titular head of this Government  plays no other part than that of a surety for the Khmer Communists. Not only have they never authorized him  in spite of his claims  to come back and establish himself in his own country  but in fact they never take into account his views and recommendations. Thus  set aside and humiliated  under surveillance by his Chinese hosts  spied on by certain Khmer members of his entourage  he has made it known that he will no longer co-operate with those he calls the ""Khmers rouges"" after the end of this conflict  that he will never return to Cambodia and that he will end his days in a foreign country.45.	It suffices to read certain statements of the Prince to journalists who visited him statements that he has never denied to understand that everything I have just claimed is the strict truth. Sihanouk and he knows it is now a figure of the past. He has understood but rather late in the day that a ""nationalist"" Prince  even if he considers himself progressive  has no place in a ""people's democracy"". We shall leave it to history and to our compatriots  whose misfortunes he is prolonging  to be his judge. It will be noted  however  that he persists in promoting the accession to power  in his country  of a regime under which he himself would not be willing to live. 46.	The Government-in-exile set up in opposition to us not only is not a royal Government  but is even less a Government of rational union. How could this union exist when most of the population lives in the territory of the Republic  where they gave their support to the national Government  and the self-styled ""United National Front of Cambodia""  dominated by the most extreme Marxists  is itself the best example of rivalry and divisiveness? That is why  incidentally  most of the former supporters of the Prince  seeing that their former master cannot command respect  have abandoned the cause which he was no longer defending and have rejoined the ranks of those who are fighting to protect the national ideals of the Khmer Republic.47.	Such is the ""Government"" by which some people would like to replace us in Cambodia's seat in the United Nations  a ""Government"" which  in order to win as much sympathy as possible  has always concealed its true colors  thus gravely misleading all nations of good faith in a word  a ""Government"" which could not represent the Cambodia of yesterday and today  a country which is open to all opinions  eager for knowledge of the outside world  and profoundly desirous of maintaining friendly relations with all nations whatever their ideology or governmental system provided they harbor the same desire in regard to us.48.	When our adversaries call us to war  we call them to peace. We know that in this way we are responding to the deeply seated aspirations of all our people  in whatever area the fighting has placed them. We also know that  on the other side  there are good brave men who do not want to fight for ""another 10 years"" for the triumph of an ideology  but who are weeping to see their country ruined and suffering. And there will be more and more of them in the future who will help us to bring about a peace where there will be no victors and no vanquished  but simply brothers who have been reunited.49.	The Government which I head undertakes to spare no effort  to pay whatever price is necessary  to bring an end to hostilities; in the coming months that is the wish of our nation and that is your own wish so that  finally  our people  reconciled  on begin the long march towards the goal of repairing the tremendous damage inflicted on our country  as the only path to a better life for all.50.	We therefore call upon the United Nations to help us achieve this noble objective before hundreds of thousands more of our compatriots fall on the desolated soil of our ill-starred country."
"70",3860,"KWT",29,1974," Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to express to you  on behalf of the Government and people of the State of Kuwait  heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your unanimous election is a tribute to the high status you enjoy in international circles as a statesman with wide experience. I had the privilege of working with you during Arab meetings and sessions of the non-aligned group of States and other conferences. May I say that my impression of you is one of a man of experience  acumen and ability appreciated by all. I have also had the opportunity to work with you as a colleague and a good friend during the past 10 years  and this has confirmed my earlier impression. I offer my congratulations  and wish you great success during the present session.268.	I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  for the manner in which- he conducted the work of both the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly and the sixth special session  which were marked by great efficiency and impartiality.269.	I should also like to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has worked hard to strengthen the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security  and to express appreciation for concern with the problems of the developing countries.270.	Kuwait welcomes the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to membership in the United Nations. I had the honor of taking part in the efforts which led to the conclusion of the agreement betweenBangladesh and Pakistan  as I led the mission which was sent to Dacca by the Islamic Conference in Lahore. I am very pleased to see Bangladesh among the Members of the United Nations.271.	I also welcome the admission of Grenada to membership in the United Nations. May I express the hope that the membership of those two countries will enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations and its capacity to implement the principles enshrined in the Charter and to achieve universality.272.	1 should also like to welcome the admission of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to membership in the United Nations after the struggle of its people culminated in full independence. Kuwait was among the countries which first recognized Guinea-Bissau  because it had faith in the ability of its people to triumph in their struggle against the forces of colonialism and in the lofty principles which require the liquidation of the remnants of colonialism  wherever they may be.273.	The world has made great strides in various fields of activity since the establishment of the United Nations. However  the only sphere in which little progress has been made is that of international peace and security. The world is still threatened by war and the small countries are a prey to anxiety because they do not find in the Organization or in the pattern of international relations anything to reassure the i about their existence  their destiny  and their right to maintain their independence and territorial integrity.274.	Two years ago I welcomed the symptoms of detente  which marked the relations between the big Powers  and I should still like to welcome this development  which minimizes the chances of the outbreak of a global war and saves the world from a great deal of fear and suffering. I should  however  pause to state that co-operation among the big Powers was limited in scope and did not include strengthening international peace and security  improving the efficacy of the United Nations and enhancing its prestige.275.	The best proof one can give of the failure of the. big Powers to discharge their international obligations is the impotence of the Security Council  its constant inability to act in times of crisis and to provide peace and security to the small countries  The big Powers  especially the permanent members of the Security Council  are primarily responsible for undermining the Council  damaging the prestige and impugning its capacity to apply the principles of the Charter. The members of the Security Council should act in a conscientious manner as representatives of the international community. They must also realize that the prominent position they enjoy and the additional privileges assigned to them must have as their counterpart a sense of responsibility   honoring international obligations and adherence to the letter and spirit of the Charter.276.	Kuwait has consistently advocated complete and general disarmament in international forums because it believes that the arms race must lead to disaster. The quality of arms in this age and the progress of science and technology have rendered war a dangerous tool for settling disputes among the big Powers and an abortive method of gaining ascendancy. Complete and general disarmament is still a distant ideal arid a far-fetched dream. The bilateral disarmament agreements recently concluded between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have turned the arms race from a race of quantity to that of quality  Although 11 years have elapsed since the signing of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  the nuclear Powers have not yet agreed to banning nuclear underground tests  and some Powers still conduct their tests in the atmosphere. The most significant step in the field of disarmament was the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)  annex). We still hope that the Powers concerned will reach an agreement on banning chemical weapons as well  so that this may yield earnest results in the field of disarmament by eliminating destructive weapons and not merely restricting their production and use.277.	My Government welcomed from the outset the proposal to convene a world disarmament conference  as we believe that this is a vital matter that concerns all countries. At the same time we commend the preparations being made for that conference; their thoroughness and comprehensive character are the best assurance for its success and for fulfilling the major task it is entrusted with.278.	We welcome the proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in the region of the Middle East. We hope that this proposal will receive the attention it deserves and lead to the conclusion of an international agreement akin to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America  which has proved its merit as a means of rescuing that continent from the dangers of nuclear war and an effective method for convincing the big Powers of the need to respect the aspirations of countries which do not wish to get involved in the conflict among big Powers.279.	Kuwait also supported from the outset the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. We hope that the report which the Secretary-General will make on the military and naval presence of the great Powers in the Indian Ocean will serve as an incentive to constructive debate that will lead to the conclusion of an international agreement aimed  at dismantling foreign military bases in this ocean and preventing naval deployments near its shores.. This naturally presupposes agreement  understanding and constructive co-operation among all the countries of the Indian Ocean  which must use -solidarity and unity among them as a means to compel the great military Powers to respect their will and their craving for peace. We must.be mindful of the economic aspects of disarmament which dissipate valuably human and material resources that should be used for peaceful purposes to produce houses  food  clothing and medicine for peoples afflicted with poverty and privation.	280.	The organs of the United Nations were preoccupied last year with the appraisal of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  The studies.and deliberations conducted in this respect clearly revealed that the advanced countries did not fulfill their commitments but were rather reluctant to take the necessary measures for providing aid to the developing countries and improving the terms of trade. So long as the Strategy is not applied one must come to the conclusion that the main obstacle is the lack of political will on the part of the developed countries. Kuwait is a developing country  and yet it has been devoting a large percentage of its gross national product during the past years to help less fortunate developing countries support their efforts to achieve self-sustained growth and extricate themselves from poverty and privation.281.	One must commend the United Nations for its efforts to accelerate the pace of economic and social development in the developing countries notwithstanding the meager financial resources available. I should like to make special mention of the sixth special session  which adopted a Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  designed to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the field of international economic co-operation and further the objectives of the Strategy  i should also like to thank the Organization for its promptness in extending aid to countries afflicted with drought and natural disasters. The concern of the international community with the plight of countries afflicted with such disasters is a new manifestation of true international co-operation and evidence of the prevalence of brotherhood and amity among all nations.282.	Some industrially advanced countries have once more broached the question of the rise in the price of oil and its effect on the inflation which afflicts the international economy . Those countries may have either forgotten or deliberately ignored the incontrovertible fact that the oil companies  the interests they serve and the countries to which they belong had deliberately frozen the price of oil at a very low level for more than a quarter of a century  keeping it thus static in comparison with alternative sources of energy while the prices of all basic commodities  manufactures and services exported by the industrially advanced countries had  been rising constantly throughout that period. Raising the price of oil was in essence the correction of an inequitable situation which persisted for a long time and which was dictated by the responsibility of the oil-producing countries towards their peoples. The insistence of the industrially advanced countries on keeping the price of oil low is designed to perpetuate the practice of depleting the natural and economic resources of the developing countries for the benefit of the industrially advanced countries without giving the developing countries a fair return.283.	The inflation which afflicts the world today is endemic in the industrially advanced countries  which are trying to evade their responsibilities by putting the blame on the developing countries. The last pretext they have thought up has been to ascribe their economic ills to the rise in the price of oil. Inflation has be deviled the industrially advanced countries since the end of the Second World War. It is a problem created by the economic policies of those countries and their inability to manage their domestic affairs properly. The industrially advanced countries have even exported inflation to the developing countries through the constant rise in the price of their exports of industrial equipment  foodstuffs and the various commodities and services on which the developing countries are entirely dependent.284.	The developing countries have been incessantly striving  to regain sovereignty over their natural resources and their right to decide how to exploit these resources and use the. revenues therefrom to build their economies and raise the standard of living of their peoples. The developing countries are still striving to establish an equitable relationship between the prices of their exports of raw materials  primary commodities  manufactures and semi-manufactures and the prices of their imports of food-stuffs  manufactures  semi-manufactures  industrial equipment and services.285.	The claim that energy is being used for political purposes is a cause of wonder. The countries which are heaping blame on the oil-producing countries now are the ones which started the practice of classifying goods  treating some of them as strategic materials subject to special trade rules which prohibit their export to certain countries. In that manner they have subjected trade exchange to political and ideological considerations  and used it as an instrument of pressure and intervention in the domestic affairs of other States. When the Arabs embargoed the export of oil to countries which support Israel and encourage it to>persist in its wanton and aggressive policy  their real aim was to rectify a situation contrary to the basic principles of justice  to restore usurped rights and to remind those countries of their responsibilities towards the people of Palestine  who have been deprived of sovereignty in their homeland and divested of their national and human rights. Hence there is no room for comparison between the pressure exerted by the big Powers to achieve selfish ends and the efforts of the Arab countries aimed at ending occupation  resisting aggression and restoring usurped rights to their rightful owners.286.	Moreover  some industrially advanced countries are now striving to create a link between the so-called energy and food crises. Let us  then  examine the farm policy of these countries and their plans to reduce the area of cultivated land and restrict agricultural production. One can hardly believe that some of these countries pay a subsidy to farmers in return for their commitment to leave vast areas of their farms uncultivated in order to ensure that production is restricted and prices are raised. This policy has been applied in lands noted for their huge agricultural potential and equipped with the most advanced farming and irrigation techniques. One is therefore led to conclude that if the farmers in those countries were free from constraint and encouraged to increase rather than restrict production there would be a large agricultural output which would exceed the needs of the domestic market and make food available at low prices.287.	How unusual is the policy of those countries that would rather leave fertile land uncultivated and dump the surplus farm produce in rivers or leave it to decay in stores and warehouses than offer it to the developing countries which are in desperate need of it and whose only fault is that they cannot purchase agricultural products with hard currency. Removing existing restrictions on agricultural production in certain industrially advanced countries not only will contribute to alleviating inflation in those countries through a reduction in the prices of agricultural products but also will have far-reaching benefits for all the developing countries whose development plans are frequently disrupted and which strain their meager resources to import food products on harsh terms 288.	One cannot place food and energy on an equal footing because the source of food is renewable and non-exhaustible while oil by its very nature is nonrenewable and depletable. Oil is also the only source of income for many developing countries  and yet we are constantly subjected to pressure to expand its production though the consumption of one additional drop of it means depriving our future generations  of a life of freedom and dignity .289.	Kuwait is keenly alive to the difficulties which international economic problems  including the energy problem  have created for the developing countries  Kuwait has always striven to promote development in the developing countries and help them to attain self-sustained growth. There is no need for me to enumerate the details of the aid extended by my country in the past. Suffice it to say that the aid provided by Kuwait  which is itself a developing country  has constituted about 7 to 8 per cent of its gross national product  which exceeds by far the volume of aid provided by the industrially advanced countries at any time and the obligations imposed by the United Nations Second Development Decade on the developed countries.290.	During the sixth special session I had the honor of announcing that the capital of the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development would be increased from $600 million to more than $3 000 million.14 Under its new constituent instrument the Fund will extend economic and technical aid to all developing countries  whereas in its old form its activities were confined to Arab countries. Kuwait has shown preference for extending its aid bilaterally rather than multilaterally because-its long experience has shown that the majority of the developing countries prefer bilateral aid provided that it is not tainted by political considerations and no strings are attached to it  that can be. fully appreciated if one realizes to what extent international organizations are burdened by a bureaucracy which hampers their delivery capacity and exhausts the bulk of their resources.291.	Though the assistance of Kuwait has always been of a long-term character  the recent difficulties of some of the developing countries have induced Kuwait to grant short-term assistance as part of the emergency measures designed to alleviate the lot of the adversely affected developing countries.292.	The salient feature of our age is the scarcity of natural resources and their inadequacy to meet the needs of the population explosion in some countries. the World Population Conference recently held in Bucharest adverted to this problem and recommended dealing with it as part of the economic and social plans of the countries concerned  which should seek to achieve a fair distribution of resources to provide prosperity to all sections of the population. The United Nations should be commended for treating the food problem as an urgent question whose solution requires a concerted effort and collaboration among all countries. Kuwait welcomes the recommendations of the World *Food Conference and will provide the necessary aid in conformity with its previous stand in support of the World Food Program.293.	We attach special importance to the work of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which also seeks to explore new natural resources in the sea-bed and to establish a legal regime regulating the exploitation of these resources  which have already been proclaimed by the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor  and the Subsoil Thereof  beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction [resolution 2749 (XXF)]   in which the General Assembly solemnly declared that the sea-bed and ocean floor  and the subsoil thereof  beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  as well as the resources of the area  are the common heritage of mankind. We hope that exploitation of these resources will help to bridge the gap between the developing and developed countries. The Conference is seeking also to settle the protracted disputes between countries in the area within the limits of national jurisdiction and draft new legal norms more suited to the spirit of our age and the wishes of the developing countries  which constitute the majority of mankind. We sincerely hope that the Conference will succeed  during its next session and in spite of the numerous difficulties it is facing  in reconciling divergent viewpoints and drafting a single convention on the law of the sea which will rectify historical inequities and establish a new legal order.294.	The developments that took place in Cyprus this summer bring to our minds the importance of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  which proclaim the right of States to independence  territorial integrity and respect for their constitutional structure. Kuwait would like to voice its sincere hope that peace and amity may be restored to that island in a manner that would safeguard the right of the communities therein to a life based on equality and justice.	 295.	One must always be mindful of colonialism and apartheid  outmoded remnants of the past that should be discarded in this age. It is a source of great satisfaction to observe the policy of the new regime in Portugal and its efforts to recognize the liberation movements in Territories that were previously under its rule. We also hope that Portugal will  without further delay  recognize the independence of Angola  so as to complete the program of work which it initiated when it recognized the independence of Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique. It is a cause of great regret that the racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia still adheres to its inhuman policy and that the Government of South Africa tenaciously persecutes the indigenous patriots in South Africa and Namibia. We are confident that the cause of justice wiU prevail and that these oppressive Governments will soon realize that oppression and tyranny do not pay dividends any longer and that they must recognize the right of peoples to self-determination and renounce apartheid  which is a crime against humanity.296.	Discussion of colonialism  racial segregation and subjugation leads us once again to discussion of our region  the Middle East  which has been for morethan a quarter of a century a stage upon which those interrelated evils have played their sinister role.297. Last year at this time the attention of the world was drawn with renewed earnestness to the events of our region  These events convinced those who were still unconvinced that security cannot be established in the Middle East -nor  indeed  in the world at large -as long as the evils of dispersion and deprivation  occupation of the territories of others  disregard for international law and for the principles of the Charter  and violation of the rights of man  the rights of peoples and the rights of States continue to exist in that region.298. Although the battlefield is quiet today  it would be a mistake to conclude that the sources of turmoil and the causes for anxiety over the fate of the region and of the international order as a whole have disappeared. For as long as people continue to be displaced and deprived; the original act of usurpation which led to their dispossession and deprivation continues to be perpetrated; and as long as the territories of others continue to be occupied the original aggression which produced such occupation continues. The current state of relative quiet is no more than an external facade. Behind it lies an inadmissible situation  a situation which rests on an evil that has not been remedied and which is certain to generate further turmoil.299.	Ever since the General Assembly came to be seized of what has been referred to as ""the situation in the Middle East"" in the aftermath of the aggression of June 1967  we have emphasized  year after year  that a distinction must be drawn between  the two principal facets of that situation  namely  the question of Palestine and its destiny  as a country and a people; and the conflict between Israel and the Arab States  of which the latest manifestation has been the occupation by Israel of territories of some Arab States.300.	In the statements I have made during the general debate at the successive regular sessions of the General Assembly since 1967 1 have always emphasized that in dealing with the Middle East problem that distinction must be the point of departure; that the tragedy which befell Palestine and its people was the original sin and the underlying problem; and that no solution of any of the resultant  successive  grave problems which have arisen in the region since then can constitute a complete or a lasting solution to the Middle East problem  unless it is accompanied by a corrective and radical solution to the tragedy of the Palestinian people -a solution that restores rights  eliminates deprivation  puts an end to usurpation and dispersion  establishes justice where injustice and oppression now reign  and  through all this  creates the conditions for real peace  the peace that is just and lasting  and conducive to security and prosperity.301.	As I have analyzed the manifold and interrelated aspects of the tragedy of Palestine in the past before the General Assembly  I shall content myself this year with recalling that that tragedy consists of the occupation of Palestine in its entirety and the usurpation of all its resources  the dispossession and displacement of the majority of the Palestinian Arab people and the replacement thereof by alien settlers who have been permitted to exploit the usurped Palestinian resources and to establish on the territoryof Palestine and at the expense of its deprived  displaced people an imported society and an alien regime which has subjugated those Palestinians who have remained in their homeland. In short  the tragedy of Palestine is the tragedy of an occupied and usurped land and of a people which has been deprived  through displacement or subjugation  of the opportunity to enjoy the most sacred and elemental of its human and national rights  and prevented from living a normal life. The tragedy of Palestine is the product of a process of colonial settlement which has been consummated in the age of decolonization. It is the consequence of the establishment of a racist regime precisely during that era in which the awareness of the evil of racism has spread throughout the world  and the conscience of mankind has rejected and condemned all racist regimes.302. My description of the tragedy of Palestine would be neither complete nor fully candid  however  if I did not refer to one of the most painful aspects of that tragedy  namely  that the United Nations and the Assembly in particular bears a considerable portion of the blame for the fate of the Palestinian people and the tragedy of its existence. For  in the final analysis  the situation in which that people has found itself for over a quarter of a century and which constitutes a desecration of sacred principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  is a situation in the creation  aggravation  and perpetuation of which the United Nations itself has played a decisive part whether through actions incompatible with the spirit and letter of the Charter  or through inaction at times when international action was an obligation prescribed by the provisions of the Charter.303.	Thus  the tragedy of Palestine  which has persisted throughout this period a very long period in the life of the present Palestinian generation has been since the beginning one of the facets of the tragedy of the United Nations itself. And the corrective solution of this tragedy has been an obligation of the United Nations  and will continue to be so for as long as the agony and deprivation of the Palestinians last. Time  by itself  neither mitigates the impact of the tragedy upon its victim nor absolves the United Nations of its duty to effect a bold and corrective solution.304.	It is our conviction that the consideration of the question of Palestine as a separate item on the agenda of the General Assembly  independently of other items dealing either with ramifications of that question or with other questions related to it  is more than a procedural matter. It is an act of substantive import that goes to the very essence of the question  for it corrects the previous approach by virtue of which the original question was ignored while some attention was paid to some of its ramifications.305.	It is also our conviction that  in order for the consideration of the question to be responsible and to reflect an earnestness of purpose and clarity of vision  it must be accompanied by inviting the Palestinian people to participate in the discussions through its legitimate representative  which alone can authoritatively explain its viewpoints  voice its aspirations and define its objectives.306.	It will be recalled that the tragedy of Palestine was born in circumstances in which the people of Palestine was prevented from participating in the discussions and decisions which subsequently exercised a decisive impact upon its being and destiny: under those circumstances  the absence imposed upon the people of Palestine was both a symptom and a cause of its tragedy. The pursuit of a corrective solution for that tragedy cannot be truly corrective  nor can it produce useful results  unless it begins by restoring the people of Palestine to its proper place  by ensuring its presence at and participation in the deliberations of the General Assembly as the party which alone possesses the right  to express its own will  its aspirations and objectives.307.	It is accordingly imperative that the PLO which my Government  along with the Governments of the majority of the Member States  recognizes as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Palestine should be invited to participate in the deliberations of the General Assembly on the question of Palestine. Extending this invitation must be the first action to be taken by the General Assembly when it takes up this item on its agenda.308.	It is our hope that the United Nations will begin  in 1974  to correct the mistakes which it began to commit in 1947."
"71",3905,"LAO",29,1974,"It would of course be more appropriate for Prince Souvanna Phouma  our Prime Minister  to head the delegation of Laos to the General Assembly. But Prince Souvanna Phouma has only recently been ill and must still spend some time convalescing. It is therefore my duty to head the delegation of Laos to this session of the General Assembly.45.	It is a great honor and a great pleasure for me to represent at the twenty ninth session of this Assembly the Kingdom of Laos  which  having formed its Provisional Government of National Union and its National Political Coalition Council  has entered a new stage in its history.46.	May I be permitted  on behalf of my country  to associate myself with previous speakers and extend to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  the eminent representative of the glorious People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  a country in the vanguard of the nonaligned countries  our warmest and sincerest congratulations on his unanimous election to the office of President of the current session.47.	I would offer my congratulations also to Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the SecretaryGeneral  on his tireless and persevering efforts and the inexhaustible energy he has devoted to the cause Of peace and international detente.48.	I likewise offer my cordial and respectful greetings to all the representatives present here  to whom also I express my profound gratitude for their feelings of friendship and fraternal sympathy with regard to my country. They have my best wishes for good health and success in their noble undertaking.49.	The political program of the Government  recently adopted by the National Political Coalition Council in conformity with the Vientiane Agreement  clearly reaffirms the policy of the Kingdom of Laos in favor of genuine peace  independence and neutrality. Moreover  as a member of the great family of nonaligned countries  the Provisional Government of National Union of Laos would wish to express from this rostrum  its position with regard to the various international problems  in conformity with the Political Declaration and the resolutions of the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of NonAligned Countries  held in Algiers in September 1973.50.	The year that has just passed has witnessed new and important victories in the struggle of peoples throughout the entire world for peace  national independence  democracy and social progress. In' all continents the peoples are strengthening their solidarity and intensifying their struggle against the policy of enslavement and exploitation carried on by the imperialists  colonialists and neo-colonialists  their struggle to reconquer and safeguard their fundamental national rights  to safeguard their countries' resources and to regain their due status in international relations. Those victories are reflected in this General Assembly itself by the number of its Members  which has grown considerably over the past few years through the admission of countries that have recently reconquered their independence.51.	Thus it is with a feeling of deep emotion and admiration that my Government and the people of Laos salute the entry of three new Members into the Organization—Bangladesh  GuineaBissau and Grenada aware as we are of the enormous efforts and the numerous sacrifices made by the leaders and peoples of those countries before they achieved their sacred goal.52.	These happy results clearly demonstrate the imperative necessity henceforth to view world peace and the independence of peoples as the ultimate purpose of all policy. Our human community is faced with enormous tasks. Certain of them  such as the struggle for national liberation  the fight against hunger  the problems of pollution  overpopulation and the exhaustion of energy resources  are closely linked to posterity  to the freedom of mankind and to survival itself in an already gravely threatened environment.. There is indeed a law that can be stated  and that is that human nature aspires to happiness and freedom  and that whatever system will make it possible for these two fundamental aspirations to succeed will be the one that our human consciousness will recognize as the best. This  I believe  is not the profession of faith of a small Buddhist country; it is also a political philosophy on which we shall have to come to agreement.53.	Also  in view of what I have just stated  the delegation of Laos expresses its disapproval of whatever remains of the colonialist and imperialist spirit throughout the world. We suffer as .we continue to see immense territories still being exploited by a colonialism that concerns itself solely with profits and not with morality and respect for man. We hail the heroic struggle of our brothers to free themselves from slavery to the colonialists and neo-colonialists and to conquer and defend their independence and freedom. This just struggle for national liberation has a. sacred significance for all people conscious of their dignity  and we wholly and wholeheartedly endorse it.54.	In speaking of the practical results of world policy  we likewise salute the initiative taken in convening the sixth special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of discussing problems relating to raw materials and development  as well as the initiative taken for the drafting of a charter of rights governing access to the wealth of the sea ~by all countries  including both those with no coastlines and those that enjoy better geographical situation. The time has come for devising some equitable distribution of those riches. No country should be granted privileges on the pretext that the great Powers have at their disposal facilities denied to other countries. Many nations are at present attempting to find an acceptable and just modus vivendi capable of remedying many aspects of the economic backwardness of the third world  including the problem of hunger that exists in certain vast areas an intolerable problem  when we see millions of human beings lacking the very minimum for their subsistence. We are gratified that from this lofty rostrum their cries of suffering are being heard  and that compassion has been aroused and that people are working to assist their neighbors in distress..55. Since  in the last analysis  it is always a question of the struggle of peoples for their emancipation  we are bound to speak of the war in IndoChina and the directions it has taken. In that part of the world  the peoples have suffered and continue to suffer from an unending slaughter  the sole cause of which is the aggressive policy of the imperialist forces. Thus it is that in Cambodia battles are still raging  imperiling millions of lives and causing damage to artistic treasures of inestimable value.56. Thus also in Viet Nam  despite the signing of the Paris Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam some 20 months ago  the fighting has not stopped. It is obvious that the peoples of the IndoChinese countries are closely bound by ties that have existed for centuries ties woven by history  politics and sentiments. The peace and independence of the three IndoChinese countries are closely bound up together. As one of the signatories of the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the countries of IndoChina and the 1962 Geneva Agreement on Laos  the Provisional Government of National Union of Laos believes that the peoples of Laos  Cambodia and Viet Nam must reinforce their solidarity and mutual support in their struggle against imperialist aggression and interference with a view to the full realization of the fundamental national rights of each people. It is precisely for this very reason that strict compliance with the Vientiane Agreement on Laos and similar compliance with the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam are closely linked  as they are linked with the struggle for the peace and independence of our brothers the Khmer people.57.	The Provisional Government of National Union of Laos respects the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam and firmly supports the struggle of the Vietnamese people for strict compliance with that Agreement  which implies the reaffirmation of the fundamental national rights of the Vietnamese people  the cessation of military action and imperialist interference and the solution of the political problem of South Viet Nam through reconciliation and national concord between the two Governments of South Viet Nam in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of the people of that country.58.	The Provisional Government of National Union of Laos firmly supports the struggle of the Khmer people against the policy of aggression and imperialist intervention and for an independent  peaceful  neutral  sovereign  democratic and prosperous Cambodia  secure in its territorial integrity.59.	Lastly  I would venture to speak to you of the problems of the Kingdom of Laos  being convinced that this Assembly will understand the reasons we have for presenting them to you again reasons stemming solely from our search for peace and national concord.60.	As you are aware  the people of Laos has waged a long and victorious patriotic struggle against imperialism. Thanks to the firm will for independence and peace on the part of the whole Laotian people  and to the immense patience and self-denial of Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince Soupha nouvong  the Vientiane Agreement and its Protocol were signed  asserting once again the fundamental national rights and the neutrality of Laos  reestablishing peace throughout the entire Kingdom  and bringing about national concord step by step. After 20 years of fierce fighting  this result is considerable and has been warmly applauded by the Laotian people and perhaps also by all peoples friendly to Laos. Little by little  a great tranquility has settled upon that peaceful Kingdom the great tranquility of the countryside  once peaceful and prosperous. And now our 700 000 refugees  who had been obliged to leave their villages during the war  are encouraged in their hopes to return in the near future.61.	The two parties in Laos  with the approval of the whole Laotian people  have agreed to participate in the new Government which was formed after the Agreement of 21 February 1973 and the Protocol of 14 September 1973. This new Provisional Government of National Union views its principal tasks as the implementation of the Vientiane Agreement and the completion of the process of national reconciliation so that the Laotian people  shortly after the Kingdom wide general elections  will have a new  functioning Government* freely elected by the people  within a constitutional framework of the kind we wish for a peaceful  independent  sovereign  democratic  neutral and unified Laos  which we shall endeavor to make prosperous through our own efforts and with the intensive and unqualified assistance of friendly countries.62.	The Provisional Government of National Union of Laos  faithfully following its policy of peace and neutrality in conformity with the Vientiane Agreement and its Protocol  is concentrating  and will continue to concentrate  all its efforts on consolidating peace and strengthening national independence  preserving the Provisional Government of National Union and the National Political Coalition Council and strengthening national concord  internationally  the Provisional Government of National Union is pursuing a policy of peace  independence and neutrality. It advocates ties of friendship with all countries  especially with its neighbors  on the basis of respect for the five principles of peaceful coexistence. Laos will make its positive contribution to the common cause of the nonaligned countries  and is actively supporting the struggle of the peoples of Asia  Africa and Latin America against colonialism and neocolonialism and for peace  national independence  democracy and social progress. While relying upon its own resources for the national reconstruction  it will seek unconditional assistance from all countries that  whatever their political regime  may wish to help Laos bind up the wounds of war and rebuild a country devastated by a long  destructive war.63.	The total withdrawal of all troops and all foreign military personnel from the territory of Laos and from all the neighboring countries will help to strengthen peace in Laos and reinforce the ties of friendship among the peoples of that part of the world. The struggle of the Laotian people against all attempts to sabotage peace and in favor of the proper implementation of the Vientiane Agreement is a long and arduous one; but because it is a just struggle  the Laotian people will be able to* overcome all difficulties and obstacles and will surely achieve final victory.64.	The people of Laos  redoubling its vigilance and strengthening its national union  is determined to fight resolutely for the full and strict application of the Vientiane Agreement  the maintenance of peace  the consolidation of independence and the complete achievement of national concord. It is resolved not to permit a repetition of the unfortunate circumstances of previous coalitions and to safeguard its fundamental national rights.65.	We are firmly convinced that countries and peoples represented in this Assembly that desire peace  freedom and justice will continue to support us in our struggle for the proper implementation of the Vientiane Agreement and to give us all the effective aid necessary for our national construction.66.	I shall conclude my statement by offering my sincere thanks to the friendly countries which have been good enough to give us their disinterested assistance  as well as to those who will be willing to provide their help in the future for the healing of the wounds of war and the reconstruction of our country  thus bringing about a substantial improvement in the living standards of our people and ensuring real and lasting peace and national concord in Laos.67.	May this year see peace and national concord in Laos strengthened  new victories won by the peoples fighting for peace and national independence and  finally  world peace safeguarded That is the ardent wish of the people of Laos."
"72",3952,"LBN",29,1974,"Mr. President  I am particularly pleased to express to you my warmest congratulations upon your election to the eminent functions of President of the twenty-ninth session of -the General Assembly. May I be permitted to recall on this occasion the fraternal ties which bind Lebanon and Algeria and which have marked with their imprint our common struggle for the defense of our national causes as well as the concerted action we are conducting so that their international relations be founded upon the principles of equality  law and justice. The expression of unanimous confidence which has brought you to the office of President is a new tribute paid to your exceptional qualities  to your dynamism and to your efficacy.164.	I should likewise wish to express my fullest esteem to your predecessor  Mr. Benites  who presided with so much competence and so much skill over the last regular session of the General Assembly as well as the sixth special session. This is particularly pleasant for me as Mr. Benites belongs to a country and a region of the world with which Lebanon maintains ties of traditional close friendship.165.	I should like also to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the steady efforts he has been making for the benefit of world peace and the strengthening of international cooperation.166.	If we pass in review the developments which have taken place since the last session  we shall find some grounds for optimism: the continuation of a dialog between the United States and the Soviet Union  as well as the meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  are likely to increase the chances of detente internationally. The separation of the forces between Israel on the one hand and Egypt and Syria on the other hand constitutes a first step towards the search for a just and global solution of the Middle East problem. The stability which is gradually settling upon South Asia is putting an end to a conflict which had exploded between countries to which the best possible relations bind us. The positive developments in Africa and the adoption by Portugal of a new liberal policy toward its. colonies and the outside world herald the arrival of a new era which  we hope  will put an end to a long and dark period of colonialism and exploitation. The entry of the three new- States into our Organization  namely  Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada  which we welcome most warmly  expands the basis of the United Nations and strengthens our hope that it will soon be able to reach universal representation.167.	And yet  certain problems remain in the agenda where they have been since 1946  without having led to a positive and concrete solution. By way of example we might mention first the questions relating to disarmament. How often have we not issued warnings against the unfavorable consequences of the arms race  the massive stockpiling of weapons and the perfecting of weapons of mass destruction. While the United Nations has succeeded in elaborating a certain number of international conventions designed to prohibit tests  the proliferation and the stockpiling of weapons  we are bound to recognize  however  that the distance to be traveled in order to achieve the ultimate purpose is still long and difficult. The common efforts that have been combined in this respect need to be intensified  and they require the support of all Member States and especially that of the permanent members of the Security Council. Within the context of the international action that has been taken in this respect  we hope that an agreement will soon be concluded on the prohibition of chemical weapons and on the prohibition of all nuclear weapons  pending a time where the disarmament problem will be debated as a whole within the framework of the forthcoming world conference on this subject. We also hope that an agreement will be reached on the denuclearization of the Middle East region.	168.	I do not intend to draw up a detailed inventory of the events which give us cause for disappointment and fear. I shall limit myself to mentioning a few examples from that list; first of all  the situation in southern Africa where the policy of apartheid still prevails  a policy which continues to violate the most elementary moral and human laws and which defies the universal conscience and the repeated condemnations of the United Nations.169.	The present situation in Cyprus  where tragic events have again occurred in spite of the efforts made by the United Nations through the Secretary- General and the international emergency force  gives ground for the most serious concern. We strongly hope that the efforts now undertaken will make it possible to restore peace and stability in Cyprus and to provide guarantees for its independence  unity and integrity.170.	The problem of the Middle East continues to be a source of anguish and concern  and constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The pressent session of the General Assembly is called upon today to get to the substance of the Palestine problem for the purpose of achieving a guarantee for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Any search for a just* and lasting solution must be based upon certain fundamental truths which cannot be ignored and which are as follows.171.	First  Israel has expelled by force the Palestinian people from its fatherland and has obliged it to become dispersed in several countries.172.	Secondly  the cause of the four wars which have taken place in the region since 1948 was Palestine. The tension which persists in the Middle East derives from the disregard of the rights of the Palestinian people and the hesitancy of the international community expressly to recognize those rights and to permit the Palestinian people to exercise them effectively  in spite of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.173.	Thirdly  any settlement of the conflict of the Middle East which does not respect the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and does not provide for the realization of its national aspirations cannot  under any circumstances  lead to a lasting peace in the region.174.	Lebanon has expressed its position on this subject on numerous occasions  in particular following the adoption of resolution 338 (1973) fey the Security Council. I reaffirm here once again that the problem of the Palestinian people is not only a humanitarian problem  but one that constitutes first and foremost a political problem. To hesitate to recognize this fact  to resort to a policy of procrastination or maneuvering in order not to face up to this reality  is to precipitate unavoidable new developments which will in no circumstances serve the cause of peace.175.	Israel ignores these truths. It continues to violate and defy the condemnations and the resolutions coming from the international community. In recent  months the Palestinian people have been the victim of a new form of a war of extermination. The Israeli forces attack Palestinian camps; they destroy their shelters  kill men  women and children in pursuit of their premeditated policy designed to sow terror and disperse the population. In the past Israel used as a pretext the acts of the fedayeen. Today it does not even trouble to invoke those fallacious pretexts. It undertakes so-called preventive action for the sole purpose of expanding the conflict and aggravating it. It is thus that the forces of Israel are constantly pursuing their aggressions against the territory of Lebanon and its air space  inflicting heavy human and material losses  particularly in the southern portion of the country  thereby violating the principles of the Charter and of international law  as well as the terms of armistice agreed upon between Lebanon and Israel in 1949  the implementation of which is supervised by the United Nations.176.	Thus it appears  to our great regret  that the resolutions adopted by the Security Council over the past few years and which contain  vis-a-vis Israel  repeated condemnations and censures  have not gone beyond a purely formal stager in their effect  thus promoting the acceptance of the logic of force and the rule of the law of the jungle  where order and respect for law should have been established.177.	Faced with this deplorable situation  we wonder about the role of the United Nations and the usefulness of the guarantees provided by the Charter for Member States  and in particular for the small countries which view the Organization as something that should be both a shield and a bulwark behind which their independence and security should be protected.178.	The Charter expressly enumerates the means of having international authority respected and of giving effect to the recommendations and resolutions adopted by the Organization. Has the time not come to apply the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter? In compliance with the decisions adopted by the last conference of the Heads of Arab States as well as by the fifth Islamic congress  Lebanon considers that the Security Council should apply against Israel the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII so that an end might  be put to its repeated aggressions against the people and territory of Lebanon. We are calling for this action out of our attachment to the United Nations and because we wish the Organization to be strong. We are unwilling to admit its inefficacy. We wish it to remain and to be able to realize its essential goals and to fulfill its responsibilities.179.	Meanwhile Lebanon considers that no solution can be provided to the problem of the Middle East without the total withdrawal from the Arab territories of the Israeli forces that have been occupying them since June 1967 and without the recognition of the national and political rights of the Palestinian people.180.	Since the end of the Second World War  the international community has not gone through any economic crisis anywhere nearly as acute as the one through which we are now living and which can have devastating consequences for the whole of mankind. On the other hand  however  during the same period appeals for harmony and co-operation have never been as frequent and as urgent.181.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly  which was held last April thanks to the initiative and work of President Boumedienc  placed particular emphasis upon the problems of development as well as upon international economic co-operation  which has been made necessary as a result of the profound transformations that have taken place in modern international relations.182.	The economic and monetary problems which arise today have not been brought about by the October war and they have not been brought about by the restrictions applied to petroleum production or by the increase in its price. These problems are chronic and long-standing; they antedate the October war; they have been arising in the world for a number of years. The petroleum prices have merely revealed the scope and gravity of these problems.183.	The Arab States are facing urgent problems in the field of economic and social development. They are attempting to solve them in the best possible way so as to provide a better life for their peoples and to reduce the gap which separates them from the developed peoples. In spite of these historic responsibilities  those countries nevertheless remain responsive to the appeals addressed to them and are examining in a spirit of co-operation and understanding the world economic situation as well as the interests of the developing countries. These preoccupations have been expressed in decisions and actions.184.	We are convinced that the present economic imbalance and the deterioration in currencies have been made possible by the international economic order which prevails at present and which  because it no longer meets the requirements of our time  should be revised in its very essence.185.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly adopted resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)  which are of considerable importance and clearly reflect current economic problems and preoccupations and define the bases upon which the new economic order should be founded.186.	It is true that the action necessary for the establishment of this order has hardly begun  but it is encouraging to observe that consultations and negotiations to achieve greater justice and equality in international exchanges have been extremely active during the past year. By way of example I might mention the negotiations concerning the reform of the international monetary system  the efforts made with a view to reconsidering GATT and the new orientation which has taken place in the World Bank for the purpose of increasing the resources devoted to development and intensifying multilateral technical assistance.187.	I wish to emphasize also the importance of the Euro-Arab dialog  and I should like to affirm  on behalf of my Government as well as on behalf of all the other Arab Governments  because of the fact that Lebanon is serving as President of the present session of the League of Arab States  our determination to make this dialog constructive and useful for all the parties concerned and beneficial to all their mutual interests.188.	We also hope that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea will lead to the preparation of a new international act regulating maritime relations between States and providing the most appropriate means for the exploitation of the resources of the sea in the interests of mankind as a whole. We hope  too  that the World Food Conference and the World Population Conference will make it possible to draw up a plan of action that will make a positive contribution to the work of the seventh special session of the General Assembly  for which provision was made at the previous session [resolution 3172 (XXVIII)].189.	In this connexion I should like to emphasize that the Lebanese Government is gratified that the working group responsible for the preparation of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States put this draft into its final form at meetings held this year in Geneva and in Mexico. In expressing the hope that the General Assembly will adopt the draft at its present session  I should like to take this opportunity of paying a tribute to Mr. Echeverria  the President of Mexico  to whom belongs the credit for having taken this initiative during the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.190.	The Economic Commission for Western Asia  the establishment of which was decided upon by theEconomic ar.d Social Council at its 55th session Resolution 1818 (LV)] on the basis of a draft presented by the Lebanese delegation  held two sessions in Beirut in June and September of this year.191.	Through the establishment of this Commission the Middle East region has recovered the natural rights of which it had been deprived during the past two decades. These meetings gave an opportunity to the countries concerned to affirm their international role and express their desire to contribute to the activities of the United Nations in the fields of development and regional co-operation. The Lebanese Government  which has established the closest ties with the United Nations Economic and Social Office in Beirut during the past 10 years  wishes to express its profound satisfaction at the establishment of this Commission. We are convinced that the activities undertaken by it will redound to the benefit of the countries of the region and contribute to the attainment of the objectives of the United Nations.192.	The United Nations was born of the suffering of previous generations and the aspirations of new generations for peace and justice. In spite of all the difficulties and the disappointment that may sometimes be felt when taking stock of the achievements of the United Nations  we continue to support this Organization  its objectives and its basic principles. Lebanon  for its part and to the best of its ability  will steadfastly continue to make its contribution to the efforts of the international community to achieve its aims and keep to its course."
"73",3995,"LBR",29,1974,"I am particularly pleased at this time to extend to you  Mr. President  on behalf of the Government of Liberia  heartiest congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. You have for many years demonstrated astute statesmanship and unwavering dedication not only to the cause of international peace and global understanding but also to our common world Organization  the United Nations  in your capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. Please accept our very best wishes and be assured of our fullest co-operation as you discharge the grave and historic responsibility of guiding the important work of this twenty-ninth session.33.	I should like also to express our most genuine appreciation to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador  who presided with calm and wisdom over the work both of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly and of the historic sixth special session.34.	Significantly  a little more than one year ago  on 24 September 1973  the courageous people of Guinea-Bissau declared the independence and sovereignty of their country  having liberated the greater part of their national territory. Today they have won the battle which  against great odds  they had fought to consolidate their independence and to free every inch of their land from the grasp of an oppressive colonialism. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau has now been accented- as a State Member of the United Na-tions. Liberia once again whole-heartedly welcomes this sister African State into this world forum and celebrates with it the hard-won freedom of its people to enjoy self-determination and national independence after so many years of difficult and self-sacrificing struggle.35.	More than 127 years ago  on 26 July 1847  the people of the Republic of Liberia declared their national independence. Since that time  moved by the most remarkable determination  they have preserved the independence of Liberia despite numerous threats and acts of aggression by foreign Powers  to which an independent African State was completely unacceptable. They endured that  as well as the taunts  insults and falsehoods  all deliberately designed to discredit Liberia in an attempt to prove that Africans were incapable of self-government. Because of that historical experience  Liberia attaches the greatest importance to the struggle against colonialism and minority rule anywhere  but most particularly on the African continent. It was the Liberian Government  through its representative on the Security Council  which  on 15 February 1961  first brought to the at-tention of the Organization the deplorable situation in the Portuguese Territories.2 We are therefore particularly gratified that  the Republic of Guinea- Bissau having entered our midst as a Member of the United Nations  we can anticipate with pleasure both the independence of Mozambique and its entry into the Organization within the next year.36.	We feel certain that the Portuguese Government  consistent with the progressive attitude and good faith it has already demonstrated  will continue with even greater intensity its efforts designed to arrive at an acceptable arrangement with the African nationalists in Angola so that that Territory may  within the shortest possible time  enjoy the right of self-determination  independence and sovereignty.37.	The decision taken by the Government of Portugal to bring to a close many centuries of Portuguese colonial domination in Africa represents primarily a victory for those valiant freedom fighters who  in Guinea-Bissau  in Mozambique and in Angola  have never wavered in their determination to attain national independence and forge their own national destinies. It represents also a victory for the people of Portugal themselves  for it frees them from the burden of waging what the Foreign Minister of Portugal has referred to as ""a long  useless war"" [2239th meeting  para. 102]  so costly in precious human lives. It has also gained for Portugal a respected place in the world community.38.	That frame of mind which welcomed and sup-ported the most blatant exploitation of one people by another  which created colonialism and continues to feed apartheid and other systems based on racial prejudice  must give way entirely to the demands of a new age. The peoples of Africa still subjected to such exploitation and discriminatory treatment are determined to be free  to enjoy human dignity and to take their rightful place in the life of their respective countries and of our world. That will cannot be de-feated. We have embarked upon a path from which there can be no turning back. Apartheid and alien minority rule  whether in Zimbabwe  Namibia or South Africa itself  cannot long survive. The torch of freedom has reached the very doorsteps of the most evil of the oppressors. Doubts and insecurity are bound to affect their national life and  in desperation  they can be expected to engage in ever more oppressive measures and to employ greater violence. But all that  in the end  cannot change the inevitable: the majority of the people of those countries will play their full role in political  economic and social affairs and come to enjoy all their rights as citizens. Whatever excuses are advanced  whatever subterfuges cm- ployed  the stark reality is that the South African Government and the illegal Ian Smith regime are maintaining and expanding systems designed to enhance the well-being and ensure the special privileges of a minority  while denying the African majority their basic  elementary and inalienable rights as human beings.39.	There is an alternative route they could pursue: they could do what is right and just. They could turn with all sincerity to the obliteration of racism and to the establishment of equitable multiracial nations in which the rights of each individual are secured  cultural differences are respected  and special privileges are eliminated. They would thereby ensure  we believe  the peace and harmony of all the people of those countries. They would also contribute to the spirit of reconciliation  co-operation and common purpose which is beginning to take hold among the nations of the world. Otherwise  it may be that the only answer will lie in a greater resort to armed struggle by the African peoples of South Africa  Namibia and Zimbabwe.40.	Such a development would be extremely regrettable to my Government because of the incalculable cost in human lives which would result and because of the greater threat such a situation would present to international peace and security. But the peoples of those areas may decide that they are left with no other choice. And in that event  those nations which through their trade and investment activities directly or indirectly strengthen the hands of the South African Government and of the Smith regime and stiffen their resolve will then have to bear their full share of the responsibility.41.	We witnessed yesterday [2248th meeting] the action taken by an overwhelming number of States Members of the Organization rejecting the credentials of the delegation of the minority racist South African regime and adopting by an almost unanimous vote a resolution calling upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa [resolution 3207 (XXIX)]. There has never been a greater show of solidarity by the inter-national community against South Africa's arrogant disregard for every requirement of morality  decency and justice  and for the principles of the Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and the many resolutions adopted by this world body.42.	Liberia believes that because South Africa has been intransigent in pursuing its evil  racist and repressive policies  and impervious to the numerous condemnations of those policies by the international community  it is South Africa which has now raised the most serious doubts as to its right to continued membership in the United Nations.43.	The struggle for national independence has in recent decades achieved remarkable progress  although  regrettably  it has not been entirely successful. Nevertheless  there is now nearly universal acceptance of the principle that every people has an inalienable right to political freedom  national self- determination and independence. And yet  the experience of recent years has shown that these rights cannot be entirely meaningful unless all peoples come to enjoy the freedoms which economic progress makes possible: the freedom from want  from hunger  from endemic disease  from ignorance and from poverty. Many representatives have already addressed themselves to this problem from this rostrum.44.	At the sixth special session of the General Assembly on raw materials and development held in April  to which the President of Liberia attached such great importance that he attended it himself  these issues were discussed in great depth. President Tolbert said:""If this special session is destined to achieve the same quality of response as has been forthcoming from all the foregoing meetings and 'paper' declarations  then I doubt that our coming here will have been worth the effort. But if this Assembly would in a concrete manner address itself to the pressing issues of organized global development today  then  as participating countries  we must all stand determined to elevate and to reshape that process which is necessary to translate into evident reality the collective will to accommodate.""45.	Vet effective follow-up measures have not ensued  and many industrialized nations have indicated their dissatisfaction with various aspects of both the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-Vl) and the related Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)]. The historic dialog which we began at that time must continue with greater vigor and be guided by a clarity of perception as to the ultimate goals we seek to achieve. Efforts must be undertaken to bring to reality the great objectives we expressed at that time. While emergency assistance is required on a priority basis for those developing nations most adversely affected by the existing economic crisis  in the longer run fundamental changes in the structure of the existing trade  monetary and investment sys-tems must be made. New insight and study of means of reconciling in a just way the interests of developing and developed countries  consumers and producers  and rich and poor nations must be found. Mutually acceptable formulas to facilitate and expand greatly the inflow of capital and technological expertise to developing countries must be devised.46.	In our common endeavor to ensure a better life for the entire family of man  it has become necessary that we look beyond narrow and short-term national interests. Ultimately  the progress and well-being of any one nation will depend on the ability of all nations to prosper. A world which continues to be so clearly divided between the wealthy arid the poverty- stricken cannot for long remain a peaceful world. What We need at this time is a joint and firm commitment to address ourselves to the problems which face the world today and which loom ahead for the future. To avoid disaster  we must avoid meaningless rhetoric and sterile exchanges designed to apportion blame  to castigate  or to justify. Liberia is concerned  rather  with the formulation of guidelines and plans by which the quality of life in our world can be improved. Liberia desires to see mere words replaced with action  and meaningless expressions of concern with carefully considered proposals. Most. of all  there must be a determination to embark upon the new course which the times require and to engage in the construction of a more equitable world order before it becomes too late.47.	During the sixth special session  the President of Liberia also uttered these words:""Living in an interdependent world  it is important to distinguish between self-interest and selfish interest. Selfish interest contains the possibility of exacting retribution for past injustices  and of seeking equalization for past exploitation. It seeks to promote the betterment of a part  while remaining oblivious to the well-being of the whole. Similarly  nationalism can be a force for good in our one world if its vision remains clearly focused on the commonality of our interests; if its oy^r-all target"" are outlined in a compromising synthesis of concepts; if its efforts are exerted in a pooling of resources in a genuine pursuit of peace and freedom  security and justice.""Are we continuously aware of this overriding com-monality of interest? Can we now engage in a com-promising synthesis of concepts? Will we ever pool our resources for the common good?48.	For perhaps the first time in history  national problems are  in most instances  world problems. The most fundamental difficulties faced by nations today can no longer be solved in isolation. Global efforts are necessary. Economic growth and development  the growth of the world's population  our concern for irreparable damage to the environment  the availability and price of raw materials  the expansion to all peoples of the benefits of technology  the dilemma of ever-spiraling inflation and the urgent need to assure an adequate supply of energy resources and of food are all problems to which we must collectively find solutions. More than that  they are all interrelated. Yet it is distressing that  despite ever-greater awareness of the interdependence of the nations of our world and the need for implementing a common plan of action to resolve these difficult problems  so very little has been achieved.49.	Many developing countries remain locked into a world system which keeps them as  essentially  producers of raw materials in a world market system of generally declining prices over which they have no control. Increased prices both of energy supplies and of other necessary imports required for development  and  in some cases  for mere survival  remain unabated. If some nations are able  to a greater or lesser degree  to offset higher costs for certain imports with higher returns on exports and  in some instances  with expanded domestic production  most developing countries are not in a position to do either. All of the evils inherent in shortages and price increases are absorbed by the developing countries. We are bound on a path to economic disaster unless meaningful  effective and urgent action can be undertaken on a sufficiently massive scale.50.	In recent times  despite the nearly universal commitment to co-operation rather than confrontation  despite the frequent exhortations against producers associations from certain quarters  despite the call for a rational system of distributing goods and services consonant with the expanded requirements of the peoples of the world and the availability of these items  we have yet to see any tangible example of an international will for real action rather than platitudes  declarations and resolutions.51.	Is it naive to expect wealthy and powerful nations to do much more than they have done which  in some instances  has been meaningful even if grossly insufficient? We are therefore greatly pleased by the statement made by President Gerald R. Ford of the United States  while addressing this Assembly [2234th meeting]  that his Government will increase rather than reduce the amount it spends on food and agricultural assistance to other countries. We also welcome the spirit of co-operation with which he called upon all nations to respond to challenges con-fronting the international community. It is indeed gratifying that this theme has been echoed again and again in these halls by many representatives. We are thus aware of how we need to proceed; what we must now show is the requisite courage and the will for positive action. And it is the responsibility of those nations possessing the capability to do so to take the proper initiative.52.	The other related concern which permeates our debate is that of peace in our world lasting  genuine and just peace  without which nothing could be accomplished and the very existence of mankind would be exposed to the most serious peril. We have there-fore all welcomed with increasing relief the spirit of accommodation and detente which exists between the major world Powers. No cause  no perception of national interest  no differences in ideological beliefs should be allowed to disturb this process. Rather  in an age of nuclear weapons  the need for peace and co-operation is overriding. It is our hope that recent developments will lead to a reduction of armaments and  ultimately  to complete disarmament. We believe that the security which is to be obtained from armed forces alone  or from an emphasis on military or ideological blocs  is more and more illusory. Indeed  the continued expansion in numbers and deployment of such weapons endangers peace and threatens security. Moreover  the tremendous cost of implements of war could be turned to such peaceful purposes as technological research and development assistance. This is why Liberia supported the Soviet proposal last year for a 10 per cent reduction in the defense budgets of major Powers  with some savings therefrom to be applied to the development needs of third-world countries.5 It is also for these reasons  and because of the evident  perilous threat to the environment such weapons would entail  and the further danger to mankind they would represent  that Liberia supports the proposal put forward this year by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union  Mr. Andrei Gromyko  entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human well-being and health"" [AI9702 and Corr.l].53.	Liberia will always uphold the sovereign right of every nation to a secure existence and decry the use of aggressive force against any nation  or any interference in its domestic affairs by any other nation. As an African nation  we support  foremost  greater co-operation and unity on our continent. We believe that through discussions problems can be resolved and the energies of all African nations can be harnessed for the common benefit of the peoples of Africa and of the world. We shall therefore continue to attach the greatest importance to the Organization of AfricanUnity [OAV]  and to all efforts aimed at promoting bilateral  regional and continental economic co-operation and co-ordination among African States.54.	At the same time  Liberia believes in the underlying principles of non-alignment and will continue to play an active role in the furtherance of the objectives of the movement of the non-aligned nations.55.	Liberia reaffirms its dedication to  and support for  the lofty ideals and high purposes prescribed in the Charter of the United Nations  However  Liberia feels that certain provisions of the Charter should be reviewed in the light of present-day realities.56.	Despite the generally favorable trend of events in international politics and the greater consolidation of detente among the major Powers  it is most regrettable that the peace  security and internal stability of smaller States may still be disturbed by more powerful States. Detente and the climate of accommodation  to be truly meaningful  must apply to relations among all States  be they large or small. The case of Cyprus  which a few minutes ago was so eloquently stated from this rostrum by His Beatitude Archbishop Makarios  President of the Republic of Cyprus  illustrates an unfortunate example of the imperfections in the international system. I would echo the words of Secretary of State Kissinger of the United States:. . tolerance of local conflict tempts world holocaust"" [2238th meeting  para. 46]  But that is one aspect of the problem. The other is that  regardless of whether or not any particular conflict remains localized  the people of that area are exposed to the horrors  the tragedy and the devastation of war. Moreover  the sacred principles of peaceful resolution of disputes and of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States are thereby trampled upon. These are firm and immutable principles absolutely necessary to an ordered and just world society. All nations must observe and respect them  or no nation will find security. I therefore hope that the people of Cyprus will be allowed the opportunity to resolve their difficulties peacefully and without undesired interference.57.	The cease-fire and disengagement agreements in the Middle East constitute an extremely hopeful beginning. I pay tribute to the Secretary of State of the United States  Mr. Henry Kissinger  for his tire-less and highly effective diplomatic initiatives. The role of the United Nations  and  in particular  that taken by the Secretary-General  who consistently demonstrates his total devotion and dedication to the cause of peace and the ideals of the Organization  merit our highest commendation. Yet dangers still persist. Portions of Arab territories are still held by Israeli forces. But we fervently believe that a just and durable peace can be obtained through patience  determination and good faith. Such a peace can only be guaranteed by complete Israeli withdrawal from illegally occupied Arab territories and by a firm commitment by all concerned to respect the legitimate rights of all nations in that region to a secure national existence within well-defined and acceptable frontiers. But genuine peace will not be possible if the aspirations of the Palestinian people and recognition of their legitimate rights are not taken into full account. We also believe that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East should be resumed as early as possible  and that the Palestinians should be accorded representation. But those are complex issues which should be carefully considered and discussed in this forum  for the fate of the Middle East surely is of the greatest importance to the peace and security of our world.58.	The hopes that the resources of the sea-bed and ocean floor will in reality become a common heritage for mankind  and that a fair and just determination will be made of national rights as regards territorial waters and exclusive economic zones  found expression in the important Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Caracas last summer. Despite its less-than-successful results  these hopes will be disappointingly unfulfilled if  in Geneva next March  compromise and conciliation do not prevail. We would then have lost a golden opportunity to set the world on a course of justice and peace in a very vital area.59.	We have reached the cross-roads. The path which we must follow  if a future of peace and plenty  brotherhood and understanding is to be assured  is clear. We are challenged at this momentous time to translate the ideals long expressed by so many of us into concrete reality. Should we fail to do so  it is evident that this good earth which we all share will be engulfed by unmanageable difficulties. In such circumstances  peace among nations will at best be meaningless and  at worst  virtually impossible to obtain  as each nation scrambles to assure its own survival. Our sacred task as members of the family of man and as representatives of a community of nations existing in the world must be  through co-operation  with a sense of common purpose and an acute awareness of the fragility of human existence  to undertake the construction of a rational and just world order in which all peoples can enjoy a life in larger freedom void of the ravages of disease  of violence and war  of hunger  of numbing oppression  of hatred and prejudices  of extreme poverty and of want.60.	I believe that we of this world community are capable of achieving these goals. Let us therefore recognize the interdependence of our world  carefully observe the pitfalls which lie before us  and with conviction foresight  strength and courage totally involve ourselves at this session and in the years to come to the noble and arduous task of creating a ""new progressive age"" for all mankind  and for all times."
"74",4041,"LBY",29,1974,"It is fitting first of all to note that the current session of the General Assembly re-presents a turning-point in the history of the Organization. The events which coincided with the session and the conditions under which it is being held reveal a major change in the movement of world history. Concepts have changed; some of the characteristic traits of the old world have collapsed. New signs have appeared that  if taken seriously  might indicate a new course for man in international life.101.	May I be permitted to congratulate the General Assembly on electing Mr. Bouteflika as President of the current session. The Algerian struggle represents a historic attainment for Africa and the peoples of the world in general. When Mr. Bouteflika  in the name of Algeria and Africa  assumed leadership of the General Assembly at its current session  we took it as recognition of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the freedom of their country and the dignity of man.102.	Only one year after the last session  the President declared the admission of a struggling people to the United Nations  a people that  until a few months earlier  was labeled a band of terrorists. Does not the President agree with me that a new concept has arisen and that the voices that have been trying to prevent the freedom fighters from reaching this forum must inevitably be silenced for ever? The admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations and the election of its representative as Rapporteur of the Fourth Committee at this very session reaffirm the facts I have mentioned. Now  let us devote this session to re-deeming those who are still under the yoke of colonialism  apartheid  racial discrimination and foreign domination.103.	Another significant characteristic of the last session was the presidency of Mr. Leopoldo Benites. His appreciation of the heritage of man  his deep comprehension of world history and his far-sightedness inspired us to appreciate the turn of events we witness today. We recognize with appreciation  inter alia  his contribution to the adoption of the Arabic language as an official and working language of the United Nations  a language imbued with a rich cultural heritage and human values  and I should like to emphasize here that his frequent praise of this language was an important factor in introducing it. It would not have been easy for anyone else to have assumed such leadership during recent developments. We note with appreciation the positive developments in the relationships between the old world  whose civilization has paved the way for the discovery of the new world  and that part of the new world from which Mr. Benites comes  and where emigrants to Latin America  while preserving their heritage  worked out a blend of the old and the new.104.	Those were two positive aspects. However  we cannot escape the fact that a negative aspect has ac-companied and will accompany this new course. When his country called for a special session of the General Assembly  Mr. Bouteflika noticed  as did Mr. Benites while presiding over that session  that there were those who sought to impede the reconsideration of international relations in such a manner as to assert the rights of the majority. The dominant Powers of the old system tried to put the blame on the third world by fabricating imaginary crises  by sowing the seeds of disagreement among the countries of the third world  by threatening to ban shipments of food and clothing  by promoting wars  espionage  subversion and coups d'etat  and by taking advantage of certain rights given them during the period of their might and dominance  thus obstructing the adoption of resolutions.105.	The sixth special session provided a precious opportunity to test the extent of the dominant Powers' readiness to adjust to the new order. Members may have noticed their disregard for the demands of the third-world countries and their attempts to obstruct any understanding on a new international economic system. When they realized that they could not prevent the adoption of such a system  they all registered their reservations. Could such an attitude be a prelude towards mutual understanding and international interdependence?106.	This Assembly  presided over by Mr. Bouteflika  and with the participation of the progressive forces of the world  cannot be used as a rostrum to invite us to dissension and threats. Discordant voices have tried to exploit this rostrum to prevent our session from considering the genuine problems facing us. There have been many arbitrary stands  but those who use threats must accept the responsibility for their attitude. It is high time that we unveiled the motives behind those voices.107.	We are happy today at the admission of Guinea-Bissau; yet we are not going to forget that the imperialist Powers have never lent a hand in support of the struggle of its people and have attacked the liberation movements by providing assistance to the former Government of Lisbon. We cannot be expected to forgive that shameful attitude simply because they did not oppose the admission of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations. We must not forget the shameful attitude of the imperialist Powers in ignoring the African liberation movement. Through assistance rendered to the former despotic regime in Lisbon  they stabbed it in the back. The new reality has been brought about despite their stubbornness and their opposition. We are ready to let our wounds heal  but we are not willing to weave glorious banners for them out of our blood.108.	The African liberation movement has rendered a service to the peoples of colonialist Powers  not only by ridding them of their dishonorable wars against freedom fighters in Africa  but also by giving them the opportunity to get rid of their corrupt and tyrannical regimes. The freedom fighters in Guinea- Bissau  Mozambique and Angola have struggled for the cause of man as a whole. Their victory helped the people of Portugal to put an end to years of tyranny and suppression. If anybody deserves gratitude for this development  it is the people of Guinea-Bissau  led by the late Amilcar Cabrai  and the peoples of Angola and Mozambique with their respective revolutionary leaders.109.	This development should have been received in the General Assembly with the admission by the imperialist Powers of the failure of their former policies and of the decline of their political and economic empires. Yet  some of them deemed it appropriate to use this forum as a vehicle to talk about tightening belts  about using food and natural resources as a political weapon  and about the rights of the minority vis-a-vis the majority. They should instead pay the price of the well-being they enjoy at the expense of those who perished of starvation  those who have no schools  those who have no medicine  and those who have nowhere to live.110.	The extravagances of these countries were perpetrated at the expense of all those we have mentioned. Those who request co-operation could have paid the price for such opulence. They could have made unconditional sacrifices  but  on the contrary  they insisted on maintaining this high standard of extravagance and  moreover  they demanded that others make more sacrifices either voluntarily or under duress.111.	In the chaotic conditions created by the imperialist Powers  the so-called rights of the minority must be looked on as only a continuation of the privileges of the minority enjoyed at the expense of the suppressed and deprived majority. This minority would convince us that the future of the world depends on this continued exploitation of the world's resources. This is totally unacceptable. The call for democracy within the international community is being blocked by the refusal of the minority to fit into the new reality. This can be achieved only if the minority yields to the view of the majority  and if the majority takes part in formulating the decisions which determine the future of international relations. Slandering the policies of the oil-producing countries for fixing prices should not be taken at face value. At most  it reveals the anxiety of the industrialized countries in so far as that measure might lead to other actions by the developing countries which produce raw materials  because the industrial countries have established their economies on the basis of obtaining raw materials at the cheapest prices and selling their manufactures at the highest prices. Obviously  as shown by their spokesmen  they are not willing to alter this formula  hence their campaign of slander.112.	Can we then attach our future to the desires of countries which  although they are in a minority  are only interested in protecting their own rights without acknowledging their duties? The discussions of the Working Group drafting the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States are a striking example of the unwillingness of the imperialist Powers to give up the gains they obtained illegally when they were in control of the world's destiny. In defaming their policies  those countries only considered the future of their own economies. None of them cared to discuss the political and economic future of the world. Nor did they admit the failure of the economic and monetary policies which they had imposed upon the world. They did not deplore the looting and plunder practiced by their multinational companies which sought to obtain the lion's share of economic revenues for their share of the products of the third world. They said nothing about their intentions to lessen the gap between their advanced economies and the economies of other countries. Nor did they render any assistance in the field of technology. They did not extend a hand to the freedom fighters struggling for the realization of their right to self-determination and control over their natural resources. All they offered was lip service. They demanded that the third-world countries continue to sell their supplies at the lowest possible price lest the world economic order collapse. This is a false theory  as if scores of years of accumulated errors  plunder and looting to which the peoples of the world were subjected were not sufficient for the major developed Powers. They would have the third world remain a political colony or  at least  remain economically dominated  offering all it had at the lowest price for the sake of helping the imperialistic Powers to maintain their grip on its economy and destiny. We believe that it has become obvious that this political practice is a deceit; it is even an absurd deceit which we can no longer overlook.113.	Those who trade in wheat and use it as a means to interfere in the internal affairs of States are the most unfair and the greatest violators of the international code of ethics  and they cannot presume to lecture other States on human conduct.114.	The Arab countries which applied an embargo on the United States have done so as a reaction to an act of aggression initiated by this imperialistic Power and still being perpetrated against our peoples. Can any sensible individual expect us to provide energy to the hand that stabs us daily  by means of its Zionist agents  for the sake of satisfying their greed in dominating the world and its destiny? The United States has thus far offered only deceit to the peoples struggling for their freedom. On the other hand  they provide weapons and means of destruction to the racists in order to enable them to continue their domination of the peoples of the world. We are not willing to supply this war machinery with the fuel it needs to perpetuate itself. Putting these facts in their proper perspective exposes the ugly face of the elements that are trying to display their concern over the fate of the world. The worth of the military equipment supplied at one time to the Zionists would have been sufficient to feed millions of people who are dying of starvation in the Sahara  and yet the United States offered only empty promises  and conditional ones at that  to those dying of hunger.115.	The true problem resides in the re-establishment of an economic balance of power in the world and in the restructuring of a new world economic order in accordance with the resolution of the General Assembly which was adopted at its sixth special session  to which the industrial countries  led by the United States of America  entered reservations because it did not meet their desires.116.	May I draw your attention to a positive indicator which characterizes this session. It has become possible for us now to discuss the issues in their proper context. No longer are we afraid of talking openly. Palestine is the very issue that concerns the world as a whole  and there is no reason why we should not employ its right name. The issue is not the truce  nor is it the Middle East problem; it is not the disengagement of forces; it is not a matter for compromises. It is not any of that nonsense. The issue  in fact  is that of a sacred land which has been flagrantly usurped  the rights of whose people have been trampled upon. Those people have lived homeless for more than a quarter of a century.117.	Thus  the imperialist and colonialist Powers and their subversive agents have sought to prevent the discussion of this issue on an international level. Yet that transformation  witnessed by the world today  has made it possible for this item to be listed on the agenda and will  in turn  make it possible for an appropriate solution to be found. The world  and especially this Assembly  has been warned against any solution based on compromises or shortcuts or bargaining. We must not ignore the facts  such as they are. We have been warned against failure to acknowledge realities and against any partition schemes contradictory to the spirit of the Charter. Today  we warn against any solutions propagated by the so- called miracle makers. Miracles can only be made by the struggling peoples  and thus no one but the Palestinian people themselves can bring about a solution. We must invite the legitimate representatives of the Palestinians to participate in the debate  as this will make the consideration of the item serious and genuine. It will further silence those who seek to smear the just struggle of the Palestinian people.118.	Those who have tried to obstruct the inscription of the item  and those who have tried to label the Palestinians and their representatives as subversives and terrorists ignore the history of the United Nations and the history of the struggle of peoples. Most of those participating in this discussion and representing the third-world countries were once labeled as terrorists. Yet when their peoples' struggle triumphed  they became the true representatives of their people at the United Nations.119.	The situation in Cyprus has a bearing upon the security and safety of the area. It has an effect upon our humane and emotional feelings. The imperialist Powers have tried to follow the same policy they have followed in other situations by fabricating solutions and devising compromises. We deem it the duty of the General Assembly to recall that the United Kingdom bears the greatest responsibility in creating the tragedy of Cyprus. This country has never abandoned an area that had been blighted with its colonialism without leaving behind a problem or the seeds of a problem. It is high time that the plot was exposed. The influence of the United Kingdom  its bases and its allies should be isolated rather than be allowed to poison inter-national relations. Let us leave the affairs of Cyprus to the Cypriots  whether Turk or Greek. The promotion of mutual relations between the two communities and the protection of the rights of each will pave the road to a peaceful solution which will restore independence and non-alignment to the island  making it free of bases of the imperialist Powers and of their allies.120.	The Mediterranean is full of military fleets belonging to Powers distant from its shores  and which have no connexion with it. The continuation of the presence of the Sixth Fleet and the attempt of NATO to gain a foothold on the island of Cyprus constitute a threat to the security and safety of the population as a whole. It is our duty seriously to endeavor to make of the Mediterranean a lake of peace and civilization  free of rivalries and spheres of influence.121.	In this statement my delegation will not dwell upon the other items on the agenda. These will be dealt with in due course in the committees. Yet we are concerned about the fate of the world because certain issues have been kept on the agenda for a quarter of a century without ever having been resolved. We realize that the decision concerning those items rests with the determination of the peoples involved  for the Charter makes special provisions for the peoples and disregards imperialistic regimes.122.	Our numbers have risen at this session with the admission of Guinea-Bissau  Bangladesh and Grenada. We welcome them whole-heartedly. However  we are still waiting for the day to come when the representatives of the racist minorities will be replaced by the true representatives of Palestine and South Africa  and when we can welcome the true representatives of Zimbabwe. Then we shall be able to say that the provisions of the Charter and the universality of the Organization have been realized.123.	The decision of the General Assembly [resolution 3207 (XXIX)] to refer the question of the relationship between the racist regime of South Africa and the United Nations to the Security Council is a new step that should be followed by others in order to make the representation at the General Assembly consistent with the provisions of the Charter. How could the Assembly admit into its membership those who daily violate the provisions of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? The argument that this matter should be looked upon in a legal or procedural context sacrifices human dignity for the sake of abiding by technicalities. The reference of this matter to the Security Council exposes the imperialistic intentions of certain Powers and unveils the organic relationship between them and the racist regime in South Africa. That  however  has not prevented the Assembly from stating its view with regard to this matter which is in itself a good start.124.	As we await the completion of the liquidation of colonialism in the Portuguese colonies  we are concerned about a neighbor of Portugal which still occupies and dominates an African-Arab Territory. Spain's obstinate position regarding Sakiet Al-Hamra and Rio de Oro places that country on the list of the last of the old imperialistic Powers that have not yet come around to understanding the movement of history. Spain's insistence on adhering to that position is in contradiction to that movement. Any argument presented by Spain in defense of its presence in that region is nothing but a colonialist argument. The inhabitants of the region and their Arab brethren are capable of achieving their freedom and well-being; they are in no need of Spanish trusteeship or aid.125.	A new world is emerging today. There can be no escape from the formulation of new bases comparable with this new beginning. The United Nations must become an effective instrument for the realization of its Charter. We the majority and we are proud of being a majority have the duty to lay new foundations for the course of the Organization. We shall not be intimidated by the stubborn attitude of the old Powers. Our interrelationships will not be affected by any willful mischief. In fact  we are terminating our relations with the old racist Powers in an effort to expel them from the Assembly Hall  while we welcome new delegations representing friendly countries.126.	The new economic Powers have made continued sacrifices for the benefit of the world. They have never exploited the world. The old Powers  on the other hand  have failed to do anything to alleviate the calamities that befall the peoples of the world whom they continue to exploit. The peoples of the third world have never willfully destroyed their raw materials as did those advanced countries that burnt their grains at a time when people were perishing from starvation. The oil-producing countries have not consumed one third of the total production of the world's energy supply in extravagant and sophisticated luxuries as the privileged few have done. Rather  they produce their materials  export them and make them available for the world  and whatever revenues they get in return  they use for their own development. Whatever surplus remains  they share with fairness and dignity. It has not been couched in deceit or given as a bribe or used by their intelligence apparatus to topple legitimate Governments. The aid has been designed to give a hand to liberation movements  with an eye to ridding man of the scourge of colonialism  suppression and apartheid.127.	The 80 per cent of the world's population that is the legitimate owner of most of the world's natural resources also has the legitimate right to discuss and administer its affairs. Now the road is clear  and we must march on despite the opposition of others."
"75",4146,"LKA",29,1974,"Rarely  if ever  in the history of the United Nations has a President of the General Assembly been elected unanimously and without the whimsical aberration of a vote cast .in support of an imaginary candidate. Mr. Bouteflika has also perhaps achieved the record of being the youngest incumbent of this exalted and responsible office.53.	Through the delegation of Sri Lanka I offer to the President  on behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka  our warm felicitations and our best wishes for his success in the office which he has assumed. We salute him  not only as a true representative of the continent of Africa and one who personifies the spirit of a people that fought valiantly to free itself from the bondage of political subjection and still carries on with indomitable perseverance the struggle to erase the last vestiges of external economic exploitation  but also as the Foreign Minister of the country which happens to be at the moment the Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.54.	Founded on the principle of detachment from great-Power rivalries  the Non-Aligned Movement is pledged to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations; to the assertion protection of fundamental human rights; to recognition of the equality of all races and of all nations  large and small; to abstention from intervention or interference in the internal affairs of another country; and to the settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means. Through fidelity to these principles and policies  the Non- Aligned Movement has consistently sought to provide that element of moderation in international affairs which could be the most vital contribution to relieving international tensions and thereby promoting peace and harmony throughout the world.55.	The non-aligned group is today more united  numerically Stronger and better placed than it ever was to exert its influence on the course of international relations in the political  economic and social spheres and thereby to fortify the United Nations in all efforts directed towards the application and enforcement of the principles and purposes of the Charter. If we are to fulfill this high mission  we must be wary of besmirching our credentials by the least manifestation of partisanship. The non-aligned group must treat all nations as friends while dissociating itself from  and striving united to secure the abolition of  policies and practices repugnant to the ideals and objectives of non-alignment.56.	My delegation takes this opportunity of expressing its great admiration for the skill and ability with which Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador presided over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. His reputation as an eminent jurist  his vast experience as a diplomat and his penetrating knowledge of all aspects of United Nations activities  combined with his human qualities of courtesy  tact and patience  were fully manifested in his conduct of the twenty-eighth session.57.	The delegation of Sri Lanka extends a fervent welcome to the three new Members which have been admitted to the United Nations during this session: the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. We offer them our cordial congratulations and best wishes. We have the utmost confidence in their capacity and willingness to make an effective and constructive contribution towards the attainment of the aims and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.58.	The admission of Grenada and Guinea-Bissau marks yet another milestone in the progress towards self-determination of subject peoples and their liberation from foreign rule  as well as the attainment of universality of representation of the peoples of the world in the Organization.59.	The admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh brings to a close a poignant episode in the history of the subcontinent to which that country belongs. The malevolence of nature has inflicted on it the severest tribulations at the very moment when it was making a desperate effort to revive its shattered economy. We sincerely hope that the nations of the world will help it generously to recover speedily from the indescribable devastation and suffering which it has experienced.60.	As in the case of Bangladesh  natural disaster has wrought widespread havoc in the territory of another Member nation—Honduras. My delegation extends to the Government and people of Honduras our profound sympathy over the loss of life and the destruction resulting from the hurricane that recently struck it and trusts that it too will receive from the international community all the help that it needs to repair the damage to its economy.61.	The year that has elapsed since the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly has been marked by several momentous developments  each of a distinctive character  whether it be epoch-making  or pregnant with promise for the future  or even deeply disquieting.62.	The change of government in Portugal has happily resulted in a final renunciation of the former Government's anachronistic policy of colonial repression. The new Government's recognition of the right of its colonies to self-determination  beginning with Guinea-Bissau  and to be extended before long  we hope  to Mozambique and Angola  is a supreme act of redemption which merits universal approbation.63.	There remain only two racist regimes which have yet to abandon their obnoxious and inhuman policy of apartheid and to accord to the black African majorities  whom they dominate and persecute  their birth-right of self-determination and freedom in their homeland. The United Nations cannot tolerate any longer the pursuit of these policies which are an affront and a disgrace to modern civilization. Portugal's example is the light at the end of the tunnel. It will not be long before reason  humanity and self-interest prevail over perversity and racial arrogance and a peaceful settlement is found which results in the total emancipation of the black majorities and the colored communities of South Africa and Rhodesia and in the establishment of democratic rule on the principle of the equality of all races in those regions  thereby enabling them to live and work together in peace and good will in their mutual interest and for the greater good of all Africa.64.	When I spoke of developments that offered some hope for the future  I had in mind the changes in the Middle East situation after the October 1973 war  and particularly the disengagement agreements relating to the Sinai-Suez front and the Golan Heights. The Secretary of State of the United States wrought a miraculous change through his whirlwind diplomacy and his imaginative statesmanship. We should neither exaggerate nor belittle his achievement. But the future of the Middle East does not depend on one single individual  however talented  resourceful and indefatigable he may be.65.	The changed situation provides a slight impetus to peace  but it must be sustained by a display of self-restraint and moderation on all sides. The only answer to the indiscriminate violence that erupts from time to time is the elimination of the factors and circumstances that drive individuals and organizations  out of frustration  despair and disillusionment  into a state of dementia in which intimidation proves more alluring than negotiation.66.	The agreements on the disengagement of forces in the Sinai-Suez front and the Golan Heights must not be regarded as anything more than a brief respite. Disengagement could be a mirage  unless it is accepted by all sides as only the first stage of a complex and difficult process leading ultimately to the full implementation of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967. This resolution presents the best hope of a fair settlement  despite some of the ambiguities that have conveniently been detected in it and exploited to prevent and defer a final settlement while lands and territories conquered in war are being systematically incorporated into the territory of the occupying Power in contempt of the United Nations and the principles of its Charter.67.	The essential elements in the proposed settlement must be recognized and accepted without equivocation by one and all. Chief among them is the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. In accordance with this principle  Israel must withdraw its armed forces from the territories occupied by it as a result of war. If this principle is rejected  the Charter becomes a dead letter. The second element is the acknowledgment  not merely in words but in policy and practice as well  of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area  including Israel  and of the right of every State in the Middle East  including the State of Israel  to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or use of force. The third element is the guarantee of freedom of navigation through international waters in the area. Finally  and most important of all  there is the need for a just settlement of the refugee problem  which is a piece of circumlocution and a euphemistic synonym for the restoration of the right to self-determination of the peoples of Palestine which would give them a separate Arab Palestinian State as provided for and endorsed by the United Nations in the Partition Plan of 1947 [resolution 18/ (II)]. It is only by ensuring for the Palestinians the exercise of their right of self-determination that the United Nations can terminate the grim ordeal of a people who have for more than 25 years been compelled to lead a life bereft of hope  dependent on the charity of the international community  betrayed  as no other people in the world has been betrayed  by the very Organization that helped create the State of Israel. It is not by raining death and destruction on the defenseless women and children in the Palestinian Arab refugee camps and by enveloping them in a constant nightmare of fear and terror that a solution can be found. This derelict mass of displaced humanity must be given a home and a State in which they can live in honor and dignity without being left to languish and decay in humiliation and desolation.68.	The principle of a separate Palestine State was an integral feature of the partition. The United Nations must accept it and make it a reality. It is an impudent challenge to the authority of the United Nations  the creator of Israel  and miserable travesty of the very principle of justice which the United Nations sought to apply  even if under intimidation and pressure  by creating the State of Israel  for Israeli leaders to have the temerity to state that ""they"" -meaning the Palestinians- ""did not exist""  or to proclaim slogans of intransigence such as ""Jerusalem Never"". These slogans and these tendentious distortions of history do not provide the material out of which the edifice of peace can be built. They are irresponsible  inflammatory  uncompromising and unacceptable. By the same token  the United Nations cannot  even by implication  acquiesce in the proposition or offer any support to the idea that Israel does not exist or that its social and political structure should be so radically altered as to obliterate the separate identity which it seeks.69.	Likewise  Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  in which the Council affirmed that every State in the Middle East has a right to live within secure and recognized boundaries  cannot be interpreted as conferring on the State of Israel the unique prerogative  totally incompatible with international law and the principles of the Charter  of determining for itself and by itself where its boundaries should run in order to ensure its security. If that right were extended to all and sundry  the outcome would be universal anarchy. The question of safe and secure boundaries is a matter for negotiation  but it cannot be divorced from the recognition of the right of Israel to exist as a State and from the repudiation of belligerency. The time has come for all parties to eschew intemperance and extremism and to display restraint and moderation. Peace alone makes boundaries secure.70.	As one who has during the last four years been deeply involved in the Middle East problem in the unenviable capacity of Chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories  and as the representative of a country that recognized the State of Israel at an early stage and maintained diplomatic relations with it until 1970 when we decided that the only means open to us of recording our disapproval of a Member State's defiance of the Charter was the suspension of relations with Israel until it relinquished its conquests of 1967 or until a solution acceptable to the Arab people of the Middle East was reached I can claim that our credentials and our impartiality cannot be impugned by anyone with the least pretension to objectivity or detachment.71.	We earnestly wish to see an end to the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors  as we are convinced that the talents and technology of the people of Israel in partnership with the human and material resources of the Arab peoples of the Middle East could transform that entire area from a battlefield into a domain of concord  peaceful co-operation and prosperity. We hope the debate on the question of Palestine will not be used as an occasion for an exchange of acrimonious charges and counter-charges  but for a sober analysis of the causes of the present situation in the search for a compact that  by securing justice for all  will offer a guarantee of enduring peace for all.72.	The crisis in Cyprus has exposed once more the tragic shortcomings of the United Nations. Despite numerous resolutions of the Security Council calling for the withdrawal from the Republic of Cyprus of foreign military personnel present otherwise than under the authority of international agreements  recording its formal disapproval of the unilateral military actions undertaken against the Republic of Cyprus  and subscribing to the principle of respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of the island  little or no progress has been made towards the full restoration of constitutional government in Cyprus.73.	There is much more involved in Cyprus than a bitter internecine conflict between two ethnic communities. We are all involved in Cyprus and not least of all the members of the non-aligned movement. The Government of Cyprus was one of the first to declare its policy of non-alignment. The agony of Cyprus is the agony of the non-aligned movement; the deliverance of Cyprus is the deliverance of non-alignment; the betrayal and abandonment of Cyprus is the betrayal and abandonment of the principles of the Charter. It is for this reason that  on the commendable initiative of the President of Yugoslavia  the non-aligned group has sought  through the appointment of a Good Offices Committee  to intervene in order to achieve a peaceful composition of the differences between the parties involved  Governments and communities alike  the withdrawal of all foreign military forces  and the complete restoration of constitutional government in Cyprus as the only means by which its sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity can be preserved free from external influence and machination. There can be no partition  no enosis  no foreign occupation  but there can be a large measure of local autonomy for the two communities which would not be open to exploitation in a manner prejudicial to the survival of Cyprus as a sovereign  united and independent State.74.	This is the justification for the inclusion of the item ""The question of Cyprus"" in the agenda of the General Assembly as an urgent matter despite the fact that the situation created by the ouster of Archbishop Makarios  whom we recognize as the President of the Republic of Cyprus  and the subsequent events came within the purview of the Security Council's responsibility. This is not a matter that concerns only the five ""bishops"" of the Security Council and their 10 temporary ""coadjutors"". It is the responsibility of the entire ""synod"" because the issues involved are ecumenical in their reach and implications. The moving words of John Donne have been quoted here. To adapt them  I would say that we should not seek to ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for us all  nations great and small  powerful and weak  but chiefly for small defenseless countries and particularly those who  reposing their faith in non-alignment and in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  disavow military alliances. But the bell tolls loudest of all for the only institution that can bring us together in the pursuit of peace  justice and fraternity within the international community  the United Nations.75.	My delegation takes this opportunity of paying homage to those members of UNFICYP who volunteered to serve the cause of international peace and humanity and gave their lives to that cause  and also to those who have been wounded in the line of duty. To the families of those who were killed and to the Governments that dispatched them on their sublime mission  my delegation offers its heartfelt sympathy. At the same time we express the hope that those who have been injured may soon recover from their wounds and be restored to active life.76.	Permit me at this stage to pay a well-deserved tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for the zeal and speed with which he has acted  both in the Middle East and in Cyprus  in the cause of peace and humanity. He has not spared himself in the process and has set a shining example of conspicuous devotion to duty.77.	In the general debate now coming to a close  almost all participants have voiced loudly and clearly their anxiety over the future of our world in all its manifold preoccupations economic  social  political and legal. We have heard many references to detente  inflation  energy  population  food and the international law of the sea. There have been feverish negotiations and intense United Nations activity over many of these problems.78.	In the economic sphere  the historic sixth special session on raw materials and development occupies a position of preeminent importance along with the forthcoming World Food Conference shortly to be held at Rome.79.	In the social sphere  the World Population Conference held at Bucharest first brought together the nations of the world into open discussion of one of the most baffling problems of our time.80.	As regards the political sphere  I have already referred to the developments in the Middle East and in Cyprus.81.	In the legal sphere  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea at its second session  held at Caracas from 20 June to 29 August 1974  completed its general discussion of the issues before it and decided to meet again in March and April of next year to begin the process of negotiation. This decision awaits approval by the General Assembly during the present session.82.	All those problems -economic  social  political and legal- imperiously demand our attention.83.	The threatened recession and the instability of the international monetary system  which have been linked with the energy crisis and the pricing policies of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]  have figured prominently in many statements  chiefly in those of representatives of certain developed countries. Many of the speakers who sought to condemn the members of OPEC and their pricing policies and indict them for precipitating a world-wide recession and wrecking the international monetary system have short memories and elastic economic theories doctored to suit their particular predicament and to absolve themselves. The OPEC members have been made to appear the villains of the piece. Even the problem of inflation has been laid at their door. It would be much closer to the truth to admit that a reduction in the astronomical expenditures on armaments  which create incomes without a corresponding increase in goods on which those incomes could be spent  could significantly ease the problem of inflation. The arguments advanced in criticism of the OPEC members are founded on the premise that the international trading system and the international monetary system must depend for their durability on the industrialized nations controlling the overwhelming proportion of the world's monetary reserves.84.	The increase in the price of oil has been condemned as arbitrary and totally unrelated to the economic determinants of pricing. The world has been asked to forget that  long before the oil-exporting countries realized  even belatedly  the value of their product and the fact that for years they had been denied anything resembling the market value or the strategic value of their product  the international monetary system had been placed in grave peril by the soaring price bf gold and the nervous breakdown which the dollar had suffered.85.	According to these economic theorists  it is a law of nature  unquestionable and sacrosanct  that the prices paid for the products of the developing world should be determined by the importing developed industrialized countries without regard to the conditions of poverty and privation under which the producers live  while the manufactured goods sold to the impoverished world make full provision to satisfy the limitless and insatiable demands of the peoples of the developed world for the material things of life.86.	The policy of curtailing crude-oil production in order to ensure fair prices has been criticized as almost a form of economic aggression by those who justify the curtailment of acreages under food grains for the purpose of maintaining fair prices for their farmers. What sort of economic theory or moral philosophy is it that could justify the curtailment in food production at a time when many millions throughout the world are undernourished and millions die of starvation because of a lack of food or the inability to afford the soaring prices while at the same time  in regard to another essential commodity  condemning a price increase that does not threaten human survival?87.	Lest we be accused of ingratitude  my delegation would like to acknowledge  with thanks and appreciation  the economic aid given by the developed world to the developing nations  and especially the handsome contributions made by the developed world to humanitarian programs for the relief of famine and other forms of distress whenever the occasion demanded. But aid must not be regarded as an act of altruism. It is an investment that ""blessed him that gives and him that takes""  like the quality of mercy.88.	It was exhilarating to hear the statements of the Foreign Ministers of France [2238th meeting]  the Netherlands [2252nd meeting] and the United Kingdom [2240th meeting]  and of the Prime Minister of Australia [2249th meeting]  who did not succumb to emotionalism in their analysis of the world economic situation but showed a readiness to deal with it in a realistic manner. The shift of approximately $75 000 million of reserves from the industrialized countries to the oil-exporting countries cannot be regarded  as a global calamity. One solution that has been suggested  that the oil producers should lend these amounts back to the industrialized countries so that the latter could have effective control over them and keep their industries in full production  took no heed of the consequences of such a course of action for those developing countries that do not produce oil. The only equitable solution lies in the joint association of the revenues of the oil-exporting countries with the technology of the industrialized nations and the human resources of the developing world. There is no denying that  if a world-wide recession is to be avoided  the revenues of the oil-exporting countries must be invested in a judicious manner  but they must be so invested as to sustain the productive capacity of the industrialized world and to increase progressively the purchasing power of the developing world. This requires a policy of planned and co-ordinated investment of those revenues in a manner which will wrest from the small coterie of industrialized countries their industrial oligopoly and create in the developing continents of the world—Africa  Asia and Latin America a pattern of industrialization which would complement the productive capacity of the industrialized nations  thereby ensuring a rational division of labor and a more equitable distribution of world income.89.	At the sixth special session on raw materials and development the Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-Vi)] and the related Pro-gramme of Action [resolution 3202 (S- VI)]  section of which contained the Special Program of emergency measures to mitigate the difficulties of the developing countries most seriously affected by the economic crisis.90.	The most unexceptionable declarations are  however  by themselves  not sufficient  and emergency measures are only a palliative. What we need is a new international economic order which would ensure an effective international scheme for the regulation of primary products and the stabilization of the prices of raw materials and primary products at reasonable levels  coupled with an assurance of steady supplies. There should be a permanent mechanism to ensure a proper equilibrium and balance between the prices received by developing countries for their exports and the prices paid by them for their imports from the developed world  so as to enable the developing countries to maintain their balance of payments and their terms of trade in conditions of stability which would permit the steady and orderly execution of their economic development programs. The economic growth process of developing countries must not be hampered by uncertainties  sharp price fluctuations and the vagaries of the market. There is yet no clear evidence that the will to produce the results contemplated in resolutions 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI) exists where it has most to be demonstrated. Although Sri Lanka is one of the countries most seriously affected by the present economic crisis  we are not prepared to join the chorus of denunciation of the OPEC members or lean against the wailing wall.91.	The creation of the new international economic order would require patient negotiation and unremitting effort. It cannot materialize overnight. Meanwhile we would appeal to those who have at their disposal wealth beyond the dreams of Croesus to spare a thought for the developing countries which are faced with ruin and disaster and to help them in their predicament and to grant this help on terms which they can afford. If I may borrow a thought from Thucydides taken from the funeral oration of Pericles: ""Wealth is not just material for vainglory but an opportunity for achievement"". The Latin maxim ""Bis ilat qui cito dot""—""He gives twice as much who gives promptly"" is most apposite in this context. The social and political fabric of the most seriously affected developing countries could be rent apart in the absence of immediate relief. It certainly cannot be kept intact with the promise and distant vision of a new economic order.92.	The second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea did not and could not secure final agreement on a treaty but it did  through an exhaustive examination of the principal issues  lay the foundation for the international covenant that we all so fervently desire. As I stated in Caracas  we must not let historians say  in the words of Simon Bolivar  that ""we ploughed the seas""; let us rather by our joint efforts and through the display of mutual understanding  co-operation  tolerance and good will permit history to record that we helped future generations to garner the wealth of the oceans for the benefit of all mankind  with special regard to the interests and needs of developing nations  and that we bequeathed to them to be held in trust for all time the common heritage of mankind to be shared and enjoyed in a spirit of fraternity and in complete peace and tranquility. This is the task that confronts us when we next meet.93.	I should like to take this opportunity of suggesting that when the item is taken up in plenary meeting we avoid general statements and confine our attention to matters of procedure  not the least of which should be a realistic appraisal of the possibility of completing our work in one more session  or of the need for providing for the contingency of yet another session to be held in 1975 at which we should conclude our deliberations and reach agreement.94.	I must not let this occasion pass without expressing in the Assembly my most sincere thanks to the Government of Venezuela for the excellent arrangements and facilities provided by it for the Conference and for the courtesy  kindness and gracious hospitality of the people of Venezuela  who emulated the example set by their President  Mr. Andres Perez  and their Foreign Minister  Efrain Schacht Aristeguicta.95.	The report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean IA19629 and Add.l[ has to be presented to the present session of the General Assembly in accordance with resolution 3080 (XXVIII). We have no illusions as to the prospects for giving practical shape and form to what might appear to be an ideal concept. The great Powers  excluding China which is a member of the Ad Hoc Committee  have not shown the amount of interest that we might have expected of them. We hope that the much-talked-of detente is not just idle chatter and that its attainment will help them exclude the Indian Ocean from their policy of competitive expansion of armaments in that area in the not-too- distant future. I refer to the Powers involved in that talked of detente  96.	The realization of the concept of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace is not the responsibility  however  of the great Powers alone. We of the littoral and hinterland States have the primary responsibility of composing our own differences  settling our disputes by peaceful means and resisting the temptation of repeating the mistakes which we impute to the great Powers. The major maritime Powers and all those who depend on the unrestricted passage of commercial traffic through the Indian Ocean may be assured that such passage will be granted to them in any arrangements to give effect to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. The lines of communication across the Indian Ocean must be kept open for vessels and aircraft of all kinds and of all nations subject only to the condition that their passage across and over the Indian Ocean does not constitute a threat to the peace  good order  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the littoral and hinterland States.97.	In the general debate hardly any mention is made of the heart and soul of the Organization  the Secretariat  on which we have to rely so heavily for the smooth conduct of our work and our activities and the execution of our policies. We have been fortunate all these years in having a staff of men and women of marked competence and devotion who have served us with steadfast loyalty. On rare occasions sections of the staff have reacted adversely. The blame rests not with them but with us. If we are to count on their loyalty and their zeal in the performance of their work and if we are to expect discipline of them  we have a duty first to discipline ourselves and to avoid making impossible demands of them and of straining that loyalty beyond all reasonable limits. Civil service must not be construed as civil servitude. Too many of us too often pay too little regard to the value of a proper employer-staff relationship. Mutual respect  mutual tolerance and mutual trust are the foundation of a sound relationship between any organization and its staff. The delegation of Sri Lanka takes this op-portunity of extending its warmest thanks to all ranks of the Secretariat for the high quality and standard of the service they continue to render us.98.	As we approach the last quarter of the twentieth century and look back on nearly 30 years of effort within the framework of the United Nations  we will realize that  although there are many political issues that still pose a deadly threat to international peace and stability  the portents should not discourage or perturb us. In the future  while the inner circle of powerful nations grapples with the dilemmas of disarmament  it is economic problems and economic relationships that will be our principal preoccupation  as they rightly should be.99.	It is incumbent on us to fashion in the new law of the sea and the proposed Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States acceptable  viable and effective instruments of international social justice which would set the tone and standard of a more enlightened international economic order and serve as an inspiring code of international morality."
"76",4190,"LSO",29,1974,"On behalf of my Government and my delegation I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Bouteflika  a courageous and illustrious son of Africa  on his unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of this Assembly. His country  under the inspired leadership of President Houari Boumediene  has played no mean role in the affairs of our continent  and indeed in the affairs of the world. We assure him of our co-operation in the discharge of his onerous responsibilities.129.	It gives us special pleasure  as a small country  to welcome the new Members of the Organization Grenada  Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau each of which will  we are sure  contribute positively to our search for peace and social justice. Their different and varied social and political backgrounds will add to the sum total of our knowledge and understanding of the problems that beset our world. Their presence will not only increase the number but augment the voice of the world's small countries in their fight against all forms of neo-colonialism.130.	Previous speakers have spoken succinctly and eloquently about the world's political and economic problems  to which we shall therefore allude only briefly. In Africa  we intend to underscore some of the problems of economic under achievement   and the implications  in terms of human relationships  of colonialism and racism. In this regard  we wish to support the informative and authoritative statement made this morning [2262nd meeting] by General Mohamed Siad Barre  President of the Somali Democratic Republic  whose voice is the voice of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] and which we request this Assembly to heed.131.	While we appreciate the steps taken by the super-Powers to reach understanding on various international issues  we do not—I repeat  we do not believe that only they are capable of bringing peace and security to the world. In fact  we are suspicious and fearful of discussions and agreements reached outside the ambit of the United Nations because the interests of the super-Powers are not necessarily the interests of mankind.132.	In our opinion  only the United Nations can safeguard the interests of the many small countries that have no political  economic or military ambitions. It is only through the United Nations that the hopes and fears of the majority of the world's inhabitants can be expressed. In other words  detente between the super-Powers is meaningless because it guarantees neither peace nor security  as witness the failure of disarmament talks  the continuing wars in Indochina  and the tensions in the Middle East. To us  superPower detente looks like mutual accommodation rather than a search for permanent peace.133.	The situation in the Middle East remains volatile because the super-Powers are using Israel and some Arab countries as pawns in the international power game. There can be no peace in the area until Israel abandons all occupied Arab lands and recognizes the legitimate rights of the Palestinians who should be involved in all discussions and negotiations. This  we believe  can be done without prejudice to Israel's existence as a State. Israel cannot claim to exist at the expense of the Palestinian people.134.	The people of Indochina should be encouraged to work out their own destinies through dialog. Political interference or military intervention by outsiders can only aggravate the situation and prolong division and strife in Korea  Viet Nam  Laos and Cambodia. Wherever and whenever possible  only the United Nations should be allowed to mediate or intervene  because  as we have indicated  those who intervene as individual nations do not necessarily have the interests of the whole area at heart  and we therefore feel that the United Nations is the only body that can represent the small Powers  which are often used as tools by the great Powers.135.	The violation of the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus  a member of the non-aligned movement  can only be viewed with anxiety and fear for the existence of small countries that refuse to be drawn into existing power blocs. Interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign  independent State  under whatever pretext  cannot be condoned or Excepted. All concerned are therefore requested  in the name of peace  to accept the decision of the Security Council on this matter and to restore the legitimate constitutional rights of Cyprus.136.	The international economic situation can only be described as perilous. Inflation has gone out of control and threatens the economies of all countries industrialized and non-industrialized  capitalist and socialist. Coupled with inflation is the unstable international monetary system  and both factors have a deleterious effect on international trade. The Western economic system based on free enterprise has become a Frankenstein monster  consuming not only its creators but all who are associated with it. No remedy seems to be in sight. The economies of small countries are being threatened as a result of the actions of the world's major trading partners and the moguls of the international monetary system.137.	There is as yet no evidence that the sixth special session has produced any change in the attitudes and methods of the major trading countries of the world. In complete disregard of the signs of the times  die hard capitalists are clinging to the old economic order with its inequities and iniquities. The poor people of the world  ruthlessly exploited for generations  are asking for a fair share of the world's economic cake. If their appeal for justice and equity goes unheeded for long  then they should seek their salvation through their own devices and  if necessary  through new economic alliances. We do not understand why the 80 per cent of the world's population who control the major resources of the world keep on moaning about bad treatment by the few and  in the mean time  allow themselves to be oppressed. It is our view that the developing countries of the world should reject economic exploitation just as unequivocally as they have rejected political oppression and subjugation.138.	We participated fully at the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Caracas  and are pleased that the international community has accepted the principle that the seas and the resources therein are the common heritage of mankind. We hope this will prevent the colonization of the seas by those who have the technology and the financial power to do this. It is our hope that the next session of the Conference on the Law of the Sea will reach agreement on draft articles of an international convention that not only will guarantee to land-locked States the right of free access to the sea but also will ensure that the seas and the oceans are protected and exploited for the benefit of all mankind.139.	We have already indicated that the President of the Democratic Republic of Somalia has spoken authoritatively on the problems of Africa. We shall therefore allude to only a few.140.	The social  economic and political problems of Africa are due to many causes. But first and foremost is the shortage of food  in both quality and quantity  due to ignorance and lack of funds  in that order. Time  effort and money should be spent on the education and training of African farmers in the basic principles and techniques of crop and livestock production.141.	Those of us who know Africa know that large areas of that continent are ecologically suitable for the production of high-quality livestock and crop products. What we lack is the technical know-how. But the techniques required are profoundly simple. It is not the machinery that we need; it is simply the devotion and self-application of our people that will enable us to produce our own food and stop going cap in hand  complaining about the destruction of crops by those who use their own crops as methods and means of twisting the arms of those that we should control.142.	In many parts of Africa agricultural production could be appreciably increased through the application of approved methods and techniques. The availability of funds for the purchase of such agricultural inputs as fertilizers  seeds and insecticides will not by itself result in increased production. What is necessary is knowledge and a new outlook based on hard work and self-reliance  which has been repeated time without number by African leaders who have tried to urge their people to go back to the land and produce the food they require. Rural development in the agricultural sector should aim first at self- sufficiency in basic foodstuffs  for only when people are happy and healthy can they become productive and receptive to new ideas.143.	In accordance with the Declaration on Economic and Technical Co-operation  adopted by OAU last year at Addis Ababa at the tenth anniversary ofOAU  African States should strive to accumulate their own food reserves and encourage trade among themselves and this is possible. Only in this way could they reduce their dependence on uncertain supplies from foreign countries which are themselves experiencing serious shortages of grains and livestock products  or which are using their food surpluses as political weapons. We hope African delegations to the forthcoming World Food Conference at Rome will give serious consideration to these issues and stop com-plaining that Africa is not being given food by those who do not want to give it food.144.	On the political front  Africa has registered some progress but much still remains to be done before the continent is finally rid of all vestiges of colonialism and racism.145.	The successful struggle and independence of Guinea-Bissau under the leadership of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC] gave impetus to the events in Mozambique where there is now a transitional Government led by the Frente de Libertao de Mozambique [FRELIMO]. Just a week ago  we visited Lourenzo Marques for the purpose of expressing solidarity with and giving encouragement to the forces of liberation there. In the context of southern Africa  this was not a mere gesture but visible support for Prime Minister Chissano and his colleagues  who are living and working in an atmosphere poisoned by centuries of racial oppression and discrimination. For this is a disease of southern Africa racial oppression  racial discrimination  racial exploitation and those who live there know what it means to live in our own continent where we are oppressed by minority regimes. We were impressed by the happy working relationship between the FRELIMO Government and the Portuguese High Commissioner  but vigilance is necessary to thwart the nefarious activities of reactionaries within and outside Mozambique. In fact  in Rhodesia and South Africa  the talk is that the Portuguese have let the side down. This is the attitude that the racist minority regimes are adopting instead of facing facts as they are and changing their policies.146.	As far as Namibia is concerned  we associate ourselves unreservedly with the decisions of the Organization. The people of the Territory must be allowed to determine their own destiny on the basis of one man  one vote  and not on the basis of ""population groups""  which is another name for apartheid. Let us not be fooled by the stratagem that has come from the Pretoria regime that the people of South-West Africa will be called together to decide their own destiny. The idea is that they should meet as populations rather than as individuals in a free country  and the basis of apartheid is population division.147.	With the imminent independence of Mozambique and  we also hope  of Angola  the days of the rebel.racist regime in Salisbury are numbered. To continue to resist progressive change is to court disaster  for no degree of oppression and brutality will discourage or deter the people of Zimbabwe from their determination to become free men in their own country. With the moral and material support of the international community they are bound to win.148.	I turn now to apartheid  which is one of the perennial problems facing the United Nations. Our opposition to apartheid derives from our belief in fundamental rights as enunciated and understood by the international community not from a hatred of white people. As the Chairman of OAU indicated this morning [2262nd meeting]  Africans are not vindictive  and  after 300 years of white habitation in southern Africa  we do not believe anybody is thinking of forcing the white man out of southern Africa; he is being simply asked to allow other people to live their own lives without let or hindrance and not to arrogate to himself the political and economic power to decide the destinies of a majority of people. We have never believed in the superiority of one race over another and  as Christians  we believe in the worth of the human person. Apartheid is unacceptable because it is based on fear and is therefore unjust. It degrades and brutalizes both its protagonists and its victims. We live cheek by jowl with the system and cannot  therefore  be accused of speaking from ignorance or malice. It is a vicious system  and to cite just one little example when we tell you that it degrades even those who apply it: recently  three white men  whose ages range from 18 to 48  murdered an African woman by forcing methylated spirits down her throat. Now  these are the degradations of apartheid.149.	Unless and until South Africa shifts from its rigid position on racial matters  there can be no constructive dialog between it and most independent African States. The longer it delays in making such a move  the greater is the danger of a racial conflagration in southern Africa and  as its closest neighbors  we cannot look at such a prospect with equanimity. We speak  not because we hate South Africa  but because we are surrounded by South Africa. We live next to South Africa  and if there is any confrontation of any kind military  economic or otherwise Lesotho  Botswana and Swaziland cannot escape unscathed  and therefore we cannot keep quiet. In their relationship with the new progressive Portuguese Government  Africans have proved to the world that they are opposed not to white people as such but to injustice and oppression. Will South Africa learn from the Portuguese experience or will it continue to defy international opinion in the misguided belief that everybody is out of step except itself?"
"77",4260,"LUX",29,1974,"I am very happy to extend my whole-hearted congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I take personal satisfaction in the honor that has been done to you and  through you  to your country  Algeria.3.	I should also like to tell the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  how much we appreciate the intelligent and effective work he has been doing for years without respite.4.	My country welcomes the admission to the United Nations of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. The United Nations has thus taken a further step to-wards the ideal situation  which would be the presence of all the countries in the Organization.5.	As is clear from the statements already made here by heads of delegations during this general debate in which each year we draw up the balance-sheet of the world situation  there are really not very many grounds for general optimism  even if in some regions of the world for instance  the Middle East there has been a relaxation of international tension and a more favorable atmosphere for the quest for peace has been created.6.	We pay a tribute to all those who  displaying great realism  have during the past year contributed to the lessening of tension in the Middle East  to the point where today one can again hope for a peaceful settlement of the conflict which has been weighing on international relations for a quarter of a century. While only too often people seem to feel that they should criticize the role of the United Nations  I take pleasure today in emphasizing the fundamental contribution of the United Nations forces in the' disengagement of the belligerents  thereby making a decisive contribution to the maintenance of the cease-fire.7.	The United States Secretary of State  Mr. Kissinger  who has not spared himself in leading us step by step to this partial relaxation of the situation  realistically reminded us in his statement here on 23 September that progress can be made only in steps  but he said that ""Each step forward modifies old perceptions and brings about a new situation that improves the chances of a comprehensive settlement [2238th meeting  para. 55]. It is therefore only logical to draw the conclusion that we must not lose the momentum thus gained  for to do so would mean that the situation could again be aggravated and the temptation to use force could become stronger. I think I can say that there is a general desire to see the Organization play a paramount role in the next phase of the negotiations  whatever form they may take  and I am gratified to be able to note that fact.8.	The countries of the European Community  of which Luxembourg is a member  have been deeply concerned with the situation in the Middle East  a region to which they are bound by many ties woven by geography and history and with which they wish to maintain ever closer relations. Hence  they thus have been led to define their position on the conflict and have called  essentially  for the observance of the following fundamental principles: the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and the need to end the occupation of territory resulting from the 1967 conflict; respect for the sovereignty  the territorial integrity and independence of each State in the area and its right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries; the necessity of taking into account the legitimate rights of the Palestinians in the establishment of a just and lasting peace.9.	I am convinced that the observance of those principles will facilitate the search for a stable solution and thus will enable all the countries concerned to devote their best efforts to the economic development of the region rather than to the purchase and use of ever more costly and ever more lethal weapons.A/PV.225310.	Only a few weeks ago we witnessed another tragic event  this time in the eastern Mediterranean. There was a coup d'etat in Cyprus  launched by irresponsible elements. It resulted in a series of murders and military actions  the displacement of thousands of persons and immense destruction in a country which had never been among the richest of the world. Despite prompt action by the competent bodies of the United Nations the Security Council  the Secretary-General and the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus  and despite prompt diplomatic intervention  it was not possible to avoid the creation of this new hotbed of tension  not to say war. I think that a solution to this painful conflict must be found by negotiations between the parties directly concerned. There must not be a repetition of the mistakes which have made us lose so many years in the Middle East. Of course  it is permissible  and possibly even useful  for the parties to the conflict to make clear what they cannot accept  but they should not at this stage pose their requirements as pre-conditions. For there is the risk that  in placing certain conditions on the resumption of negotiations  one becomes locked in an impasse that can lead to the broadening of the forum of the discussion without necessarily increasing the chances of success.11.	With regard to the solution to this critical situation  I fully share the opinion expressed here a week ago by Mr. Callaghan  the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom [2245th meeting]. I  too  hope that the negotiations between the leaders of the two Cypriot communities will soon lead to positive results.12.	It should surprise no one that the head of Government of a small State linked  through the European Community  with both Greece and Turkey  and also with Cyprus  is much more concerned with the independence of Cyprus and the sovereign will of the Cypriots than with the desires and preoccupations demonstrated in other capitals  in Europe and else-where.13.	On the humanitarian level  the international community as a whole is invited  once again  to con-tribute generously to alleviating the suffering and repairing the damage. It goes without saying that we shall not be remiss in fulfilling our duty of international solidarity.14.	In my opinion  our Organization can learn several lessons from the events in Cyprus.15.	In the first place and Mr. Waldheim quite rightly highlights this important point in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization the United Nations can effectively intervene in conflict situations only if it has the support of all its Members in the application of the decisions of its principal organs  and particularly the decisions of the Security Council concerning the maintenance of international peace and security [A I96011Add. I  sect. VII]. It goes without saying that in that respect the support of the permanent members of the Council is particularly vital.16.	In the second place  the two conflicts 1 have just mentioned show that mankind clearly remains more skilled in the art of war than in the art of restoring peace  as we can see if we compare the funds spent on. increasing war arsenals with those actually devoted to the quest for and the establishment of peaceful relations. The United Nations has a fundamental mission to perform here  one which is fully in accord with the primary objective of the Charter  namely  the maintenance of international peace and security.17.	The United Nations forces  in accomplishing their task in the Middle East and in Cyprus  have fulfilled with distinction the mission entrusted to them  and I bow my head in memory of the 40-odd members of the United Nations forces who made the supreme sacrifice  not as heroes of war  but as defenders of peace. These forces cannot  of course  be a substitute for real negotiations  which alone can create a new viable political situation.18.	For some time a great deal has been said about detente. Several speakers have already referred to the favorable development in the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union  and this is obviously a source of satisfaction for all of us.19.	Furthermore  let us recognize that for many years discussions concerning disarmament have nevertheless been carried out within the framework of our Organization and other international forums  and yet only modest progress has been achieved in this field.20.	We must regrettably note that  despite the existence of immense war arsenals which can eradicate all life on earth  the general arms race continues at a devastating pace and the budgets to this end increase regularly. Ever more sophisticated weapons are continually being produced and made available to an ever-growing number of countries.21.	At the report of all those armament policies there is a feeling of suspicion: none dares trust a potential adversary. Yet it is clear that this arms race cannot go on indefinitely  because it increasingly absorbs wealth which is essential for humanitarian purposes. Further-more  the risk of a fatal accident with incalculable consequences cannot be excluded.22.	In my view  the problem must be approached realistically. While complete disarmament must and should be considered as the ultimate goal  it is nevertheless more realistic on a short-term basis to consider an effective and controlled reduction of a given proportion of weapons. In this field as in others  the best is often the enemy of the good. It is in this spirit that my country participates in the Vienna talks on the reduction of arms in Central Europe.23.	I referred earlier to the importance of trust and I remain convinced that without effective control it will be impossible to instill the trust that is needed to arrive at effective disarmament.24.	We believe that a general conference on disarmament might bring us closer to our desired objective  provided that it is preceded by an adequate preparation  bearing particularly on effective means of achieving that goal.25.	The rather poor record of this year nevertheless includes a most satisfying development  namely  the radical change in the policy of the new Portuguese Government in regard to its overseas territories. The distressing Guinea-Bissau affair has now had a happy outcome. Furthermore  Lisbon has accelerated its negotiations with the liberation movements in its other territories  and those negotiations have already produced agreements.26.	Favorable developments of this kind are  unfortunately  not yet in prospect in South Africa  Rhodesia and Namibia. These areas will doubtless be the last on the planet openly to suffer from a policy of racism. We must hope that the wisdom of all men will finally put an end to this suffering.27.	Two European countries  Portugal and Greece  are preparing to rejoin the family of truly democratic countries. For me  this is another positive factor of great importance which I cannot fail to welcome warmly from this rostrum.28.	Together with this  there is the very difficult evolution of the nine countries of the European Community towards economic and political .union. I shall not deny the complexity of this evolution  but it moves ahead relentlessly because of the determination of its sponsors  the originality of its approach and its very promising nature.29.	As was emphasized so eloquently the other day by the President of the Council of the Community  Mr. Sauvagnargues [2238th meeting]  this Community will be both internally and externally a valuable guarantor of peace and justice and a powerful factor for progress and co-operation. Conscious of the dignity to which all peoples aspire  and aware above all of the needs of the least endowed  it feels that it must contribute substantially to the creation of a more just world order  one which is better balanced and able to meet the multiple challenges which face us all  taking realistically into account all of the factors and resources which condition our common survival beyond the short term.30.	It is with such an approach and with a view to a more effective universal co-operation that the nine members of the Community have requested the status of observer within this Organization.31.	More than a quarter of a century has gone by since the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  which is the fundamental charter for safeguarding human dignity. In this respect I fully agree with the ideas expressed from this rostrum by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium [2244th meeting] and by other colleagues.32.	We are alarmed by the frequent reports which describe recent cases of the use of torture  arbitrary detention or other degrading treatment  and we fully support any action taken to condemn and abolish such reprehensible practices. It is in cases of armed conflict that human rights are most often disregarded and populations subjected to great risks. One notes with growing frequency  however  that similar injustices are perpetrated in times of peace as well  in defense of so-called ""higher interests or ideals"". May those in authority in every country realize that no ideological consideration can justify recourse to torture  and that those who resort to  dishonor themselves and deserve to be placed outside the pale of mankind. Seizing innocent hostages who are alien to any conflict can never be justified anywhere  and those who still indulge in such abominable and cowardly acts can no longer lay claim to an ideology or popular cause. They are simply common criminals. If our collaboration in the United Nations is to have any meaning  all Member States here should  without exception  agree to abolish  as swiftly as possible  international gangsterism.33.	In our times  economic and social problems have acquired a growing importance  both nationally and internationally  since economic difficulties  as we all know  frequently generate political tensions.It is therefore natural that international organizations  and particularly the United Nations  should concern themselves more actively with these questions.34.	The world economic situation has deteriorated in the course of the last year because of increased inflation  a shortage of certain primary commodities  and because of important changes both in trade balances and in balances of payments. It is symptomatic that economic growth should be negative in several industrialized countries which have to meet very high deficits in their balance of payments. As a reaction   too many countries have had as a reflex action the protection of their immediate national interests  without taking into account the needs of their neighbors. What could follow is a large-scale economic crisis. International co-operation has never been as necessary as it is today because interdependence is such that no country  even the wealthiest  can be sheltered from a world crisis.35.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly shed new light on these major economic and social problems which have accumulated over several years. It has made it possible to see a little more clearly what are the renewable and non-renewable resources of the earth.36.	The last year has nevertheless shown that the world economic system is not able to absorb too many sudden shocks  such as the quadrupling of the price of one raw material  oil  within a year. If one goes too far or too fast in isolated sectors without taking into account the whole economic picture  there may be breakdowns or violent reactions harmful to all to all  I emphasize.37.	Doubtless  in the past the industrialized countries have not given all the assistance which they could and should have given to poorer countries  and an additional effort can legitimately be demanded of them. But that entails the obvious need that their own economies should not be imperiled by ill-timed rises in indispensable primary commodities.38.	Furthermore  it is essential that all countries concerned clearly realize that if the world were to have an economic and financial crisis because of new exaggerated rises on so essential a product as oil  for example  the super-Powers would be the first to come out of such a crisis  and even come out of it strengthened economically and politically  while the lesser industrialized countries  like the developing countries  would feel the full weight.39.	As for the Special Program  under the Pro-gramme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)]  to give emergency assistance to the countries most seriously affected by recent movements in international prices  the European Community is going to make a concrete and substantial contribution. For that operation to be really successful  all potential donor countries  of both East and West  and the countries which have a wealth of raw materials  should agree as soon as possible to exceptional and universal aid.40.	Among the major problems  we must still  alas  include famine in certain African and Asian regions. One of the main tasks of the forthcoming World Food Conference in Rome in November 1974 will be to consider this problem in depth  and recommend medium- and long-term measures so as to prevent shortages of all kinds in the future  particularly of fertilizers. But we must not lose sight of short-term needs  and must provide sufficient food for countries in urgent need of it. Countries in the drought zone of Africa are among those suffering most.41.	Furthermore  the World Population Conference held a few weeks ago in Bucharest drew world attention to the growing importance of the problems of population growth. It goes without saying that one cannot expect final conclusions in so vast and complex a field. The World Population Plan of Action which was adopted by the Conference could not  by the nature of things  go beyond certain general guide-lines.42.	Bearing in mind the considerable decline in the birth-rate in most industrialized countries  they may soon have to face a serious problem of depopulation. This is the case in my country  where a certain balance is maintained only because of migration. On the other hand  many developing countries have a high rate of population growth  together with a substantial economic and geographical potential. Such a situation certainly presents problems  but stimulating problems whose solution appears promising. But it would be absurd to claim that an over-populated country with meager resources can ensure its development despite a high birth-rate.43.	It follows that a world population plan of action cannot be uniform. It is not a question of reducing the number of human beings at all costs everywhere  or  on the contrary  of believing that the more people there are  the more power  and indeed wealth  there will be. The main purpose of that world plan of action should be to ensure a better proportion between available resources and their present and future users.44.	Next year we shall celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. Our world Organization was the result of the aspirations of mankind  which had endured the agonies of a devastating war and which placed its hopes in the attainment of a peaceful world that would enable all States to co-operate fully in order to ensure a better life for all peoples. In the course of that period  the fundamental objectives enshrined in the Charter have successfully stood the test of time and all the pro-gramme of international co-operation which has resulted will continue to constitute an indispensable framework and an essential condition for genuine international co-operation to flourish.45.	However  it is not enough to support the United Nations with words alone. We must learn to make better use of the vast possibilities offered by our Organization and to develop them further so as to enrich our common heritage as much as possible; as the representative of the Netherlands said this morning so eloquently [2252nd meeting]  we must make use more fully than in the past  of the many channels of international co-operation within our Organization."
"78",4331,"MAR",29,1974,"It gives the Moroccan delegation real satisfaction to see the representative of a sister country presiding over this important session of the General Assembly of the Organization. Through you  Mr. President  all Africa is honored today. Consequently it is with true pleasure that I express to you  on my own behalf and on behalf of all the members of my delegation  warmest and most fraternal congratulations. I now pledge to you the total co-operation of the Moroccan delegation in the accomplishment of the tasks which the members of this august Assembly have unanimously entrusted to you. This is no doubt that  thanks to your competence and your great experience of international problems  the work of the present session will be crowned with success.156.	I must not fail in another equally pleasant duty  that of addressing to Mr. Benites my heartiest congratulations on the manner in which he guided the work of the twenty-eighth session  in the course of which he demonstrated his great talent and his attachment to the ideas of peace  freedom and cooperation between all the peoples.157.	The present session opened under the best auspices. It started its work by welcoming three new Members to the Organization. We offer the representatives of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau our cordial congratulations and our warmest wishes for the greatness and prosperity of their countries and their peoples. We rejoice that they have come here to reinforce our ranks in the struggle-of a different nature this time- which we are waging here for a more just and fraternal world and society.158.	We realize that in the year which has just elapsed progress has been made in the efforts to establish peace in troubled areas  to accelerate the process of decolonization in Africa and elsewhere and to search for economic co-operation for the good of all. These efforts led us to hope that the process of detente and co-operation would continue. Unfortunately  the world finds itself confronted once more by dangerous events with grave consequences which threaten to jeopardize all the achievements of recent years.159.	The international situation as it appears today is  to say the least  confused and uncertain. It does not encourage optimism. There are still numerous problems which threaten  at the same time  co-operation  peace and international security . It behooves us. 150.	With regard to the regime for the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  the delegation of Dahomey believes that the international authority to be established should be endowed with extensive powers in connexion with not only the exploitation and exploration but also the sale of the resources  in order to prevent a decline in the prices of the minerals from the deposits on dry land  and in particular of those produced by the developing countries. In any event  exploitation of the international zone must not be entrusted to multinational corporations on the unconvincing pretext that the international authority does not have the required technical and financial means—a formula that would betray the concept of the common heritage of mankind. The industrialized countries that already have the means necessary to undertake the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the international zone can demonstrate their willingness to co-operate by placing themselves at the disposal of the authority until it is financially capable of acquiring those means itself.151.	Those were the various agenda items on which my delegation wished to share its thoughts as the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly begins its work. While the Organization can take some pride in the fortunate outcome of some of the burning problems that had been before it recently  'we must note with some bitterness that most of those problems have been solved virtually outside the United Nations. The changes in Portugal and the progress achieved in colonial matters seem to have been less the result of positions we have taken or recommendations we have adopted than the normal outcome of the struggles and sacrifices by the peoples concerned.152.	At the very most  our support -often very timid support- for the liberation movements may have helped to galvanize the energies of the freedom-fighters. Today more than ever before it has become essential that we should pause for thought  should seek the causes of the paralysis and impotence of the Organization in respect of the tragedies confronting mankind. We can no longer wait to see ""the dead bury their dead"" to devote our efforts to seeking solutions common state with the problems with which we are confronted.160.	In the Middle East  war broke out for the fourth time in a single generation. It succeeded in destroying certain myths. It destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the aggressor. It destroyed the myth of the division of the Arab countries. It proved that the Arab countries were fully capable of mobilizing all their potentialities in defense of their just cause. In doing so it threw into relief the far-reaching repercussions and nefarious consequences for all of allowing the situation to fester.161.	Above all  this latest war made possible the consecration on the international level of the existence of the Palestinian people as a people. That is a fundamental element which  from our point of view  happened rather late  but which is at the heart of the problem. There is not and there cannot be any true  just and lasting peace in the region without recognition of the national rights of the people of Palestine. We welcome the decision taken by the Assembly to place the question of Palestine on its agenda with a view to permitting the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] representing the Palestinian people  to make the voice of the Palestinian people heard at last in this body.162.	Today it is no longer a question of doling out subsidies to refugees who are denied their own homeland. It is no longer a question of keeping alive from day to day hundreds and hundreds of thousands of human beings herded into temporary camps. The international community is aware today that those refugees have a land  their homeland  that that land has a name  Palestine  and that they will never give it up.163.	Moreover  some of the territories of certain of our sister countries  Members of the United Nations  are still occupied by Israel as a result of successive aggressions. Egypt  Syria and Jordan cannot tolerate this situation. We reaffirm our active solidarity and assure them of our participation at their side for the liberation and recovery of their territories of all their territories occupied by Israel.164.	I need hardly recall briefly the behavior of Israel. Israel continues to occupy by armed force the territories of States Members of the Organization. It is systematically establishing settlements and it does not hide its intention of definitive occupation. It declares that it has made Jerusalem the new capital of the Zionist State  cynically disregarding the fact that the Holy City is the spiritual center of hundreds of millions of men belonging to the Christian and Moslem world  and not hesitating to mock their religious convictions.165.	It does not hesitate to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another State of the region. Thus it constantly resorts to bombardments by its aircraft and artillery against agglomerations in Lebanon  causing destruction and heavy losses among the populations.166.	It defies all the principles of the Charter  that same Charter it needed to get itself recognized as an entity  and all the resolutions adopted by various organs of the United Nations and the specialized agencies. As far as violations of the Charter are concerned  we can say that the Zionist State has beatenevery record. By its strategy of provocation and terror  Israel demonstrates its contempt for international law and morality by strengthening its challenge to the community of nations and mainly to the Organization.167.	To give but one example  here is the statement made by the representative of Israel before this Assembly on 21 September. If the question of Palestine is included in the agenda of the General Assembly  he said:""Would a single tenet of the Charter remain intact after such a development? Would any sensible human being find it possible to take the United Nations seriously if it were to act in so irresponsible a manner?"" [2236th meeting  para. 30.]168.	I will simply add that the question of Palestine has been included in the agenda without any opposition  except for that of the Israeli representative.169.	The result is that tension continues to prevail in the area and that Israel is deliberately fomenting it. The situation is clearly worsening and is a source of increasing anxiety . Israel seems to have drawn no lesson from the war of last October. It is preparing a new aggression. The disengagement of forces is not peace and cannot be used as a soporific to put the Arab people to sleep. We had thought that it would be the start of the thaw on the road to peace. Yet  by its behavior Israel persists in vitiating all the industrious and indefatigable efforts undertaken by Secretary of State Kissinger and by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  as well as by various other statesmen.170.	As was recently brought to mind by His Majesty Hassan II  the military disengagement agreements should be looked upon as a step towards the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from all occupied Arab territories  including the city of Jerusalem  and the recognition and restoration of the national and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.171.	It behooves the United Nations to adopt all the necessary measures to implement its decisions and to lay the foundation for an over-all solution which would guarantee  the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the area.172.	At a time when international opinion was anxious over the development of the situation in the Middle East and was following with a great deal of interest the efforts undertaken to attempt to find a solution to that situation  the Mediterranean  which was already seriously affected by that problem  found itself once more the scene of a conflict which  by the passions it provoked and the interests involved  could have led to a situation seriously threatening world peace and international security .173.	As a Mediterranean country and therefore one which could hot be indifferent to the future of Cyprus—'Morocco  as early as the proclamation of the Cypriot State  felt that lasting' peace and stability could not be ensured without full respect for the constitutional and international edifice on which was based the independence of a country composed of two communities which history and interests should have united.174.	Consequently  Morocco examined developments on the island very carefully and somewhat anxiously. It had to admit that  in violation of existing agreements  the Turkish community was systematically deprived of its constitutional rights. From being a two-nation State  Cyprus was being transformed into a single-nation State  which some responsible authorities wished openly to restore to Greece some day. That is what nearly happened this summer.175.	The old agreements are now out of date and should be replaced by a new constitutional charter negotiated with the participation and agreement of the representatives of the two communities of the island. Morocco believes that the new status of Cyprus should ensure its independence  its territorial integrity and its neutrality. Morocco feels  moreover  that the Organization has an important part to play   first by helping to solve the island's grave humanitarian problems and also by guaranteeing the agreements reached by the parties concerned. Only thus can peace and concord be achieved and harmony and understanding among the States in the area concerned by this drama.176.	Unfortunately  these are not the only problems which require vigilance and careful attention on the part of the international community  in order to find adequate solutions. Colonialism has for many years been receding throughout the world. We are now witnessing the end of the Portuguese colonial empire. My delegation wants to hail here this great victory of the national liberation movements of Guinea-Bissau  which we have already welcomed here among them  and of Angola and Mozambique. This victory has been acquired thanks to their political maturity  their courage and the great sacrifices which for years the leaders and the people have made for the success of their just cause.177.	My delegation would also like to express its sincere and cordial congratulations to the Portuguese Government  whose realism and perception of the sense of history and of its true and lasting interests have facilitated and allowed such a change. We profoundly rejoice in this new attitude of Portugal because of the ties of friendship and good neighborliness which both of us have always sought to maintain.178.	This development  however positive it may be  must not allow us to forget the tragic state of the people of Zimbabwe and our brothers in Namibia and in South Africa. The Organization must adopt precise and concrete measures which will be more clearly understood by the illegal Ian Smith regime.179.	The segregation in which the people of Zimbabwe live has no equal in the world save that which is inflicted upon our brothers in South Africa. Despite the many resolutions adopted by the United Nations condemning apartheid in that part of the world  not a single gesture has been made by the leaders of Pretoria which would lead us to believe that action has been initiated to put an end to a policy rejected and condemned unanimously by the international community.180.	MoreoVeiy the racist Government of South Africa maintains and accentuates its policy of domination and discrimination in Namibia in total disregard of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.It is fitting to denounce here the strange understanding  even the complicity and the military support received by South Africa from certain Powers  allowing it to continue unrestrainedly an action unreservedly condemned by the Assembly.181.	The Pretoria Government  deliberately disregarding the resolutions of the Organization and of the specialized agencies  remains obdurately adamant. We cannot remain inactive in the face of such a challenge. Energetic measures must be taken to put an end as quickly as possible to the intolerable situation which prevails in Rhodesia  South Africa and Namibia.182.	Decolonization has always held a high place in the debates of the Assembly  and the Moroccan delegation has always considered it to be a question of high priority. It could not have been otherwise for a country which not only has known colonization under its usual form  of occupation by a single foreign Power  but which has also been the victim not only of a division but a real carving up by colonialism: one part was under the protectorate of France; one so-called international zone  Tangier  was under the administration of 13 Powers; another part was under the protectorate of Spain  including a northern zone and a southern zone—Tarfaya  Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro -as well as the enclaves  the zones of Ifni and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla. Although important parts of our national territory have been liberated  it is nevertheless true that vast areas of our country are still occupied by a European colonial Power  namely Spain.183.	On 27 April 1956  the Moroccan-Spanish agreement proclaimed the end of the regime of protectorate and the independence of Morocco  on the basis of the unity and integrity of its territory. It was the end of colonialism  at least on the official level.184.	The northern zone of Morocco was restored. The southern zone  Tarfaya  was restored in 1958 only after lengthy negotiations with Spain and various local confrontations with the occupation troops. The two Saharan provinces of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra were still to be liberated  in addition to the Ifni enclave. As far as these parts of our territory were concerned  which Spain was  committed to restore to us in 1956 similarly to the northern and southern zones  the Government of Madrid sometimes met our request with an obdurate refusal and sometimes with successive and interminable dilatory maneuvers. This attitude meant that it intended to maintain its domination over these parts of our national territory.185.	In various areas of these zones the Moroccan people have resumed the struggle agamst colonial occupation. The armed struggle of Ait Ba Amrane  to cite only one example  against the Spanish troops established at Ifni or at Sakiet El Hamra was proof of the determination of our people to bring about the liberation of their territory. However  the successive governments of His Majesty the King never despaired of seeing Spain display reason and wisdom. It is because of our moderation and also our will to further develop ties of friendship and co-operation with Spain that this question -that of the continued Spanish domination over the western part of Morocco continued to be a problem for 18 years. It is still  today  on the agenda of the Assembly.186. Such are the fundamental facts of this problem  Meanwhile  Algeria and Mauritania  neighboring countries of the Sahara  recovered their national independence  Our territory atone was still being mutilated because of the Spanish occupation. That is when the Moroccan Government  always opting for peaceful means  decided in 1964 to request the inclusion of the question in the provisional agenda of the General Assembly. Since then  and throughout the vicissitudes of our debates  one constant and important fact appeared: for Morocco the decolonization of the two Saharan provinces implied their reintegration into the Moroccan State. All our interventions and declarations are there to bear witness to the facts  The first decision was adopted on 16 October by the Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  This decision refers explicitly to resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960  which constitutes the charter for decolonization. In December IMS  it was the turn of the General Assembly to approve almost unanimously  with only two votes against -those of Spain and Portugal- resolution of paragraph 1 of which reads;""Urgently requests the Government of Spain  as the administering Power  to take immediately all necessary measures for the liberation of the Territories of Ifni and Spanish Sahara from colonial domination and to this end to enter into negotiations on the problems relating to sovereignty presented by these two Territories187. Thus  the General Assembly voted that it was urgent to decolonize the Saharan Territories  But it also called Spain at the same the to start negotiations concerning the problem of sovereignty which was posed by these Territories: the Rio de Oro  Sakiet El Hamar and Ifni. Consequently  there was a problem of sovereignty to be settled by negotiation  which underlines in a very clear manner the specific character of these provinces and the specific process to be applied to part an end to colonial domination. 188. Who was the partner who Spain was called upon to enter negotiations? The Moroccan State  which ever since 1956 has not ceased to claim the restitutions of these zones as an integral part of the territory; the Moroccan Government which took the initiative of putting the question on the agenda of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Of course  the Spanish Government refused and continues to refuse to enter into such negotiations concerning the problems of sovereignty for the particular zones. 189. I quoted resolution 1514 (XV) which constitutes the Charter of United Nations on the problem of decolonization. A few brief clarifications seem necessary in order to put an end to any sort of confusion that may persist  voluntarily or involuntarily. 190. Resolution 1514 (XV) was completed and made explicit on the very next day by resolution 1541 (XV) o 15 December 1960. In the principles approved by the resolution  particularly in Principle VI the General Assembly affirmed: "" A Non-Self-Governing Territory can be said to have reached a full measure of self-government by:(a) Emergence as a sovereign independentState;(b) Free association with an independent State;or(c) Integration with an independent State"".191.	Thus the correct and loyal implementation of the principles of decolonization and self-determination does not necessarily and automatically lead to the status of an independent State. It all depends on the particular situations for each Territory  and particularly on the origins of colonial conquest  and imperialist deals to which some countries fell victim. Such is the case of Morocco  which witnessed its national territory  towards the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth  become a victim to the carving up into several zones of influence  as 1 have just mentioned.192.	Yesterday and today  we ask only for the just and correct implementation of the principle of decolonization  which should lead to the integration of the provinces of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra into the national territory.193.	But let us come back to the other resolutions adopted by the United Nations. From year to year  ever since 1964  the same recommendations have been taken up  with the addition  according to the forms of the debates  of some paragraphs. But all come back to some basic ideas. First of all  Spain is called upon to hasten the process of decolonization. Secondly   it is constantly invited and called upon to adopt all measures which would allow the free and democratic expression of the local populations  which implies putting an end to the police measures and the evacuation of occupation troops. Thirdly  it is called upon and invited to allow the refugees who have been expelled by the Spanish administration to go back to their homes and participate in an eventual local consultation. Fourthly  it is invited and called upon  first of all  to negotiate  and then to proceed to the necessary consultations with Morocco  Mauritania and all the other interested parties  which implies tot like United Nations does not admit that Spain should act alone and unilaterally  which also implies - as was said before- that the decolonization of the two Saharan provinces poses a problem of sovereignty  without which the negotiation and recommended consultation would have no valid Justification. Fifthly  Spain is invited and called upon to allow a mission of the United Nations to ensure that the consultation of the local population will take place In a climate freedom and democracy   and so forth.194. What has been the behavior of the Madrid Government throughout these 10 years? The Spanish Government throughout the years has shown how well fit $an profit to certain confusion  fed by repeated discussions and the multiplicity of motions voted upon. The same idea of his behavior is to !make much play with the principles of decolonization and sel&deteimmationiMiathihe very purpose of maintaining colonial domination over and exploitation of these two jpsMiees. Initially the Spanish Government simply disregarded the substance of the resolutions adopted. It intended  and still intends today  to act alone and according to its own wish. This is a constant factor in Spain's policy. Thus  it has refused all negotiations or consultations concerning the problem of sovereignty posed by these Territories; it has refused to allow the refugees who have been expelled from their homes (numbering 20 000 persons  according to the Spanish press itself) to go back home in order to participate in a possible local  popular consultation; it has refused to allow a mission from the United Nations to go to the area to check the organization of this consultation and to make sure that it takes place in an atmosphere of free expression of views.195.	An array of military  police and administrative arrangements have been set up there: thus the occupation troops today number 70 000 to 80 000  for a population of approximately 45 000 to 50 000. If we assume that in a population of that size only 20 000 to 22 000 are adults in other words  those who can effectively and theoretically participate in a consultation then we note that there are more than three Spanish soldiers for each potential voter. That is how the Spanish Government intends to implement the United Nations resolutions and allow the local population free expression of its wishes.196.	Moreover  once the military and police machinery was strongly entrenched  an assembly  entitled Jema'a  has been purely and simply nominated by the Spanish authorities. It is directly under the authority of the military governor. The so-called Assembly has been authorized by the Spanish Government to speak for the population of the two provinces. It alone has been authorized to express its vision of the future. This has been very clearly stated: it does not accept the principle of decolonization. It wants the Spanish administration to continue for years. Meanwhile a ""statute"" is being worked out for the Sahara  and will be granted by the Spanish Government without  of course  any negotiation or consultation with the United Nations or the States concerned. But as the approval of the United Nations is absolutely necessary for the consecration of this pseudo-decolonization  the Spanish Government deems the time ripe to inform the Secretary-General of its intentions* These consist of defending the people of the Sahara against designs of annexation or expansionism on the part of certain neighbors and to ""guarantee ... the free and authentic expression of their wishes"". That is the significance of the information notes in documents A/9655 and A/9736  transmitted on 11 July 1974 and on 13 September 1974 respectively. Spain goes so far as to promise to give all facilities to the United Nations so that it may participate in the projected process of self-determination. But even at this stage  it is only a promise: it is up to the Spanish Government alone to fix the date for this ""in due course"". 197.	Such mystification seems to be really going too far. The Government of His Majesty the King of Morocco is convinced that the international community cannot endorse the unilateral policy of the Spanish Government. It amounts to creating out of nothing a fictitious entity  with an active population of 22 000 persons in a Territory of 280 000 square kilometers  and an Atlantic coastline stretching for 1 500 km. This fictitious entity is destined to perpetuate the reality of the colonial presence  and the robbing of our country of two provinces which have always been an integral part of our Territory. That is why His Majesty the King was forced to proclaim publicly on 5 July 1974 that the patience and moderation of the Moroccan people have their limits; that our people  who have struggled  weapons in hand  for their independence and the integrity of their territory  can in no way accept a fait accompli in the two provinces which fall under our sovereignty.198.	Thus  the unilateral policy ohthe Spanish Government being thus revealed in its crude reality  and the position of Morocco being what it has always been since 1956  since we were"" admitted to the Organization  the situation seems to be the same as at the outset. We are forced  if we want to safeguard peace in this area  to study this problem once more without questioning the principles of decolonization and self-determination. We must rather give these principles real content  and apply them honestly  with regard for the particular and specific character represented by the liberation of the western Sahara.199.	In seeking to find some justification for its unilateral policy  the Spanish Government claims that the provinces of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra were originally Territories which did not fall under any sovereignty or administration. According to the Spanish Government  at the moment of colonial conquest they were res nullius  or Territories without a master  and that implies that the Spanish Government does not have to negotiate with Morocco for the process of decolonization.200.	As against that attitude  there is the attitude of Morocco  which  based on its historic  legal  ethnic and cultural rights  has always considered those two Territories as being an integral part of the national Territory. That is why the Moroccan Government is determined not to accept the artificial creation on its own territory of any entity whatsoever  particularly a fictitious entity intended to maintain the colonial system.201.	The formulation of these two attitudes allows us to discern clearly the basis of the dispute between Morocco and Spain since 1956. First of all  we must answer the following question: originally  were the two Territories of the Sahara in question  as the Spanish Government claims  res nullius  or Territories without a master  and open to occupation? Or were they at the moment of occupation under the sovereignty and administration of the Moroccan State? Only the answer to that question will make it possible to give real meaning  based on law and reality   to the principles of decolonization and self-determination. This is a prior question which we are all called on to settle  and it is of an exclusively legal character.202.	Using this analysis as a starting point  and anxious to safeguard peace  His Majesty the King has once more chosen the peaceful method of settling the dispute between Morocco and Spain. In his press conference of 17 September 1974 His Majesty Hassan II proposed to submit the case to the International Court of Justice  one of the most important bodies of the United Nations. The Court is competent to proceed to an arbitration between the parties concerned on a purely legal matter. As Members of the United Nations  Morocco and Spain are necessarily parties to the Statute of the Court. Further  it must be added that the Charter of the United Nations lays down  in Article 36  paragraph 3  a general principle making referral to the International Court of Justice mandatory in all cases. That Article states that ""... the Security Council should also take into . consideration that legal disputes should as a general ' rule be referred by the parties to the International Court of Justice"".203. The Government of Morocco sent Spain a note dated 23 September 1974 inviting it to join Morocco in submitting a request in accordance with the rules of procedure of the International Court. If that step  taken by the parties concerned Spain and Morocco-had been adopted  the prospects of a peaceful solution of the problem of the Western Sahara would have become clearer because they would have been based upon law and equity.204.	If for one reason or another that direct method had not been adopted  we would still have requested the Court  not for an arbitrary decision  but simply for an advisory opinion on a simple matter of law. It is for the General Assembly or for the Security Council to request such an opinion  in accordance with Article 96  paragraph 1  of the Charter  and Article 65 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The opinion given by the International Court of Justice on  a point of law can have a considerable effect as a decision of arbitration. In any case the General Assembly would be in a position  on the basis of such opinion  definitively to find a solution to the political question of the future of the two provinces  Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro.205.	That is why my Government has decided  in case the first procedure might not be adopted by the Spanish Government  that it should ask the General Assembly  which is in a position to do so  to seek such an opinion of the International Court of Justice.206.	The dispute which opposes us to Spain has lasted for the past 18 years and it has been on the agenda of the General Assembly for the past 10 years. AH the resolutions and recommendations which have been voted concern the main question: that of knowing whether the two provinces of Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro belong to a certain sovereignty and authority or whether they have been free territories  open to any occupation. My Government is firmly convinced that the members of the Assembly  particularly the peace- and justice-loving peoples  cannot remain indifferent to this last appeal launched by Morocco that international law and morality and the principles of the United Nations should prevail.207. In the same context  may I now make the same appeal more directly to Mauritania  since we know that country is as anxious as we are to safeguard peace in the area and to undertake all measures in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations  so that law and justice may prevail. Morocco and Mauritania are bound by historic  ethnic  economic arid cultural ties and their peoples and leaders are fully conscious of the fact that the fraternal links which tie the two countries and peoples ate harbingers of a future of development for both countries.208. Basing itself on these facts  Morocco declares that Mauritania is concerned in the future of the Sahara and can surely be associated  because of its rights  with the settlement of the disputes between Morocco and Mauritania and Spain. It is in that spirit that I call upon the Government of Mauritania to associate itself with us before the International Court of Justice to obtain the advisory opinion which the Moroccan Government is seeking.209.	My Government hopes to have contributed  as a Member respectful of the Charter of the United Nations  to the clarification of the problem of the liberation of the two provinces of the Sahara and their political future. However  I also owe it to myself to say  in the most courteous yet firm manner possible  that Morocco cannot accept being faced with a fait accompli imposed by the ""Spanish Government. That Government has been acting in such a way as to make final the dismemberment of our national territory and of the two provinces where the Moroccan Government has exercised sovereignty for centuries.210.	By persisting obdurately in a manner which seems to s irresponsible the Spanish Government is endangering the unity and territorial integrity of our country and threatening and jeopardizing the cause of peace and international co-operation. Resolution 1514 (XV) contains the following significant passage:""Any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.""211.	May I say to the Government of Spain that I quote that passage because it has been quoted relevantly by the representative of Spain in the United Nations on the question of the restoration of Gibraltar to Spain. The question of Gibraltar has been defined by the General Assembly as a question of the restoration of the national unity and territorial integrity of Spain and not as a question of self-determination. That is the case so far as we are concerned in the matter of the provinces of Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro  because they have always been an integral part of our national territory  as history  geography  culture and language bear witness and of which proof is given by numerous international treaties. Spain is in a position to understand that what it considered to be unacceptable for Gibraltar cannot be acceptable for the two provinces of the Sahara  and for the same reason.212.	The Spanish Government is in a better position than anyone else to recognize that the proper and loyal interpretation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) rests in the judicious application of the principles of decolonization and respect for the unity and territorial integrity of sovereign States. Our national territory as a whole was the subject of deeds behind its back at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of this century  deeds which led to the carving up of these provinces into various spheres of influence. Those deeds and other ententes cordials between colonial Powers cannot be accepted by us  as is underlined by international law and international morality.213.	Our people have struggled for centuries against foreign penetration  whatever it might be  in order to safeguard their independence and the integrity of our national territory. To give but an historic example  let us recall that the fighting Ma EI Ainine  who came from the provinces of Rio de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra  undertook an armed struggle against the colonial conquerors in those provinces in order to penetrate as far north as Marrakesh in 1908. Is there a more striking historical example of the determination of the Moroccan people to preserve their national unity and territorial integrity?214.	There is a lesson which we have learned from this long struggle  similar to that drawn by other peoples under the colonial yoke: the liberation of peoples is above all accomplished by the peoples themselves."
"79",4510,"MEX",29,1974,"Mr. President  for reasons beyond his control  the Secretary of State for External Relations of my country who would have been very happy to be here publicly to thank you for your hospitable welcome during the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries has been compelled this time to postpone his annual visit to United Nations Headquarters. On that account the honor falls to me to bring the voice of Mexico to the general debate of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In so doing  I should like to start my statement by repeating to you the sincere congratulations of the Government and people of Mexico on the distinction which  with unusual unanimity  you have been honored by all Member States. We interpret this as a well-deserved tribute both to your eminent personal qualities and to the outstanding role which your country  Algeria  has played in the development and strengthening of non-alignment among the countries of the third world.4.	I should likewise pay a tribute of admiration and appreciation to Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who so skilfully and impartially presided over the debates of the twenty-eighth regular session and the sixth special session of the Assembly in a manner which was to the great honor of all the countries of Latin America.5.	Immediately after having discharged such pleasant duties  I am compelled to deal with something that is far from pleasant. I refer to the disaster which recently cast the Republic of Honduras into mourning  a Republic linked to Mexico by so many ties of affection and history. We have grieved at this unexpected catastrophe as though it had been our own  and the highest Mexican authorities  headed by the President of the Republic  have helped by every means within their power to mitigate its tragic effects. However  the scope of the disaster is such as to render imperative the solidarity and co-operative action of the entire international community.6.	We welcome the advent of a new Portugal  whose dedication to the principles of the United Nations and total commitment to the task of decolonization were described from this very rostrum some days ago [2239th meeting] in persuasive and eloquent terms by its Minister for Foreign Affairs.7.	In expressing our boundless welcome to Guinea- Bissau as a Member of the United Nations  the first territory to benefit from the praiseworthy Portuguese policy of liberation and independence  we also wish to voice our confidence that Mozambique  Angola  and Cape Verde will also soon enlarge the ranks of the membership of the Organization of sovereign States  taking it yet another step towards universality.8.	For similar reasons we are pleased to express our most cordial welcome to Bangladesh and to Grenada.9.	It would be impossible to try to review here even an adequate selection of the 110 items or  rather  since a few minutes ago  111 items  on the agenda of this twenty-ninth session  the highest number of items ever submitted to the General Assembly in the annals of the United Nations. Accordingly  I shall limit myself to a synopsis of the essential aspects of my country's position on those items to which we attribute special importance. This general survey will serve as an introduction to the rather more thorough analysis I intend to make of three questions which at this point in history seem to us of fundamental importance: detente  disarmament and the economic rights and duties of States.10.	We deplore the tragic events that provoked the recent crisis in Cyprus  and we wish publicly to express our gratitude and high esteem to the Secretary-General for his valuable and tireless efforts to prevent an aggravation of the conflict and to contribute to its lasting solution. We share his opinion that such a solution is possible only on the basis of formulas that are in keeping with the Charter  that are freely agreed to by the two Cypriot communities  and that take due account of their vital interests and aspirations. Likewise  we agree with the Secretary-General that it is an essential factor in this matter  as in any other matter of this sort  that ""Governments become accustomed to respecting the decisions of the Security Council and to co-operating with the instruments which it may set up"" [A/96011Add. I  sect. VII]which in this case means  above all  strict respect for the ""sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus"". It is equally essential that what are called the peacekeeping operations  which by their very nature must be temporary  should not serve as a pretext ""for slackening the momentum of the search for a settlement of underlying problems"" [ibid.  sect VI].11.	As regards the items on our agenda entitled ""The question of Palestine"" [item 108] and ""The situation in the Middle East"" [item 109]  Mexico's position has been clear and consistent: in keeping with the traditional principles of our foreign policy  we repudiate the use of force in international relations and  accordingly  refuse to concede any validity to the occupation of territories and  a fortiori  any attempt at territorial conquest which implies the necessity of withdrawal from all territories occupied as a result of the 1967 war.12.	We also consider that the parties to the conflict should put an end to the state of warfare and strive to establish a form of coexistence based on respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of all States of the Area. Moreover  we are convinced that there can be no just and lasting peace in the Middle East unless those States take the appropriate measures to guarantee the Palestinian people a future of freedom and dignity.13.	Among the resolutions adopted by the United Nations-on these items I would single out Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  adopted on 22 November 1967 nearly seven years ago which  in our opinion  contains the essential elements for a just solution. Mexico also viewed with satisfaction the adoption by the Security Council  on 22 October last  of resolution 338 (1973)  in which it decided that concurrently with the cease-fire in the last armed conflict  negotiations should start between the parties concerned aimed at establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.14.	We would express the hope that the debates that will be taking place now in the plenary Assembly  to which both items have be.en allocated  will be held in an atmosphere and in a spirit that will facilitate the attainment of substantial progress towards a peaceful solution in accordance with justice and the purposes and principles of the Charter.15.	My country was honored by the recent visit of a mission from the United Nations Council for Namibia. We regard it as a token of appreciation for our active participation in the struggle against colonialism in general  and for our modest but determined contribution to the praiseworthy efforts of that Council  of which Mexico has been a member for two years. We hope that it will go from strength to strength and finally put an end to South Africa's intolerable occupation of Namibia  which is in violation of so many General Assembly and Security Council decisions and has been expressly declared illegal by the highest tribunal  the International Court of Justice.1 Given South Africa's attitude of open defiance of the principal organs of the United Nations  and its repeated failure to comply with basic obligations contracted by Member States under the Charter  it seems to us the duty of the Security Council  a duty that can neither be shirked nor postponed as we stated last week from this very rostrum [2248th meeting] in recalling a suggestion Mexico had made more than five years ago to recommend to the General Assembly  in conformity with Article 5 of the Charter  the immediate suspension of South Africa from the exercise of the rights and privileges inherent in United Nations membership.16.	The results of the World Population Conference held at Bucharest in July and August of this year under United Nations auspices  represent considerable progress on this vital subject. In the World Population Plan of Action that the Conference approved by consensus  the various theses presented were harmonized. This was done in a way essentially in keeping with the basic aspirations of the countries of the third world. It was made quite clear that the framework of international co-operation that was recommended should be one of strict respect for the sovereignty of each country  and it was emphasized that population problems are closely linked to a balanced development  and therefore that their solution will largely depend on what can be done to raise the standard of living of two thirds of mankind.17.	The Government of Mexico  which seeks at all times to align its conduct with international decisions  has already sent to my country's Congress an initiative intended to reform the Mexican Constitution with a view to incorporating in it some of the specific recommendations contained in the Bucharest Plan. One of the provisions to be included in the Constitution in accordance with this initiative states the following:""Man and woman are equal before the law. The law will protect the organization and development of the family. Every person has the right freely to decide  being responsible and informed  on the number and spacing of his or her children.""18.	Another international gathering  which we also consider deserves a positive assessment by this Assembly  is the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which was held at Caracas in July and August of this year. Even though the Conference did not succeed in completing the difficult and complex task entrusted to it this was obvious from the beginning to States called upon to participate in it and thus it will continue its efforts at a second session to be held next year  there is no doubt that important progress was made on some far-reaching aspects.19.	The proposal for a 12-nautical-mile-wide territorial sea to be supplemented by an additional economic zone  for which Mexico has suggested the name of ""Patrimonial Sea""  where in the matter of the exploration and exploitation of all the resources of the sea and of its soil and subsoil thereof  the coastal State would have the same rights that it has in its territorial sea although this would in no way  of course  affect freedom of navigation and overflight has already met with the approval of the vast majority of States.20.	Likewise  the principle that the zone and the re-sources of the sea-bed and the ocean floor and the subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind  and the con-sequent need to establish an international authority that would guarantee an equitable distribution of the resources derived from exploitation of a zone  continued to gain ground in the work done in Venezuela's capital.21.	We venture to hope that the continuation of this task  which will be carried out in Geneva  will make it possible in 1975 to sign an instrument that will find general acceptance and lead to the codification of the many facets of the law of the sea  efforts which in so far as the United Nations is concerned were started in 1958. We believe that this would be to the benefit of properly understood self-interest  as much to the coastal and land-locked countries as to the maritime Powers.22.	Now I shall go on  as I had announced at the beginning  to make some comments on detente  as it is called  between the two principal nuclear Powers commonly known as the ""super-Powers"".23.	Mexico enthusiastically supports the idea of that detente. But  of course  we consider that it should not be viewed as an end to itself but only as a means to consolidate a peace that will guarantee justice and equity for all  a peace that is faithfully and strictly in keeping with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  as these have been defined in the Declaration on Principles of International Law  Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV))  a declaration that was solemnly adopted in the course of the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Organization.24.	Detente must therefore mean a complete break with certain practices of the cold-war era that tended to divide the world into bipolar spheres of influence. It must imply a radical change in attitude such as the one that inspired the title of the well-known work that analyzed the arrogance of power. It must never serve to try to justify violations whether open or concealed  clandestine or shouted to the four winds as a means of intimidation or coercion of the basic principles of self-determination  non-intervention and sovereign equality  which are the cornerstone of organized international existence. Fundamental rules of international law which  like those I have just mentioned  have been expressly recognized and reaffirmed with the active participation of all Members of the United Nations  are not to be capriciously invoked or ignored depending on how they suit the selfish interests of a given State  however powerful it may be. We must say ""thus far and no further"" to all procedures which violate these principles  recalling in this respect what Hugo Grotius said three centuries ago:""Just as the citizen who violates civil law in order to serve the interest of the moment destroys that which is the foundation of the permanent interests of himself and his posterity  so too a people that violates natural law and international law destroys the defenses of its future tranquility.""25.	We are furthermore convinced that for detente to acquire the scope and significance which I venture to believe we would all desire so that it can serve as an effective instrument to strengthen and consolidate international peace and security  it must impress itself on the world by clear and palpable results in two main fields: in disarmament  and in the economic rights and duties of States.26.	With respect to the first of these  detente must not become an instrument to institutionalize the so- called balance of terror by legalizing the maintenance in perpetuity however balanced it may be of a deadly supersaturation in nuclear weapons which entails a potential threat to the very survival of mankind.27.	The modest collateral measures which have been adopted in the course of the last decade apply  in the main only to zones in outer space or the ocean depths  or are intended to eliminate weapons such as the biological weapons which  for reasons of self-preservation  nobody would have dared to use. Such measures should not lead us to forget the nightmarish situation now existing. No attempt should be made to use them as a smokescreen concealing the constant increase in the destructive power of nuclear arsenals  which for more than Ave years has been estimated as representing between 15 and 30 tons of dynamite for every person on the face of the earth. Nor should such measures make us lose sight of the fact that world military expenditures for the present year are estimated at the astronomical sum of $220 000 million  of which approximately $160 000 million is accounted for by the two super-Powers alone. Finally  we should not lose sight of the terrible discoveries which we learn about every day regarding new possible apocalyptic effects of a nuclear conflagration  such as those which were made public last month in statements made by one of the most authoritative sources in the United States  according to which a nuclear war could destroy the layer of ozone in the stratosphere which makes life on our planet possible by protecting it from the ultraviolet rays of the sun.28.	The many items on disarmament included in the agenda of this session of the Assembly offer the nuclear Powers  and in particular the super-Powers  broad scope in proving that detente can really bring about fruitful results. It would be fitting  for example  to restore general and complete disarmament under effective international control to its proper place as the final goal towards which all negotiations on this subject should be directed. The United States and the Soviet Union would render a valuable contribution to that end by bringing up to date the drafts they submitted to the Disarmament Committee more than 12 years ago  or by presenting new proposals.29.	The nuclear test held on 18 May this year by a State not listed among those that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex] defines as nuclear-weapon States has emphasized the urgent need  for the nuclear States Parties to the Treaty  if they wish to prevent horizontal proliferation  to comply without delay with the commitments they entered into concerning vertical proliferation.30.	Compliance with these commitments would principally mean that the two nuclear super-Powers would put an end without further delay to underground nuclear tests  by means of a permanent agreement  or through unilateral or negotiated moratoria  as the General Assembly has requested in so many of its resolutions.31.	Such compliance would also require that the armaments race should cease and that nuclear dis-armament should be carried out in accordance with the specific requirements of article VI of the Treaty. Appropriate methods of starting to implement those provisions have been repeatedly put forward by the General Assembly when it emphasized the urgent need for the super-Powers to reach an agreement on ""important qualitative limitations and substantial reductions of their strategic nuclear-weapons systems as a positive step towards nuclear disarmament"".32.	The fact that the agenda for this session includes items relating to the establishment of three separate nuclear-free zones [items 30  31 and 101] one in Latin America  which covers a territory of more than eight million square kilometers with a population of approximately 150 million inhabitants  and the other two proposed zones respectively for the Middle East and southern Asia is in itself most significant. It is a clear indication of the position of those States which do not possess these terrible instruments of mass destruction.33.	Because of the reluctance of the nuclear Powers to adopt effective disarmament measures  non-aligned States seem to be prepared to resort to procedures similar to those which apply in the case of an epidemic: to seek gradually to broaden the zones of the world in which nuclear weapons are prohibited for all time so that the territories of the nuclear Powers will constitute something like contaminated islands  subject to quarantine.34.	The nuclear Powers could there make again a contribution to the strengthening of detente. The Soviet Union  the only one not to have done so of the five nuclear Powers to which the General Assembly has addressed so many appeals  can do so by signing and ratifying Additional Protocol II to the Treaty of Tlatelolco the United States and France can do so by signing and ratifying Additional Protocol I to that Treaty  to which the United Kingdom and the Nether-lands are already parties; and all of the nuclear Powers can do so by offering their unreserved co-operation so that the two proposals submitted to the GeneralAssembly will become a reality  like the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace adopted three years ago [resolution 2832 (XXVI)].35.	This year the General Assembly will also have to deal with the report to be prepared by the Secretary- General  with the assistance of expert consultants  on the reduction of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council and of other States with major economic and military potential. The report was requested by the General Assembly in resolution 3093 B (XXVIII)  in connexion with which the delegation of Mexico had the privilege of taking the initiative. Consideration of that report  which we are sure will contain a well-documented and objective study of the subject  will provide yet another occasion for all States  in particular the nuclear Powers  to demonstrate by deeds their political will to assist in achieving disarmament. That is all the more desirable since the Assembly proposed in paragraph 1 of its resolution something which would constitute an invaluable contribution towards alleviating the economic crisis which afflicts the world  that is to say  ""the utilization of a part of the funds thus saved to provide international assistance to developing countries"".36.	Lastly  the preparation and convening of a world disarmament conference which would be open to all States  a question which the Assembly has been studying since 1971 and in regard to which it has repeatedly expressed the conviction that it would promote and facilitate the adoption of effective disarmament measures  in particular measures of nuclear disarmament  is something which undoubtedly could give us conclusive proof of a real will for international detente. In that connexion  it is mainly China and the United States which will have to overcome the reluctance they have shown hitherto and offer their co-operation  as we have repeatedly asked them to do.37.	The other field  also very broad in scope  in which  as I have already pointed out  detente should be felt tangibly so as to win credibility among all the peoples of the third world  is that of establishing a new international economic order which would become a reality within a system that includes an instrument defining the economic rights and duties of States.38.	We are undoubtedly at a decisive moment in the destiny of man. It is urgent that the detente among the great Powers should' contribute to &n objective interpretation of the origins of the crisis which threatens the world.39.	The energy problem  which has recently become particularly acute  is doubtless analogous to  though of infinitely smaller proportions  that which the developing countries who are producers of raw materials have been feeling in reverse. Those countries have for decades been the victims of systematic and growing impoverishment because of the imposition of unfair terms of trade amounting to thousands of millions of dollars. However  since in the present case the most highly developed countries are also affected by the so- called energy crisis  the latter  along with its harmful consequences  may have a beneficial result that of inflicting a shock similar to the shock treatment some-times used in the medical treatment of psychiatric ailments.40.	In fact  the industrial Powers  which could view with equanimity and  why not say it  with the ill-con-cealed complacency of their gigantic importing companies  the collapse in the price of coffee  sugar  cocoa  iron  tin and oil itself  are today experiencing the same effects as those so often felt by the developing countries. We hope that this shock will open their eyes to the urgent need for just and equitable terms of trade between the raw materials which constitute the main source of income of the third world countries and the technology and industrial and agricultural machinery which  in effect  are the virtual monopoly of the developed countries.41.	If we consider the question of energy in that perspective  and even within the broadest framework of trade relations of which it is a part  it must be concluded at least this is our fervent hope that  as in the case of various other developments of similar gravity  both are but inseparable symptoms of the profound maladjustments in the international economy. Inflation  food shortages  the tragic possibilities of unemployment  the absence of an orderly monetary system  problems of population  pollution of the human environment and the relative depletion of natural resources are reasons for grave concern for any observer of the contemporary scene.42.	Mexico maintains that  taken in isolation  none of these phenomena is controllable. They make sense only within a global context that at one and the same time encompasses and conditions them. What we must transform is the system itself of international co-existence  not the individual contradictions to which it gives rise. It is an age-old stratification of relationships based on domination that maintains the world of abundance and enlarges the boundaries of the world of poverty. Consequently  it is a question of finding basic answers  new structures capable of subordinating the irrational forces of history to the demands of security  well-being and the survival of the human race. The necessity can no longer be postponed for discovering a real remedy for the alarming situation that confronts the world  instead of resorting to mere palliatives that produce illusory and transient effects.43.	When at the end of the first United Nations Development Decade we realized that hundreds of millions of men  women and children not only were suffering poverty but were still fighting to live in the degrading anguish of poverty  it became obvious  indeed axiomatic  that the international system of exploitation unrestrained by any ethical controls and having as its only incentive the selfish gain of a consumer society  was powerless to solve the problems resulting from growth.44.	At the same time  we learned that  during the first Development Decade  gross world production had risen to $1 100 000 million. But we also learned that only 6 per cent of that fantastic sum applied to countries having 60 per cent of the world's population  with a per capita income averaging $200 or less. On the other hand  80 per cent of that incredible increase had gone to countries with populations barely amounting to one fourth of the world's population  countries that furthermore enjoyed a per capita income of more than $1 000.45.	It was no doubt because of reasons and facts such as those I have just cited that the President of Mexico  Luis Echeverria Alvarez  was moved to pro-pose  at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  the drafting and adoption of a Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  to serve as an instrument which  through mandatory rules of economic conduct  will encourage the development of a framework of co-operation for balanced development. On that occasion  19 April 1972  the Mexican Head of State spoke words which  in the light of what has since occurred  have today acquired a prophetic sense. It therefore seems to me timely to recall them:""The solidarity that we are calling for is a condition for survival . . .""The task to be carried out is one for the present generation; there is no alternative of postponement. We are at the threshold of a structural change in human society that can be brought about only if all nations work together to achieve it.""If the experience of the decade now ending is repeated in the coming decade  perhaps nothing further can be done to prevent an irreparable deterioration in the relations of the third world with the great industrial nations.""No balance can be based upon a lack of common consent among the greater part of the world's in-habitants. Our peoples are aware that their poverty produces wealth for others. The hatred accumulated against political colonialism is now rising anew against economic colonialism.""To construct an economy for peace is  at this hour  the primary duty of the international community. On the other hand  a refusal to co-operate in reducing the disparities among peoples means preventing the principles of the United Nations from acquiring any real content.""46.	To build an economy for peace  an economy from which all nations may benefit equally is the primary objective of the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States which  as is well known  the Working Group established by UNCTAD in 1972 and entrusted by the United Nations with the task of working out the text of the final draft  has been carefully preparing since February 1973. The General Assembly  in the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] after emphasizing the necessity and urgency of establishing that new order  proclaimed a matter of vital importance that the Charter should be approved at the present session.47.	It is our hope that it will be so and that the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  the first step in the work of codifying and developing the subject  will constitute  as the Assembly itself affirms in the Program of Action to which I have referred  ""an effective instrument towards the establishment of a new system of international economic relations based on equity  sovereign equality and interdependence of the interests of developed and developing countries"".48.	The conflicting speeches we have heard in this Hall during the past two weeks and the terrifying facts reported in the course of the deliberations of the joint meeting of the World Bank and IMF which has just ended in Washington  in which the turbulence of the world economy and the sombre outlook for all countries were endlessly referred to  while at the same time it was affirmed with undeniable authority that hundreds of millions of inhabitants of the third world would die of hunger unless the industrialized nations immediately came to their aid all these facts make clear that we can no longer postpone using co-operation as the antidote to a possible confrontation  so that the concept of interdependence tempered to accord with equity and the sovereign equality of States mentioned in the Program of Action I have referred to may acquire its full force  and to contribute to this we should without delay adopt the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. We hope that the General Assembly will interpret the facts in this way and that it will prove equal to the responsibilities that the present historic moment brings."
"80",4605,"MLI",29,1974,"Mr. President  I should like  first of all  to tell you how justly proud my delegation is to see one of the valiant sons of Africa and the third world presiding over the work of the Assembly's twenty-ninth session.40.	Our continent is of course honored by your election  but my country  Mali  takes particular satisfaction in participating in the international consecration of the former Commander Si Abdel-kader El Mali  that intrepid fighter who won those glorious titles on the Algerian-Malian frontiers in the heat of the liberation struggle of his country.41.	Mali  which at that time still had only internal autonomy  was already committed to Algeria's struggle. That prestigious nom de guerre ""El Mali""  which your comrades-in-arms borrowed from my country and gave you  awakens deep memories in us.42.	In other words  Mr. President  for the people of Mali  among whom you so worthily represented the National Liberation Front  you have remained our brother and friend  an ardent patriot.43.	Your past as a fighter  your eminent qualities as a statesman and your brilliant political career predestined you for these lofty functions  there can be no doubt that you will be able to give our work the same mark of faith and dynamism that characterizes the foreign policy of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  with which Mali enjoys solid relations of friendship and solidarity forged throughout centuries of common history and life.44.	In offering to you  through me  its warm and fraternal congratulations  my delegation wishes also to take this opportunity to express its sincere thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  on the remarkable way in which  with so much competence  he conducted the proceedings of the twenty- eighth session and the sixth special session  which was devoted to the problems of raw materials and development.45.	We wish also to congratulate the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has spared no effort in fulfilling as satisfactorily as possible the extremely heavy and difficult task that we have entrusted to him.46.	We should like to associate ourselves with the many messages of sympathy that have been addressed to the delegation of Honduras  a country which has been ravaged by a terrible hurricane. We extend our friendly sympathy to the people of Honduras and its Government  and we express our deep condolences to the Honduran nation and the bereaved families.47.	The admission to the United Nations at this session of the fraternal States of Guinea-Bissau  Bangladesh and Grenada is an important milestone on the difficult path to the universality of the Organization. My delegation extends its fraternal congratulations to the representatives of those new States and wishes their people much success in the difficult tasks of national construction awaiting them. The admission of each of those three States is in itself a historic event of great significance.48.	For-the People's Republic of Bangladesh  it represents the crowning of long and patient efforts undertaken  with the assistance of the international community  by Pakistan  India and Bangladesh itself to put an end to the painful crisis that had torn the Indian sub-continent apart in 1971. In this respect  we cannot pass over in silence the historic Simla Agreement of 1972  on bilateral relations between India and Pakistan  which laid the foundations for that settlement.49.	For Grenada  admission to the United Nations has put an end to more than 200 years of colonization in that West Indian island.50.	For the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  this extremely happy event is both a fruition and a beginning. It is a fruition because this 138th Member of the Organization has thus been given international recognition after so many years of heroic struggle under the banner of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [.PAIGC]. It is a beginning because the process of decolonization begun by the new Portugal has only just got under way. We would therefore express the hope that that process will be pursued so that the representatives of peoples still under Portuguese colonial administration who are engaged in the same kind of liberation struggle will very soon be able to take their places among us here.51.	We cannot talk of the independence of Guinea- Bissau without paying a warm tribute to all the freedom fighters  to the martyrs of the PAIGC and the glorious action of its leader  Amilcar Cabral  that outstanding figure of fighting Africa who fell on the field of honor.52.	Last year  after having set forth at the twenty- eighth session the views of my Government on the international situation and having defined its position with regard to the problems of survival facing our society  I concluded my statement by saying that ""we have no choice but to work jointly for the coming into being of a new international order based on justice and equity."" [2145th meeting  para. 145.] Such a choice requires from us  above ail  courage and political will to discharge fully our responsibilities before history. It cannot  therefore  be reconciled with bad compromises and inconsistent agreements which only skim over the surface of the vital problems of our times. Nor can it be reconciled with colonialism  racism and apartheid  which are still rife in the world.53.	In spite of certain developments in the field of decolonization in the territories under Portuguese administration  since the coup d'etat which  in Lisbon  on 25 April 1974  overthrew the Fascist regime of Caetano  the spiritual heir of the dictator Salazar  millions of people still remain deprived of their freedom. And while we welcome the agreements concluded on 7 September 1974  at Lusaka  between the Frente de Liberta$ao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] and the Portuguese Government  we are nevertheless apprehensive about the future of Angola and the other territories under Portuguese administration  because of the unsuccessful coup of.the white extremists in Mozambique and the most recent crisis which erupted within the new regime in Lisbon. Those events should  in our view  prompt the Portuguese Government to act more quickly and firmly in carrying out its program of decolonization and to apply the agreements already concluded or about to be concluded with the liberation movements recognized by the Organization of African Unity [OAU].54.	The State of Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands must  without further delay  recover its national unity and territorial integrity.55.	The United Nations  for its part  must remain vigilant and assume its responsibilities vis-a-vis the peoples of the territories under Portuguese administration. It cannot recover from a further affront of the kind inflicted on it by the rebel Ian Smith regime.56.	While decolonization has made some progress in the territories under Portuguese administration  we cannot say as much for the rest of Africa. Indeed  apart from the undertaking of the French Government to give independence to the Comoro Archipelago in 1975  with respect for its territorial integrity  we have seen no encouraging sign for the other territories under colonial domination.57.	We will venture to hope that  in their awareness of the irreversibility of the course of history  the other colonial Powers will emerge from their immobility and  in accordance with the provisions in the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries arid Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]  will promote the decolonization of the last remaining territories under their domination.58.	This is the place to make an urgent appeal to Spain to put into effect as soon as possible  and in consultation with the sister States of Mauritania  Morocco and Algeria  the relevant resolutions adopted by the various bodies of the United Nations on Spanish Sahara.59.	On the question of the Comoro Archipelago  we have no doubt that the French Government will associate itself fully  in the consultations which are to lead to the independence of the Territory  with the Mouvement de liberation nationale des Comores [MOL1NACO] and with all the political exiles of the country  in accordance with the recommendations in the decision adopted by the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples on 6 September 1974.60.	With respect to Southern Rhodesia  the white usurpers continue to defy the United Nations  with the complicity cf the administering Power. The people of Zimbabwe  who in 1972 rejected the Anglo-Rhodesian proposals for a settlement  once again demonstrated its standing as a great people by refusing this year to lend itself to the electoral masquerade which was organized on 30 July by the Salisbury rebels.61.	The repugnant and criminal theory of racial superiority has been reflected in Southern Rhodesia in the deprivation of the political and civic rights of the black majority  the proliferation of homelands  which are nothing but concentration camps  and the recrudescence of political assassinations. The manhunt organized against the inhabitants of Musiwa last February  and the ensuing summary and public execution of the leaders of that village give us  if there is any need for it  some idea of the sufferings the people of Zimbabwe have endured for more than 10 years.62.	The United Kingdom bears responsibility for this and should follow the example of Portugal  which  although it did not enjoy the same degree of military or economic power  nevertheless succeeded  early in September  in crushing the revolt of the white extremists in Mozambique and in establishing law and order.63.	The United Nations has tried in vain to exert pressure against the rebel Salisbury regime. The most recent to date  that is to say the economic sanctions decreed by the Security Council  were breached by some of its most influential members. For our part  we have in any case never believed in the virtues of those sanctions.64.	The Assembly should learn the proper lessons from this and prevail upon the administering Power to discharge all its responsibilities towards the Zimbabwe people  in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and the resolutions adopted on the question.65.	Although primary responsibility for the Rhodesian crisis falls to the United Kingdom  as the ad-ministering Power  responsibility for Namibia  on the other hand  a territory under the trusteeship of the international community  lies entirely with the United Nations. Unfortunately  the United Nations finds its actions thwarted by the allies of South Africa  that is to say the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] Powers.66.	The racist regime in Pretoria has naturally taken advantage of this situation to extend its authority to that territory and install and reinforce there its odious policy of racial segregation. Patriots are persecuted  citizens relegated to homelands  while the white settlers who have come from South Africa and the representatives of foreign interests are engagingin a systematic plunder of the country's resources.67.	The Secretary-General himself recognized this in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  when he says: ""It is with regret that I report that there has been no improvement in the internal situation in Southern Rhodesia  while in Namibia conditions continue to deteriorate."" [A196011 Add.  sect. IX.J68.	The appointment  in December 1973  of the United Nations Commissioner for Namibia has not brought us any closer to a settlement of the question  except for the attempts at dialog which had previously been made by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative. The Organization must get out of its rut and assume with more determination its proper responsibilities in Namibia  the very responsibilities derived for it from the Charter and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the question.369.	The panorama of white power in southern Africa would not be complete if we did not give some account of the repugnant policy of apartheid which over-shadows and casts opprobrium on the regime of Pretoria. This Power  which has been placed in the dock by the international community for more than a quarter of a century  has recently been associated with an influential member of the Security Council in carrying out military maneuvers in the Indian Ocean. This is the same Power that some members of the Security Council  heedless of the appeals of the international community  are enthusiastically arming against the defenseless populations of Azania  with the secret ambition of turning that country into a bulwark of their wars of colonial reconquest. 70.	It is for all those reasons that the Assembly  by its resolution 3207 (XXIX)  wisely rejected the credentials of the representatives of the racist regime of Pretoria and called upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa in the light of the constant violation by South Africa of the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.71.	The conflagration ignited in southern Africa by the partisans of racism will not  of course  consume that part of the world alone  for the events in the Middle East have dismissed the very carefully thought out theories on the localization of conflicts. Indeed  the world found itself last October on the brink of world war because it allowed injustices and acts of gratuitous provocation to pile up over the years in the Middle East. Instead of trying to bring about a general settlement of the Middle East crisis  we have  since 1967  been content with provisional solutions which  far from creating the essential conditions for lasting peace in that part of the world  have led to a situation of stagnation: neither war nor peace.72.	We needed to await the Israeli-Arab confrontation of October 1973  and the fears to which it gave rise  in order to make some progress towards a final settlement. Apart from the opening of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East this year  other developments included the signing by Egypt and Israel on 18 January and by Israel and Syria on 31 May of agreements on disengagement of forces. A few rays of hope have thus emerged  but they have been rapidly stamped out because of the expansionist designs of Israel  which continues to occupy Arab territories and to deprive the Palestinian people of its homeland.73.	The just and lasting peace the international community would like to see established in the Middle East cannot come about until all the Arab territories have been evacuated by Israel and until the national fundamental rights of the martyred people of Palestine have been restored.74.	The Palestinian problem is not one which presents itself in humanitarian terms  which is how it has been represented for more than 30 years now  but rather in political terms  because it relates to the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination.75.	No definitive solution can be found for the Israeli-Arab crisis without the effective participation of the Palestinian people in the search for that solution. The Palestinian problem  as we see it  is at the very heart of the Middle East tragedy. The delegation of my country has had occasion to make that point in all the international bodies that have dealt with the question from 1967 until this very day. That is why my country takes pleasure in today seeing the General Assembly sharing its views and finally-embarking upon the course that should lead to the final settlement of the Middle East crisis. The inclusion in the agenda of this session of the question of Palestine [item 108] should be understood in that sense.76.	This year  the Mediterranean  at another of its nerve centers  the island of Cyprus  has been the scene of distressing events. We have followed very closely and with great concern the development of that crisis  because Cyprus and Mali both belong to the third world and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.77.	The Cypriot State  composed of two communities of Greek and Turkish origin  respectively  has ceaselessly struggled to reaffirm its national independence and identity. The fragile equilibrium that had been maintained with the support of the United Nations was abruptly broken by the coup d'etat of 15 July  fomented by imperialism -a coup d'etat which entailed unutterable suffering for the Cypriot people.78.	Through those developments  the crisis called into question the very existence of Cyprus as an independent State. It must therefore be the task of the Organization  which has the question before it  to work above all for the safeguarding of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of that Member State. It must require and obtain the withdrawal of all foreign troop stationed on the island of Cyprus. Any attempt to solve the crisis which fails to take account of those fundamental facts is doomed to failure.79.	Although  in the last year  the Organization has had to its credit the settlement of the grave crisis in the Indian sub-continent and the bringing about in Laos of national concord  it is nevertheless a fact that the picture in Asia is very dark indeed.80.	While the war in South Viet Nam and Cambodia continues with disturbing ferocity  foreign intervention continues to maintain the Korean crisis  with everything that implies as a threat to peace.81.	In spite of the efforts of the Provisional Revolutionary Government  the hopes born of the conclusion  in 1973  of the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam vanished as a consequence of the repeated violations by the Saigon administration and its imperialist masters. The International Commission of Control and Supervision has in fact been paralyzed.82.	In its diversionary attempts  the Thieu regime is multiplying its provocative acts against the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam  is violating its airspace and exerting pressure along its frontiers.83.	In Cambodia  the Lon Nol regime has  for more than a year  been kept inside its capital by the patriotic forces of the Royal Government of National Union  which controls the whole country  apart from a few pockets.84.	In Phnom Penh itself  in spite of an infernal machine of repression elaborated by the regime  the opposition is maintaining a climate of constant agitation while the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk  organizes the administrative  political and economic life of the liberated regions.85.	In Korea  where the General Assembly's dis-solution  last year  of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea [UNCURK] was welcomed as a first step towards normalization of the situation  the people are finding it harder and harder to tolerate the presence of foreign troops on the demarcation line.86.	The consensus on the Korean question  adopted by the General Assembly on 28 November 1973 6 far from having encouraged the Seoul authorities to resume negotiations with the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  has  rather  encouraged them to adopt a negative attitude. 87.	In Seoul  there is total insecurity. The administration resorts to repression in order to stifle the voice of the people  which is being raised to call for the departure of foreign troops and the independent reunification of the country.88.	The puppet regimes established by imperialism in Saigon  Phnom Penh and Seoul constitute  as we can see  the main obstacles to the return of peace in Asia  and that is why they have been rejected by the peoples of Viet Nam  Cambodia and Korea. They owe their survival solely to the vast material and human resources imperialism uses in their countries to protect its interests in Asia.89.	It is certainly worth recalling that the covetousness aroused by the vast potential of the Gulf of Tonkin was behind the launching of the second Indochina war  which is still going on.90.	The Organization cannot continue to identify itself with those regimes without renouncing its primary mission. It is therefore high time for it to meet the aspirations of the peoples of South-East Asia  which have not known the joys of peace for more than a quarter of a century  by calling on the Thieu Ad-ministration correctly to apply the Paris Agreement  by restoring to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia its legitimate rights in that country  and by withdrawing foreign troops stationed in Korea under the flag of the United Nations.91.	By leaving to the parties the task of settling their dispute free from foreign interference  we should at the same time be promoting a resumption of the peace process that was blocked in that region by traitors to their country  manipulated by imperialism.92.	Certain statements made in the course of the twenty-eighth session suggested that real progress would be realized in 1974 in the field of disarmament. In fact  one year after those proclamations  we are obliged to note that no substantial agreement on disarmament has been concluded and that  in fact  the arms race has intensified  the club of nuclear Powers has expanded and the rate of research on and development of nuclear weapons has accelerated. The two major Powers have passed from the second-generation nuclear arms  that is  the remote-controlled multiple-warhead missiles (MIRV)  to the third generation  the ""Tridents"" (MARV)   which are capable of evading the anti-missile missiles. More than $200 000 million is swallowed up every year in the arms race  to the detriment of development. In .such an atmosphere of unbridled competition  and given the mutual outbidding of those States  the efforts of the international community to achieve general and complete disarmament can only be in vain. Intensive armament still seems to be the only guarantee of the security of States.93.	There is no doubt that this is where we find increasingly emerging the selfishness and vanity of man  when we realize that just one quarter of the sum of money spent every year on such arms and missiles could save more than 1 000 million human beings from poverty  hunger and disease. My delegation will go into detail on this distressing problem when the time comes. At this stage  we should simply like to express our total support for the proposals on the denuclearization of the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent proposed by the delegations of Iran and Egypt [AI9693 and Add.l to 3] and of Pakistan [419706]  respectively.94.	The discovery of the immense resources of the sea is opening up new prospects for our development provided  of course  that this matter of the seas and the oceans can also somehow be removed from the sterile interplay of struggles for influence and policies of domination.95.	Although it did not live up to the expectations of the developing countries  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Caracas  nevertheless made it possible for the international community to clarify its positions on the major questions debated there.96.	The Government of the Republic of Mali would like  for its part  to reaffirm its attachment to the OAU Declaration on the Law of the Sea with regard to the exploitation of marine resources by land-locked countries  the right of transit and of free access of those countries to and from the sea  and the establishment of appropriate international machinery for the exploitation of the resources of the high seas.97.	We would venture to hope that  at the next session of the Conference  in Geneva  the political will to negotiate and to arrive at final agreements on the exploitation of the sea's resources for development purposes will be manifested.98.	Although there has been some progress towards detente on the European continent and beyond  particularly with the holding of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and the beginning of a European-Arab dialog  we cannot but recognize that a certain separation of States according to their economic power is now apparent between the northern and southern hemispheres -that is  between developed and developing countries.99.	Furthermore  the rich have been continuing to get richer  and the poor to get poorer. The affluent world  concentrating exclusively on its interests and trembling for them  has given voice to indignation and has uttered thinly veiled threats in the face of the rise in petroleum prices. 100.	While the deterioration of the economic situation which is being deplored today goes back a long way into history  it did not hold the attention of certain affluent countries as long as it was the third world that was bearing all the costs.101.	The developing countries  however  harbor no illusions  knowing as they do that the struggle of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to affirm the permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources is also their own.102.	The attempts made by certain Powers in their bitterness are doomed to failure.103.	The subtle theory of a ""fourth world"" or a ""quarter world"" invented by those same Powers in an effort to create a conflict of interests within the third world by trying to arouse the indignation of the least advanced among the developing countries is also bound to collapse.104.	In the current confrontation  the third world countries - which are the mayor exporters of raw materials -will close ranks around OPEC  because they are quite aware that the outcome of this trial of strength will decide the future of international economic relations.105.	Today  the offensive is directed against the oil producers. Tomorrow it may be directed against the producers of copper  bauxite  sugar  uranium or coffee.106.	The energy crisis thus calls into question the whole edifice of the present economic order.107.	The sixth special session  devoted to the problems of raw materials and development  after having highlighted the absence of an overall plan to integrate the economies of the developing countries within a coherent world-wide system of production and trade  adopted two documents of vital importance: the Declaration and the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI) and 3202 (S-VI)].108.	That Declaration and Program of Action not only make an exhaustive analysis of the world economic situation but also indicate all the measures that should be undertaken in order to build a new international economic order.109.	What we have to do now is to work for the total implementation of the recommendations made at that special session. Only thus will we be able to contribute to the preservation and maintenance of international peace and security.110.	The year 1974 has been a trying one for the people of Mali because of the persistence of a drought which has beset the Sudano-Sahelian region for nearly seven years. Thanks to international solidarity and my Government's perfect organization of assistance  the worst has been avoided.111.	My delegation feels duty bound  therefore  to thank warmly the United Nations and its specialized agencies  friendly States and all donors  public and private  that have rendered their assistance to us in our struggle to limit the effects of this terrible catastrophe.112.	While we are about to attain this first objective  it is no less true that the problem itself remains  because the phenomenon is becoming chronic. That is why the last meeting of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  held at Ouagadougou  in Upper Volta  with the participation of representatives of international organizations and other sources of financing  worked out a medium-term and long-term integrated economic development plan that would make it possible finally to eradicate this evil. Inasmuch as the necessary funds for the implementation of that plan are well beyond our means  the delegation of Mali would like to associate itself with the other States of the region in issuing an urgent appeal to the international community to take part in our crusade against drought  that challenge of nature which threatens the very existence of more than 30 million people in the Sudano-Sahelian region.113.	We await with great interest the holding  next November in Rome  under the aegis of the United Nations  of the World Food Conference. We hope it will do everything it can to find final solutions for the distressing problem of hunger in the world.114.	As the survey of the international situation I have just undertaken has shown  the world is at a crossroads: while the old order based on imperial rights is disappearing  a new era of justice and effective solidarity can be glimpsed on the horizon. This historic turning-point may mark either the breaking apart or the meeting of the two hemispheres.115.	Although it is always difficult to give up centuries-old privileges  we have no doubt that all sides will appreciate the danger of disintegration that threatens us and will opt for the second alternative that of building a new international order in which problems will be viewed in a world context  as was recommended to us at the historic sixth special session of the Assembly. In so doing  we would be coming close to fulfilling one of the fundamental purposes of the Charter. My delegation would venture to hope that this twenty-ninth session will take a very big step in that direction."
"81",4648,"MLT",29,1974,"Mr. President  may I  first of all  be permitted to extend to Mr. Abdelaziz BoUteflika the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Malta on his unanimous election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. As the representative of a country with which Malta shares not only the influences and concerns deriving from our common Mediterranean heritage  but also the principles and ideals of non-alignment  my delegation is doubly happy to see Mr. Bouteflika presiding over our deliberations during the current session.179.	I should also wish to express the appreciation of my delegation for the admirable manner in which Leopoldo Benites conducted the business of the Assembly during the past year.180.	It is likewise with the greatest pleasure that I avail myself of this opportunity to welcome the presence amongst us of the representatives of the three States  Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau  whose recent accession to membership in the Organization has brought the goal of universality so much nearer.181.	At a time when the value of the United Nations is being questioned in certain quarters  it is a source of encouragement that new Members should still be found knocking on the doors of the Organization. But as the Organization becomes more universal  the question inevitably arises whether it is also becoming more effective. As the Secretary-General remarked in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization last year:""the United Nations would be a far more effective Organization if Member States developed the habit of consistently responding to and respecting the decisions and findings of the main organs; if  rather than using the United Nations to promote short- term national interests  they would pursue long- term international aims and provide leadership in the pursuit of those aims; and if there was a general recognition  in deeds as well as in words  that present conditions of life on our planet demand much more of international co-operation than the mere protection of national interests.""182.	These are indeed challenging words whose timeliness remains undimmed  and I am sure that none here would contest the Secretary-General's conclusion repeated again in this year's introduction to his annual report [Al9601lAdd.i  sect. I] that on the international community's ability to rise to this challenge the future survival of mankind may very well depend.183.	Fortunately  there are encouraging signs that this of repeated warning is not being entirely unheeded. The spirit of detente between the great Powers appears to have acquired a certain dynamic momentum  and although we share some of the misgivings of those who fear that an undue reliance on bilateral  or even regional  negotiations in such fundamental areas as disarmament and the search for a genuine peace and security might tend to relegate the United Nations to the role of a bystander  we cannot but welcome the important contribution towards relaxing international tensions that several bilateral initiatives  notably involving the great Powers  have made in recent times. As with the positive results achieved in negotiating disengagement and withdrawal from Arab lands in the Middle East  such bilateral initiatives can* be most effective when they complement  not supplant  the efforts of multilateral diplomacy. As the Secretary- General reminds us elsewhere in the introduction to the report on the work of the Organization:""If the beneficial effects of detente are to extend to conflict situations not involving in the first instance the nuclear Powers  the multilateral diplomacy of the United Nations will have to be more strongly supported and resorted to at an earlier stage."" [Ibid.  sect. II.]184.	Writing on the same theme last year  the Secretary-General similarly emphasized the complementary nature of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy  and observed that ""there is no single road to peace we must try them all"".5185.	It is in this spirit that my Government has actively participated in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe since its inception. Although regional in its composition there is no need to stress the global implications of this historic Conference. Europe  both the source and inspiration of so much that is positive in today's world  was also responsible for centuries of colonial oppression  and within the span of a single generation has inflicted upon the world the horror of two world wars. The search for lasting peace in Europe  and  beyond that  for active co-operation in husbanding its fruits  is therefore an event of the utmost significance.186.	However  the problems besetting the world can no longer be treated in strict isolation and  just as security in Europe cannot fail to generate security outside its geographical confines  so will conditions of insecurity outside Europe continue to eat at the foundations of peace in that continent. This is especially so when those conditions of instability are allowed to persist on the very doorstep of Europe  in such a vital area as the Mediterranean. Fully aware of this danger  Malta did not fail to raise its voice. From the very beginning of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  Malta tenaciously held the view that European security and co-operation could not meaningfully be discussed if the problems of the Mediterranean were to be ignored. We are accordingly gratified that  as a result of our efforts and those of others who shared our views  the voices of several non-European Mediterranean States have been heard in Geneva at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. It remains for that Conference to take adequate heed of these concerned voices and to ensure that the perspectives they bring to the problem of security on Europe's southern flank are fully reflected in the eventual decisions reached.187.	Malta has also taken the initiative  during that same Conference  to express certain misgivings about the confidence-building measures being recommended in that forum. Addressing itself to the question of prior notification of movements of forces  my Government has expressed the opinion that the recommended measures will not appreciably strengthen security in the Mediterranean and in Europe. To the small unarmed States of that region  prior notification can only be of value in so far as it enhances confidence amongst larger States which are capable of defending themselves. It cannot of itself provide security to weak and small States. For such States  other confidence- building measures must be sought.188.	In looking at the contemporary situation in Europe  what stands out conspicuously is that the majority of European States have sought their security within one or the other of the two military alliances on that continent. These two blocs have until very lately relied entirely for their security on the deterrent provided by their respective massive armaments. But the massing of more and more military hardware  together with the rivalry for influence in the Mediterranean on the part of the two leading members of the opposing blocs  brought about the realization that the whole structure of peace in the area was being undermined  hence the attempt to seek other solutions through the Conference on Security and Co-operation. Having grudgingly conceded that European security is intimately linked with Mediterranean security  the Conference has still to accept another and equally undeniable fact  namely  that a genuine peace in Europe cannot be achieved and maintained without the emergence of an independent Europe free to assert its own identity and to provide an effective buffer between the two super-Powers. It is in the interest of all  not least of those same super-Powers  to promote this new political dynamism.189.	There are those who believe that the European Economic Community may yet assume this role; but it is hardly realistic to expect that the Europe of the Nine will alone be able in the foreseeable future to do so effectively. In the light of these considerations  my Government has warmly welcomed the dialog that has been initiated between the nine of the European Community and the 20 members of the League of Arab States  and we express the hope that that dialog will eventually be extended to include other States bordering on the Mediterranean and the Gulf. Such a historic process could provide a unique stimulus not only to the prospects for economic co-operation but also to the search for peace. By building mutual understanding  it could lead to concerted political action in the interest of peace in the entire area  and it could gradually lead to the voluntary withdrawal by the super-Powers of their forces from the Mediterranean region.190.	In speaking of the problems of peace and security in the Mediterranean  one is inevitably reminded of that intractable threat to peace and security in that area  the Middle East conflict. The traumatic events of last year's October war have dramatically driven home the point that an overall solution to this problem can no longer be delayed. Happily  following that tragic reminder  there have been encouraging signs of movement  notably the troop disengagement agreements reached between Israel and Egypt  and Israel and Syria. But the momentum towards peace appears to have slackened in recent months  and if the lessons of the past 25 years have taught us anything it is that the situation in the Middle East will not remain static.191.	It is in the interests of all parties and of the entire international community to build upon what has been achieved and to move forward towards peace. That is why my country  together with a large number of others  has supported the inclusion of the new item in our agenda entitled ""Question of Palestine"". There can be no peace in the Middle East without a prior solution of the crux of the problem  which is the Palestine question; and there can be no solution to the Palestine question unless the rights and interests of the Palestinian people  including their inalienable right to self-determination  which this Assembly has repeatedly reaffirmed  are duly upheld. Once again my delegation expresses the hope that the Organization  and particularly those of its Members with special responsibilities under the Charter  will explore every possible avenue towards helping the parties directly concerned to find the road to an honourable settlement. It goes without saying that such a settlement can only be reached within the parameter of the essential principles involved: the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by means of force  respect for the territorial integrity of all States  the inalienable right to self-determination of all peoples  including the Palestinian people  and the right of every State to recognition and to security within its territorial boundaries.192.	Our deep concern over She situation in the Middle East has been compounded by the recent tragic events which have occurred in Cyprus. Despite all the soothing words of detente  despite the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  a small unarmed State which has been participating actively in that Conference finds itself a victim  in 1974  of inadmissible foreign interference in internal affairs and of the use of armed force. It is our fervent hope that the judicious combination of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy which has proved its effectiveness elsewhere will not fail to find a solution that will safeguard for Cyprus its territorial integrity  unity  independence and non-alignment. Such a solution  in conformity with the lofty principles of the Organization  must above all provide for the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the return of the refugees to their homes and properties  so as to promote the requisite preconditions in which fruitful negotiations can be held  involving the representatives of both ethnic communities and aimed at a lasting and equitable constitutional arrangement.193.	Despite the balmy winds of detente  conflict and tension  fear and insecurity  also persist in other parts of the world. In South-East Asia  notwithstanding the formal cessation of the war in Viet Nam and the conclusion of the Paris agreements events which we all welcomed the situation is still far from satisfactory. The bitter struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against the forces of reaction and imperialism must still pursue its arduous path. If peace is to dawn over that ravaged land  it is essential that the Paris agreements are scrupulously observed by all sides  and that the efforts of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam to achieve the strict implementation of those agreements are no longer frustrated.194.	In neighboring Cambodia  the Lon Nol regime  bolstered by foreign support  continues to defy the Cambodian people and to cling to power in the diminishing areas still remaining to it. The time has surely come for dispassionate consideration by the General Assembly of the representation of Cambodia in the United Nations  bearing in mind that the Royal Government of National Union under Prince Norodom Sihanouk controls much the larger part of the national territory and enjoys the support of the vast majority of the Cambodian people. The Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries which met test year at Algiers indicated the only honorable path which this Assembly should follow.195.	Another area of the world where peace has still to be consolidated is Korea. Following the modest step forward taken last year  the General Assembly will again during this session have an opportunity to make a positive contribution towards the peaceful reunification of that country. My Government is convinced that the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations is the essential first step leading towards meaningful bilateral negotiations and the attainment of peaceful reunification.196.	In Africa the day appears at long last to be at hand when the final vestiges of colonialism will have disappeared. We are happy to express our heartfelt satisfaction at the very welcome change which has occurred in Portugal's African policies and which has restored to Portugal its revered place in the international community. The unanimous admission of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to the Organization is perhaps the first tangible fruit of that positive transformation  and we look forward to the rapid and peaceful decolonization of the other African Territories under Portuguese administration and their admission to the Organization.197.	But these heartening prospects have also served to highlight still more starkly the depressing and inhuman conditions under which millions of other Africans continue to groan. Upon these millions and upon the conscience of the world  the yoke of apartheid and oppression in South Africa  in Namibia and in Zimbabwe weighs ever more heavily. At this eleventh hour  we still appeal to the Government of South Africa to heed the voice of humanity. The writing has long been on the wall for the colonialists. Now that the wall itself has begun to crumble  it is imperative that the policy of apartheid be allowed to do likewise. As for the illegal regime in Zimbabwe  we must all redouble our efforts to strengthen the policy of sanctions and to ensure that it is universally enforced.198.	On other occasions from this rostrum  the representative of Malta had outlined briefly the foreign policy of my Government. The cornerstone of that policy was and remains one of aloofness from military blocs and confrontation and of positive friendship towards all. Last year at Algiers  my country gained formal admission to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  thus proclaiming anew its dedication to neutrality and its solidarity with other developing countries in their quest for a better life.199.	If the cold-war confrontation under which the concept of non-alignment was born has moved towards a welcome thaw  that is not to say that non-alignment has lost its significance. The reality of big-Power rivalry is still there  complicated perhaps by the emergence of new centers of power  while the existence of spheres of influence is still very much a reality. The aspirations of mankind as a whole towards securing the immediate necessities of life and advancing from there towards the enjoyment of improved standards of living are still as far as ever from being realized. It is those factors  more than any other  which have ensured the steady growth of the non-aligned movement.200.	Speaking at Lusaka in 1970  President Tito said of the movement: ""We are not against the big Powers  we are only against power politics"". This is as significant today as it was then and succinctly captures the spirit of non-alignment. There are some who view the growing strength of the non-aligned movement with certain suspicion. In all frankness we are puzzled by such criticism. For it seems to us that to question the principles of non-alignment is to take issue with the fundamental purposes of the United Nations. The non-aligned countries are unanimous in their dedication to strengthening the United Nations and to making the Organization a more effective instrument for peace and co-operation  and in this we are all here completely aligned.201.	Malta's espousal of non-alignment is not a new development. Since 1971  when my Government was elected to office  Malta has practiced a policy of non-alignment. It has striven hard  at great risk and sacrifice to its people  to make a valid and concrete contribution towards peace in the Mediterranean. In an overpopulated little island with no natural resources and which for centuries has known no source of livelihood other than catering to the military needs of the occupying Power  we have taken the bold step of declaring our firm intention to bring to an end within a few years the economic contributions deriving from this surviving relic of the colonial era.202.	Once again this year the General Assembly will be taking up the issue of disarmament without much progress on the part of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament. It is no criticism of the members of that hard-working body to emphasize that the world has grown impatient over their inability to agree on such long-standing goals as a comprehensive test-ban treaty and a ban on chemical weapons. If no visible progress has been registered on such modest goals  how are we to view the prospects for the goal of general and complete disarmament  which indeed seems to recede further every year?203.	We in Malta have welcomed both the easier relations and the significant agreements reached between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the field of disarmament  notably the agreement last year on the prevention of nuclear war  and their announced intention to conclude a permanent agreement on the limitation of strategic offensive arms. Likewise  we are encouraged by their more recent agreement to halt  as from March 1976  underground nuclear-weapon tests above a certain magnitude. These are encouraging steps  but they can only be viewed as first steps on the road to real disarmament.204.	Meanwhile  however  world opinion is discouraged by the continuation and  in some areas  increasing momentum of the armaments race. Nuclear testing  for instance  continues apace and evokes widespread indignation. We are opposed to all forms of nuclear-weapon testing  whether in the atmosphere or underground  and this in keeping with our commitment to general and complete disarmament. At the same time  however  as we deplore such testing  we cannot fail equally to deplore the fact that  10 years after the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  which solemnly proclaimed the intention of the parties to achieve a comprehensive test ban  this goal is still beyond our reach.205.	When those that have amassed the frightful capacity to destroy all life on this planet i tany times over continue to develop still more weapons to add to their armoury  it is not surprising that there are some who question an order of priority which seeks first to prevent others from developing their own weapons. A more rational order of priority would seem to be for all the nuclear Powers to heed the anguished demands for total prohibition of the use and manufacture of nuclear weapons and othei"" weapons of mass destruction  the dismantling and destruction of existing stocks of such armaments  accompanied by the progressive reduction of conventional weapons  and the discontinuance of nuclear tests in all environments.206.	One of the ways in which the cause of peace and disarmament can be advanced is by the creation of zones of peace and zones from which nuclear weapons are banned. The proposal before the Assembly for such a zone in the region of the Middle East [AIC.IIL.700] affects my country closely  and we support it whole-heartedly.207.	One of the most significant events in the history of the United Nations during the past year has undoubtedly been the convening of the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. My delegation has witnessed with satisfaction the growing realization on the part of the international community that new concepts  replacing the worn-out system of domination and dependence  must be worked out to govern mankind's increasingly varied activities on and under the seas. It was in 1967 that the delegation of Malta first launched the initiative which eventually led to the establishment first of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction and later to the convening of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.208.	The proposals submitted by Malta in 1967 included two interconnected propositions  namely  that the sea-bed and the ocean floor and their resources beyond the limits of national jurisdiction should be declared the common heritage of mankind  and that an international regime governing the area and its resources and including appropriate international machinery should be established. These two principles were later incorporated in the Declaration of Principles Governing the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor  and the Subsoil Thereof  beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  adopted by the General Assembly in 1970 [resolution 2749 (XXV)].209.	The progress achieved by the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas this summer leads the Government of Malta to believe that such a regime and machinery  which will take account of the needs and interests of the developing countries  will in fact be created. In the light of this assessment  my Government feels that it is no longer premature to consider the location of the proposed International Sea-Bed Authority  and it has accordingly made known its decision to offer Malta as the site for the Authority's headquarters. In announcing this offer  my Government believes that many members of the international community would like to associate Malta in the most appropriate way with the tangible and lasting results which will have emerged from the Maltese initiative of 1967.210.	In talking of the United Nations and its achievements during the past 29 years  it has become habitual to make a distinction between  on the one hand  the Organization's record in the political and security sphere where  albeit considerable  its successes are not usually regarded as having matched the hopes reposed in it by its founders and  on the other hand  its much more substantial record in the field of economic and social co-operation. The argument continues that lack of  or only partial  success in the political and security issues invariably receives spectacular but negative coverage in the mass media  whereas important progress in alleviating the lot of humanity in its everyday life often goes unnoticed. There is certainly much truth in this  but  unfortunately  such arguments suggest that all is well with the performance of the Organization in the economic field and may give grounds for complacency. Despite the real and solid achievements of the Economic and Social Council and the specialized agencies  the stark fact remains that the gap between rich and poor nations  far from being bridged  continues to grow apace. The first United Nations Development Decade raised more hopes than it could satisfy. Almost midway through the Second United Nations Development Decade  it is clear that its objectives are likely to remain a mirage.211.	If this was already evident last year  the economic crisis into which the world has since then been plunged has not failed to sharpen our vision. Never was there more need for genuine co-operation among nations in their economic affairs. The energy crisis  in particular  has produced tensions that must be resolved equitably and amicably. The dire alternative of economic confrontation is too fearsome to ponder. In any trial of strength between the powerful  it is the weak bystanders who suffer the most. For those small countries which are exporters neither of technology nor of raw materials  the prospects would be grim indeed. For them  it would seem that they could at best expect nothing but ever higher prices to pay not only for manufactures but also for raw materials  food and fuel  all of which they must obtain from abroad. Such a double squeeze could only depress their terms of trade to intolerable levels and force a drastic reduction in living standards  which  in many cases  are already at a perilous level. It is therefore urgently necessary that the hopes generated by the sixth special session of the General Assembly should be speedily fulfilled. The urgent demands for immediate and effective machinery to translate into action the consensus achieved during that session are still awaiting implementation. We are grateful  to the Secretary-General and to all those who are striving to give early effect to the decisions taken at that historic special session  particularly the Special Program established under the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] and its call for emergency relief measures  and we venture to hope that these measures will be put into operation without further delay. It is also our hope that the beneficiaries of these special measures will not be identified solely on the basis of a purely mechanical formula that ignores fundamental differences in the structure of national economies. Sources of income which derive from transient  artificial and non-economic factors must be recognized for what they are  and their distorting effect on national income statistics must be isolated and corrected.212.	I should like to conclude  as I began  on a note of optimism with regard to the difficult challenges facing the United Nations. If  in taking stock of the current situation  one is bound to acknowledge that the Organization has yet to arrive at satisfactory solutions to many of the world's pressing problems  this is not to belittle its achievements. There is no doubt that the world would be in far worse shape without the United Nations. As for the future  signs of encouragement are not lacking. For if it is true that the first step towards solving a problem is to be aware of its challenge then one can take comfort from the fact that  under the impetus of technology  the world community is increasingly forced to face previously unrecognized problems as well as new dimensions to old ones.213.	It is also becoming a tenet of conventional wisdom that the successful handling of global problems requires a measure of active international co-operation far beyond the concepts of mere detente and peaceful coexistence. This is certainly true of such global challenges as those posed by  amongst others  the current economic crisis  the equitable formulation of the law of the sea  the search for equilibrium between mankind's development activities and the preservation of his environment  the peaceful uses of outer space  the impact of fast-growing population  and the need to augment and to share the world's food resources. The same internationalist approach must also guide the way towards the establishment of a new international economic order  as called for at the sixth special session [resolution 3201 (S-VI)]. Whilst the need for international assistance has never been greater than during these difficult times  it is of the utmost importance for the developing countries to redouble their own efforts towards mutual co-operation in tackling their common problems. In this context  particular significance must be attached to the self-help program  including the solidarity fund for financing economic and social development projects  which the non-aligned countries have moved to establish.214.	The Government of Malta is fully aware of the importance of the principle of self-help for developing countries. In our own economic development  we have spared no effort to encourage our people to mobilize our entire national resources  both human and material  in order to participate fully in  and to share the eventual rewards deriving from  the successful accomplishment of the challenging task of transforming our nation's economy from its pre-independence role of catering to foreign military interests into one based on peace and co-operation with all"
"82",4693,"MMR",29,1974,"I take great pleasure in warmly congratulating Mr. Bouteflika  on behalf of the delegation of Burma  on his election to the Presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. We are glad at the honor thus shown to him personally and to his country  the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria. We assure him of our full cooperation in his discharge of the responsibilities of your high office.2.	My delegation would also like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to Mr. Leopoldo Benites for his distinguished services to the General Assembly as President of its twenty-eighth session.3.	On behalf of the delegation of Burma  I am happy to extend our sincere felicitations and warm welcome to the delegations of Bangladesh  Grenada and GuineaBissau. The admission of the three new States to membership in the United Nations will no doubt contribute to the strengthening of the world Organization. We look forward to working together with them for the furtherance of the purposes of the United Nations.4.	The international situation today is characterized by acute preoccupation with economic and social problems. These problems have forced upon nations the need to review old patterns of relationships not only in the economic but also in the political field. These problems have also made nations realize more than ever before that solutions to international problems cannot be achieved except through international cooperation as envisaged in one of the purposes of the United Nations. It seems to the delegation of Burma that such international cooperation presupposes respect for the principles of equal rights and self-determination  and a greater measure of the democratization of international relations. Experience over the last two decades or so also shows that the threat or use of force in international relations defeats its own purpose  and that if nations are to live in peace and friendship and pursue their own paths of progress  it is imperative that States should strictly observe the principle of noninterference in each other's internal and external affairs. It also underlines the need to persevere in our efforts to settle international disputes by peaceful means  without endangering international peace and security  and with justice.5.	Regarding international peace  it is a matter of great concern that  although there is a trend towards detente and negotiations for the settlement of international disputes  there still exist not only tension but even armed conflicts between some States. Nevertheless  the delegation of Burma is glad to note that  of late  there are signs of more positive thinking on the part of some interested outside Powers regarding these conflicts. We hope that this welcome attitude will become more pronounced in the future. We realize however that in the last analysis  the solution of these conflicts must rest with the parties directly concerned. In this connexion  the delegation of Burma notes with satisfaction that countries mo.e or less vulnerable to outside intervention have shown increasing determination to safeguard and maintain their right to self-determination. This reduces the chances for outside intervention in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of States.6.	Let me now briefly refer to the problem of colonialism and racial discrimination. It is indeed a most welcome development that the new regime in Portugal has acknowledged the right of the people of its dependent territories to self-determination  and has granted independence to GuineaBissau and paved the way for independence in Mozambique and Angola. The delegation of Burma earnestly hopes that this significant trend will help bring about a speedy end to the evils of colonialism and racial discrimination wherever they still exist in Africa.7.	We live in an age of rapid change and of crises affecting the structures of society. Life in the international community is developing progressively and often old rules do not correspond to existing realities. We take heart that  in accord with Article 13 of the Charter  the United Nations is increasingly directing its efforts towards the codification of international law and its progressive development. We refer here to the conference of plenipotentiaries for the revision of maritime law.8.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has rightly been described as the single most important international conference held under the auspices of the Organization. Such high importance has been attributed to the Conference not only because of the unprecedentedly large number of States participating in it  but because there is a universal recognition that  in a world of dwindling natural wealth and rapid population growth  the seas offer the last reserves of the natural resources on which mankind depends for survival.9.	The fundamental and paramount task of the Conference is to create a new legal system for a just and equitable sharing by all nations of those abundant but finite reserves. Its outcome is  therefore  not only of profound and direct concern to nations but it will also affect the very lives and wellbeing of their peoples for generations to come. The task of establishing a new international regime of the sea to determine the rights and obligations of States with respect to the oceans  is undoubtedly a very complex and difficult one which necessarily requires time.10.	On the other hand  the pressure of political  economic and technological realities of a fast changing world is such that it is imperative for the international community to reach agreement as soon as possible on the establishment of a just and equitable legal order in the use of the sea. The consequences of procrastination and delay will be far reaching and can jeopardize our efforts to create such an international regime.11.	The rapid deterioration of the world economic situation over the past year has been a source of major international concern and has brought economic issues to the forefront of world attention. Recent events  more than at any other time  have also made it clear that the world economic system is based on interdependence and that we can ignore this fact only at our peril. The energy crisis  which remains far from being resolved  presents a dramatic case in point. Evidently  the interests of producers and consumers will often diverge  but these differences must be reconciled in a spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding. When attempts at conciliation fail  the outcome only brings unnecessary economic instability and hardship to the entire world community.12.	World inflation presents another important example of interdependence. In the modern world  with its complex economic interrelationships between States  it is almost impossible for a country to isolate itself from economic problems originating elsewhere. One economic problem that has received much publicity of late and which has reached worldwide proportions is  of course  inflation. Considering the relative ease with which imported inflation can spread from one country to another  it is hardly surprising that it has now become an international problem. The seriousness of the situation has been recognized by many countries and the need to supplement domestic remedies with international collaboration and coordination on anti-inflationary measures has been increasingly realized.13.	While international cooperation provides a fruitful approach in the fight against inflation  we believe that a sound international monetary system can also make a valuable contribution to overcoming this problem. On the basis of the final report of the ad hoc Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues (Committee of Twenty) 1 a large measure of agreement has already been reached on international monetary reform  including the agreement on the valuation of special drawing rights on the basis of 16 major currencies of the world.14.	The annual meeting .of IMF recently held in Washington  has approved amendments to the Articles of Agreement of the Fund designed to improve the adjustment process in balance of payments disequilibrium  to impose guidelines on floating rates and to extend the Fund's assistance to developing countries in the form of extended fund facility and the oil facility to meet the current payment crises.15.	However  there are still fundamental issues that remain to be solved  such as the question of restoring the system of par values and the role of gold in the international payments system. It is imperative that these fundamental issues be solved through closer international cooperation  thus forestalling a division of the world into competitive trading blocs with all its undesirable consequences.16.	While the problems associated with the energy crisis  inflation and the shortages of food and essential raw materials have caused worldwide hardship and anxiety  the burden has been particularly heavy on the developing countries. This is to be expected  as developing countries  with their weak economic structures  are more vulnerable to adverse external economic pressures. For some  the high cost of fuel and food and  for many others  the inflated prices they have to pay for essential semi-manufactured and manufactured goods  capital equipment  raw materials and spare parts  have severely strained their balance of payments. Many of those countries now have been placed in the highly undesirable situation where they have to devote so much of their energies and resources to meeting the high priorities of their immediate needs that their longterm goals of social and economic development are likely to suffer.17.	These difficulties could  of course  be mitigated if the international community has the political will to implement some of the more important United Nations resolutions on international economic development and cooperation which have been adopted after arduous debate and protracted negotiations. But  for the most part  these resolutions have been conveniently ignored  as indeed have the high hopes of the much proclaimed International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade.18.	At the recently concluded World Population Conference at Bucharest there were opportunities to exchange views and information and to devise means of international cooperation on the question of population and food. The forthcoming World Food Conference in Rome will provide further opportunities to explore and to find answers to both the longterm and short-term aspects of the world food problem. The constructive proposals which no doubt will ensue from that Conference should form a basis for greater international cooperation in that field.19.	The world economy is now at the crossroads. Recent events  as well as new sets of circumstances and relations  have undermined its structure  its basic premises and its institutions. What is now imperative  therefore  is to replace it with a new world economic order that is more in conformity with the changed circumstances  that is more equitable  and  what is most important  that engenders a new sense of responsibility and cooperation for mutual benefit on the part of the international community. We believe that the recommendations contained in the resolutions adopted at the recently concluded sixth special session of the General Assembly have much to contribute to the creation of such a new world economic order. We would  therefore  like to reiterate our support of the principles embodied in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (SVI)] and urge an early implementation of the provisions made in the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (SVI)].20.	It would be no exaggeration to say that the United Nations is now in a new and important phase of its development. One of the topics that will surely occupy our attention is the increasing role that the* Organization must inevitably play in the establishment of a new international economic system founded on the principles of co-determination and equality of all countries. Through the exigencies of the world economic crisis and the restiveness of States  the international community is once again discovering the United Nations as the most universal forum in which to seek solutions through concerted action.21.	The international theme today is interdependence  global participation and solutions. The talk now is for dialog and negotiations between the economically weak .developing countries  which constitute the majority  and the few industrialized developed countries. It is becoming increasingly clear that the contemporary world  more than ever  calls upon all nations to reconcile their differences and to seek joint action in solving pressing world problems through the United Nations. All this suggests that the value of the United Nations is amply being borne out by time  that it is fast acquiring a fresh lease of life and charting a renewed course for international cooperation in the pursuit of peace and progress. To realize this objective is the challenge with which the United Nations is faced today."
"83",4749,"MNG",29,1974,"Mr. President  the delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic wishes sincerely to congratulate you  an outstanding Government leader of friendly Algeria  on your election as President of the General Assembly and to express the hope that the present session  under your skilled guidance  will make a new contribution to the cause of strengthening peace and co-operation.530. The delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic is deeply satisfied that justice has at last prevailed and the People's Republic of Bangladesh has taken its legitimate seat in the United Nations.131.	We are also happy to welcome among us the representatives of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  whose people have attained national independence through persistent and valiant struggle.132.	We extend our greetings to the new State of Grenada and congratulate it on admission to membership of the United Nations.133.	As we see it  the dominating feature of the present international situation is determined by the progressive deepening of the process of detente. As a consequence of the consolidation and extension of positive changes in the world arena  the principles of peaceful coexistence among States with differing social systems are increasingly gaining firm ground in international relations.134.	A fundamental positive shift in the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States of America  the two mightiest Powers  representing two differing socio-economic systems  has undoubtedly become an important factor leading to the improvement of the world situation as a whole. The positive outcome of the third Soviet-American summit meeting gave a new boost to the further relaxation of international tension and to the practical implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence and broadened the prospects of finding solutions to many of the burning contemporary issues. We submit that the agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States aimed at lessening the danger of war and curbing the arms race represent a constructive contribution to the cause of consolidating universal peace and security.135.	The ongoing process aimed at normalizing the situation in Europe holds a prominent place among efforts to improve the international atmosphere. A whole system of treaties and agreements concluded among the European States with differing social systems has already yielded fruitful results. This demonstrates that there always exist genuine possibilities of solving the most complex and thorny international problems. The holding of the final stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at the highest level  successful negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe  and other measures  would undoubtedly represent an important step in the direction of turning Europe into a continent of lasting peace and mutually beneficial co-operation.136.	The development of events in other parts of the world is .promising  as a whole  despite existing attempts to aggravate the situation. As is well known  the termination of war and  the restoration of peace in Viet Nam were a welcome start towards the removal of one of the most dangerous sources of international tension.. The Paris Agreement on Viet Nam and the Agreement on Restoration of Peace and National Accord in Laos have created favorable prerequisites for strengthening peace and stability  not only in Indochina but also on the Asian continent as a whole. Nevertheless  the complete normalization of the situation in IndoChina has not yet been achieved. The provisions of the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam have been violated systematically by the Saigon regime. The situation of conflict in Cambodia still persists. All this poses a serious obstacle to the attainment of true peace and security in the area.137.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic resolutely condemns the actions of the Saigon authorities and their patrons directed at sabotaging the Paris Agreement on Viet Nam. The political realities prevailing today in South Viet Nam should find a proper reflection in this Organization too. We therefore deem it necessary that the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam be granted permanent observer status at the United Nations and in its specialized agencies.138.	Certain progress has been achieved in removing the roots of dangerous tension in the Middle East. However  the situation in that part of the world continues to give rise to serious concern because of the aggressive intentions and policies of the ruling circles of Israel  backed by imperialist and reactionary forces.139.	The Mongolian People's Republic holds the view that only complete withdrawal by Israel from all occupied Arab territories and full vindication of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine will pave the way to the settlement of the Middle East conflict. The interests of peace and good neighborliness in that region require the early resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all States directly concerned and the representatives of the Arab people of Palestine.140.	An important question concerning the withdrawal of all the foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the United Nations flag is on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly [item 104 (A)]. AS is well known  new opportunities for the constructive solution of the Korean problem are being created  thanks to the initiatives of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  aimed at the peaceful  democratic reunification of Korea. The united efforts of socialist countries and all peace-loving forces augment the possibility of that development.141.	We should note the positive fact that at the last session of the General Assembly a decision was adopted on the dissolution of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification* and Rehabilitation of Korea.3 What the United Nations should do now is decide to withdraw immediately all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations so as to enable the Korean people to decide their own destiny by themselves without any outside interference.142.	My delegation considers that the tripartite meeting of representatives of .India  Pakistan and Bangladesh is one of the important recent initiatives. In our opinion  the agreement signed during the tripartite meeting has created favorable ground for the further normalization of the situation on the Indian subcontinent.143.	All those positive changes in international life have taken place thanks to the persistent struggle of the countries of the socialist community and all the progressive forces fighting to strengthen peace and security. At the same time  one cannot help but note that the opponents of peace and detente are trying  in particular  to create new hotbeds of international tension. Among others  the recent events in Cyprus testify to that. The crisis in Cyprus demands that we take urgent and effective measures to curb and root out the conspiracy of certain circles within the NATO bloc against the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus  a State Member of the United Nations.144.	The criminal acts of the Fascist military junta in Chile  where fundamental human rights are being flagrantly violated  arouse profound indignation and protest around the world. The Mongolian people resolutely demands that the savage repression against Communists and other representatives of democratic and progressive forces of the country be halted.145.	Our delegation would like to stress the importance of ensuring peace and security in Asia on a collective basis and the development of friendly co-operation among the States of the continent.In that respect  the idea of creating a system of collective security in Asia which meets the vital interests of all peoples now assumes even greater significance.146.	Ensuring security in Asia requires the patient and persistent efforts of all Asian States  their good will to consolidate and bolster friendly relations among themselves on the basis of the principles of respect for sovereignty  inviolability of frontiers  non-interference in internal affairs  non-use of force or threat of the use of force  equality and mutually advantageous co-operation. The creation of a system of collective security in Asia  the largest continent of the world  where more than half of the world's population lives  will undoubtedly promote the improvement of the international situation as a whole.147.	The appeal of the General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session for constant and urgent implementation of and adherence to all provisions of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security and for an expansion of the area of detente so that it will spread all over the world [resolution 3185 (XXVIII)] sounds very timely.148.	In the present circumstances  when the nuclear and conventional arms race has not been checked  there is an especially pressing necessity for all States to pledge themselves not to use force in international relations and simultaneously to prohibit permanently the use of nuclear arms. The Mongolian delegation would like once again to emphasize that the Member States of the United Nations should strictly observe that principle and  furthermore  that the Security Council should as soon as possible elaborate the relevant provisions to make that a compulsory principle. That would represent an invaluable contribution towards the cause of strengthening world peace and international co-operation.149.	Detente cannot be stable unless concrete and practical steps are taken in the field of arms limitation and disarmament. In the view of my delegation  the reduction of the military budgets of States is an effective means of limiting armaments. At its twenty-eighth session the General Assembly considered and adopted the proposal of the Soviet Union on the reduction- of the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)]. The implementation of the decision of the General Assembly with the participation of all permanent members  of the Security Council would promote the efforts of States to limit armaments. That would make a real contribution towards the goal of accelerating the economic and social progress of developing countries.150.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that the time has become ripe to start practical preparation for the convening of a World Disarmament Conference. The conference would give a new impetus to international detente and would play an important role in solving one of today's pressing issues general and complete disarmament. In view of the useful work done by the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference  we deem it necessary to expand the mandate of the Committee so that it may undertake effective steps for the actual preparation of the conference.151.	We consider it abnormal that  in spite of the time that has elapsed since the adoption of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction  it has not yet come into force because of the halting pace of its ratification by Member States  In that connexion  we should like to recall the request of the last session of the General Assembly to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  which stressed the need to reach  as soon as possible  an agreement on* the prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of all kinds of chemical weapons and their elimination from the arsenals of alt countries [resolution 3077 (XXVIII)].152.	The Mongolian People's Republic stands firmly for the complete prohibition of all means of chemical warfare and  together with other socialist countries  has proposed a draft resolution to that effect to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva.153.	In the present circumstances of international detente  the ratification of the Geneva Protocol of 1920s by those countries that have not yet ratified it assumes even greater importance. The Mongolian delegation  guided by the sincere desire to see that all States subscribe to the high principles of the Convention and strictly adhere to it  calls on all countries that have not yet done so to sign the Protocol and/or ratify it in 1975 in commemoration of the historic fiftieth anniversary of that important international agreement.154.	It is most regrettable that complete prohibition of all tests of nuclear weapons by all States has not been agreed upon despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of the countries of the world stand in favor of it. The provisions of the 1963 Moscow Treaty on the prohibition of tests of nuclear weapons in three environments continue to be violated. The people and Government of the Mongolian People's Republic resolutely protest the continuation of nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere and demand an immediate end to such tests.155.	The Mongolian delegation would like to stress the necessity of strict observance of all agreements that have been already concluded in the field of arms limitation and disarmament. We believe that the conference to be held in 1975 which will consider the progress of the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will play a positive part in further strengthening peace and international security. The success of the conference will be greatly facilitated if all countries  including nuclear Powers and those possessing considerable military potential  participate in it.156.	The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that the new proposal of the Soviet Union entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human well-being and health"" deserves serious attention and thorough consideration at the present session of the GeneralAssembly. This Soviet initiative serves lofty humanitarian goals of precluding the use of achievements of modern science and technology for military purposes that have a harmful influence upon the natural environment  life and people's health. In this connexion we consider it necessary to elaborate and adopt a relevant international convention that would serve the lasting interests of all mankind.157.	The delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that the interests of further normalization of international relations dictate the elimination of all vestiges of colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination that continue to be one of the constant sources of tension and conflict in the world.158.	Since the twenty-eighth session considerable changes have taken place in the process of decolonization. The recognition by the new Government of Portugal of the right of the Portuguese colonies to self-determination and independence; the admission of Guinea-Bissau to membership in the United Nations and other developments contribute to the acceleration of the process of the final liquidation of colonialism.159.	The Mongolian People's Republic adds its voice to the demands for scrupulous implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The international community must redouble its efforts towards the implementation of the comprehensive program for the struggle against vestiges of colonialism and racism adopted by the United Nations General Assembly [resolution 2621 (XXV)]  and should render effective assistance to the liberation movements of Africa and to efforts to compel discontinuation of any outside support to colonial and racist regimes. Mongolia is one of the first States to have signed the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII)  annex].160.	The thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations will be celebrated in 1975. That anniversary coincides with the fifteenth anniversary of the adoption of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic considers that our Organization should celebrate those significant anniversaries in a distinctive manner and take concrete and effective steps to secure the complete realization of the goals and principles of the above Declaration.161.	The political detente in the world creates favorable conditions for the positive solution of problems of international economic relations  particularly the problem of the economic development of the developing countries. The outcome of the sixth special session of the General Assembly  where the problems of raw materials and development were discussed  demonstrated once again the Close link that exists between economic and political problems. Our delegation has supported the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial spirit of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 320/ (S-Vl)] and the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)]  which set out new and important principles of international economic relations.162.	The falling off in food supplies  the monetary and financial crisis and skyrocketing inflation in the capitalist world not only undermine the economy of the developing countries and exert a negative influence upon the terms of international trade  but also contaminate the international political atmosphere. That is why we believe that concern for the improvement of international economic relations should go hand in hand with concern for the further normalization of the international situation as a whole. The time has come to put an end to discriminatory practices in economic and trade relations imposed by imperialist and colonialist domination and to reshape the structure of international economic relations in the interests of promoting truly equal and mutually beneficial co-operation among States.163.	Mongolia  which this year celebrates its auspicious jubilee  the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic  has always pursued the policy of peace and friendship among nations. The people and Government of the Mongolian People's Republic will continue to exert tireless efforts for the consolidation of peace in the world. The Mongolian People's Republic welcomes the positive contribution of the United Nations to solving the acute international problems that threatened world peace and security.164.	The Mongolian People's Republic advocates enhancing the role of the United Nations in tackling international problems on the basis of the strict observance by all States of the provisions of its Charter. The United Nations  which in its activities reflects the ongoing positive changes in international life  should intensify its efforts to consolidate and promote the spirit of detente in order to make it global and irreversible.165.	We express our hope that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will mark a new step towards the further strengthening of international peace and security."
"84",4836,"MRT",29,1974,"Mr. President  my first words will naturally be to express to you the sincere congratulations of the delegation of Mauritania. In more ways than one  no choice could have been wiser than ours in making you our President. Your qualities as a statesman and a distinguished diplomat and your experience of international problems are for us a sure guarantee of success. Your election to the presidency of this important session is not only a tribute to your persona! qualifications; it is also proof of our esteem and respect for and confidence in Algeria  the Revolutionary Council and the people of Algeria. It is also a great honor conferred upon Africa  of which you  Mr. Minister and dear friend  are a worthy representative.129.	May I say  Mr. President  how very much my country appreciates any honor conferred upon Algeria. Not only do we think alike politically; history  geography and Arab culture have throughout the centuries woven between our two countries and our two peoples ties of friendship and solidarity  ties which have become richer and more fruitful in the course of time and which now distinguish our day- to-day relations. You may therefore rest assured of our co-operation in the exercise of your lofty responsibilities. Certainly they are difficult responsibilities  because you have been entrusted with the direction of the work of this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly  whose aim is to trace the pattern of international events  make clear their meaning and draw up guidelines for short-term and long-term action by the Organization 130.	On looking at the international situation today one cannot fail to see prophetic signs  even auguries  of profound changes on both the political and the economic level. On the economic level  the crisis of the international monetary system  the constant deterioration in the terms of trade and related difficulties are problems that have been accumulating for many years. These problems finally brought the international community  and in particular the developing countries  face to face with the threat of a break-down of unprecedented scope.131.	The inequalities  the characteristic injustices of this system  which already weighed heavily on the countries with weak economies  finally were going to jeopardize dangerously the prosperity of the rich and industrialized nations. In fact  no nation and one becomes increasingly aware of this today can  in an era when large groupings prevail  prosper and live in isolation  while its destiny is more than ever tied to that of the other members of the international community. It is with interdependence  co-operation and mutual assistance that we can jointly build a better world from which we shall banish poverty  ignorance and social and economic injustices. We know that this is still a pious hope  but we believe that an awareness of the need for solidarity and concerted action is already a factor of considerable importance. It so happens  indeed  that all the delegations that spoke during the course of the sixth special session  and the documents adopted as the result of that debate  placed particular emphasis on this urgent need for solidarity. Need I recall that the developing countries  far from seeing the problems in terms of confrontation  wish to have recognized for each State its own rights  which naturally imply obligations. The new international economic order proposed and adored by a general consensus constitutes  in the opinion of my country  an important step in that direction  and must be Sincerely supported by all nations  and in particular by the industrialized and developed countries. It is owly thereby that the international community can overcome the contradictions of the existing system and establish co-operation based on real equality and the interests of all.132.	Politically  the forces of oppression and domination see their end approaching with each passing day. In the Middle East  Zionism  despite the diversity and variety of the support it enjoys  can no longer resist the unshakable will of the Arab peoples to defend their freedom  their sovereignty and their territorial integrity. The October war  which was a defeat for the Israeli forces of aggression  showed an astounded world the determination of the Arab countries to ensure their complete mastery of their own destiny. International opinion  which seemed to have far more faith in force than in right and reason  today has come to see the situation in the Middle East in true light. Sovereign and independent countries  Members of the United Nations  have in the course of the year seen their territory become smaller like a shrinking skin  their sovereignty diminished  and even their existence threatened. Israel  strong in its impunity  pursues its policy of force and destruction in this region  sparing neither innocent civilians nor peaceful villages. In this connexion  we must recall the perfidy  the indescribable act of the destruction of the city of Quneitra by the Israeli soldiery. It is difficult not to be deeply indignant at such an act of sadism which is nothing other than a repetition of the methods of Hitler. Thus those who yesterday were the victims of Hitlerism have today become its most fervent practitioners  but whatever may be the perfidy and arrogance of Israel  it 'can never break the will and determination of the Arab countries.133.	Even the Palestinian people  expelled from their homeland  reduced to a wandering existence since 1947  deprived of its most elementary rights  is today more than ever determined to carry on its heroic struggle to recover its national territory. It is  furthermore  now admitted and we rejoice at this that the solution of the problem of the Middle East as a whole must necessarily include a settlement of the Palestinian question. In this regard the inclusion of this question on the agenda of the present session should enable the United Nations to give this general feeling specific form.134.	It goes without saying that the PLO must speak before the General Assembly and effectively participate in this debate  which concerns it primarily and which will decide its destiny. I here reaffirm our permanent and effective solidarity with our brothers of Egypt  Syria  Lebanon  Jordan and Palestine.135.	In Asia everybody knows of the sacrifices and sufferings imposed on the Cambodian people by foreign forces which continue  financially and militarily  to support the regime at present in power at Phnom Penh. In spite of the massive aid given to the unpopular Lon Nol regime  the balance of forces on the battlefield is in itself sufficiently eloquent to make our Organization finally heed the clearly expressed will of the Cambodian people. Thus it is the duty of our Assembly to restore the legitimate rights in the United Nations to the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia under the direction of Prince Norodom Sihanouk  the sole genuine representative of the Cambodian people.136.	The South VietNamese people  in its National Liberation Front and in its Provisional Revolutionary Government  gives striking proof of its will to sacrifice and its determination to face the difficulties on its road to independence and freedom. This people will not rest as long as foreign forces are not with-drawn from South Viet Nam and as long as the Saigon authorities do not scrupulously comply with the Paris agreements.137.	In Korea the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea  and the abolition of the use of the United Nations flag  should enable the Korean people as a whole to exercise its right to self-determination and freely to decide its future. The United Nations  which had the chief responsibility in the artificial division of the territory and people of Korea  today more than ever has the duty to facilitate the peaceful and independent reunification of that country. 138.	As regards the problem of Cyprus  our delegation in the Security Council has on numerous occasions had an opportunity to express the view of the Government and people of Mauritania. Our position with regard to this painful problem is based on our support for three fundamental principles  namely  the territorial integrity  independence and sovereignty of Cyprus.139.	Lately  under the pressure of liberation movements and of forces favorable to peace  there has been an irreversible acceleration in the process of decolonization in Africa. The sacrifices of every kind and the sufferings that the African liberation movements imposed on themselves  their heroic struggle for the freedom and dignity of their people have obviously been the decisive element in that change. Nor can I fail to mention the critical contribution still being made by the United Nations and by all peoples that love peace and justice  which have at no time spared their support for and solidarity with OAU and the African freedom fighters. Nor could I fail  in speaking of decolonization  to pay a heartfelt tribute to the Government and people of Portugal for their sense of realism and for having understood the need for decolonization  a need which has often been recalled before this Assembly.140.	As a result of the combination of those elements  we are able today to welcome the admission to the United Nations of the Republic of Guinea- Bissau  which  after almost two decades of struggle and sacrifice  has finally regained its dignity and its freedom. That is a decision which my country  from this rostrum  has constantly and whole-heartedly called a just decision  a decision in conformity with the right of peoples to self-determination and to choose their destiny freely. Hence  I should like to extend my country's congratulations to the delegation of Guinea-Bissau  whose presence in this hall constitutes for us Africans the living symbol of the lightness of our cause and encourages us to pursue our action. We hope that we shall soon be able to address ourselves in similar terms to the true representatives of the peoples of Mozambique  Angola and still other Territories and I would stress those words: ""still other Territories"". For it is a fact a fact that each day becomes more obvious that the will of the peoples is invincible.141.	It is equally true that the liberation of the colonies under Portuguese domination places the general problem of decolonization at the forefront of present events. The anachronistic colonial situations still prevailing in southern Africa and other parts of the continent can no longer resist that will of the peoples and that irreversible pressure of events. Portugal's example must teach the racist minorities of South Africa and Zimbabwe to stop clinging to obsolete and criminal values  must make them try  while there is still time  to take their places with honour in the great human family.142.	I come now to another colonial African Terri-tory—Sahara  under Spanish administration. Every-one is aware of the position of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania on that problem; it is a constant and  we think  logical and consistent position. Indeed  our position regarding that part of the national territory draws its strength as much from history and geography as from the nature of the population.143.	Historically Mauritania or what was then called ""Bilad Shinguit"" has always been  throughout the last 14 centuries  that Saharan entity which extends from the southern frontiers of Morocco to the Senegal River and from the Atlantic to Telemsi Morocco or the extreme west has often been called ""Jazirat Al-Maghrib""  the Isle of the West. That very fortuitous expression means that the Moroccan domain is encompassed by the Mediterranean to the north  the Atlantic to the west and the Sahara to the south. The Sahara and I must stress this-- has been and remains a much more difficult barrier to cross than the maritime frontiers. That is the result as much of the nature of the terrain as of the centuries- old determination of the inhabitants of that region to resist any threat to their freedom and to allow passage only to beneficial influences that they have voluntarily accepted.144.	No one and certainly not the Mauritanians can deny that brotherly and mutually beneficial relations have been established between those two entities throughout the centuries. But history attests to the fact that deep frictions also have arisen between them. However  there is one unchanging element in the long history of this Saharan region: from the beginning of history and up to the first part of this century  the region was never administered from outside. It was always governed by emirs who were genuine inhabitants of the region. On the other hand  that region was able to govern the Saharan and Moroccan entities and to unite them under one authority. That happened in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The unification that took place then was the work of the Almoravides  who had come from the central and western parts of Mauritania. For the first and last time  Mauritania and Morocco were one empire  the empire of the Mauritanian Almoravides.145.	At the beginning of this century  a similar attempt was made by El He'iba Ould Sheikh Malatnine  or the ""Blue Sultan""  the descendant of an old and noble family from Nema  a city in the south-eastern part of Mauritania. It was only the intervention of French troops that defeated that attempt to recreate the glorious age of the Almoravides.146.	Between those two dates the eleventh century and the beginning of the twentieth century all the attempts made in the north-south direction failed. Some expeditions undertaken in the last century got as far as Sous  in the region of the present city of Agadir. A more successful undertaking brought Sultan Moulaye El Hassan in 1886 as far as Wad Noum  in the G'leimim (Goulimin) region.147.	In that very same year  1886  Spain succeeded in establishing itself in the Sahara  having concluded treaties with some Mauritanian chiefs  particularly the Emir of Mauritanian Adrar  Ahmed Ould M'Hamed Ould Ai'da; all other parties were excluded. That proves that at the time of the Spanish penetration there clearly was a traditional power in the Sahara  as there was everywhere else in Africa. Of course  the simple existence of that power does not automatically lead to the existence of rights. But the links between that power and independent Mauritania do not need to be demonstrated in any way. Indeed  that treaty was signed by a Mauritanian Emir who came from the city of Atar in the north-central part of present-day Mauritania.1481 A few years after the signing of that treaty between Emir Ahmed Ould M'Hamed Quid Ai'da and Spain  France began its penetration into southern and eastern Mauritania  through agreements reached with the Mauritanian Emirs and excluding all other parties. Furthermore  the existence of that distinct Mauritanian entity  with its own identity  has been recognized on many occasions in old international treaties and recent official documents. As proof I need cite only the peace treaty concluded between Morocco and Spain on 28 May 1767  during the reigns of Sultan Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdallah and Charles III and more specifically article 18 of that treaty  reading as follows:""His Imperial Majesty will not discuss the establishment that His Catholic Majesty wishes to create south of the Noum River  because he cannot be held responsible for the accidents and misfortunes that could occur  in view cf the fact that his sovereignty does not extend that far and that the fierce roving tribes living in that country have caused harm to the people of the Canary Islands and reduced them to slavery.""149.	And yet Wad Noum is well north of the Tarfaya region  ceded to Morocco by Spain in 1958. Thus  Sultan Mohamed did not hesitate to grant  through that treaty  fishing rights to the Spanish starting at Santa Cruz that is  Ifni towards the north  in the Moroccan territorial waters where he believed he had sovereignty.150.	There are other official and irrefutable pieces of evidence that that Territory is Mauritanian; they are dated 1960 and come from our Moroccan brothers.151.	As can be seen  both the historical background that I have just referred to without any bitterness or rancor and official acts of the fraternal Moroccan Government prove that the southern frontier of Morocco is a genuine delimitation between two worlds  or  as the historian Robert Montagne wrote  ""the demarcation between two different social and political systems"".152.	Hence  historically Mauritania  with its ""fierce roving tribes"" as they were so politely called was to remain that mysterious  unknown and feared country until the ""Franco-Spanish"" penetration.153.	Geographically  the present frontier of the so- called Spanish Sahara has been defined by the Franco- Spanish Conventions of 22 June 1900  30 October 1904 and 27 November 1912. Although the Sahara has common boundaries with Morocco and Algeria  extending over some 400 and 40 kilometers  respectively  its entire area of 280 000 square kilometers lies within Mauritania and along a 1 600 kilometer- long administrative boundary.154.	Indeed  like Mauritania  so-called Spanish Sahara extends from longitude 17° W to latitude 27° N. This means that it is pointless to emphasize the artificiality of the Saharan frontier which arbitrarily divides regions whose ethnic  linguistic and geographic unity is beyond challenge. I must recall  as was emphasized in 1963 by the Mauritanian Minister for Foreign Affairs before the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  that the so-called Spanish Sahara is inhabited solely by Mauritanian tribes differing in no way from other tribes living in the north-western part of independent Mauritania.6 Indeed  they have everything in common; their language—Hassania (the Mauritanian dialect of Arabic)  culture  race and customs. Even in their daily activities and their nomadic nature  those tribes give proof of the artificiality of the frontier which divides them. The examples of CMad Dleym  Rguebatt  Oulad Tidrarine  Ehel Baricalla  Laroussyne and so on attest to the inter-penetration of those tribes and to the homogeneity of that whole north-western region of Mauritania.155.	Thus it is clear that history  geography and human habitation have made that region  formerly called ""Spanish Mauritania""  an integral part of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. My country's position on this problem derives  quite naturally  from these fundamental facts.156.	Thus it was that in 1957 and more precisely on S July 1957  i when we were able to free ourselves partially from colonial subjugation  three years before our independence the Mauritanian Head of State  then Vice President of the Council of Government  declared at Atar:""Mauritania is no longer that vast desert which was once so difficult to cross and which formed a sort of barrier between the Mediterranean world and black Africa  difficult for men and ideas to traverse. I am addressing myself more particularly to our brothers of the Spanish Sahara. I cannot help but recall the innumerable ties that unite us: we have the same names; we speak the same language; we have the same noble traditions; we venerate the same religious chiefs; we graze our herds on the same pastures  which we water from the same wells. I therefore invite our brothers of Spanish Sahara to reflect this great economic and spiritual Mauritania which from now on is always in our thoughts.""157.	That policy has subsequently been constantly expounded at every African and international gathering  and  in particular  by the most authoritative spokesmen of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania: its Chief of State  its Ministers for Foreign Affairs and its United Nations representatives. Therefore  I need hardly reiterate in detail those various policy statements  as they appear in the relevant documents of the Organization; nor do I wish to take up more of the Assembly's time.158.	For the sake of historical truth  however  I must recall that on 13 December 1962  here at the United Nations  my country subscribed to the principle of the self-determination of the people of the Sahara; for we were sure that our brothers in the Sahara  if they had to choose between Mauritania or another country  would choose to march with us. But beyond that certainty  there is all our loyal and sincere support for the right of peoples to self-determination  in accordance with the Charter and with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  which contains the Declaration of the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.159.	The United Nations itself  on the basis of a decision taken on 9 September 1966 by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  acknowledged the inalienable right of the people of the Sahara to self-determination [resolution 2229 (XXI)j. That right has subsequently been reaffirmed in all resolutions and decisions taken by the non-aligned countries  the OAU and the United Nations. As proof I need only cite the resolutions adopted on 9 September 1973 by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries; on 14 December 1973 by the General Assembly [resolution 3162 (XX VIII)]; and on 11 June 1974 by the Summit Conference of the OAU. Need I recall that all those resolutions were drafted  submitted and supported by my country and by those directly concerned with the problem  notably Morocco?160.	Along with that action  my country has sought internationally  by every means  to preserve and consolidate friendship among the fraternal peoples and Governments of the subregion. Thus  in 1969  when the subregion witnessed a happy turn of events the normalization of relations between Morocco and Mauritania my Government  without departing from its fundamental position  unhesitatingly placed the problem of the so-called Spanish Sahara within the framework of concerted action. We proposed to the Governments of our brother States that they unite their efforts so as to achieve as soon as possible the settlement advocated by the United Nations. Above all  our concern and desire was to maintain peace and stability in the subregion  but also to have the African and Arab groups regain the necessary cohesion to be able to face the scope and gravity of the decolonization problems in Africa and the Middle East.161.	My country  which more than ever is prompted by the same desire  cannot fail to respond favorably to the appeal addressed to it yesterday on behalf of the Moroccan Government by my colleague and brother Mr. Ahmed Laraki  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Morocco [2249th meeting]. We can do so with all the more alacrity and serenity since the Government of Morocco has expressly recognized our rights over that Saharan region. We do so  too  because we are certain that  beyond transitory misunderstandings fostered by colonialism  the Mauritanian and Moroccan .peoples are keenly aware of their responsibility to combat colonialism  which continues to dominate the Territories of Ri'o de Oro and Sakiet El Hamra. Mauritania  which understands the legitimate motives of the Government of Morocco  declares that the only problem at present is the liberation of those Territories liberation  which will strengthen understanding and cooperation between our two peoples.162.	We have sufficient historical  legal  linguistic and human proof that those Territories were not lands without masters or administration. That is why the Mauritanian Government accepts recourse to the International Court of Justice  whose opinion cannot fail to enlighten the General Assembly on the well- founded nature of our position and enable it to ensure proper implementation of the resolutions adopted. This attitude  which shows the constant interest and solidarity of our peoples  is further warranted by the need to maintain harmony within the ranks of theArab and African countries in the face of our serious and multiple concerns. It is based also on my country's devotion to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes  particularly when those disputes are likely to lead to a confrontation between two countries and peoples which geography and common civilization have destined to enjoy relations of understanding and co-operation.163.	Spain  as the colonial Power  must in any event soon end its presence in the Sahara. History  the United Nations and international morality demand it  and Spain itself has agreed to meet that requirement.164.	Thus the International Court of Justice  in establishing the existence or non-existence of a Power in the Sahara  will have to determine the Sahara's links with Mauritania and Morocco.165.	Whatever might be the opinion of the Inter-national Court of Justice  however  the right of self- determination of the people of the Sahara cannot be subject to any impediment. That population has the right freely to choose its destiny and no international organization or institution can deny it that right. My country solemnly undertakes here before you to abide by the freely expressed will of that population.166.	This  of course  leads me on to speak of the referendum in which the population of the Sahara is to decide its future. That referendum cannot be organized and carried out on a completely free  democratic and impartial basis unless the administering Power scrupulously respects the procedures which have so often been advocated by the United Nations. Above all  a special mission to the so-called Spanish Sahara must be sent by the United Nations  and it alone should recommend to the United Nations the practical measures for the organization and holding of the referendum. For our part  we understand that these measures would refer not only to the preparation and supervision of the referendum by the Organization  but also to the practical and specific arrangements that would enable the genuine Saharans  within and outside the territory  to participate in that consultation.167.	We have  of course  taken note with satisfaction of the reiterated commitment of the administering Power to apply all the provisions of resolution 3162 (XXVIII). And yet we must deplore the slowness of the administering Power and at times the vagueness of its intentions about the future of its Territories. This is all the more resented because any colonial situation is anachronistic in our era  and because recent statements made by Saharan figures of consequence would  if confirmed  give us no grounds for optimism.168.	However  we feel certain that Spain  which has already shown a positive attitude with respect to decolonization  will avoid anything that might affect its past and present relations with Mauritania and the other States of the subregion.169.	In concluding this statement  I should like to say again how happy I am  Mr. President  to be ad-dressing the Assembly under your presidency. I also wish to express our admiration and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Benites  for the outstanding manner in which he guided the work of the twenty- eighth session and of the sixth special session of the General Assembly. I hope that the Republic of Bangladesh and the Republic of Grenada will accept our friendship and our warmest congratulations. I wish to assure the Secretary-General that we follow with deep sympathy his tireless efforts to make of the United Nations a true instrument of peace  understanding and harmony among peoples. We express again our confidence in him and assure him of our support in his efforts. We sincerely hope that each Member State will work for the respect of the principles embodied in the Charter and for the implementation of the decisions taken by the Organization."
"85",4882,"MUS",29,1974,"Mr. President  I should like first of all to offer you the congratulations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your great country  Sir; has been in the forefront of progressive action in the third world and has played an important role in the world community  and we are particularly happy to see you presiding over the work of this Assembly.111.	Ever since he accepted to shoulder the burden of the most impossible job in the world  our distinguished Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has spared no effort in his work for peace  justice and progress. We warmly congratulate him for his tremendous  prompt and positive actions not only at times of political crisis but also in the quieter fields of economic development.112.	We should also like to welcome Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau as new Members of the United Nations.113.	We listened attentively and with much interest to the stirring address of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh  Sheikh Mujibur Rahman [2243rd meeting]  a heroic statesman. We warmly welcome the presence among us of the representatives of Bangladesh.114.	Grenada  the ""Spice Island""  shares with Mauritius the beauty of nature- except that the beaches of the star and key of the Indian Ocean are much more beautiful.115.	The admission of Guinea-Bissau is the victory of a right and just cause. We are proud to see among us the valiant representatives of this new African court- try  and never shall we forget the name of Amilcar Cabral.116.	Our sympathies go to the Government and the people of Honduras in their present plight after the cyclone ""Fifi"". We hope that the world community will  as usual  be generous in helping to alleviate the sufferings of our fellow human beings not only in Honduras but also in Bangladesh -which  once again  is stricken with natural disaster and elsewhere.117.	As a brief reminder of the problems which confront the United Nations at this session  I would point out that the special emergency operation to which we agreed at the sixth special session has not yet resulted in concrete measures to assist those among us who are most affected by the present world economic crisis; that we still have to tackle the complex question of general disarmament  that is to say  disarmament which would lighten the burden arising from the arms race and increase the opportunities for development; that peace has not yet been restored to South-East Asia; and that such serious political problems as the situation in the Middle East and the question of Cyprus remain to be solved. So  in addition to finding ways and means to promote a new economic order  we still have to find appropriate solutions to long-standing problems so as to promote political stability.118.	Mauritius has welcomed the atmosphere of detente among the major Powers  because it believes that it could be the basis for universal peace  thus lessening the possibility of confrontations between them. Detente  however  has not eliminated the possibility of confrontation in the Indian Ocean.119.	Declared a zone of peace by the Assembly three years ago [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]  the Indian Ocean is at present the scene of dangerous rivalries. Any decision of the United Kingdom and the United States to extend communications and military facilities on the island of Diego Garcia would constitute a flagrant violation of the United Nations resolution on the subject. May we appeal to those directly concerned  especially the United States of America  to reconsider their present policy which  certainly  far from being conducive to the creatL J of a zone of peace is rather conducive to the creation of one of tension. Mauritius  therefore  with other countries bordering the Indian Ocean  views with grave concern the activities of the great Powers  which could create an explosive situation. The peoples of the countries of the Indian Ocean must be allowed to live in peace and security. Mauritius will therefore continue to explore with others every possibility of maintaining peace in the area.120.	But world peace cannot be ensured if the global issues of disarmament are not solved. For us  genuine disarmament means not only an end to the arms race -which  it should be recalled  costs about $270 000 million annually -but also the destruction of all existing arsenals. The work of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament should be accelerated and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks should be allowed to yield more positive results. It is the view of our Government that what is needed is a comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty  and that any other agreements concluded- should not be aimed at preserving primarily the prerogatives of those countries that are already nuclear Powers. It is in that context that we would consider the proposals fm nuclear-free zones in some parts of the world.121.	Although the solutions proposed at the sixth special session have remained unimplemented  the session was useful in so far as it helped to underline the great degree of interdependence of the world economies  particularly the interrelated nature of the economies of the producers of raw materials and those of the developed countries which nerd the raw materials for their continued industrialization. Since the special session  the world economy has further deteriorated. Inflation in the developed countries is felt also in the developing countries  which are paying higher prices for food  fertilizers and manufactured goods. The energy crisis has taught the developed countries their dependence on petroleum. In this respect  we believe that oil price increases should be discussed in the general context of a system of adequate remuneration for basic commodities. My country  which draws about 90 per cent of its total export earnings from the export of sugar  has greatly suffered in the past from the constant deterioration in the terms of trade. The economic  situation of countries which  like Mauritius  export raw materials  will remain unstable as long as an adequate and equitable system is not found to counter the cyclic fluctuations to which the prices of raw materials are subject. While we continue to search for long-term measures  contributions are urgently needed for the emergency operation in order lo assist the hardest hit among the developing countries.122.	It is our belief that existing specialized agencies or international institutions  such as UNIDO  UNCTAD and the regional economic commissions could greatly contribute towards the search for long- term solutions. In spite of their efforts  developing countries are still compelled to specialize in the production and supply of raw materials to the developed countries. We feel that their action would be more fruitful if they concentrated on an increased transfer of technology from the developed to the developing countries  in order to achieve the aims of diversification and industrialization. We suggest that  so far as Africa is concerned  the conclusions of the UNESCO Conference on the Application of Science and Technology to Development in Africa should be implemented without delay . We also note the early implementation of the African regional plan of action for science and technology  which aims at creating the necessary apparatus to enable an easy  transfer of technology from the highly industrialized nations. Finally  we suggest that the EC A  whose main contribution has so far been the preparation of studies and the organization of meetings  seminars and symposia  should be enabled to assist African States in a more practical manner.123.	Before turning to some of the political problems confronting us  I should like to refer briefly to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. Mauritius  which is an island  of course attaches great importance to the problems of the sea  the sea-bed and its subsoil and their resources. At the second session of the Conference held recently at Caracas some of the basic issues were raised. We view the question of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the . sea  its soil and subsoil up to 200 miles as being particularly important. It is essential that the establishment of a 200-mile coastal zone be accepted over which the States concerned can exercise the right to exploit the natural resources of the sea for the economic development and welfare of their peoples. A second element which the final legal order of the sea should emphasize is the idea Of universal ownership of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction and its administration by an international body in the interests of the peoples of the world as the common heritage of mankind. Those two elements have clearly emerged from the Caracas session. Together with most of the countries of the Third World  Mauritius will support the final instruments relating to the Law of the Sea.124.	We are gratified to note that among the political issues before the General Assembly this year we will not have to devote the usual amount of time and attention to the questions of the Portuguese-administered Territories.125.	In the course of the general debate at the twenty- fourth session of the General Assembly  my Prime Minister  Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam  said  referring to the colonial Powers  particularly Portugal:""These to my mind are the main currents of colonial policies adopted by many Powers. Why do they not want to withdraw gracefully from the Territories they have occupied for centuries? At times it was* advanced by them that the peoples Of those Territories were not ready to assume independence; at other times it was said that those Territories were economically backward and not viable. On either ground  they have forfeited their right to continue to maintain their rule because after centuries of colonial rule they have failed on all counts.""Colonial Powers should no longer invoke the principle that the affairs of Territories under their rule are purely their internal affairs. The time has passed for such a concept; and they should voluntarily divest themselves of their political rule without necessarily impairing their cultural links.""6126.	It is therefore with great pleasure and admiration that we have followed the efforts of the new regime is Lisbon  not only to restore democracy and freedom to Portugal but also to negotiate with the recognized leaders of its colonies the transfer of power.127.	The statement made by the Foreign Minister of new Portugal  Mr. Mario Soares [2239th meeting]  was historical inasmuch as it ended over four centuries of colonial oppression. On behalf of my Government  I wish to pay a tribute in regard to those efforts which have already led to a peaceful settlement in Guinea-Bissau and to the Lusaka agreement concerning the independence of Mozambique. We are confident that with the usual statesmanship the new leaders of Portugal will tackle with success the outstanding problems which are to be solved with regard to Angola and that the decolonization process in that Territory also will be as* smooth as in the other cases. While saluting the wisdom and statesmanship of the new Portuguese Government  we should like to praise the freedom fighters for their long and heroic struggle to liberate their countries.128.	We hope that the developments in the Portuguese-administered Territories will have a healthy impact on the situation in the rest of southern Africa  which is still under the domination of colonialist and racist regimes.129.	We are gratified to note that the British Foreign Secretary  Mr. James Callaghan  has reaffirmed that the United Kingdom still has an outstanding responsibility in Southern Rhodesia and has given us assurances that the British Government will adhere to the policy f ^t ""there can be no satisfactory settlement without :e agreement of the African people who live in Rhodesia"" [2240th meeting  para. 229]. We assume that all concerned realize from what is happening in Mozambique that there could be no settlement without majority rule. Another lesson which should be learned from the patterns of settlement in the Portuguese-administered Territories is that no peaceful settlement is possible in Southern Rhodesia except through negotiations with recognized leaders of the people. It follows that without the release from detention of the leaders of the Zimbabwe liberation movement  no negotiated settlement is possible. The only alternative would be to continue the liberation struggle which  with the possibility of increased assistance from the OAU  is bound to be intensified. We trust that the British Government  like us  wishes to avoid unnecessary loss of life. Taking into account the new developments  we believe that it can more forcefully impress upon the rebel regime of Ian Smith the urgent need for peaceful change. Of course  all other States can  and should  help in tightening the sanctions against Rhodesia.130.	The situation in Namibia has worsened over the past year. But it appears  from some statements made by representatives of the white minority in the Territory  that there is some awareness that the reign of terror of the apartheid regime cannot continue indefinitely  when Angola is expected to become independent in the near future. We hope that there  as in Southern Rhodesia  political realism will prevail: In the meantime  the armed struggle waged by the freedom fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization will continue and Mauritius is determined to continue to support it.131.	Whether the abhorrent system of apartheid in South Africa will be affected by the admirable example of humanity and political wisdom set by Portugal is debatable. The nature of the evil system of apartheid is such that it would take a revolution similar to that which has occurred in Portugal to change it. It is an opinion  indeed a conviction  however  that the apartheid policy is doomed to failure. Mauritius is determined to continue to associate itself fully with all action that might be undertaken by the United Nations to bring about the end of the racist minority regime in South Africa.132.	Before concluding  I would like to indicate very briefly the position of Mauritius on a number of other political issues before us.133.	The representative of Mauritius  at the time of the violent overthrow of President Makarios  expressed in the Security Council the shock and emotion felt by the people of Mauritius. The position which the representative of Mauritius stated still stands: namely  that Archbishop Makarios was  and remains  the legitimate head of the State of Cyprus and that the restoration of constitutional order implies that he should be allowed to return. Our position is a simple one as it h based on the fact that Archbishop Makarios is the elected President of Cyprus. We hope that our forthcoming deliberations on the Cyprus question will pave the way to restoring full sovereignty to that country and to safeguarding its territorial integrity and independence to the satisfaction of all the inhabitants of the island.134.	On the Middle East question  Mauritius fully supports the position of the OAU  particularly on the demand for complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories. This is not only a just demand but a requirement for the restoration  of durable peace in the region. That measure and any others aimed at safeguarding the independence and territorial integrity of Israel are  in our opinion  the issues which should be resolved at any resumed talks in Geneva if complete peace it to return to the Middle East. Any solution would also have to take into account the legitimate rights of the people of Palestine.135.	My delegation welcomes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the supplementary item entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human well-being and health"" [item 103]. We congratulate the Foreign Minister of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  Mr. Andrei Gromyko  and his delegation for having proposed the inclusion of this item in the agenda of the Assembly [see A19702]  which my delegation will actively support.136.	The World Population Conference  in which Mauritius participated  has accomplished considerable results and we trust that all Member States  and others  will co-operate and help generously towards the implementation of the World Population Plan of Action  which was adopted by acclamation in Bucharest by no less than 135 participating States.137.	Now we are hopeful that the World Food Conference  scheduled to be held in Rome this November  will result in the adoption of measures which will lead to the alleviation of the food problems that the world is facing today.138.	To conclude  allow me to return to the point I started a little while ago  namely  to the immediate region where Mauritius is situated. My Government has the friendliest relations with the leaders of the Seychelles. We have welcomed the decision of the ruling party  the Seychelles Democratic Party of Mr. Mancham  with regard to the independence of the Islands  and we are looking forward to co-operating closely with the independent Seychelles.139.	Furthermore  we were pleased to hear earlier this week from the French Foreign Minister  Mr. Sau- vagnargues [2238th meeting]  that France was completing its own efforts in the domain of decolonization by preparing  with the agreement of the freely elected leaders of the Comoros  the accession to independence of the islands. We welcome these developments and are also looking forward to establishing friendly relations with the independent Comoros. The co-operation of the Seychelles and the Comoros as well as that of all other States of the region is needed firmly to establish the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.140.	May I  on behalf of my Prime Minister  the Government and people of Mauritius  reaffirm our unbounded faith in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."
"86",4965,"MYS",29,1974,"Mr. President  permit me at the outset to add my voice to the many that have preceded me  in most heartily congratulating you on your election to the high office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My delegation rejoices to see you in the Chair. We know you well for your accomplishments as foreign Minister of Algeria  a great nation with which my country has close and friendly ties. We have come to respect you as well for the prominent role and positive contributions you have made to the non-aligned movement and the conferences of Islamic nations  movements whose aspirations and objectives my Government fully shares and firmly supports. We have every confidence that you will deploy all the wit and wisdom that we have so often witnessed from you  and exercise the infinite patience and perseverance that we know you to possess  to ensure the success of this session. For our part let me say  Mr. President  that my delegation stands ready to extend to you our fullest co-operation.310.	In welcoming you  Mr. President  may I also take the opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador  who as President  not only of the twenty-eighth session but also of the historic sixth special session of the General Assembly   contributed immensely to the fruitful deliberations of the sessions. May I  therefore  express my delegation's gratitude and admiration to Mr. Benites for the skillful guidance he had given us  the leadership he had provided and the wisdom he had shown which enabled us to bring the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session to their successful conclusions311.	My delegation too  both on its behalf and on behalf of the Malaysian Government  would like to extend at the outset its warm welcome to the delegations and Governments of the Republic of Bangladesh  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  and Grenada to this great assembly of nations. Their membership will bring us nearer to the attainment of the universality of the United Nations.312.	Partly because of our geographical proximity but primarily because of our common interest and pursuits  my country was one of the earliest to stretch out its hand of friendship to the people and Government of Bangladesh upon its emergence. We are therefore happy at the admission of Bangladesh to the United Nations. Indeed as a country that bears nothing but good will and friendship to all the countries on the Indian subcontinent  we are even happier at the unanimous support that has been given to her admission.313.	It is in the same spirit and with a similar sense of familiarity that we welcome the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to membership in the United Nations. My Government had no hesitation in recognizing the declaration of independence that the people of Guinea-Bissau proudly proclaimed last year. The tenacity  the courage and the conviction demonstrated by the people of Guinea-Bissau in their long and just struggle for independence will surely stand as an example for the colonized peoples of the world to follow and as a reminder to the world that the self-determination of peoples cannot forever be denied  much less delayed.314.	My delegation looks forward to working together with the delegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau within this forum  as indeed we have been doing outside it  in various movements to which both our countries subscribe.315.	If I left Grenada to the last  let me hasten to assure the members of the delegation of Grenada that we welcome them no less warmly to the United Nations  that we no less look forward to working with them. The admission  of Grenada to full membership in the United Nations is surely another important step in the continuing process of decolonization.316.	We meet today in a climate less clouded by the threat of a global conflagration. This climate  although only slightly improved  is none the less comforting. As one of the many countries that had no part in creating the monstrous threat of a global conflagration and had no choice but to live in constant fear alongside it  we not unnaturally welcome the new relationship at the major-Power level that has contributed  as those Powers alone can  towards its reduction. Detente  if it is to remain welcomed  however  cannot merely mean an increased remoteness of a direct and total conflict at the major-Power level. Nor  if detente is to contribute to the making of cosmic changes  should it merely herald the beginning of cooperation between the major Powers on all issues in aU areas of the world  to the exclusion and at the expense of others less powerful. All nations  be they big or small  fortunately endowed or unfortunately deprived  have the right to contribute to  indeed the responsibility to participate in  the creation of a more secure world order. Respect and restraint should form the relations between all nations regardless of their size or situation.317.	It is therefore encouraging for my delegation to see that what the major Powers have set in motion had led to major and important initiatives taken by smaller and medium-sized Powers to accept this new challenge and seize this opportunity to work towardsthe solution of their own problems. And it is indeed heartening that  as a result  events that had taken place in the past year  and as recently as early this year  had on balance greatly contributed to the relaxation of international tension and increased the scope for peaceful coexistence and constructive relations. It remains our hope  and indeed our determination  to ensure that this will develop into a durable pattern of relations that would diminish the need to confront and increase the will to co-operate among all.318.	It is in this light that my delegation would like to welcome the salutary initiatives taken by all concerned to devote their best efforts and energies towards finding a just solution to the Middle East problem. We are even more encouraged to hear that the process of finding a just solution is continuing and will continue until the whole Middle East problem is resolved. We welcome the disengagement agreements and the separation of forces in the Middle East but  as is universally acknowledged  and rightly so  disengagement is only a point of departure. A just and durable peace in the Middle East will emerge only with the return of the illegally occupied territories  territories acquired by force  to the countries to which they legally belong  the return of the Palestinian people to their homeland  and  equally important  the end of Israeli occupation of the holy city of Jerusalem.319.	My delegation has always maintained that the crux of the Middle East problem is the question of Palestine. Today the Palestinians still continue to endure the existence of camp-living and enforced exile. Today the Palestinians are still denied their inalienable rights to self-determination. It is in an effort to redress this situation  to see that justice is done  that my delegation whole-heartedly supports the inclusion of the item entitled ""Question of Palestine"" on the agenda. It is also my delegation's hope that the item will be deliberated in the plenary meeting of the General Assembly  and that it will be brought up at the earliest possible opportunity   in order that the problem may be given the greater hearing and greater attention which it deserves. But above all it is my delegation's hope that it will remind us of the urgent task facing the international community and lead us to take speedy action to hasten the process of finding a just solution to the problem.320.	In many areas of the world the process of decolonization has yet to run its full course. In this regard we welcome the new and positive attitude adopted by the new Portuguese Government. Its willingness to recognize the independence of Guinea-Bissau and to concede the right of self-determination and independence of the peoples of Mozambique and Angola is an important contribution to the cause of decolonization in Africa and the world.321.	While my delegation welcomes the constructive and positive attitude of the new Portuguese Government  the action already taken by it in regard to the independence of Guinea-Bissau and the action which it promised to take in the future in regard to the self-determination and independence of Mozambique and Angola all salutary action which  we are confident  will contribute greatly to global peace and security my delegation is  however  constantly reminded that in South Africa and in Southern Rhodesia white minority regimes representing nothing but their own selfish interests and pursuing policies that are inhuman and abhorrent continue to remain in power. The brutality and injustice that are being committed in South Africa and in Southern Rhodesia  the systematic denial of human rights to the vast majority of Africans  permit no ambiguity of attitude towards apartheid. There can be no shade of grey in regard to a policy designed solely for the purpose of perpetuating domination of and discrimination against peoples whose skins happen to be black by those whose skins happen to be white. To refuse to condemn the regimes in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia is to condone their evil policies. To allow them to persist in maintaining their evil policies and to continue with their repressive actions is to allow them to erode the foundation of peace and security in that continent. And so long as South Africa remains in Namibia  so long as these racist regimes are allowed to exist  so long will peace remain but a promise. We would like to urge  therefore  that those who have it in their power to assist in removing these institutions of injustice should not claim powerlessness to do anything.322.	Events that have recently taken place on the Indian subcontinent gave us reason to rejoice. Within the improved climate and in the spirit of detente we see the fruition of continuing dialog and constructive relations. And we earnestly hope that what has already been set in motion will continue and pave the way for greater co-operation among all the countries in that region e id in the process will lead to the resolution of all the remaining problems.323.	It is in the same spirit that my delegation views the Korean question. We continue to urge that the constructive dialog already begun  but regrettably interrupted  will be resumed at the earliest opportunity. We acknowledge again the many difficulties that have to be faced by both sides  but we who enjoy friendly relations with both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea strongly believe that while there is dialog there is hope for the reconciliation of their differences that may finally lead to the reunification of the two Koreas. Any progress in this area will contribute further to the already improved climate in the international political scene.324.	But  while we recognize the improvement so far achieved  we also realize this is no time to be complacent  to be lulled by the new sense of reduced insecurity. If the dangerous antagonism of the major Powers has been reduced  the pursuit of aggression and confrontation and conflict is still very much a painful part of the present in many areas of the world.325.	In Viet Nam  despite the agreement to end the war  a war is still in progress. Although it is now less devastating  it is no less tragic. We continue to consider the agreement to be a realistic basis for the settlement of the problem and  more importantly  a basis for the building of peace in our part of the world. We continue  therefore  to urge its strict implementation and the adherence to it of all concerned. And we stress again that the people of Viet Nam themselves must be allowed to determine their own future without any interference from outside.326.	It is in this same spirit .that we view the problems confronting the people of the Khmer Republic. My delegation's dearest wish for the people of the Khmer Republic is the speedy return of peace to their country . The problem of the Khmer Republic  as my country sees it from close proximity- both Malaysia and the Khmer Republic being in the South-East Asian region- is basically a problem of contending leaderships and is  in my delegation's view  a problem that only the people of the Khmer Republic may determine. Herein lies a fundamental principle which throughout the length and breadth of our deliberations on this issue must never be lost sight of. The United Nations  whose principal mandate is the fostering and preservation of peace  should never allow itself to take positions that would be incompatible with this high ideal. This august body  in its anxious pursuit of peace  should not allow itself to disregard the very fine lines that are drawn between positions that are permissible and positions that are not.327.	It is my delegation's view that the Assembly should remind itself that  should it not tread with the utmost caution in the matter of the Khmer Republic's representation in this body  it stands in grave danger of compromising a sacrosanct principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign  independent State. The United Nations can best contribute to the well-being of the Khmer people and nation by expressing its genuine anxiety for the return of peace to that country and by affording every assistance within its power to the Khmer people to resolve their problem themselves.328.	Although tension and insecurity in old areas of conflict have been reduced  new ones have arisen. Recently  death and destruction have descended upon the island  of Cyprus. This conflict is no less tragic and no less a threat to world peace. It is clear that a satisfactory solution in this instance must be left to the decision of the parties immediately involved. We are therefore encouraged by the fact that the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus have met and  as a result  the humanitarian aspects of the problem have to a certain extent  been negotiated and agreed upon  much to the relief of those directly involved. My delegation in this regard would like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for the timely initiatives he has taken  initiatives which  in a sense  represent the continuing role that the United Nations plays and must play. But the prospect for peace in Cyprus remains dim. My delegation therefore urges that all parties concerned direct their efforts most urgently towards the early resolution of this problem in a just manner.329.	If I now turn to the subject of disarmament* it is because my delegation attaches great importance to it. I would once again like to reiterate my Government's support for a World disarmament conference under the auspices of the United Nations and Would welcome positive efforts towards the convening of such a world conference. It may be fanciful now to speak of fear of a nuclear war. But let us not lose sight of the fact that nuclear weapons are Still with us  that their capabilities are being constantly improved upon  that their possession is within the reach of an ever-increasing number of nations. The existence of nuclear weapons ensures that their use remains a possibility  however remote. The continuing development of such weapons of mass destruction and their acquisition by more countries increases the possibility of their utilization. Even if the threat of a nuclear fall-out that would destroy us all has lessened  the threat to the environment as a result of a fall-out from the ""limited"" nuclear tests has not. We must urgently seek an end to. the suicidal course that we seem to have embarked upon; to fail to work towards disarmament now is to agree to face destruction in the future.330.	We welcome  in particular  the initiatives designed to create nuclear-free zones and zones of peace in various regions of the world  similar to our own aspirations to make South-East Asia a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality  for they reflect the real desire and represent one of the many efforts by nations to contribute towards a more stable international order.331.	.We believe that the primary responsibility for contributing towards peace and stability in one region of the world should rest with those countries that belong to the region. Moved by such considerations  Malaysia  together with its immediate neighbors which are also members of the Association of SouthEast Asian Nations  has embarked upon a program of study and consultation to establish a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality in South-East Asia.332.	Our own proposal  which is embodied in the Declaration of Kuala Lumpur  as the Assembly has been informed on previous occasions  seeks within the context of the prevailing improved international political climate to prevent South-East Asia from being an arena for major-Power conflict. It seeks also to enhance co-operation among States in.the region  and further seeks to develop a sense of regionalism  so that all who belong to the region need not fee! nor find themselves in a hostile environment. We hope to evolve from this a solidarity that will prevent our differences assuming proportions which  in the past  have resulted in their exploitation by others outside the region  to our terrible cost.333.	While we continue to support proposals for the establishment of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace  and while we continue to be sympathetic to such proposals  it is also my delegation's view that such proposals and initiatives should first have the support of countries in the proposed zone. Convinced of our belief that the creation of nuclear-free zones and zones of peace will contribute greatly to global peace and security  Malaysia stands ready to give support and encouragement to similar initiatives and proposals by others.334.	We would expect also that the major Powers  which are equally convinced and equally concerned with global peace and security  would likewise support and encourage any such proposals and contribute positively towards their implementation. My Government  therefore  views with grave concern and deeply deplores the increasing military and naval activities of the major Powers in the Indian Ocean. Adherence to and respect for the United Nations declaration of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean [resolution 2832 (XXVI) by the major Powers is imperative.335.	While efforts have been made to reduce the risks of war in the pursuit of peace  no comparable effort has been made to solve the economic and social problems facing the world. On the one hand  thereis the problem of spiraling inflation which continues to pose a serious threat to world economic and financial stability as each nation tries its own method of coping with it. On the other  there are the problems posed by the realignment and floating of exchange rates  the rise in the price of fuel  shortages of food grains and fertilisers  and a slow-down in the growth rates of the industrial countries. For the developing countries  these problems have been compounded by a drop in prices of many of their primary commodities. When the prices of these commodities had been high  they had helped to cushion the effects of inflation. But now  as the prices haye come down  and the prices of capital goods imported from developed countries remain high  the burden imposed upon the developing countries has become intolerable.336.	The problem of how to cope with inflation is indeed a complex one  especially as there is no single agreed method of arresting it. Wage and price costs and their effects on employment make it an acute political problem for all nations. Furthermore  the problem cannot be treated in isolation  for whatever measures are taken by the industrialized countries in particular  developing countries will be invariably affected. Never before has the world community been faced with a problem of such magnitude during peace-time.337.	We in the developing countries are most concerned that while the developed countries grapple with the immediate problems posed by inflation  they will relegate to the background the more basic issues that have concerned us for well over two decades. Issues such as the attainment of the level of official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by 1975 by the developed countries; the reform of the international monetary system with greater participation by the developing countries; trade liberalization measures; remunerative prices; access for our primary commodities  semi-manufactures and manufactures to the markets of the developed countries  and a greater share in world trade are in need of urgent attention  in addition to the ever-present problems of hunger  disease  illiteracy and mass unemployment.338.	All these problems were given an airing once again at the sixth special session held here in April this year  on the initiative of the President of Algeria. This session was a landmark in the efforts of the developing countries to redress the imbalance in the economic relations between the developed and the developing world. At the meeting  the"" General Assembly unanimously agreed  by resolution 3201 (S-VI)  to establish a new international economic cfrder based on equity  sovereign equality  interdependence  common interests and co-operation among all States. In doing so  the Assembly clearly recognized that the old system  which had been established long before developing countries had become independent  was not adequate to meet the new challenges facing the world  especially the developing countries. The Assembly  therefore  proclaimed its united determination to work urgently for the establishment of a new economic order. This implied greater co-operation between developed and developing countries.339.	Increased co-operation is  in fact  imperative because the problems that we face are interrelated and their effects are world-wide. Any solution to them must be found in the global context. If there is to be genuine co-operation  then there is no doubt that it must be based on partnership and mutual advantage. It cannot be otherwise. However  it must be recognized that  according to the rules of the game  the developing countries are the handicapped ones and therefore deserving of preferential treatment and special consideration. If this is not recognized  then terms such as ""interdependence"" and ""mutuality of interests"" are merely euphemisms for the exploitation of the poor and the weak by the rich and the strong.340.	We have also very often heard that political will is necessary if developed countries are to fulfill their obligations and commitments under the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade and help create a truly new economic order. Indeed  the problem  in essence  is a political one  and the time has come for the developed countries to show greater statesmanship so as to translate the various resolutions  strategies  declarations and programs into actions. The problem is also a moral one  for the developed countries owe it to the developing countries  as their former colonial masters who exploited their human and natural resources  and thus built the foundations of their own prosperity  to bring about economic and social stability. As you  Mr. President  so eloquently put it in your address to us  ""However decisive the distribution of power may be  moral considerations also have their weight  and this weight can be decisive"" [2233rd meeting  para. 31].341.	One issue on which it is necessary to bring the political will to bear is the level of official development assistance. It has been known  for instance  that instead of reaching the prescribed target of 0.7 per cent  official development assistance has fallen to about 0.35 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries. In asking that that level be maintained or even increased  we are not asking the developed countries to give up their prosperity. What is asked of them  as Mr. McNamara  President of the World Bank  pointed out  is that they just dedicate a tiny fraction of their incremental income  that is  income over and above that which they enjoy that will accrue to them in the 1970s. The present problems that developed countries face should not be used as an argument against foreign aid  as these countries are in a stronger position to weather the storms they experience.342.	Developing countries  on the other hand  with a weak resistance  will only sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire of difficulties. Then even a salvage operation on a global scale will be too little  too late. Developed countries should consider that instead of giving millions for disaster assistance it would be more beneficial if the developing countries were instead granted fair and remunerative prices for their exports. This would have a greater salutary effect on the economies of developing countries. On the other hand  the rise in price of an essential import item or a decline in the price of their primary export can erase all the benefits they would get from foreign aid.343.	Another example of the ""aid fatigue"" is the response to the emergency operation launched by the Secretary-General in response to resolution3202 (S-Vl) to meet the immediate and urgent needs of the countries most seriously affected by the current crisis. To say the least  the response has been poor. It has been estimated that economic assistance to these countries would amount to US $3 000 to $4 000 million for the first 12 months. Yet bilateral and multilateral assistance already announced by Governments only amounts to $1 000 million.344.	On the question of external assistance for agriculture in developing countries to help alleviate the food crisis  it has been estimated that assistance in the years ahead would have to be increased to $5 000 million from the $1 500 million that is currently available. It has been mentioned that more than 460 million people are ""permanently hungry"" and their capacity for living a normal life cannot be realized. At least 40 per cent of them are children. The question we ask is  what sort of a world are we building for these children?345.	The World Bank carries an even more ominous warning in its report for 1974  in which it forecasts that many developing countries will experience a decline in their gross national product growth rates below the 6 per cent target set for the International Development Strategy and that for the poorest countries the growth rates will be so low that per capita incomes will either be stagnant or rise very little between now and 1980. For these countries  especially those with high population growth rates  the prospects look terrifying indeed. The report also talks about the bleak prospects of mobilizing additional capital and says:""It appears almost inevitable that at least in the short run  the flow of concessionary aid will decline even further in real terms. This will happen at a time when the needs of countries which depend heavily upon such aid will be greater than ever.""What prospects do these countries have for social and economic development?346.	President Ford of the United States of America said in his address before the Assembly that ""we need new approaches to international co-operation to respond effectively to the problems we face"" [2234th meeting  para. 22].347.	Yet the Secretary-General in his press conference given on the eve of this session said  ""there was not a trend towards better international co-operation  but rather a trend back again to nationalism . . ."".348.	It is clear therefore that What we really need is a firm commitment from the developed countries that they will negotiate in earnest and genuinely have the interests and the welfare of the developing countries at heart. Nowhere is this more applicable than in the multilateral trade negotiations  where the whole question of an improvement in the trade position of the developing countries is being discussed. Progress on these negotiations has been slow. We in Malaysia set great store by these negotiations because our export trade constitutes more than 40 per cent of our gross national product. Yet the multilateral trade negotiations  for example  have barely got off the ground  though they are to be concluded by 1975. Further delays in the negotiations are expected while developed countries preoccupy themselves with their own problems. Such delays  as our Prime Minister pointed out when he addressed the special session of ILO in Geneva in June this year  are ""morally untenable. He called on the developed countries to negotiate in earnest with the developing countries.349.	Progress in bringing about reforms of the international monetary system has also been slow. In calling for an early reform of the monetary system we  together with the other developing countries  have called for greater participation by the developing countries in the decision-making process  the establishment of a link between special drawing rights and additional development finance and the transfer of real resources from the developed to the developing countries. These issues  important as they are  seem to be overshadowed by the current developments on the financial scene. Yet the need for these reforms could not have been greater.350.	The negotiations on the charter of economic rights and duties of states have also been stalled because of the lack of agreement on such key questions as the permanent sovereignty over natural resources  foreign investments  transnational corporations  nationalizations and compensation. The charter will be an important document governing  the economic relations between States. iSuccess in settling the outstanding issues depends on whether a political decision has been reached by some of the countries concerned to proceed with finalizing the charter. Otherwise the discussion of this item at this session could turn out to be another long drawn-out affair with little progress to report at the end.351.	We seem to have reached a stalemate in our efforts to establish a more just and equitable socio-economic order. We all know how this is to be achieved. It only remains for the developed countries to change their attitudes so that we can break this stalemate. We are encouraged by the fact that a few of these countries have come out in support of the aspirations and hopes of the developing counties and have taken concrete steps to fulfill their commitments and obligations. The efforts of such countries are worthy of our praise. This leads us to believe that all is not yet lost.352.	If we are to build a durable structure of peace  it is imperative not only to improve the political climate but  along with it  to make a genuine attempt to achieve economic and social justice for the developing countries. Otherwise  as the Secretary-General pointed out in his introduction to the report on the work of the Organization  We will risk destroying even the very gains made on the political front and usher in a new period of desperation  chaos and confrontation. We believe that there is too much at stake to allow this to happen. Malaysia pledges to do all it can within its means  and asks that others do the same."
"87",5038,"NER",29,1974,"I should like first of all  Mr. President  to offer you  on behalf of my delegation  our warmest congratulations on your election to the important post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. That choice is o^ particular significance to my delegation: first  because you represent Algeria  a country with which Niger has for many centuries enjoyed relationships of friendship and cooperation and  secondly  because your personal qualities and complete understanding of international problems are a sure guarantee that this Assembly's work will be fruitful.211.	I also wish to associate my country and my delegation with the well-deserved congratulations ad-dressed to Mr. Leopoldo Benites  the representative of Ecuador  who presided over the work of the twenty- eighth session with remarkable skill and courtesy.212.	I likewise wish to express to the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the great confidence my country feels in having him conduct the affairs of our Organization. His recent journey to the drought- stricken Sahelian countries and his swift and timely action in both the Middle East and the Mediterranean area are  for my Government  further demonstrations of his constant interest in the grave problems that regularly afflict our world.213; I should like  first  to address the delegation of Honduras and to offer the full sympathy of the Government and people of Niger because of the catastrophe that has so cruelly struck that country. The people of Niger  who have just suffered through six years of natural disaster  feel for that reason particularly close to the people of Honduras and have no difficulty in understanding the impact of that catastrophe and  above all  the difficulties it has caused in their attempts to rehabilitate their national economy.214.	On behalf of the Supreme Military Council and the Government of the Republic of Niger  I should like to voice here the satisfaction I feel at the admission to this Organization of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. My country is most gratified at the decision taken by the General Assembly. We are deeply convinced that the admission of the People's Republic of Bangladesh to the United Nations will help prevent any new war in the Indian subcontinent and  consequently  will further the strengthening of international peace and security.215.	My delegation likewise welcomes the admission of Grenada to the great family of the United Nations. The presence of Grenada among us is added proof that our Organization is becoming truly universal.216.	Another great source of satisfaction to my delegation is the admission of the sister Republic of Guinea- Bissau to full membership in the United Nations. My country has special reasons for considering its admission as an historic event. In our view  it is the culmination of many years of struggle against colonialism. The brilliant victory that the people of Guinea- Bissau has just won honors not only all the peoples of Africa  but also ail men who reject the domination of one people by another.217.	It is for this reason that l wish to assure the delegation of Guinea-Bissau of the high esteem felt by the people of Niger for the people of their country  a people that has shown exemplary courage and unshakable tenacity. Amilcar Cabral  a hero who has become a legend throughout all of Africa  will remain forever graven in our memories. Now  as his country achieves independence  it is with great emotion that we recall the immense sacrifice of that valiant son of Africa.218.	My delegation followed with particular attention the statement delivered from this rostrum by Mr. Mario Soares  the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal  specifically when he said:""With respect to the other Territories  in accordance with the declaration made during the visit of Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim to Lisbon  Portugal has solemnly reaffirmed what its constitutional laws already guarantee: that it fully recognizes the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. Portugal is therefore ready to apply the United Nations decisions to that effect  reaffirming also the fulfillment of its obligations arising from Chapter XI of the United Nations Charter and General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  which contains the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  as well as resolutions referring to Territories under Portuguese administration."" [2239th meeting  para. 116.]219.	May I most heartily welcome this new unequivocal position that at once does honor to those who hold it and to the new Portugal as a whole. The Government of Niger is reconsidering its relations with the new Government of Portugal. In so doing  we realize we can help speed up the process of decolonization.220.	The example of firmness set by the new Portugal in respect of recent events in Mozambique should serve to inspire those who claim that nothing can be done in Rhodesia. Many problems of Africa could thus find solutions in keeping with the aspirations of the oppressed peoples.221.	I take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the freedom fighters  to all those who have given their lives  to all those who are still stubbornly fighting so that their peoples may finally regain their dignity and freedom.222.	That part of the African continent unfortunately still remains the scene of massacres  imprisonments and harassments of all sorts inflicted on populations that have already suffered so greatly. The policy of apartheid  so often denounced here and elsewhere  is a defiance hurled in the face of the international community  and of our Organization in particular  by the racist and anachronistic regime of Pretoria and the illegal minority Government of Rhodesia. We are in duty bound to take up that challenge. Thus  my delegation appeals most urgently again to all the Powers that directly or indirectly support those Governments  calling upon them to come to their senses and condemn these racist  colonialist regimes that are justly regarded as historical anomalies. That challenge we shall take up sooner or later  alone or with the understanding or the participation of the international community  even if it means the sacrifice of more African lives.223.	As regards the sensitive problem of the Spanish Sahara  my delegation has noted with satisfaction and relief the statements made here by the Foreign Ministers of Morocco [2249th meeting] and Mauritania [2251st meeting]  two sister African countries interested in the solution to that problem. My delegation is therefore pleased to learn that the present trend is towards arbitration. Niger can only encourage such attitudes where disputes among nations are settled in peace and harmony  particularly disputes among sister African countries. This is fully consistent with African tradition and wisdom.224.	My country  ever anxious to promote peace in the continent as well as in the world  has set for itself  as a guide-line in its foreign policy: friendship with its immediate neighbors  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  non-alignment vis-a-vis all blocs and the establishment of friendly relations with all peace- and justice-loving countries. Thus  in the Ave months since the National Army took command in my country  the new Government  as one of its tasks  is determined to strengthen its friendly and good- neighborly relations with the countries around it.Because the people of Niger have no warlike designs on its neighbors and that it does not consider any of them to be an enemy  the Government of Niger has denounced all defense agreements linking it with other countries and has condemned the stationing of any foreign troops in other countries.225.	Likewise  the new Government of my country  as part of its policy to establish friendly relations with all peace- and justice-loving countries  has decided to normalize its relations with the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  which are countries that have always fought for the emancipation of peoples oppressed by imperialism and colonialism. Within this framework the policies of my country will be to extend a hand  without any exception  to all those who  through their international attitudes  share our ideals of peace  equality and co-operation.226.	Our concern to maintain peace in the world and our concern for peaceful coexistence  prompt us to view with some anxiety the recent developments in Cyprus which are an additional source of tension amongst the major Powers.227.	We are pleased here to pay a particular tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization  whose efforts have led the two Cypriot communities to start talks  the only means in our opinion  here or elsewhere  to find a just and equitable solution to any dispute. Also  we should like to extend our warm congratulations to all who have given substantial humanitarian aid to the Cypriot communities.228.	We fervently hope that Cyprus will find peace in harmony and that this will take place in the enlightened self-interest of the Cypriot people as a whole. To this end we would express the hope that the leaders of the two communities will continue their dialog with the assistance of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  in keeping with resolution 361 (1974)  adopted by the Security Council on 30 August.229.	As regards Korea  my country fully supports all efforts exerted by both parties to settle peacefully their conflict free from all pressure or foreign intervention. Foreign intervention in some countries is still present in our minds and reminds us that the desire for hegemony and interference are the main source of conflicts in today's world.230.	My country is now more than ever before convinced that the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries should be the corner-stone of the foreign policy of all the States of the inter-national community. The disturbances in South-East Asia is a striking example of this interference. All the hopes born of the Viet Nam agreements remain  regrettably  unfulfilled. Viet Nam and Cambodia  for instance  continue to suffer as they have been suffering for decades  and look to the international community for more co-operation and peace than armaments.231.	While there are still trouble spots on the inter-national arena  we nevertheless remain optimistic. Indeed  we are pleased and reassured that detente has become a reality among parties to conflict. We should like  however  to reaffirm our unfailing support for the cause of the Arab nation  because we are firmly convinced that a just and durable peace will prevail in the Middle East only if Israel abandons its expansionist policy and withdraws from the occupied Arab territories  in accordance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967.232.	My delegation will of course also support any resolution which recognizes the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination and the recovery of all the territories of which they have been dis-possessed.233.	While my country is generally concerned with the maintenance of peace in the world  its greatest concern is none the less the many problems of development. Priority naturally goes to the relentless struggle that the Supreme Military Council has decided to wage to assist the populations that have been victims of the drought. For us it is first and foremost a matter of eliminating all the after-effects of this disaster  which has so severely struck our country  using our own resources and those that international solidarity is good enough to make available to us.234.	Niger has just suffered the most terrible of natural disasters. The drought has lasted six long years. It has killed 80 per cent of the country's livestock. It has prevented all harvests for six years. It has burnt pastureland and young trees. It has lowered the water-table to a depth which could never have been imagined. Trees are dead; men and cattle  when possible  have fled. The sands of the desert have swept over vast areas. My country is slowly drying up  whereas elsewhere deserts are greening. The people of Niger  so proud and so dignified  are compelled to await a generous gesture from their brothers in the international community.235.	We are determined never to have to witness this humiliating spectacle again. The events of April 1974 are in keeping with that decision. Our economy  which has been shattered  must be rebuilt and the Supreme Military Council is tackling this colossal task with an awareness of the scanty resources of the country and the amount of the international assistance necessary for it to succeed in this huge task. It can rely on its voluntarily mobilized popular masses to achieve precise objectives. That is the price we must pay for national reconstruction. However  it will take time and will require technical and financial assistance from the international community.236.	May I take this opportunity to thank all the friendly countries  national and international organizations  public and private  that have shown concern for the fate of the Sahelian countries. Their immediate response to the food shortage has been deeply appreciated by our people. It is on behalf of those people  who during the last year have at last found reason to hope again  thanks to the rain that is now falling there  that I express my profound gratitude.237.	That food assistance should continue  and we are grateful to those countries which  within their agricultural policies  have considered expanding their aid. Our populations still need it  for it is not possible  even with a year's sustained efforts  to remedy the cumulative effects of a long drought that has sown devastation  misery and death everywhere.238.	Over and above food assistance  we should thoroughly reappraise the problem. To eat fish is all very well and good  but to learn how to fish is to ensure one's future and independence and to regain one's dignity. My Government earnestly hopes that the economic reconstruction program for the Sahelian countries will be studied with interest by all those with the means to participate.239.	We do not underestimate the seriousness of the economic difficulties that have been plaguing the world for some time now. But the energy crisis must not become a pretext for ignoring our cause. We are feeling the effects of inflation even more keenly; and this inflation is due solely to the lopsided policy of economic expansion needlessly pursued by certain Governments. The increase in the prices of raw materials  wrongly labeled as an evil  is merely incidental. Indeed  it is a welcome happenstance in fact in that it has curbed the constant widening of the gap between the developed countries and those of the third world. Some were getting rich at the expense of the weakest. The restoration of the balance should not open the way for blackmail or for justification of the negative attitudes which some have been tempted to take. There are historical responsibilities that one cannot evade without running the risk of being discredited.240.	I cannot conclude this statement without mentioning the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the World Population Conference. My country is a land-locked one. Nevertheless  it has an even greater interest than others in everything that concerns the problems of the law of the sea. For us the sea is a link between continents and people; it is also a source of new resources for mankind. The most technically and technologically developed countries should renounce the appropriation of its resources  and no longer  in the name of a pseudo-right of force  take what belongs to all. Indeed  we cannot shut our eyes to the scandal that is brewing and that is likely to occur next year in Geneva. That scandal would lie in finding ourselves powerless  at the end of this twentieth century  to prevent a partition of the sea that would permit only the countries capable of engaging in the exploitation of its resources to benefit therefrom. Raw materials are far from being inexhaustible  and no one can assume the right to monopolize the common heritage of mankind.241.	My delegation suggests that the resources of the sea  when they are part of the common heritage  should be set aside  all proceeds therefrom to go into a development fund for the benefit of the most impoverished countries. We are convinced that the resources of the sea-bed can well serve to help countries out of their underdevelopment rather than to widen still further the gap in the living standards dividing the industrialized countries and those of the third world.242.	As for the World Population Conference  held in Bucharest  my Government is of the view that the population growth on our planet vis-a-vis the growth in food resources is actually only a subject of concern for a few Malthusians who tremble at the idea of losing the insolent material comforts that they cannot do without. Such thinking is likely to have an adverse effect on development assistance. My country is convinced that man  while not necessarily a sacred being among other creatures  should continue to be the main object of care from his society. There is global development and selective development. Family planning programs can be envisaged only at a relatively high level of living. Why not give everyone -every couple- on earth the hope of developing  understanding and choosing?243.	In conclusion  let me express all the faith and hope that my country places in our Organization in its efforts to ensure the maintenance of peace on our planet and to promote co-operation among all nations of the world. But everyone in this Assembly is aware of the threats to this fragile peace and this co-operation that has not yet found its true path. The arms race is a real peril which we cannot forget and which must constantly be dendUnced. It compromises the development of our countries by diverting vast resources to hastening the apocalypse; it makes peace more remote when selfish interests are at stake  when the fate of humankind remains subject to the will of certain Powers  unless wisdom can prevail to halt this frenzied race immediately and destroy the existing arms stockpiles.244.	Those  in brief  are the few thoughts that my Government has charged me to put forward at this twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly."
"88",5083,"NGA",29,1974,"On behalf of the Nigerian delegation  I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Your election is an appropriate recognition of your personal qualities as a statesman  an international diplomat and a fighter for human dignity. More importantly  your election symbolizes international recognition of the role of Algeria and its respected President  Houari Boumediene  in the struggle for equality  the right to self-determination and human dignity. It is a fortunate coincidence that you should be presiding over this crucial session  which will be faced with taking follow-up action on the decisions of the sixth special session  held as a result of the initiative of the President of your great country.2.	This session  which was devoted exclusively to the question of raw materials and development  was the culmination of a universal concern for the disastrous prospects of the existing international economic order. At that session resolution 3201 (S-VI) was adopted  which spoke of our united determination to work urgently for the establishment of a new international economic order based on equity  sovereign equality  interdependence  common interest and co-operation among all States.3.	In that resolution we accepted then that the developing countries  which constitute 70 per cent of the world's population  account for only 30 per cent of the world's income. We declared that in order to safeguard every country's natural resources  each State is entitled to exercise effective control over them and their exploitation and that no State may be subjected to economic  political or any other type of coercion to prevent the free and full exercise of this inalienable right.4.	The Assembly also pronounced itself on the need to regulate and supervise the activities of transnational corporations by taking measures in the interest of the national economies of the countries where such transnational corporations operate  on the basis of the full sovereignty of those countries; and finally  among other matters  the Assembly declared itself in favor of a just and equitable relationship between the prices of raw materials  primary commodities  and manufactured goods exported by developing countries and the prices of raw materials  primary commodities  manufactured goods  capital goods and imported equipment  with the aim of bringing about sustained improvement in the unsatisfactory terms of trade and the expansion of the world economy.5.	This resolution was adopted on 1 May 1974 as the basis for the establishment of a new international economic order. But only six months later  some of the countries which participated in the adoption of that resolution want to jettison the historic Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order which it contains.6.	One primary commodity -crude oil- has been singled out and made the villain of the piece; and the oil-producing countries are being pilloried before the bar of this Assembly as the culprits of international inflation and the wreckers of the national economies of the great wealthy nations. There is even talk of bringing back the gunboat to get oil prices reduced. Is it not sad that the international community continues to use nineteenth-century methods to solve late- twentieth-century international problems?7.	Of course  the price of oil has increased sevenfold  but even more so have the prices of wheat  automobiles  steel  cement  every type of machinery and every piece of electronic equipment. Stated bluntly  the argument of those who say that if only oil prices were reduced then inflation would be checked means that the highly industrialized countries are not prepared to make any sacrifice in the phenomenally high standard of living of their peoples in order to promote the development of the developing countries and ensure the adequate flow of real resources to those countries.8.	It is true that the non-oil-producing developing countries are the least able to pay the foreign exchange bill demanded by high oil prices; but that is precisely the reason why there has been so much consultation in recent months between countries of the third world for the purpose of working out mutual assistance agreements and the establishment of special facilities to assist the most hard-hit countries. That is the reason why oil-producing countries  like my own  in spite of their development needs  are responding to international appeals for multilateral assistance to the hardest hit. 9.	In the sixth special session the Assembly recognized the role of transnational corporations in the fashioning of a new international economic order. The Nigerian delegation had hoped that at this session proposals would be brought forward for the reform of the policies and practices of transnational corporations to enable them to conform and assist in promoting the new international economic order. If we take that most abused commodity  crude oil  we know that transnational corporations  which control the oil industry  hold national governments to ransom on oil prices. It is common knowledge that for every dollar which the producer country earns  the international oil companies earn between 7 and 10 dollars. National governments seem incapable of controlling  in the interest of their citizens  the profits made by oil companies operating in their countries. Is this not a problem which requires international co-operation within the United Nations system for its solution?10.	Next  I must ask how we are going to establish a just and equitable relationship between the prices of raw materials  primary products and manufactured goods if we cannot ""set our sights"" above the current price of oil. It is my delegation's hope that the Assembly at this session will devote a considerable part of its effort to working out the implementation of the two resolutions adopted at the sixth special session  for  in the words of the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization:""There can be no doubt that the nature and quality of life for future generations on this planet depends  as never before  on the ability of the community of nations to co-operate and plan effectively for the future in the common interest of all"" [Al960llAdd.l  sect. /].11.	The full impact of the special session at which the Assembly sought to put world economic relation-ships in their proper perspective will take many years to unfold  but I want to assure you even now that the Nigerian Government takes very seriously the solemn resolve of Members of the United Nations to work for the establishment of a new international economic order. The Program of Action adopted at the special session [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] outlined what is to be done in order to bring about that new order. It calls on the international community to replace an outmoded and lopsided structure of international economic relations with one based on full recognition of mutual interdependence and respect for the mutual interests of all parties. To do this  we must possess the political wisdom to recognize the need for change in our mental attitudes so that those who hitherto have been used to having every issue settled on their own terms can become accustomed to recognizing the legitimate aspirations of others. Inflation and supply shortages are real problems which we must deal with co-operatively and in a spirit of realism and mutual understanding  bearing in mind that we are living in a period of change  and that a period of change is sometimes accompanied by inconveniences to which we must learn to adjust. We must tackle these inconveniences through co-operation  not through confrontation.12.	Nowhere has the period of change manifested itself more clearly than on the continent of Africa  over the past year. About this time last year the people of Guinea-Bissau  through their  authentic representatives  the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC]  took their fate in their own hands and declared their independence. We are happy that today the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is a proud Member of the United Nations  thus fulfilling the prophetic message which my head of State  General Yakubu Gowon  sent to the Heads of State of the Organization of African Unity [OAU] in 1971  namely  that within three years from that date at least one African Territory must be liberated from colonial bondage. The spirit of? liberation has gathered far more momentum than was anticipated in 1971  and we are happy to note the change in Mozambique  which has resulted in the installation in that country of a government of nationalists  poised to assume full sovereignty in 1975. We pray that the efforts towards conciliation which are now going on in Angola will result in the assumption of full sovereignty by that potentially great country before long. The Government and people of Nigeria congratulate the liberation movements of these countries on their sacrifices and their achievements. I should also like to place on record my Government's appreciation of the courage and wisdom of the masses of the Portuguese people in realizing that their long-lost freedom was inexorably bound up with the freedom of the peoples of southern Africa  who for 50 years had been the victims of political domination by a neo-Fascist clique from Portugal. I should also congratulate the new Portuguese Government for giving firm support to the new Mozambique Government in crushing the futile white minority coup in that country. One hopes that the lesson of the Portuguese Government's action will not be lost on their oldest allies  who continue to equivocate on Rhodesia.13.	These developments in Portuguese-held territories must give this Organization tremendous satisfaction. The support which the United Nations gave to Africa and the national liberation movements was indispensable for the final liquidation of Portuguese imperialism in Africa. However  vigilance is still required to ensure that the few reactionary elements in both Portugal and Angola and Mozambique are not permitted to reverse or even slow down the process of Portuguese decolonization.14.	Regrettably  Namibia still remains in the fetters of South Africa's illegal occupation. The well-organized brutalities practiced on the indigenous population of Namibia in the hope of destroying their fight for freedom can be matched only by the Nazi horrors of the first half of this century. For how long will the United Nations watch such horrors helplessly? For how long will the Organization shy away from the firm measures that are needed to assert United Nations authority over Namibia? I do not believe that anyone here is still in doubt as to the unwillingness of the Vorster regime to withdraw gracefully from Namibia. Unless  therefore  this Organization is prepared to acquiesce in the illegal seizure of Namibia by South Africa  prompt and decisive action should be taken now to end South Africa's continuing defiance of the authority of the United Nations over Namibia. As in Namibia so in Zimbabwe; time is running out for the minority white oligarchies. One must pray that the white minorities in both Territories will choose the alternative of co-operation in a multiracial society before the deluge.15.	Before ending my remarks on decolonization  I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the two other new Members of the Organization on their accession to membership and to the Charter. I refer  of course  to the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Grenada  both of which share membership of yet another organization with my country. Let me assure them that both in this and in every other forum my country will work in co-operation with -them for the achievement of international understanding and co-operation.16.	The brief interlude of comparative calm in the Middle East since the cease-fire after the October 1973 battle has created the impression that the Middle East conflict can now be resolved by a meeting in Geneva between the big Powers and the adversaries  and that we  the small countries of the world  need play no role beyond that of cheer-leaders in the power game called the Middle East crisis. If doing nothing more than cheering the players could bring real peace in that area and  by implication  peace of mind to the peoples of the African region  my country would be happy to do just that and no more. Unfortunately  this attitude is based on a fallacy. That is why my delegation welcomes the inclusion in our agenda for this session of the question of Palestine [item 108]  and the opportunity of a full debate on what the international community understand by the phrase ""Reaffirms the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine"" contained in General Assembly resolution 2535 B (XXIV) of 10 December 1969. Furthermore  the General Assembly ought to state what is meant by returning to the Arabs ""the lands occupied by Israel as a result of the 6 June 1967 war  as stated in Security Council resolution 242 (1967).17.	One would have thought that these phrases would mean what they say. However  they have been subject to such varying interpretations that  unless agreement is reached by the parties on what resolution 242 (1967) means  months of meetings in Geneva will not bring the solution of the Middle East crisis any nearer. We should have no illusions about any solution which does not take into account the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Arab people on the one hand and the recognition that Israel is a reality  a nation which can make its own contributions to world peace  on the other. As for the Palestinians  the international community cannot continue indefinitely to acquiesce in their remaining permanent refugees. Four million people rendered homeless as a result of the struggle in their land cannot be allowed to continue to live without purpose and without hope. These are the issues which must be settled in Geneva. These are the issues on which this Assembly must pronounce  as guidance for those who sit round the conference table in Geneva.18.	Reference to the situation in the Middle East cannot but draw attention to that unhappy island State  Cyprus. Whatever may be the rights and wrongs of the parties to the tragic drama in that island  we in Nigeria are convinced that Cyprus must be enabled to continue as one undivided sovereign State  and that the citizens of the sovereign State of Cyprus must learn to live together under one sovereign government. What arrangement the peoples of Cyprus make to ensure the stability and territorial integrity of their country is a matter of their internal affairs. My delegation hopes that the United Nations will lend its authority to ensuring the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus.19.	The events of the past 12 months  whether political or economic  indicate more than ever before that at no other time in the history of mankind has the term ""village"" applied more appropriately to the world. It needs little perception  therefore  to recognize that this ""village"" world of ours has become too small for endless rampages. Peace in the world is as indivisible as its destiny. We live in challenging times  which equally offer us more opportunities to meet these challenges. Despite its weaknesses  the United Nations is one of man's greatest creations. It offers us a unique forum for sustaining universal peace and progress. Let all its Member States  there-fore  powerful and weak alike  exercise the political self-discipline necessary for them to adapt the Organization and its rules to meet their present-day needs.20.	I would like to end this statement with a tribute to the Secretary-General  whose courage and sense of mission have averted disaster after disaster in the past 12 months  whether in the Middle East  the Sahelian region  southern Africa or Cyprus.21.	May I add as a postscript my country' s sympathy for the victims of the disasters in Honduras and Peru."
"89",5129,"NIC",29,1974,"I wish to begin my statement with congratulations  on behalf of Nicaragua and of my delegation  and on my own behalf  to Mr. Bouteflika on his election to the presidency of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Mr. Bouteflika  distinguished gifts as a statesman and his prudent strength as a young diplomat assure us that he will fulfill his duties with skill and intelligence.214.	To his no less illustrious predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  I wish to extend  through our President  the expression of our deepest appreciation for the wise and effective manner in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly during the last two sessions. It brought great credit to his country  Ecuador  and to all of our Latin America.215.	I wish also to ask that our greetings be conveyed to the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim. We have followed with interest all he has done for the cause of peace and co-operation among peoples  and his efforts to maintain the Organization at the service of the lofty interests of mankind.216.	The disaster that recently struck our sister Republic of Honduras  which also to a lesser degree struck Guatemala and my own country  prompt me to give public expression of our condolences to the delegation of Honduras. The thousands of victims who lost their lives in the fury of the hurricane  the tens of thousands left homeless  and the material damages that have already been estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars  are for Honduras a most grave and distressing blow that can have very serious repercussions in the life of that Republic in the future.217.	In the area of Central America  there tan be no country which appreciates better than Nicaragua the gravity of the natural disaster that our sister Republic of Honduras has suffered  inasmuch as in 1972 an earthquake destroyed our capital city  causing great loss of life and material damage and leaving behind it problems which even today we are still trying stubbornly to overcome. We have had two years of constant work by the National Emergency Committee and of exemplary dedication on the part of the present President-Elect of Nicaragua  General Anastasio Somoza Debayle. But in spite of everything and in spite of the efforts being made day after day by the people of Nicaragua to overcome such painful realities  the mark of the tragedy still re-mains present in the economic and social life of our people.218.	In keeping with the fraternal bonds that unite the peoples of Honduras and Nicaragua  the Government and the people of my country have mobilized their effort while attending at the same time to those parts of our own country that were affected by the hurricane to bring our modest but relatively generous assistance to our brothers in Honduras. And in that task of assistance several heroic Nicaraguans have given their lives.219.	This new natural disaster that has struck the area of Central America brings out the special importance of the allocation to the Second Committee of the item entitled ""Assistance in cases of natural disaster and other disaster situations"" [agenda item 60]  the humanitarian aspects of which could be considered by the Third Committee during its consideration of item 12. Unfortunately  it would seem that the international community has failed adequately to understand the fact that the problem of natural disasters cannot continue to be treated as one involving only mercy and charity.220.	The concentration and the ever more rapid growth of population  the greater areas being brought under cultivation and incorporated in the economic life of communities  and the complexity of the economic and social system all mean that natural disasters produce massive problems which  through the disturbances and disruptions they create  affect not only the economic aspects but also the social  political and institutional aspects of national life.221.	Here we should like to refer to the third resolution adopted by the Committee of the Whole of the Economic Commission for Latin America.*1 It was adopted at the seventh extraordinary session to consider what action should be taken to help Nicaragua after the 1972 earthquake. It recommended the preparation of a regional plan for Latin America that would promote effective and orderly action in dealing with the disruptive effects  over the short term and medium term  of natural disasters.222.	Those countries which are situated along the so-called volcanic chain of the Pacific  particularly those countries of lesser economic and social development  and those with coasts on the Indian Ocean and in the Caribbean  as well as the countries of the Sahel  have been hit by an awesome number of natural catastrophes and have shown great vulnerability to the social and economic effects of these disasters.223.	The delegation of Nicaragua  with conviction born of our own distressing experience  cannot be satisfied with mere expressions of condolences for Honduras; urgent problems of a humanitarian nature must be tackled. I wish today to appeal to the international community  and particularly to Latin America  to confront the problems of Honduras and promote a broad program of reconstruction and development for the vast area affected; and I have instructed my delegation to remain open to whatever initiatives may be proposed to this end:224.	We also hope that the study of the item on natural disasters allocated to the Second Committee will lead to conclusions and positive action going beyond the mere passing expression of humanitarian sentiment.225.	There is another problem of ominous dimensions and serious consequences that directly afflicts societies whose land has been convulsed in the way described  although  perhaps  this problem is not limited only to them. I am referring to hunger  not to problems of nutrition  which can be an offshoot of affluence. I am speaking of the physical reality of eating to survive the elementary problem of existing and not the qualitative problem of living humanely. Indeed  hunger is a daily reality for one fifth of the population of the world.226.	The secretariat of the World Food Conference has recognized that the present food crisis is the most serious that mankind has faced in the past 40 yeafS. The immediate effects of this crisis have been shortages and higher prices of all foodstuffs and increases in the costs of services necessary to produce and market food. To that must be added the growing seriousness of the situation of the workers  the sharpening of tensions and difficulties in society  and the growing  widespread inflation  with all the social problems that it entails.227.	The situation becomes a tragedy when one appreciates the fact that the sectors most directly affected are not the affluent  but rather the less advantaged  sectors in all political systems: small landowners  small farmers and those who rent land  the rural landless  the unemployed of the cities and the countryside  and generally those with the least buying power in society  including a high percentage of infants and children.228.	Here again  my delegation hopes that this session of the General Assembly will put forward effective recommendations and that it will talk about the causes of the problem  about which something can be done. We must not content ourselves with merely saying that the artificial increase in the prices of raw materials has led to the higher prices of fertilizers which are necessary to produce food; we must also take a hard look at scientific research which is focused exclusively on these two choices; moreover  we must think about the decision-making process which has led to that situation  and we must also consider the economic problems and the cultural climate that produced the consumer habits that have created the problem. Just as the consideration of what may seem to be the cause of the problem leads to its underlying causes  so it might well be that remedies for these underlying causes may prove to be the best solution to the problem itself.229.	We are all well aware of the fact that the world has been living through a period of economic instability with serious repercussions. The persistence of under-development and the growing gap between the wealthy and poor countries are a noticeable result. The interminable escalation and succession of crises in the political  economic and social areas are symptoms. The energy crisis is one of the most dramatic  and it has indeed become the new villain on which the blame for all the ills of the latter part of the twentieth century has been heaped.230.	In discussing this crisis it is also necessary to talk about all its components. On the one hand  it is not entirely true that the crisis is due to the fact that the oil-producing countries have created a bloc and have tried to impose their economic views by taking advantage of their monopoly on one raw material. On the other hand  it is not entirely true either that the main reason for the crisis is that the producing countries could no longer tolerate the constant deterioration in the prices of their basic raw materials in the face of the constantly increasing prices of products they were importing  and  therefore  had to take defensive action for which they are being blamed today.231.	To our way of thinking  other equally important aspects of the problem must be pondered. Throughout the decades  international co-operation has been such as to make petroleum a fundamental element of modern civilization  and the production of energy has been a sector requiring high concentrations of capital and technology. For some time nowwe have been laying the groundwork for a very expensive monopoly  neglecting the development ; of alternative forms of technology that might use traditional sources of energy  such as hydraulic energy  which would have prevented a concentration of power in one sector where monopoly was possible.232.	In our view  alternatives to be sought in the future must not create an undue dependence on certain sources of energy that can be monopolized  such as oil and nuclear power; we must not concentrate on sectors requiring excessive concentrations of capital or technology. The important thing  however  is that we take an overall approach to the problem of development. At the sixth special session of the General Assembly held this year  the groundwork was laid for a program of international action  and consideration was given to the problems of development and international co-operation. We must realize that a major effort must be made to create a radically new economic order.233.	One of the corner-stones of such a new order  with which the Government of Mexico and the peoples of Latin America are so deservedly associated  should be the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which must enshrine norms and principles ensuring and orienting this new universal economic order: the integrity and inviolability of the physical and cultural heritage of peoples  effective sovereignty over national resources and economic development leading to tangible benefits for the people of the world; the regulation of foreign investment  particularly the investments of transnational companies  which must be a. tool for co-operation and progress and not a means of domination; the banning of economic pressure as a political weapon to be used against the sovereignty of States; and the right of nationalization and expropriation of property existing on national territory  regardless of the nationality of the owner.234.	This is a difficult task. Let us have no illusions about what we can achieve at one session of the General Assembly. There have been few occasions in history so fraught with danger and challenges  but it is in the very nature of things that the United Nations should confront these situations  and no one expects it to act hastily. The interests at stake are great indeed  the consequences of failure are serious  and we must not act with undue haste.235.	A very telling example of all this is what happened at the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. From the time it was convened we realized that the Caracas meeting would not be the end of the matter. We realized that it was not possible to reach decisions on substantive issues when practically 50 per cent of the participants had not taken part in the work of the Preparatory Committee  and the complexity of the task made it impossible for the Preparatory Committee to issue sufficient documentation and undertake the additional work of fully distributing it. However  there are those who clamor for speedy agreements and already speak in terms of the ""Caracas failure"".236.	I believe that it is appropriate to express here the gratitude of the Government of Nicaragua to the Government and the people of Venezuela for their invaluable efforts to create a propitious climatefor the important deliberations of the Conference  and to extend to its President  Mr. Amerasinghe  and the other officers of the Conference a vote of confidence and the congratulations of my country on the wise way the work was conducted.237.	It is my Government's firm belief that a mature approach  prudence and a knowledge of the facts alone can serve as the major elements in the work of reaffirmation and creation of law governing a more equitable international order. That is and was the framework of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It must promote the deliberations and efforts of the international community  which have already been begun  to regulate the proper use of the sea.238.	This cautious approach should not be abandoned in dealing with any of the other problems which beset mankind. The population problem is obviously a cultural problem which goes far beyond the sovereign authority of States and is closely related to individual human rights. International co-operation in this area must not be aimed at speedy results. While it is true that the immoderate growth of population creates economic and social problems which afflict our nations  it is also true that certain spiritual and political sectors say that not only should a brake be put on the growth of population  but its causes should be studied and uprooted and a more equitable order created.239.	International co-operation must not be aimed at perpetuating the status quo. It must be aimed at the genuine development of institutions. It must replace confrontation by procedures which will promote the action of the peoples of the world. After a quarter of a century of considering aggression solely in terms of military aggression  we now find that economic aggression and the attendant use of resources and financial institutions have moved to the forefront of international relations. There can be no doubt that  given its dangers and the risk of armed struggle to which economic aggression leads  the way to deal with it is not simply to define it but to proscribe the acts which express it.240.	That was  in fact  the course chosen by the major Powers in order to avoid the risk of armed confrontations among them. There were agreements such as those relating to disarmament  the prohibition of nuclear tests  increased co-operation in the peaceful use of a growing number of technological developments which had been used for the purpose of war. These are all practical measures which  while making it possible to avoid confrontation  created and strengthened a new sense of international morality which has become the hallmark of international relations.241.	There is no reason why the smaller countries of the world should adopt a different approach or different procedures. We must realize that confrontations have tended to shift to the smaller countries and have created an unnecessary market for armaments  diverting resources which are needed for the progress and well-being of our peoples and maintaining a climate of tension which in no way assists the principal tasks of development and progress.242.	The general situation in the Middle East deteriorated seriously last year with the outbreak of the crisis in Cyprus and the recrudescence of the Palestine question. My Government has always advocated a slow  cautious approach to the various points of view. We advocate careful negotiation and the use of peaceful procedures. In particular  in the case of Cyprus  my Government believes that the international community should do more than offer simple declarations of good will. Every aspect of the problem of Cyprus involves the risk of a confrontation and a violation of a basic principle of the Charter which cannot be ignored by our Organization. The right to self-determination  non-interference in the internal affairs of a country  territorial integrity  proper protection of minorities  and so on  are alt principles which must be maintained and protected  and that is the view which we must firmly uphold.243.	My delegation has noted with pleasure that the number of countries which wish their areas to be nuclear-free areas has increased. We welcome pressure to prohibit nuclear tests. We welcome restrictions on harmful military activities or other activities which alter the climate or have an adverse effect on the quality of the environment. We share these hopes and fears and we are firmly convinced that the smaller peace-loving countries of the world must make a major effort to ensure that atomic power is not increased or used and that the nuclear Powers respect the firm determination of those countries which wish to proscribe its use and keep their areas of the world free from this terror.244.	In particular  we should consider the application of earlier resolutions of the General Assembly relating to the signing and ratification of Additional Protocol I of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  and we hope that all the nuclear Powers will respect the nuclear-free zone agreed upon by the countries of Latin America. Together with many other countries of our continent  Nicaragua has sponsored a draft resolution which will be circulated at a later date.7245.	This community of nations  with so many formidable challenges and opportunities ahead of it  has recently welcomed the new States of Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. With their admission we have gained the enthusiasm and fighting spirit of new nations which have recently acquired statehood and have values that will serve to enrich the human treasure.246.	Particularly  we wish to welcome the delegation of Grenada  which has joined the family of Latin American countries. Grenada has been very much concerned to promote the development of our regional institutions. We believe that because of our common history and geography there will be many opportunities for us to co-operate and we extend our very best wishes to this new Member from the Caribbean.247.	Finally  may I express confidence in our President's abilities and skills and may I pledge to him the frill co-operation of my delegation in the joint effort to see to it that this session of the General Assembly is productive and fruitful."
"90",5175,"NLD",29,1974,"On behalf of my delegation I convey sincere congratulations to Mr. Bouteflika on his unanimous election as President of this session. The qualities of his leadership have been displayed both in his country and in the context of the group of nonaligned nations.45.	At times in history events and developments suddenly assume the proportions of a bursting dam. Since I addressed this Assembly a year ago [2128th meeting]  the world has been confronted with war  with profound changes in the distribution of power and economic wealth  with the sudden scarcity of essential raw materials and with continued massive violations of human rights. Those dramatic developments have brought home the dearly bought lesson that peace  justice  freedom and development are inseparably linked. None can be achieved without the others.46.	Last year  in this Assembly  delegations welcomed political detente. My Government strongly supported  and continues to support  efforts towards detente in Europe and elsewhere in the world. But the situation remains unstable because so far detente largely represents understanding between the big Powers within certain limits  limits defined by elements of deterrence  competition and collaboration. The unacceptable risk; of nuclear war compels cooperation but does not exclude competition. External events beyond the limits of the understanding on detente continue to endanger the balance resulting from detente. Detente between the great Powers has therefore not eliminated sources of friction and crisis caused by lack of justice and freedom.47.	The most striking and dangerous case in point is the war in the Middle East and its aftermath. The international community was again confronted with the fundamental instability of a situation resulting from the absence of a just peace settlement in the region. Notwithstanding detente between the iJreat Powers  peace proved to be impossible without justice to all the parties concerned. The Netherlands Government welcomes and supports the efforts and steps to achieve such peace and justice the armistice agreements and the subsequent agreements on the disengagement of forces. A high tribute is due the Governments and statesmen within the region and outside it who made those agreements possible.48.	The position of the Netherlands Government in support of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council is known and is fully reflected in the declaration of the nine countries of the European Economic Community of 6 November 1973.4 Subsequent to that declaration  the countries of the European Economic Community have entered into a dialog with the countries of the Arab world in order to strengthen and intensify their mutual relations and to arrive at longterm forms of economic  technological and cultural cooperation. The Netherlands Government wishes to promote this EuropeanArabian economic cooperation. It expresses the strong hope that the efforts being undertaken in the political field will soon lead in the Middle East to durable peace based on justice.49.	Another external event affecting detente was the armed conflict in Cyprus. Here too  durable peace proved impossible without justice to all the parties concerned. A political settlement without any further recourse to armed intervention must  in the view of the Netherlands Government  be based on full respect for the independence and territorial integrity of the country and for the fundamental rights of the peoples and communities concerned  The conflict in Cyprus has caused profound human suffering and economic dislocation. My Government has contributed to the emergency operations of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Parallel to further efforts towards a political settlement  action should be taken by the international community to restore the economy of the island by providing emergency economic assistance.50.	Although the United Nations has not been able to prevent the disasters that have afflicted the Republic of Cyprus since July  the presence of the United Nations has proved to be of great value. I wish to pay a tribute to the members of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus [UNFICYP] who have acted firmly and responsibly in situations of grave risk and have suffered severe casualties in performing their tasks. In view of the outstanding services rendered by UNFICYP in the present crisis  my Government has decided to make a voluntary contribution of $250 000 for the current year to the financing of the United Nations Force. 51.	The Cyprus crisis and the war in the Middle East have demonstrated both the potentialities and the limitations of the United Nations peacekeeping activities. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations has been trying for years to formulate basic guidelines for those operations  but has not yet succeeded in reaching full agreement on the complex issues involved. I am gratified to note that this lack of agreement on the theory of peacekeeping has not prevented the Security Council from taking practical action when circumstances required new operations. I do hope that this will accelerate the work of the Special Committee.52.	I should like to make one remark here about the question of the composition of peacekeeping forces. In my opinion this question should be dealt with in a pragmatic way and not made dependent on the application of too rigid and antiquated yardsticks of geographical distribution. Paramount should be the objective of the operation: the efficient and expedient safeguarding of peace. My Government remains ready to contribute Netherlands units to United Nations peacekeeping operations.53.	Another grave so are of danger to and instability of detente is in my view the arms  race in the MiddleEast  the unprecedented proportions of which threaten to prevent or to upset any political settlement and increase the potential danger to world peace of the conflict situation in the region. If the world really wishes to promote detente and peace  the United Nations and individual Member States must address themselves to the problems of the arms race in conventional weapons in this and other danger areas.54.  I have spoken of some external factors which threaten to frustrate the development of detente. In my view a further serious threat to lasting detente is the unsolved problem of nuclear proliferation.55.	The Secretary General was right in drawing our attention  in the introduction his report on the work of the Organization  to the dangers to our civilization and the human race inherent in the uncontrolled spreading of nuclear ""knowhow"" and of plutonium  and in the proliferation of nuclear devices [AI9601I Add.I  sect. X]  I cannot conceal my Government's profound concern regarding the action taken by India in May of this year in testing a nuclear explosive device.56.	We have taken due note of the statement of the Minister of External Affairs of India [2245th meeting] that India has no intention of becoming a nuclear Power and that it remains committed to a policy of using nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. Nevertheless it is difficult to distinguish between a nuclear test for peaceful purposes and a nuclear test for weapon purposes; therefore it cannot be denied that the Indian test explosion represents a setback to international efforts to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons and to ban nuclear tests everywhere and by everyone. I repeat: everywhere and by everyone.57.	The risk of nuclear proliferation should be a matter of concern to all nations  regardless of size or power. The imperative of world peace must override nuclear ambition. In this context the review conference provided for in the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex] gains even more relevance than before.58.	As a member of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva the Netherlands Government will continue to support all efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. We regret that progress in this field has not come up to expectation. In particular  my Government deplores the fact that the parties to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963 have not yet fulfilled their commitment to ban nuclear tests in all environments.59.	I assume that the Assembly will give great attention this year to the general problems of arms control and disarmament. Several new proposals from different sides deserve serious consideration.60.	As far as the. situation in Europe is concerned  the Netherlands  in consultation with its allies  will continue to press for substantial results in the Vienna talks on mutual and balanced force reductions.61.	In the introduction to his annual report  the SecretaryGeneral has urged us ""to ensure.that peacekeeping efforts must not be the pretext for slackening the momentum of the search for a settlement of underlying problems."" [Al960llAdd.l  sect. VI.]62.	In this connexion  I wish once more to draw attention to the essential but too often neglected role of the International Court of Justice in the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Court has recently adapted its procedures and rules  which now permit shorter and more simplified action. I wish to support the SecretaryGeneral's appeal to Member States to review the possibility of referring legal disputes to the Court.63.	Parallel to the achievement of universality in the United Nations there has been a progressive development of new rules of international law acceptable to all States  old and new. Such development of international law will  however  not lead very far without the strengthening of  and more frequent recourse to  effective machinery for the settlement of disputes. I hope that this session of the General Assembly will take action to that end.64.	There can be no peace without justice and freedom and without respect for human rights. The Secretary General has shown his concern for the disregard of individual rights and the decline in civility. He has reminded us that the democratization of international relations in order to bring peace and justice to the daily life of all peoples has always been a central role of the United Nations.65.	The Netherlands Government will continue to press for the safeguarding and defense of fundamental human rights  within my own country under the European Convention on Human Rights in the discussions between Eastern and Western Europe  and in the world at large. I wish to express the profound joy of the Government and people of the Netherlands caused by the restoration of democracy and human rights set in motion in Greece and Portugal and by the reversal by the new Portuguese Government of the colonial policies of its predecessors. Those most encouraging developments  which have been welcomed by many in this General Assembly  should not  of course  turn attention away from persistent violations of human rights elsewhere. I refer specifically to the situation in South Africa and Namibia and to the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia. There is reason  too  for continued deep concern about the situation in Chile.66.	I refer also to the increasingly widespread practice of torture and maltreatment of prisoners. The Netherlands delegation  together with others  will put forward specific proposals in this respect.67.	The persistence and the very increase of violence and brutality in today's world is an alarming phenomenon. Practices of terrorism jeopardizing the lives of men  women and children continue to be a source of great anxiety. It is a matter of common interest and concern to all nations to prevent and combat such practices by joint and separate action.68.	In order to strengthen respect for freedom of religion or belief the Netherlands delegation will also introduce proposals aimed at the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief.69.	The year 1975 has been proclaimed Intel national Women's Year by the General Assembly of the UnitedNations [resolution 3010 (XXVII)]. My Government will fully support United Nations action in this respect  because the role of women is crucial in the search for development and justice.70.	There can be no peace without justice and freedom. The rapid developments towards decolonization in Africa have brought us considerably closer to the implementation of the right of self-determination of all nations. Some of the basic purposes of the Charter and the ideal of universality are now coming close to fulfillment.71.	The Kingdom of the Netherlands extends a most cordial welcome to the three new Members of the Organization: Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea Bissau. Our sincere feelings of sympathy towards the people and Government of Bangladesh  which have been so severely tried  have been expressed by our continuing efforts to render effective assistance. In Grenada we salute a nation close to the Netherlands Antilles  part of the Kingdom I here represent. My Government particularly rejoices at the presence among us of GuineaBissau. Its struggle to obtain the rights enshrined in our Charter has finally been justly rewarded.72.	It is my privilege to inform you that the Kingdom of the Netherlands next year will witness the accession to full independence and sovereignty *of one of its partners  Surinam. The Government and people of the Netherlands are looking forward to the now rapidly approaching day when Surinam will be able to take its rightful place in the General Assembly. In view of Surinam's wish for independence in 1975  the three partners of the Kingdom  that is  the Netherlands Antilles  Surinam  and the Netherlands  will soon meet in a joint effort to reshape the present relationship agreements.73.	Stability in Europe and in the world is seriously threatened by economic dislocation  by persistent inflation  and by the danger of recession and unemployment. The energy crisis and the profound changes in international commodity markets have produced a catalytic effect on the economic development of the industrialized world. A reorientation of thinking and policy on our pattern of growth and on the level and nature of our prosperity is called for. Obviously  a redistribution of power and wealth has been set in motion.74.	However  there is the danger that this development will have a polarizing and antagonizing effect on international economic relations in the sense that consumer countries may be forced to embark on alternative sources of raw materials and self sufficiency. I wish to sound a note of warning with regard to these polarizing tendencies. Any nationalistic raw materials policy  if carried to the extreme  risks being self defeating. The alternative then is obvious: cooperation on the basis of economic interdependence  as called for in the Declaration and the Program of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth special session.75.	The resolution adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly gave expression to these fundamental changes in economic relations and in development cooperation. While the phenomenon of physical shortages was new to the rich countries  we should remind ourselves that a scarcity of resources has always been a normal situation in the poor countries. New border lines have been drawn in the international community. Countries with a structural balance of payments deficit today are found among the poor as well as among the rich. Countries suffering from shortages of commodities today are to be found in both categories. This new reality demands new policies and agreements for commodity markets. It also demands a reorientation of the future economic growth of the rich countries  whose growth will have to be selective in the sense that they cannot continue to use ever increasing quantities of raw materials supplies  both in an absolute sense and as a percentage of global availabilities. Thus  the future requires strategies for development not only for the poor countries but also for the rich strategies aimed at a global policy of interdependence.76.	A new  worldwide recession would be a disaster  in particular for many developing countries. Regardless of other urgent measures by developing and developed countries  has the time not come for producers and consumers of essential raw materials to meet under United Nations auspices in a common effort to give effect to the notion of interdependence in order to help forestall such a recession? The present situation offers sufficient scope for progress towards a larger degree of justice in international economic relations.77.	In the search for development strategies we have so far been concentrating most of our attention on medium and longterm development. But the immediate needs of developing countries  the pressing problems of mass poverty  unemployment  undernourishment and lack of housing have often been neglected. Many developing countries are so hard pressed by the emergencies of today that they can hardly give sufficient attention to the problems of tomorrow. The Netherlands Government is convinced of the need for a new development dimension; a strategy and a program are required to meet the immediate needs of developing countries  including those resulting from natural disasters. The United Nations machinery in this respect must be strengthened. The assistance  to be worked out internationally  should be additional to existing aid programs for longterm plans and projects. The Netherlands Government in its budget for 1975 has allocated $100 million for assistance to meet the immediate needs of developing countries.78.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly has adopted a Special Program to assist the countries most seriously affected by rising energy and commodity prices. The Netherlands Government  in view of the appeal made by the Secretary General  has decided to make available during the budgetary year 1974 an amount of $30 million for assistance to these countries. A substantial part of these funds will be channeled through the Secretary General's special account; another part through the European Economic Community or bilaterally.79.	Next year  the Netherlands intends to do more; it is prepared to contribute to the Special Fund established by resolution 3202 (SVI). Our contribution will be made in the context of my Government's new four year program for development cooperation  which has recently been submitted to Parliament. This program aims at a target for official development assistance of approximately 0.8 per cent of the gross national product by 1976.80.	Since peace and freedom cannot survive without justice and economic and social development  all means to redistribute wealth and economic power will have to be considered. It appears to me that the balance of wealth and power between rich and poor countries may be decisively influenced by the exploration and exploitation of the resources of the sea which so far have remained untapped. In the introduction to his report on the work 4 of the Organization  the SecretaryGeneral rightly 'calls attention to the tremendous importance of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea [AI960llAdd.l  sect. XII]. The Netherlands Government adheres to the concept that the seabed and its resources outside national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind. Effective exploitation of the resources of the sea for the benefit of the developing world could lead to a decisive change in the existing structure of inequality in wealth and prosperity. The Netherlands  therefore  advocates the adoption of a new legal system that would safeguard this common heritage  emphasizing the duties which the use of the sea entails for all States. This requires effective arrangements and machinery for international legislation  administration  supervision and international jurisdiction. In Caracas excessive emphasis was placed  in my view  on questions of national jurisdiction  to the neglect of vital issues of international control and common interest  and I wonder whether developing countries are sufficiently aware of the enormous benefits that they can reap from international exploitation of the resources of the sea.81.	I have spoken of some vital problems with which this session of the General Assembly will be confronted: problems of war and peace  problems of instability and equality   problems of human misery and of the denial of fundamental rights. But I have also pointed to progress  new forms of cooperation and  in some areas  to breakthrough and new departures. The world  and with it the United Nations  is in motion and is moving faster than some may wish or expect.82.	In this perspective  the Netherlands Government attaches great importance to the special session of the General Assembly to be convened in September next year. That session represents a unique opportunity to come to grips with many of the problems that beset the world today. As one of the elements in this process  the outcome of the World Population Conference in Bucharest has provided a promising first step. The Kingdom of the Netherlands looks forward to the World Food Conference. More than ever before  the urgency of the world food problem calls for imaginative proposals and concrete action.83.	In the coming months  other international conferences and negotiations  such as the Second General Conference of UNIDO  the review and appraisal of progress in the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  the discussions on international monetary reform and the multilateral trade negotiations  will take place. All these activities  in which nongovernmental organizations can play an important role  should converge in a decisive effort for reaching agreement on the foundations for a new economic order at the next special session of the General Assembly.84.	The cynics and self professed realists who tell us that strategies  declarations and action programs are nothing but words which can lead only to frustration and damage the prestige of the United Nations  should remember that the great ideals of mankind  in history and today  were drafted in words which  once conceived  were able to move men to action. A determined effort to carry out by intensified international cooperation what has already been agreed upon in the Strategy and in other instruments can overcome the triple danger of fatalism  cynicism and nationalism  so clearly confronting mankind. If the right choices are made  the thin margin between order and chaos  sufficiency and want  peace and annihilation  described to us by the SecretaryGeneral  can make way for a system of peace  justice  freedom and development. The United Nations offers such a system in the unique collection of instruments for international negotiation and cooperation. Let us use those instruments. Let us devote more time to consultation and negotiation in the United Nations. We have it in our power to guarantee that future generations will not criticize our era as one in which a maximum of opportunities to better the lot of mankind was wasted by a minimum of goodwill and cooperation. Let us seize those opportunities."
"91",5221,"NOR",29,1974,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Norwegian delegation  I have the great honor to congratulate you on your election as President of this Assembly. I can assure you of the full co-operation of my delegation in your important task.237.	In the introduction to. his report on the work of the Organization  the Secretary-General raises the following question: how is the United Nations responding to the formidable challenges that face the nations of the world  and in what ways can its performance and capacity be improved? I would like to take up this issue from the viewpoint of a small country which considered its membership in the United Nations a corner-stone of its foreign policy.238.	When we consider the tasks and challenges confronting the world community today  there ace two basic considerations that stand out: the one is the gravity and the magnitude of the tasks ahead; the second is the urgency involved.239.	Such fundamental problems as the arms race  the population explosion  the gap between the rich and the poor  the scarcity of resources  global inflation  pollution  food crises and so on  indicate the magnitude and scope of the tasks facing the world today. These problems are of concern to all nations because they concern mankind's possibility for survival.240.	The second main consideration is the time factor. Time is not on our side  and the question is whether or not we have sufficient time to cope with all these problems before they become truly unmanageable. What we need is a new sense of urgency and new approaches for common solutions of the many new tasks. What we need is international action and international management of mankind's common problems and tasks.241.	In this connexion  I would like to stress the importance of the international conferences that have taken place or are to be held this year under the auspices of the United Nations. Last spring the sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and development  was held. The World Population Conference has just been concluded. The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea had its first session in Caracas this summer and will resume next year. The World Food Conference is about to be opened.242.	Those and other international conferences are important milestones in the work of the United Nations. Decisions have been taken. Declarations of principle and programs of action have been adopted. But more important still is the follow-up of these decisions  and  unfortunately  the conclusion must be drawn that so far the follow-up of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  as well as of the decisions taken at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  has not been marked by any strong sense of urgency. The efficient implementation of these decisions will require sacrifices from big and small States alike  and not least from those countries whose economy has recently been strengthened considerably as a result of improved terms of trade.243.	For its part  Norway is committed to participate to the best of its ability in the efforts to promote increased global economic and social solidarity. We attach special importance to the Special Program in favor of the most severely affected countries  and we would earnestly hope that this Program will gain wider support and be fully implemented as soon as possible.244.	The United Nations will have to play a central role in the implementation of declarations and pro-grammes of action already adopted at these various conferences. But here again we are faced with the question raised by the Secretary-General  how can the United Nations discharge its responsibilities? That question will undoubtedly be an important item on the agenda for the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1975. There is  however  one aspect of this issue that I would like to comment upon today  and that is: how can the idea of collective economic security and solidarity best be realized within our present institutional framework? How can we best co-ordinate and direct the wide range of ongoing activities in the economic and social fields? This poses the question of the future role of the Economic and Social Council.245.	In the Charter a unique role in the promotion of economic and social progress and development has been entrusted to the Economic and Social Council. The question is  however  whether the Council's working methods today are fully adequate to deal effectively with the many important tasks attributed to it. Subsequent to the recent enlargement of its membership  the Council is more representative of the world community than before. However  we ought to consider how we can make the Council more efficient and increase its importance in order that the United Nations would be better equipped to deal with economic and social problems. Here I have in mind not only the long-term development problems but aSso acute economic crises  as well as emergency relief operations.246.	More frequent participation of cabinet ministers in the sessions of the Council is one possibility. An alternative and one more in line with my thinking is to transform the Council into a body in permanent session  that is  some kind of security council for economic and social affairs. For Norway  which hopes to beep me a member of the Economic and Social Council again as of next year  the question of how to strengthen the Council will be a central issue in the months ahead.247.	Also in the field of international disaster relief and longer term relief assistance  there is an urgent need for increased efforts with a view to improving efficiency and co-ordination. Much remains to be done  and the measures taken so far have not always yielded the expected results. The world community must give increased priority to disaster relief.248.	As a State Member of the United Nations  Norway has considered it an important task for the Organization to develop a more suitable system and machinery for dealing with violations of fundamental human rights. We have repeatedly had the experience that Member States invoke the principle of non-interference in' matters within their domestic jurisdiction when attention is drawn to violations of human rights. However  such violations concern the world community as a whole arid have a negative influence not only on relations between individual nations but also on the international climate in general. That is the reason why we have worked for the creation within the United Nations system of a post of High Commissioner for Human Rights.249.	We have recently received an increasing number of reports of torture and brutal treatment of prisoners in various parts of the world. The United Nations must now give increased priority to this question. By creating an alert world public opinion and by working systematically within the structure of the United Nations  we must seek to ensure that the individuals are effectively protected against torture and other gross violations of human rights. In this connexion  I would like to pay a tribute to the work carried out by Amnesty International andthe campaign against torture which that organization has launched.250.	At a time when the world is confronted with very serious economic and political problems and when the need for global and regional co-operation is greater than ever before  we experience in all our countries and in all parts of the world & trend back to bilateralism and increased nationalism in inter-national politics. This is not in the interest of any country. It is  however  first and foremost  the small countries which will suffer from such a development. This trend towards bilateralism is perhaps even more pronounced in matters of peace and security. Here  however  the situation is fundamentally different.251.	Under the pressure of the modern weapons of mass destruction  a rapprochement has developed between the great Powers  as well as a common effort to co-operate in order to limit the arms race and prevent local conflicts from developing into a direct confrontation between themselves. It should  of course  be in the interest of all countries to support this development. Whether we like it or not  the question of peace and war will to a large extent remain the responsibility of the super-Powers.252.	Nevertheless  this development confronts us  the smaller countries  with a dilemma. On the one hand  we are vitally interested in and dependent upon the continued detente aid co-operation between the big Powers. On the other hand  we are not interested in this co-operation taking forms that could undermine the international system of co-operation or hamper the efforts to build a world community based on the United Nations.253.	We  the smaller countries  cannot escape this dilemma  either by automatically accepting everything the great Powers have agreed upon or by a priori condemning this co-operation or this agreement simply because we have not been consulted. What the great Powers are doing is developing a common conception between themselves of how peace can best be secured. This is necessary; but the smaller countries must also develop their conception of how the world community should be organized  and this should not be in opposition to the great Powers and their co-operation but should form a necessary supplement and act as a necessary corrective to the co-operation between the great Powers.254.	This conception  or the task of the smaller countries  must therefore lie in working for a strengthening of international co-operation through the United Nations which will secure international peace and at the same time make it possible to achieve the necessary peaceful changes in the political  economic and social structure of the world. And in working for this  we the smaller countries have a common interest  regardless of our geographical location  whether we are rich or poor and irrespective of political or ideological differences. Part of this small-Power conception must also be to tie the great Powers as strongly as possible to the United Nations and encourage them to make full use of the Organization. It is only through constructive interaction between the small and the large countries  arid through the use of the United Nations machinery  that thepotential of the Organization to meet the challenges of our time can be developed.255.	The current session of the General Assembly has on its agenda a number of important political questions of current interest  such as those of Cyprus  the Middle East  disarmament and the situation in southern Africa. The Norwegian delegation will come back to some of these questions during the consideration of the respective items on the agenda. I shall therefore limit myself here to some brief remarks on these subjects.256.	The situation in Cyprus continues to be a source of concern and anxiety. However  we can now discern certain trends in the negotiations between the leaders of the two communities on the island which give reason for some optimism. We hope that in the longer perspective these may lead to real negotiations with a view in achieving a just and lasting solution based on respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus. Such a solution can be obtained only by peaceful means and not by military force.257.	As I already mentioned  the Norwegian delegation will in a later statement discuss disarmament problems on a broader basis. However  today I shall stress the importance which my Government attaches to the earliest possible cessation of all nuclear tests and to the need for the problems of nuclear proliferation in connexion with tests for peaceful purposes to be considered seriously now in the United Nations or in the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva. I would also underline the importance of the continuing efforts by the United States and the Soviet Union to reach agreement on further limitations in the field of strategic weapons systems.258.	This year we welcome Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau as new Members of the Organization. This brings the United Nations even closer to fulfilling the principle of universality  a principle which Norway considers to be of the utmost importance.259. The admission of Guinea-Bissau is also a manifestation of the encdUraging developments with regard to the abolition of Portugal's colonial rule in southern Africa. I should like Jo express the deepest appreciation of my Government for the important decision taken by the Portuguese Government to prepare  in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  for the rapid and peaceful achievement of self-determination and independence by the peoples in the colonies.260.	In South Africa  Rhodesia and Namibia  the white minority regimes continue to suppress the African populations and to violate fundamental human rights. As far as Norway is concerned  we shall fully apply the sanctions which have been decided upon by the Security Council against Rhodesia. We shall also continue strictly to observe the arms embargo against South Africa and to work for intensified international pressure against oppression and racial discrimination in these areas261.	It is only natural that the international energy situation and its financial and economic implications will be a main theme in the debate during this session of the General Assembly. Several speakers have already stressed the gravity of the situation. It goes without saying that the Norwegian Government is also most concerned about these problems  and that has relevance to the dual position in which Norway finds itself.262.	On the one hand  Norway  as part of the industrialized world is greatly dependent upon stable supplies of energy being ensured to other industrialized countries at manageable prices. On the other hand  Norway  as an emerging net exporter of gas and oil  is preoccupied with the same  problems  such as the pace of exploitation and national control over natural resources  as the other producer nations.263.	In view of this dual position  my country has an obvious national interest in avoiding confrontations and crises between producers and consumers  and we shall to the best of our ability contribute to solutions that can ensure a sound international economy and take due account of all legitimate interests  in particular the needs of those developing countries dependent upon imports of oil.264.	Finally  I should like to stress how important it is for the further development of the world community that we arrive at a comprehensive solution of the many outstanding questions related to the law of the sea. As a major shipping nation  as a producer of oil and gas from the continental shelf and  first and foremost  as a nation whose coastal population is overwhelmingly dependent upon the resources of the sea  it goes without saying that my country attaches great importance to the need for reaching international solutions to these problems as soon as possible.265.	The Norwegian Government had hoped that it would have been possible during the first session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea to reach agreement on certain basic principles for a package solution. Well  the Conference did not succeed in this. Nevertheless  we noted with satisfaction that the first session of the Conference succeeded in creating a good basis for further negotiations next year  which we hope will succeed in achieving a comprehensive convention relating to the law of the sea."
"92",5266,"NPL",29,1974,"It is an honor and a privilege for me to convey to the President and to the representatives assembled here the greetings of my Sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva  and his best wishes for the success of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly.2.	I should like to convey to the President  on behalf of my delegation  our sincere congratulations on his election to the high office of President of this session of the General Assembly. We are familiar with his distinguished public career and the high reputation he has gained in his own country as well as in the international sphere. We are confident that under his able and wise guidance it will be possible for the work at this session to contribute towards the solution of some of the basic problems at present facing us. My delegation wishes to assure him of its full cooperation and support in the discharge of his heavy responsibility.3.	I should like also to take this opportunity of expressing our deep appreciation of the exemplary services rendered by the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who carried out successfully the task entrusted to him in a year which was one of the most challenging of our time from both the economic and the political points of view.4.	This year witnessed a most serious economic crisis which threatened the existing economic order of the world. But  at the same time  this has also been a year characterized by the numerous international initiatives taken and efforts made by various countries of the world and by the United Nations itself towards the solution of the outstanding socioeconomic and political problems of our time. The most important among these was the special session of the General Assembly convened to study for the first time the problems of raw materials and development and devoted to the consideration of the most important economic problems facing the world community. Therefore  in spite of the discouraging economic threat looming over the world today  we are confident that with cooperation and understanding among ourselves and on the initiative of this world body we can work out internationally acceptable solutions to all the problems facing us. It is with this hope and in this optimism that we have come to the United Nations this year.5.	Remarkable progress is being made in the improvement of the international political climate. The policy of detente has continued to be the main feature in international relations and has helped to bring not only a relaxation of tensions but also closer cooperation between the major Powers. The agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States of America in the scientific  technological and industrial domains and on the limitation of strategic weapons and underground nuclear tests reached during the last visit of the former United States President  Mr. Nixon  to the Soviet Union are undoubtedly positive steps towards the promotion of world peace.6.	The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe being held in Geneva also showed that there is strong determination among the European Powers to resolve  their differences and bring about increased cooperation among themselves. This is in itself a positive trend towards lasting detente in Europe in particular and world peace in general.7.	Since it has contributed greatly to the relaxation of world tension  the increased cooperation between China and the United States and between China and Japan  is receiving ever growing support.8.	In the Middle East  thanks to the untiring efforts and great negotiating skill of the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Henry Kissinger  a disengagement agreement between Syria and Israel  which constituted one of the most difficult tasks of our time  has been achieved. Mr. Kissinger not only brought together two parties which had never met before except on the battlefield but also devised a breakthrough which may be the beginning of a new era of peace in that area. This  together with the disengagement agreement reached between Egypt and Israel  will  we hope  clear the way for further negotiations between the Arabs and the Israelis for the final settlement of the problem.9.	In cite of these favorable trends in ArabIsraeli relations  the prospect of peace in the Middle East is still far off. We believe that no permanent solution of the Middle East problem is possible until the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are properly and justly settled.10.	Nepal  as a peace loving nation  has always been in favor of a peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem and has supported all such moves as were aimed at bringing about a peaceful and permanent solution of the problem. We have always supported the various resolutions of the Security Council designed to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Middle East problem. The practical solution is laid down  we believe  in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). The full and speedy implementation of that resolution is expected to bring about a lasting peace in the region.11.	We readily responded to the request of the United Nations to participate in the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East by sending a contingent of the Royal Nepalese Army to the spot. It is satisfying for us to learn that that contingent of the Nepalese Army  as on past occasions  has fulfilled its duties in a most disciplined way and has proved its worth. We are also glad that we have been able to contribute  in whatever humble way we could  towards the maintenance of peace and security in the region.12.	In the SouthEast Asian region a few tense situations that persist have been the source of permanent disturbance to the peace and security of the area. Though the fighting in Viet Nam has come to an end  the problem is still unresolved. My delegation is of the opinion that the Paris peace Agreement should be implemented to the full so that peace and harmony in the area may be speedily restored.13.	The restoration of permanent peace in the SouthEast Asian region will not be possible unless the Korean question is solved to the satisfaction of both the Koreas. The decision of the last General Assembly which brought about the dissolution of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was a positive step in that direction. My delegation will support all such moves that may contribute towards the creation of favorable conditions for the acceleration of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.14.	The recent disturbances in Cyprus are deplorable not only because they caused a serious disruption of peace in the island but also because they brought heavy suffering to the innocent people there. We welcome any initiatives from within or from outside the United Nations which are aimed at establishing a normal situation on the island. My country appreciates the personal initiative taken by the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in making an on the spot assessment of the situation and in the consultations he had with the leaders of the parties in conflict. We are of the conviction that there should be no threat to the territorial integrity of Cyprus and that it should continue to remain as independent and sovereign a nonaligned country as ever.15.	Li spite of all these disturbances  the most satisfying trend in recent international relations has been the relaxation of tension. The settlement of conflicts in many regions of the world by peaceful means will undoubtedly create an atmosphere of confidence and trust between nations and will help to create conditions favorable to international peace and security. This positive trend in international relations should be complemented by other international actions that can promote rapid economic progress and development  the most basic and urgent need of our time. More concrete international measures should be taken to halt the arms race  which is not only the cause of perpetual fear and distrust among nations but also the main factor responsible for economic retardation.16.	There have been many encouraging developments in the field of disarmament in recent years  but the progress achieved so far is inadequate. The arms buildup is increasing alarmingly and vast riches that could have been used for the promotion of peace and the welfare of mankind are being drained by the production of destructive weapon^ We are of the opinion that the growing tendency among the developing countries and others on the threshold of development to rapidly obtain possession of nuclear power is dangerous not only because it seriously disrupts international peace but also because it retards the economic development of the world. It is for this reason that we oppose all proliferation of nuclear power and the consequent nuclear tests carried out underground or under water  in the atmosphere or in outer space.17.	As a peace loving nation Nepal wants to remain at peace and is  therefore  especially interested in seeing peace restored in the South Asian region  to which it belongs. With this in view  we have supported all moves towards the normalization of relations between Pakistan and India and also welcome the resumption of talks between them. Our support of General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI) regarding the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace is motivated by this desire. We shall willingly support any such future moves that lead to the restoration of perpetual peace in the area.18.	It is only through general and complete disarmament that international peace and security  which is one of the main objectives of the Charter of the United Nations  can be achieved. We believe  therefore  that it is more urgent than ever before that positive consideration should be given to the convening of a world disarmament conference in which all nations  whether big or small  developed or developing  nuclear or nonnuclear including the divided ones could participate and deliberate on ways and means to achieve this sacred goal.19.	We are indeed very happy to welcome the People's Republic of Bangladesh among us as a new Member of this august body.' The Republic of Bangladesh is one of our neighboring countries with which we have the most intimate friendly relations. We supported its admission to this Organization from the very beginning and we are now happy to see this realized. We are confident that Bangladesh  by its participation in the various deliberations of the United Nations  will contribute to our common endeavor in the promotion of world peace. We should also like to express our deep satisfaction at the admission of Grenada to this world Organization. We are also happy to welcome the Republic of GuineaBissau in this family of nations as a sovereign and independent country. The emergence of GuineaBissau as a sovereign independent nation is an example of the decline of colonialism in the world. We hope that the Republic of GuineaBissau will add to the strength of the Organization in effectively dealing with the problem of decolonization and swiftly bringing salvation to the peoples suffering under the tyrannical yoke of some colonial regimes and will thus contribute to the promotion of world peace.20.	This year  there have been some positive developments in the field of decolonization. The new Government in Portugal has recognized the Republic of GuineaBissau as an independent and sovereign country and has at the same time shown interest in entering into negotiations with various liberation movements. The independence of Mozambique is also already in sight  and it is gratifying to know that that country will emerge as a new independent nation in a year's time. We heartily welcome the establishment of a provisional government in Mozambique. The present policy of the Government of Portugal of granting independence to its colonies is highly praiseworthy. We only hope that the decolonization of all Territories under colonial rule and an immediate end to all the sufferings of colonial peoples  which have long been a matter of serious concern to all of us  can be achieved as speedily and as urgently as possible. We should also like to see Mozambique and Angola as Members of this august body in the near future.21.	The active participation of my country and its contributions to various international efforts to eliminate colonial domination and racial discrimination are well known to all representatives here.22.	The worst form of colonial oppression is being adamantly practiced by the racist Governments of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia  in total disregard of world public opinion. In South Africa  the colonial people remain condemned to all forms of torture and repression. The Government of South Africa has been stubbornly denying fundamental human rights to its people and has been making a mockery of all United Nations decisions  including those of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and of the United Nations Council for Namibia.23.	The South African Government has not only continued forcibly and illegally to occupy the international Territory of Namibia against the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice but has also practiced a most inhuman policy of apartheid in exploiting and repressing the indigenous people there. We strongly condemn all these acts of barbarism on the part of the Government of South Africa  which are an affront to humanity and civilized behavior.24.	The minority Government of Southern Rhodesia has also continued to consolidate its racist regime and to repress the liberation movements of its people by all inhuman and criminal means of collective punishment. It has denied the people of Zimbabwe the right to self-determination  freedom and independence  in defiance of all United Nations decisions. That illegal racist regime has sufficient moral and material backing from its major trading partners  who cooperate with and maintain it for their own selfish economic interests  thereby impeding the effective application of sanctions imposed by the Security Council against the regime. We are of the view that all Member countries should unite and consolidate their efforts to bring this deplorable situation to an end. We believe that the recently adopted International Convention on theSuppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid [resolution 3068 (XXVIII)  annex] will be helpful in eliminating this form of racial discrimination and request all Member States to sign or accede to this Convention without delay.25.	The necessity for international cooperation has become urgent not only for the maintenance of political security and international peace but also for the solution of many of the social and economic problems of our time. The growing trend among nations in trying to solve  through peaceful consultations and understandings  global problems concerning the environment  population  food  the seabed and outer space is a very positive one. It is the more so when new and legitimate solutions to all these problems are being sought within a universal institution such as the United Nations  where every nation  big or small  developed or developing  has equal say.26.	Nepal has been participating with keen interest in all these United Nations activities. More recently  Nepal actively participated in the deliberations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas. Though the Conference could not fully achieve its objective of producing a single agreed convention  the progress achieved in such an important area  progress which involved the varied and conflicting interests of nations  was undoubtedly noteworthy. We are of the opinion that we should give careful consideration to the rights and interests of all the groups of countries  instead of concluding a hasty convention that might leave room for future disputes on such a vital area affecting the common interest of mankind.27.	Nepal  together with other landlocked and geographically disadvantaged countries  has made its viewpoint sufficiently clear on the main questions affecting its interests in relation to the sea and its resources. The foremost interest of ail landlocked countries  including Nepal  is the international recognition of their rights to free and unrestricted access to and from the sea. This is a prerequisite for the promotion and diversification of the trade and economic development of a landlocked country. Provisions for the right of transit through coastal countries and for port facilities  including the construction arid maintenance of warehouses at the port to provide storage for goods in transit and facilities for the transport of goods  are the matters of vital importance for the landlocked countries which should find accommodation in the convention on the law of the sea.28.	We are against any attempt to annex the economic zones to the territorial seas of the coastal countries and to establish exclusive rights over such zones. The arbitrary limit of the economic zone at 200 miles lacks justification  and there is no reason why such a vast area should be occupied exclusively by coastal countries  in this way reducing the area of the common heritage of mankind to a meaningless concept. We do not mean  however  that we are opposed to the creation of an economic zone as such. But as the zone would be created for safeguarding the interests of the developing countries against the unscrupulous exploitation of the area and its resources by countries with advanced scientific and technological means  we are of the opinion that it should be under the common jurisdiction of all neighboring States  whether coastal or landlocked. All States should have a due share in the resources of the sea  whether living or inanimate. And all States which exercise jurisdiction over the zone should also share responsibilities as well as duties.29.	Another important international problem which confronts mankind today and in which the United Nations is deeply involved is the explosive increase of population and the growing worldwide shortage of food. The World Population Conference  held in Bucharest in August  and the forthcoming World Food Conference  to be held in Rome in November  are the other two major activities of the United Nations this year. Though these problems seem to be separate  they are very much related to one another. They should be examined together with other interrelated problems like the threat to the environment  the rapid depletion of resources and the need of accelerated economic growth. We very much welcome the World Population Plan of Action adopted by the Bucharest Conference.330.	Nepal is one of the densely populated countries  with 79 persons per square kilometer  which is three times higher than the world average of 27 persons. With a fate of population growth of more than 2 per cent on the average  the population increase  which is expected to be doubled in 30 years  is already putting strains on the agricultural production. Per capita agricultural production is declining and if this trend continues  the cereals  especially food grains  which account for the exportable surplus of Nepal  will be a scarce commodity in a few years time.31.	This  with the recent problems posed by the rising prices of fertilizer and other inputs  together with their scarcity  has been adversely affecting the economic development of my country. His Majesty's Government is aware of the urgent need to work out a comprehensive plan to face any future difficulties that these trends may bring to the economy. We therefore greatly value the world conferences on such vital questions as population and food  and see that these international initiatives may bring forth practical and urgent measures for effectively combating these problems looming over the future of mankind.32.	All these initiatives taken and efforts made by the United Nations  and those effected by all other countries of the world on their own  will not bear fruitful results until the widening gap of economic disparity between the developed and developing countries is narrowed.33.	From the economic point of view the year has been very disappointing. If the continuously rising inflationary trend has become the common unavoidable feature of the world economy  on the one hand  the wide gap of economic disparity between the developed and developing nations is becoming even wider in an alarming way. Though the exporting countries benefit from the rise in prices of their products  the least developed and landlocked countries  like Nepal  which have practically nothing to trade off against the rising cost of both raw materials and manufactured goods  have become the most severely affected countries.34.	The impact of the deteriorating economic situation  aggravated by the energy crisis  was so severe on these hardcore poverty stricken countries that the objective of achieving an accelerated rate of growth  as envisaged in the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)] has not only become unattainable  but the question of maintaining the present rate of growth is becoming a matter of serious concern. As we are approaching the midterm appraisal of the Second United Nations Development Decade  the goals of the Strategy appear to be more and more remote. The recent problem of scarcity of essential and other basic goods has been added to the problem of rising prices. The developed countries have been reluctant to help in the accelerated development of the developing countries of the eliminate the gap of economic disparity. The contributions of 1 per cent of national incomes have not been forthcoming  and the transfer of technology and of its benefits to the developing countries has been purely fictional.35.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly was convened against this background of the deteriorating economic situation  further aggravated by the energy crisis. The session was able to convince the world that the present international economic order is in direct conflict with the current development in international political and economic relations  and it therefore approved the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 320 (SVI)] under which future economic relations among nations will be based on equity  sovereign equality  interdependence and cooperation. The most important achievement of the special session  in our view  is the full realization that the political  social and economic wellbeing of present and future generations depends more than ever on cooperation between the developed and the developing countries  and that the interests of these two groups of countries are closely interdependent.36.	The adoption of emergency relief measures by the United Nations to mitigate the difficulties of the developing countries severely affected by the economic crisis was one of the very encouraging decisions of the session. We believe that the contributions made so far to the Special Fund established by resolution 3202 (SVI) are significant  though not sufficient for effectively meeting the economic hardships of the seriously affected developing countries. We hope that further contributions will be forthcoming from all potential donor countries for this purpose.37.	Nepal  as a least developed and landlocked country  faces many economic woes different from  and more serious than  those faced by other developing countries. Our level of economic development is so low and our exportable surplus so minimal and uncertain that our economy can neither benefit from the rising prices of primary goods nor sustain the burden of the rising cost of imports.38.	Nepal is basically a mountainous country with a difficult transportation problem  which has been the most serious bottleneck in our economic development for many years. We are still building our infrastructure  and our economic growth has been almost stagnant. Our industries are few and medium sized  and are hardly capable of producing export earnings. Our agricultural production is showing a declining trend due to want of fertilizer and the increasing pressure of population growth.39.	In spite of all these adverse economic realities typical of least developed and landlocked countries  Nepal is seriously endeavoring to emerge from this economic stagnation by embarking upon all round economic development  under the inspiring and zealous leadership of my Sovereign  His Majesty the King.40.	The recent economic crisis has brought about a serious disruption in the process of our development. The rising prices of basic commodities necessary for our development purposes  such as fertilizer  petroleum products and other development materials  coupled with the problem of their growing scarcity  have aggravated the situation. In the absence of dependable export earnings it has become extremely difficult to meet the increased cost of imports of both raw materials and manufactured goods resulting from the adverse terms of trade. This has also increased the possibility of a rapid depletion of the meager foreign exchange reserves. To all these  the landlocked character of the country in itself is an additional burden because it increases the cost of transport and makes development more expensive. So it is due to these specific problems that a least developed country which is also a landlocked country needs special attention and increased assistance for its economic development.41.	We are very much encouraged by the particular consideration the General Assembly at its sixth special session accorded the seriousness of the problems faced by the least developed and landlocked countries of the world in adopting both special measures and the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. As a least developed and landlocked country  we are naturally very eager to see that due consideration is given to such countries in providing the emergency relief measures provided for in the Special Program of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3202 (SVI)]. We all know that without first improving the economic conditions of the least developed and landlocked countries of the world the hard core of the developing countries  as they are the objectives of the new economic order envisaged will not be realized.42.	We are of the view that the Special Program and the Program of Action should also be so designed that they complement and further strengthen the goals and objectives of* the International Development Strategy as well as the new measures formulated by the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to offset the shortfall in achieving those goals and objectives so that the steadily accelerating economic development of the developing countries  especially the least developed ones  can be urgently stimulated.43.	In conclusion  I should like to point out that the world of today has become so interdependent that no problem can be confined to national boundaries or tackled effectively by national efforts alone. We are convinced that we need an effective multinational channel through which all global problems on a wide range of human activities can be properly dealt with. Such a channel could  no doubt  be the United Nations  for this could for many years to come be the only conceivable world body in which all independent sovereign nations could work collectively  without losing their individual identities  for the common goals of mankind. It could be made an effective instrument for the international peace and security so vital to the socioeconomic and political development of the world. I want to recall here the feeling expressed by our beloved and long remembered King  the late King Mahendra  on the importance of this august body  when he said  ""The only real alternative to the United Nations is an even more powerful United Nations""  which amply demonstrates the faith the Nepalese people has in the United Nations and in its ideals."
"93",5330,"NZL",29,1974,"Mr. President  I congratulate you most warmly on your election to the President's chair  for which your qualities and long experience as Foreign Minister of your country so admirably fit you. I wish you well in the direction of our business  which includes many important and some difficult issues. The year of your presidency will be an important year. We shall in fact be getting to grips with matters which are central to the future welfare  and even the existence  of human society.4.	First of all  I must speak of the recent tragic death of our beloved Prime Minister  Mr. Norman Kirk  who last year spoke for New Zealand in this debate. He was a good and humane man -a champion of the poor and the weak. We were deeply touched and comforted by the sympathy shown to us by people from all over the world at the time of our loss. Such solidarity occurs only when we lose a leader who has risen above local concerns  as he did one who has worked to advance the cause of the whole human family. The response to his death suggests that multitudes hunger for new attitudes among the leaders of nations. New Zealand will miss him greatly. But my Government will still try to bring to reality his personal vision of a new world social and economic order. We shall continue to strive  as Mr. Kirk did  to translate into international terms the vision of a decent and humane society which motivates our policy at home. Our goal remains to help to harness the great resources and skills of the people of this planet  so that everyone  not just a few  will have a chance to live as human beings should. We shall continue to work to strengthen the United Nations as a center for harmonizing the actions of nations and for protecting the rights of the smaller nations.5.	The last three years have witnessed a remarkable change in national attitudes. In 1972  the year of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm  the international community became aware of  and accepted the existence of certain physical limits to economic growth: limits to the availability of natural resources and of food; limits to the amount of pollution that can be discharged into the environment before inevitable and unwelcome consequences follow. In 1973 the world began to receive sharp  warnings of some of these physical limits  particularly in the supply of energy and of food. It became painfully apparent that our ability through existing institutions to make efficient and humane use of the world's talents and resources for the common good was more limited than we had thought and more limited than we could put up with.6.	In 1974 it became obvious that the world had better make a more serious effort to understand the interdependence of all peoples and all States. At a number of historic conferences the nations at last started to study realistically the fundamental changes that will be needed if we are to bring about the new order that the world requires a new order that will ensure a more equitable use of the world's resources to meet the demands of the future. These conferences included the sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and development  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  the World Population Conference  1974  and  soon  the World Food Conference. The common theme of these conferences was  and will be  interdependence. Whatever subject is studied  the same lesson emerges: we are one people  we are all one of another; and if we ignore that truth all of us will suffer and none of us may have a future in any meaningful sense of the word at all. At one time only visionaries and preachers spoke in such terms. Now the message has spread to the so-called practical people.7.	Governments  in their concern about the state of the planet  are having to look up from problems of local tension and conflict which are themselves hard enough to solve and to face fundamental issues affecting the very survival of humanity. The great issues of today are population  food  energy  natural resources  the environment and the embracing need for an economic order which will enable all people to realize their full potential as human beings. For the immediate and foreseeable future these constitute the agenda these will be the primary concerns of the international community and of the United Nations. Our success in dealing with them will largely determine the climate in which relations between States will develop in the next decade.8.	Detente is not just a question of political relations between the great Powers. True  detente must be based on a general acceptance of the interdependence of the great Powers and the small  of developed and developing nations. It must be based on the willingness of all of us to work together to solve the problems about which I have spoken. What alternative is in fact open to us?9.	To deal first with the subject of food  the shortage of food is growing worse. The international community has recognized the urgent need to act and to deal with the situation. Without food there can be no human energy. The World Food Conference will be a vitally important meeting. World food stocks have sunk to the lowest level in 50 years. We are now living literally on a hand-to-mouth basis. The assessment prepared for the World Food Conference has indicated that there will be a very significant food deficit in developing countries in the 1980s. Others have forecast the possibility of mass starvation by the end of the century. As a matter pf Immediate anxiety  a grave food shortage looms next winter. Weather conditions have reduced the harvests in the United States and Canada  and  therefore  the possibility of their being used  as they so often have been  as a backstop. The drought in the Sahel has brought famine to Africa. Further shortages seem likely to hit countries in Asia.10.	Weather is one cause of these troubles but nations are also at fault. The institutions for producing and marketing and distributing food have failed us. Above all  they have failed those countries and those people on the lowest incomes. There is an enormous unused potential for food production  but the international community has not yet devised ways of sharing its resources and skills for the benefit of all. The World Food Conference must provide the framework for such co-operation. If a crisis situation is developing  there will be a tendency to concentrate on short-term food aid. A world food security arrangement  which has so far eluded our efforts  is more necessary than ever be-fore. We must ensure that arrangements are made for sufficient stores of food  so that people do not starve in the emergencies which past experience teaches us will unfortunately occur from time to time.11.	The world  however  cannot just rely on the traditional food producers  There is a fundamental imbalance in food production. The answer is not to produce more and more food in the rich countries and ship it off as aid to distant parts. We must give top priority to increasing national production in developing countries. In many regions there are untapped resources of land and water. These can and must be utilized to expand food production. It is essential that the World Food Conference produce arrangements that will transfer agricultural technology to developing countries and increase the supply of the agricultural inputs they must have: money  energy  fertilizer  seeds  chemicals and equipment.12.	Most of New Zealand's special expertise is in the varied field of agriculture. We have shaped our development assistance and technical co-operation according to programs to make it available to others who need and want it. In the last year over 30 per cent of our bilateral aid involved the transfer of agricultural technology  materials  equipment and training. In providing this aid we are making a strong effort to ensure that it is practical and literally down to earth. Our friends in the South Pacific tell us that in the past years their islands have been nearly buried by feasibility studies  surveys and reports by international experts. They have been studied and surveyed beyond all bearing. What they want now is action. So do we. We do not underestimate the value of research. Our own agricultural success has depended on it very much indeed. But we think that if production is to be increased  as it should be  this will be done by men prepared to dirty their hands in the field  and not by those who polish the seat of a chair in a distant office. We for our part try to avoid inflicting on other people chair polishers disguised as experts. And we hope that the students from other countries whom we train in New Zealand will get the message that countries are developed only by hard work and effort  and that workers are deserving of equal respect whether they wear collars and ties or just shirts.13.	As a major agricultural exporter  New Zealand certainly shares the interest of developing countries and other States in the orderly marketing and distribution of food. We are constantly working for the elimination of barriers to trade and for the creation of stable markets at fair prices. Obviously in this area we are working in our own interest; but we believe also that we are working in the interests of others just as much as in our own. The World Food Conference should provide constructive guidance to the multilateral trade negotiations at present under way. We hope it will also give the incentive to remove the present stumbling blocks to progress in these negotiations. This is an area of activity in negotiations in agricultural trade that is usually dull and hard  and greatly complicated by national politics. But if food is to be produced in much greater quantity and it must be if the rapidly growing number of people are to be fed we must get an imaginative breakthrough in this vital field.14.	I have spoken of our concern about the world food shortage. I have said that we wish to make available to developing countries the benefits of the technology and expertise that we have built up in our agriculturally-based economy. Together with our colleagues from Sri Lanka  we have promoted emergency arrangements to ensure that the countries most in need can obtain sufficient supplies of nitrogenous fertilizers at prices they can afford.15.	We are convinced that real and lasting progress can be made by developing countries only if aid policies are closely co-ordinated with trade and monetary policies. The sixth special session of the General Assembly was an historic event  in some ways a revolutionary event. Its consequences will work themselves out over many years.16.	But the most important revolutions  we believe  occur in men's minds  not in the streets. Colonialism collapsed in two decades because of a conviction that its day was over. As the cumulative result of years of effort in education  sometimes through oratory and pressure  the conscience dormant in most people was brought to life and even the colonial Powers came to share this conviction  some more slowly than others. But I believe that we are now on the brink of another and even more profound shift in attitudes. We are beginning to accept  not just in words  but through practical decisions  that all members of the world society in which we live have a just claim on the wealth and the more decent life that that society can make possible. To discuss a new economic order is now to discuss reality.17.	A momentum has been established. Much more discussion will no doubt be required before consensus is reached on specific actions and before the change in attitudes is complete. But to achieve this we have to keep up the momentum and concentrate the energies of the international community on a manageable  realistic field of action. For our part we would like to suggest that the Assembly at this session identify as priority tasks for the coming year the four main issues for priority action: food  trade access  reform of the monetary system and emergency assistance. We think it would be useful if at this session the Assembly directed the subsidiary organs of the United Nations to bear this in mind in drawing up their own agenda and work programs.18.	At the sixth special session  the General Assembly established an emergency program of measures to help the countries hardest hit by the economic situation [resolution 3202 (S-VI)]. My country has allocated $10 million for this program. At the meeting to be held on 27 September on this subject I shall give more details of this contribution. However  we believe that a firmer basis should be established within the international community for providing large-scale emergency assistance whenever the need arises. We must have the means to avert the risk of the energy crisis or any other similar catastrophe creating a ""fourth world"" of countries so hopelessly placed that they are without any prospect of economic and social development for decades to come. My Government accepts that developing countries must increase their share of international trade  principally through improved access to the markets of the developed countries of the world. We support the generalized system of preferences and we are at present reviewing the New Zealand scheme with a view to introducing improvements into it.19.	New Zealand does not play a major role in the world financial institutions. But we have supported  and will continue to support  the principle that the developing countries should be full participants in discussions leading to major decisions on the international monetary order.20.	L turn now to disarmament. Against this back-ground of human need  which all the speakers this morning touched on  it is surely tragic folly  to squander resources at an ever-increasing rate to perfect weapons of destruction. We already have enough nuclear weaponry to obliterate all life from this earth several times over. Almost everyone says he wants to stop the arms race and to use the scarce resources that would be saved for constructive purposes: for aid and human welfare. Each year this Organization solemnly proclaims how essential it is that additional resources be devoted to economic and social development. Each year it proclaims the need for disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament. Yet each year its proclamations are ignored. We now watch with despair medium-sized and even small-sized Powers trying to follow the bad example of the great nuclear Powers.21.	Since the Assembly last met in regular session the tempo of nuclear-weapon testing has been stepped up. Two super-Powers have told us that a decade must elapse before they will be able to disentangle themselves from the spider's web of the arms race- a decade to strike what they choose to call ""a strategic balance"".22.	In the same time-span we face the prospect  even the certainty  if the international community does not act with vigor to prevent it  that there will be further additions to the nuclear club. Given the example set by the super-Powers and I do not feel at all comfortable in lecturing others we have to say that we completely reject the notion that the possession of these dreadful and suicidal weapons can in some way enhance a nation's status or security. On the contrary  the greater the number of States that possess such a capacity the more unstable the relationships between States will become and the greater will be the danger to world peace. We are deeply concerned that recent events may undermine the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]. Some find defects in this Treaty  but  despite  the defects  it does offer a path back to sanity and reason.23.	For many years the nations of the South Pacific have been close to the testing of nuclear weapons. Interested parties may argue that the tests are harmless  but those of us who have been closest to them are keenly aware of the dangers that testing poses for the human environment. We know that these tests can create anxiety and apprehension in ordinary people everywhere. We urge that this Assembly again assert  clearly and without equivocation  that testing in every form must be ended  soon  urgently  through a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The Assembly should act to advance the principles of the non-proliferation Treaty.24.	We believe that the Assembly should stand ready to encourage positive proposals from countries of a given region to increase regional stability and security. In recent years that search for international security and stability has been given new impetus through regional activities. New Zealand continues to see merit in this approach  and we urge outside States to co-operate fully in giving effect to these initiatives by smaller countries in various parts of the world.25.	I come now to the law of the sea. The law of the sea occupies a crucial place among the issues upon which the international community should focus most urgently in the coming year. In a world where population and resources press heavily upon one another  it is of critical importance to agree upon a just use of the resources of the oceans.26.	The session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas this year was especially important for the countries of the South Pacific. It gave New Zealand and its neighbors a most welcome chance to stress the special dependence of small island nations on the sea island States such as those in the South Pacific are at a disadvantage: they are geographically remote and they have very few agricultural and mineral resources. The development of their nearby maritime areas represents one of the few ways in which they can hope to supplement their slender land resources. New Zealand was encouraged that at Caracas these special needs were generally recognized.27.	Much work remains to be done; but we were heartened by the progress made. For the first time we now have within reach the essentials of a new agreement on a 12-mile territorial sea and a 200-mile economic zone. Undoubtedly  there will be a great deal of hard negotiation to come before a fair and balanced agreement can be reached on all the major issues. New Zealand  as a coastal State  recognizes the just interests of others: of the land-locked States and of those with limited access to the resources of the sea. We recognize the just interests of all countries  but especially the developing countries  in preserving the ""common heritage of mankind'' in the resources of the deep sea-bed. We hope that all countries will look to the next session of the Conference  in 1975  as the stage at which compromises must be made. And we believe that  if approached in that spirit  the session will lead quickly to the final treaty.28.	I shall now speak of the South Pacific and Niue. In connexion with the South Pacific islands  but in a different context  we are pleased to note that in a referendum on 3 September the people of Niue chose to become fully self-governing  in free association with New Zealand: On 19 October New Zealand and Niue will end their relationship of administering Power and Non-Self-Governing Territory; we will enter a new period of partnership on a basis of equality. As a self-governing State  Niue will take its place as a full member of the South Pacific Forum along with other independent and self-governing States in the Pacific  including Papua New Guinea. Niue's new Constitution contains my Government's assurance that New Zealand's economic assistance to Niue will continue as before. During the process of self-determination it has been helpful for the people of Niue  as well as for New Zealand  to have the United Nations constantly and closely involved.29.	New Zealand is conscious  as never before  of the importance of Africa on the world's stage. We see the need  not only for Africa but also in the wider interests of the international community  to find lasting and peaceful solutions to the problems of that continent.30.	It is understandable that the situation in southern Africa should be of such continuing concern to this Assembly. New Zealand stands solidly with the world community in rejecting the policy of apartheid in South Africa. My Prime Minister welcomed a recent opportunity to assure the Chairman of the Special Committee on Apartheid  Ambassador Ogbu of Nigeria  that New Zealand would continue its stand on sporting contacts with South Africa: South African teams will not be allowed to enter New Zealand  unless they represent a sport in which apartheid is not practiced.31.	New Zealand also continues to offer practical support to the victims of apartheid: it contributes to the United Nations Educational and Training Program for Southern Africa  the United Nations Trust Fund for South Africa and the United Nations Trust Fund for Namibia.32.	In addition  my Government has decided to contribute more than $200 000 over a two-year period to a joint project with UNICEF to provide humanitarian assistance through liberation movements for the tens of thousands of displaced persons from Southern Rhodesia  Namibia and Angola who are at present living in -Zambia. This money is given to supply drugs  vaccines  high-protein food supplements  agricultural tools and educational aid.33.	Before I conclude  may I express my Government's pleasure at the admission of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau to membership in the United Nations. We welcome also the historic change which now allows us to look forward to the early admission of two other important African countries  Mozambique and Angola. Their accession to independence will mark a major step in the process of decolonization and a further major step in the liberation of Africa. It will bring us still closer to the full realization of the principle of universality  to which my Government attaches great importance.34.	I have said that the primary concerns of this Organization today are people  food  energy  natural resources  the environment and the need for a new economic order. These are universal concerns; every nation has a duty to play its part in helping to solve them. New Zealand believes that all nations can best do this within the great family of the United Nations  accepting the obligations as well as the privileges of membership."
"94",5375,"OMN",29,1974,"At the outset  allow me to express the sympathy of the Government of Oman for the Governments and peoples of Honduras and Peru for the natural disasters which have struck those two countries recently.23.	Mr. President  I should like  on behalf of the Government of the Sultanate of Oman  to express to you our heartfelt congratulations and our full satisfaction on your election as President of the General Assembly at its twenty-ninth session. The long years of experience which you have acquired as Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sister country  Algeria  undoubtedly have  and will be  fully appreciated by the representatives here; and I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to assure you of our full support and cooperation in the conducting of our deliberations at this session.24.	Allow me  Mr. President  to extend  on behalf of my delegation and my Government  our feelings of appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Benites  for his skill  ability and wisdom  and the excellent way in which he led the Assembly during its twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session.25.	My Government extends a hearty welcome to Bangladesh  Grenada and GuineaBissau as new Members of the United Nations  and we are quite happy and satisfied to see the representatives of those countries take their places among us here. Their presence here will undoubtedly add strength to the future steps to be undertaken by this international Organization. My delegation looks forward to full cooperation with the representatives of those countries. Meanwhile  we wish to take this opportunity as well to express to the Governments and peoples of the new independent countries all wishes for success and prosperity in the future.26.	In conformity with its firm foreign policy of supporting the rights of peoples to freedom and independence and the eradication of colonialism an d racial discrimination in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations  Oman has actively participated in supporting the struggle waged by the peoples of Africa in Angola  Mozambique  Namibia  Zimbabwe and South Africa. It is our earnest hope to see the peoples of those countries take their rightful places among us in the Organization in the very near future.27.	The free peoples of Africa have always resisted military invasions and colonial suppression. In their long struggle for freedom there are striking examples of sacrifice that call for our admiration. The Government of Oman has never failed to support the lawful and just struggle of all peoples for freedom  independence and self-determination. In so doing  Oman has lived up to its deep rooted respect for the dignity of the human being as evidenced by its noble and glorious civilization and its profound belief in man as the ultimate end of all endeavors.28.	As a country of the third world  committed to a policy of neutrality and nonalignment and of respect for and a deeply rooted belief in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  Oman fully supports and favors the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. We declare also our firm support for the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the region of the Middle East  the objective of which would be to eliminate the crisis prevailing in the area and to prevent it from reaching uncontrollable dimensions.29.	Ever since the creation of the State of Israel  the situation in the Middle Fast has been continually exploding in a series of crises  in many cases reaching a point where it threatened international peace and security. This can only be attributed to the obstinacy and arrogance of Israel  its policy of aggression in the area and its continuous barbaric and brutal crimes perpetrated against the peaceful inhabitants of the area.30.	The policy of terrorism and intimidation which has prevailed and upon which Zionist policy has been based ever since Israel was created has been made clear in a series of acts of aggression against the land and people of Palestine  beginning in 1948. That policy has now reached an unprecedented degree of violence and brutality. The aggression perpetrated in 1967 by Israeli forces against three Arab States  Members of the United Nations  led to the deaths of thousands of innocent people. We are still witnessing repeated bombings and military attacks against Lebanese territory  all aimed at the liquidation of the Palestinian people.31.	It is not surprising that the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories [AI98I7]  established by virtue of General Assembly resolution 3005 (XXVII)  emphasizes Israel's repeated refusal to comply with United Nations resolutions and its insistence upon and persistence in a policy which is in defiance of those resolutions. The report proves once again that Israel is continuing the policy of aggression which it has always followed since its creation in 1948. Israel still persists in activities which are in flagrant contradiction with the fundamental principles of international law. It continues to expropriate the land in the area and to expel citizens from their homes. The refusal of the Israeli authorities to cooperate with the Special Committee constitutes yet another defiance by Israel of the resolutions of the General Assembly.32.	The tragedy of Palestine and the agony and sufferings of its people compel us to demand that the Geneva talks be resumed immediately  so that lasting peace and security  based on justice and acceptable to the countries of the region  particularly Palestine as represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO]  may be restored.33.	As far as the problem of the Sahara is concerned  my Government fully supports the agreement reached by Morocco and Mauritania to refer that issue to the International Court of Justice. We appeal to the Spanish Government to accept that agreement and to cooperate in finding a solution to the problem through negotiations and within the framework of the friendly relations that exist between Spain and the Arab world.34.	The Middle East is now facing another serious crisis which has stirred and disturbed the international community. I refer to the problem of Cyprus. My country  as a member of the nonaligned group  firmly believes in the urgent need to protect the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus and to ensure full respect for its sovereignty  without any interference in that country's internal affairs.35.	The developing countries which are producers of raw materials are attempting  through unity  to reach an agreement and understanding with the developed countries. That  of course  necessitates their continual insistence on their right to own and exploit their own natural resources. That is why the countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] have affirmed their right to establish the prices of oil in the world. For years oil had been sold at very low prices  while the prices of all the commodities exported by the developed to the developing countries had been reaching astronomic levels. That is why the developing countries producing oil decided that it was fully within their right to raise the price of oil in order to meet the rising prices of the commodities they needed. The increase in the price of oil was not aimed against the economic interests of any country  developed or developing; it was aimed at reestablishing the situation on a basis of justice  where injustice had long prevailed.36.	The world is now facing a severe economic crisis such as it has never experienced before. Oman supports the principle of international economic cooperation and regards the resolutions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly as a basis for such cooperation between the industrialized and the developing countries. The economic interdependence of the international community makes international cooperation essential as the only means of averting the impending starvation and misery of all mankind. Oman firmly believes in the importance of the role of the United Nations in ensuring stability and security  which are the fundamental requirements for economic and social progress throughout the world.37.	We also believe in the importance of preserving the natural resources of land and sea  and  in conformity with that belief  my Government has concluded an agreement with the Government of Iran on the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Straits of Hormos and the neighboring waters  in accordance with the principles of international law and the aims and principles of the United Nations. We believe that the happiness of the people of the area and the achievement of a better standard of living for them will come about only through such joint efforts. Moreover  in an attempt to preserve our marine environment and in the furtherance of our public  social and economic interests  on 3 August 1974  my Government promulgated the Marine Pollution Control Act.38.	Awareness of the importance of the sea and its role in the development of national economies prompted my Government to make a positive contribution in the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held in Caracas from 20 June to 29 August 1974. The importance of that Conference is evidenced by the participation of some 150 countries in an effort to find solutions to various interrelated problems. The high percentage of participation in the Conference on the Law of the Sea is again evidence of the awareness of the international community of the importance of the sea and its resources in the development process of national economies and the ever increasing importance of reaching binding agreements on the use  exploration and exploitation of the sea and its resources. We followed with great interest the views presented at Caracas  and we declare here that  within our means  my country will assist and actively help and cooperate to bring about a definitive formula acceptable to all.39.	Because we believe in the collective responsibility of States in the efforts to achieve international peace and security  Oman joined the group of the nonaligned countries. We firmly believe in (the principles which guide the nonaligned countries and fully share the point of view of that group. Furthermore  we are fully convinced that no sacrifice on OUF part will be too great for the cause of peace and development and the well being of all humanity.40.	The steps being undertaken for an open and direct dialog between the Arab States and European countries for the purpose of defining a firm basis for cooperation also have our full support. Such cooperation indicates the awareness of all parties concerned of their mutual dependence. We hope that such cooperation when it does come about will also not only include economic and political aspects but also be a step forward for full ArabEuropean cooperation at every stage and in every field.41.	I have tried to clarify my country's position as regards various issues facing the international community. Allow me to add here that the United Nations and the specialized agencies  in our view  have a greater role to play in resolving all these problems. I avail myself of this opportunity to reaffirm here our assurances that the Government of Oman will not hesitate or refrain from offering its help and from doing what is necessary to establish international peace and security in conformity with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations."
"95",5421,"PAK",29,1974,"Mr. President  it gives my delegation great pleasure to offer you warm felicitations on your election as President of the General Assembly. We regard this election as recognition cf the notable role played by Algeria in the furtherance of the just causes of the third world. You are a symbol too of the dynamic and resurgent forces of liberation that animate the great continent of Africa  forces which will continue to have our resolute support.78.	I should like to take this opportunity to pay our tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador  who presided with distinction over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly  as well as over its momentous sixth special session.79.	I wish to express also the distress of my country at the appalling tragedy that has struck Honduras and to convey to those who have suffered the deep sympathy of the people of Pakistan.80.	My country joins other Members of the United Nations in welcoming the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau as new Members of this Organization. We look forward to the distinctive contributions we know they will make to the work of the United Nations.81.	The past year has taken us somewhat closer to the realization of the objectives of the Organization. There have been welcome serious moves to resolve the long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict in order to bring peace to the Middle East. In Africa  a momentous step has been taken towards decolonization. The Third World has succeeded in promoting widespread recognition of the need for a more equitable international economic order. These are positive developments  but we have? yet far to travel to reach our goal.82.	The world is still haunted by a pervasive sense of insecurity and  as a result of the mounting inflationary pressures  the poorer nations face a desperate struggle for economic survival.83.	The detente between the super-Powers has gone some considerable way in relaxing tensions in Europe. It does not  however  encompass all regions of the world. To say this is not to belittle the important agreements that have been reached between these Powers. In the field of disarmament the strategic arms accords are in the nature only of preliminary steps in the direction of arms control. But* in absolute terms and in the context of the commitments undertaken under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]  they fall considerably short of what the world expects from these Powers in the matter of promoting the objective of general and complete disarmament. Undoubtedly  this is not a matter which lends itself to a quick solution. Nevertheless  the progress so far made has been painfully slow.84.	On the other hand  the development of science and technology  particularly nuclear technology  has proceeded apace. Today  a large number of countries can acquire  should they so choose  the capability to develop nuclear weapons. That they might actually do so was brought sharply home to the world by the explosion of a nuclear device this year by yet another country  India. This is a development of grave import.85.	The Government of India affirms that its nuclear explosion was intended entirely for peaceful purposes. The real difficulty lies in the fact that  in technological terms  there is no difference between a nuclear explosion for peaceful purposes and one that is conducted to develop a nuclear weapon. There is the further danger that India's experiment may have removed the restraint on nuclear proliferation and  unless effective safeguards can be provided against it  the Indian example may be emulated by others.86.	India's nuclear explosion came up for discussion at the Fifth Islamic Conference  attended by 37 countries  which met in Kuala Lumpur in June this year. It unanimously adopted a resolution which  inter alia  called upon all nuclear-weapon States to give a solemn undertaking in the nature of an obligation not to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear- weapon State. In the view of my Government  such an undertaking is necessary not only in itself: it is needed also if nuclear proliferation is to be checked.87.	There is one other line of action which might be fruitfully pursued in our search for security. It is now widely recognized that the goal of general and complete disarmament can be brought nearer by collateral measures such as the establishment of nuclear- free zones in various parts of the world. The General Assembly has commended this idea on several occasions. The non-nuclear States Conference also adopted a decision to this effect in 1968. The countries members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN] have taken a similar stand against the introduction of nuclear weapons in their region. The Organization of African Unity [OAU] has taken the same position with regard to Africa. In Latin America  a treaty is already in effect aimed at making that area a nuclear-free zone. On this year's agenda [item 101] there is a similar proposal  jointly introduced by Iran and Egypt  with regard to the Middle East.88.	Nearly two years .ago the Prime Minister of Pakistan  Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto  proposed that South Asia should be declared a nuclear-free zone [see AI9706  explanatory memorandum  para. 2]. Other countries of South Asia have also proclaimed their opposition to the introduction of nuclear weapons into the region  or their acquisition. Sri Lanka conceives the zone of peace in the Indian Ocean proposed by it as being free of nuclear weapons. The Government of India also has repeatedly asserted that it has no intention of acquiring nuclear weapons and remains opposed to military uses of nuclear energy.89.	Pakistan feels that this common desire of the States of South Asia now needs to be translated into a formal arrangement. A model for such an agreement already exists in the Treaty of Tlatolco. That treaty net only contains an unequivocal commitment by the regional States not to acquire or manufacture nuclear weapons: it establishes a regime for independent observation and verification of explosions conducted for peaceful purposes as a safeguard against the diversion of peaceful nuclear programs to military ends.90.	We are confident that all Members of the United Nations that desire to promote a climate of peace in South Asia and all those that  like us  feel concerned at the prospect of nuclear proliferation will welcome the proposal to declare the South Asian region a nuclear-free zone. Pakistan considers that the proposal to create such a zone in the Middle East also is a timely initiative  for the danger of nuclear proliferation looms large in that area as well.91.	We are happy to note that the situation in the South Asian subcontinent is progressively returning to normal. Bangladesh was recognized by Pakistan in February of this year. By the end of April  following two agreements between Bangladesh  India and Pakistan  all of the prisoners of war had been repatriated to Pakistan. And thanks to the very valuable assistance given by the United Nations under the able leadership of its Secretary-General  some 250 000 Bangladesh and Pakistan nationals stranded in either country had been repatriated to their homes by a massive air operation. These developments cleared the way for further steps to be taken for the normalization of the situation in the subcontinent as envisaged in the Simla Agreement.5 Accordingly  experts of the two countries met recently and concluded an agreement for the restoration of postal and telecommunications and travel facilities between the two countries. They also agreed to examine the questions of resumption of air links and trade at an early date.92.	It is obvious that normalization of relations is not an end in itself; it is only a means of achieving the larger objective of peace  so that the peoples of the subcontinent may be able to devote their pitifully limited resources principally to eradicating poverty and hunger rather than fritter them away in senseless conflict and confrontation. A firm commitment to the principles of peaceful coexistence  mutual respect for the sovereignty  political independence and territorial integrity of each country and a just and equitable settlement of their differences remain essential prerequisites to the building of a durable structure of peace.93.	The presence of Bangladesh as a Member of the United Nations marks a new relationship between the peoples of Bangladesh and Pakistan. The fraternal sentiments that animate them were vividly reflected in the warm welcome accorded to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman when he visited Lahore to attend the Islamic Summit Conference and in the tumultuous welcome Prime Minister Bhutto received when he arrived in Bangladesh. Undoubtedly some problems remain to be settled. Given goodwill and understanding  these too  we hope  will be solved. It is now increasingly recognized by the people of both countries that they must rise above the tragic events of 1971 and  in their mutual interest  work as sovereign and equal nations for the establishment of a friendly and co-operative relationship 94.	Against the background of these developments aimed at promoting subcontinental reconciliation and reinforcing the foundations of peace in the region  it is a matter of considerable disappointment to us that our relations with our other neighbor  Afghanistan  should be strained at this moment. This is all the more unfortunate when every consideration -historical  geographical  political  cultural or economic demands that the relations between the two countries should be especially close and friendly. We trust that the present unsatisfactory state of these relations is only a passing phase. It is the settled policy of my Government that we establish ""the best possible relationship with Afghanistan"" and  so far as we can  we will continue to work towards that end.95.	During the last year  war has erupted in two areas. On 6 October last year the fourth Arab-Israeli war broke-out the inevitable consequence of international failure to help settle the issues arising out of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. A cease-fire was brought about as a result of Security Council resolution 338 (1973) of 22 October. That was followed by a period of intense diplomacy and  thanks to the remarkable efforts of Mr. Henry Kissinger  the United States Secretary of State  and the sense of realism displayed by the parties to the conflict  the guns were silenced and the disengagement of forces was eventually effected.96.	But disengagement is no settlement. By itself it is not peace. It is only a preliminary step towards facilitating negotiations for a peaceful settlement. The Islamic Summit which met in Lahore in February this year unanimously resolved that the essential elements of a durable settlement are: first  the Complete withdrawal by Israel from the Arab territories occupied by it; second  the full restitution of the national rights of the Palestinian people; and third  the restoration of Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem. All these elements derive from the principles of a just peace in the Middle East set out in Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Short of a settlement on these lines  there will be no durable peace in the'Middle East.97.	In July fighting broke out in Cyprus following a coup d'etat against its constitutionally established Government  engineered by the Greek military junta in order to annex the island. This was a flagrant violation of the London  and Zurich Agreements  which guaranteed the independence of Cyprus. Turkey  which  together with Britain and Greece  is a guarantor of the independence of the island  moved in  both in order to discharge its obligations under those Agreements and to protect the Turkish community in Cyprus. It is fortunate that Greece now has a democratic Government and we hope that a lasting settlement can be achieved which fully safeguards the legitimate interests of both the Turkish and the Greek-Cypriot communities.98.	In regard to the Korean peninsula the encouraging trends which the Assembly noted last year have not produced the desired progress towards the reunification of that divided country. Pakistan will support any measures that the parties consider conducive to achieving the objective of peaceful reunification.99.	The presence of the delegation of Guinea-Bissau in this Hall today is an event of more than passing significance. It marks the culmination of a leng and unrelenting struggle by a people determined to free itself from colonial rule. It is the harbinger of the end of colonialism wherever it still exists. In bidding welcome to the representatives of Guinea-Bissau and expressing the hope that they will soon be joined by representatives of the other Territories under Portuguese control  we should like also to felicitate the new leadership of Portugal on the imaginative steps it is taking to liquidate its colonial empire in Africa in recognition of the legitimacy of the African liberation movement. We trust that the racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia will draw the necessary lessons from this development.100.	I now turn to the grim economic crisis that faces the developing countries. The future of the peoples of South Asia and much of the third world is today threatened by a danger of global proportions. It is caught up in an inflationary squeeze. Vast populations in the developing countries suffer from hunger and privation while the developed world is preoccupied with its own problems of inflation and monetary instability.101.	These grave problems constitute perhaps the greatest challenge which at present faces the nations of the world rich or poor. They have accumulated over the decades  due in large part to the failure of the international community  and particularly the affluent nations  to accept and make the adjustments necessary to build a just and balanced world economic order  even when such adjustments were called for in the interests of the developed countries themselves.102.	The General Assembly demonstrated a welcome unanimity at its sixth special session last April on recommendations to deal with the immediate difficulties facing countries which have been most severely affected by the current economic crisis. A number of countries have responded to the emergency operation to be launched by the Secretary-General as a first step in the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI)  Special mention may be made of the generous assistance rendered by some of the oil- producing countries  particularly Iran  Saudi Arabia  Abu Dhabi  Kuwait and Venezuela. These countries are making commendable efforts  bilaterally as well as through multilateral channels  to ease the burden of the developing countries most severely hit by the high rise in prices. A much greater effort by the international community  however  would be required to assist these countries if the relief is to be commensurate with the magnitude Of the formidable difficulties they face.	103.	Emergency relief alone is no substitute for the more fundamental changes needed to prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophic situation. So far  there is little evidence of any progress having been made towards the new economic order called for by the sixth special session of the General Assembly [resolution 3201 (S-VI)]. Nothing is being done to improve the terms of trade of the developing countries  to provide them greater access to the markets of the developed countries  or to build a monetary system which ensures the transfer of the needed resources to the developing countries. Unless such fundamental changes are made to restructure economic relations between the industrialized countries and the third world  the developing countries may have to consider whether they can continue to play a game in which they are cast as the perpetual losers.104.	Most of the policies being considered in world financial circles to deal with the current balance-Of- payments deficits of the developed countries give rise to doubts and fears. Those developing countries which do not produce oil may be further squeezed by the deflationary policies of the industrialized world. There may even be an actual transfer of their financial resources  in the form of payments for higher oil bills  to the developed countries and by way of the heavy investments being made by oil-producing countries in the industrialized nations. The eventual outcome of such a process could be an economic collapse in most developing countries.105.	The best way. to assist developing countries in their present economic difficulties is to ensure the injection of a substantial proportion of international monetary liquidity  in the form of investment and concessionary assistance  into the developing world. This would generate a greater demand for imports from the industrialized countries and help the latter to rectify their balance of payments. It would also open up a productive avenue for the investment of financial surpluses of the oil-producing countries and a source of supply for the commodities and goods needed by them for their own industrial and economic growth.106.	That is but one reason for the Third World to develop economic and technical co-operation among its own members. The Second Islamic Summit in Lahore  the Kuala Lumpur Conference of Islamic Foreign Ministers and the summit meetings of the non- aligned nations and of the OAU have all contributed significantly to the promotion of economic co-operation and unity of purpose among the countries of the Third World.107.	By maintaining that unity and promoting its economic strength  the Third World will be able not only to help to build a just economic order but would also ensure a more universal respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.108.	We can build the structure of a new democratic world order only on the basis of compliance with the principles and resolutions of the United Nations  on the basis of sovereign equality of States. The effort to secure this great objective must be carried on at every stage and every level of State relations  bilateral or multilateral/But it is in this world Organization that all these efforts can be synthesized and brought into focus.109.	Let me therefore express the hope that this Assembly will carry us closer to the objectives  the purposes and the aims which the United Nations set for itself nearly 30 years ago."
"96",5511,"PER",29,1974,"Before I begin my address  I wish to express to our sister Republic of Honduras the great grief and solidarity of the Government and people of Peru in connexion with the enormous natural catastrophe which has afflicted that country in the last few days. We trust that the United Nations will take immediate action to contribute to the recovery of the brave Honduran people from this disaster.165.	Mr. President  on behalf of the Revolutionary Government of Peru and the Peruvian people  I wish to express to you my sincere congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly. The high responsibilities entrusted to you are merely an undeniable recognition of your qualities as a statesman and of your dedication to the cause of non- alignment and the third world and your efforts in support of that cause.166.	I should also like to express a cordial greeting to Mr. Leopoldo Benites  from our sister Republic of Ecuador  for his outstanding and very effective role as President of the General Assembly at its last two sessions the regular session and the special session.167.	Similarly  I should like to express to the Secretary-General the appreciation of my Government for the' devotion and spirit of sacrifice with which he has contributed to the solution of the difficult problems which affect the peace and security of the world.168.	It is with particular satisfaction that my Government welcomes Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada  new States Members of the Organization  whose participation will greatly contribute to the fulfillment of the purposes and principles of theCharter and a concrete expression of the universality of the Organization.169.	Allow me to consider first the framework of the international situation. Detente between the great Powers has continued; new dialogs and new agreements during the year so far are proof of this. The danger of a nuclear war is no longer with us and the years of the cold war seem to be a thing of the past. However  detente at the summit has neither eliminated nor diminished conflicts at the periphery. On the contrary  the countries of the third world face even mo violence these days. Suffice it to mention the continuing wars of liberation in Viet Nam and Cambodia; the persistence of a tense situation in the Middle East and the emergence of a new such situation in Cyprus; the policy  which is a remnant from the past  that has been maintained against Cuba through a partial blockade which has clearly proved to be an anachronism and a failure; and the fact that the Indian Ocean  far from being a zone of peace  grows day by day as an area of rivalry.170.	Thus  the international situation rests upon a fragile and precarious state of peace and security. That is so because the hegemonic designs of the great Powers continue to be their everyday practice. There is an obvious contradiction between the detente being sought at the level of the great Powers and the fact that the developing nations are being thrust  socially and economically  into an increasingly marginal situation  and such a contradiction leads to ever more pronounced radical trends in the revolutionary potential of these nations.171.	We are living at a moment of critical stock-taking in which the world status quo is being increasingly questioned. We are witnessing a qualitative break in the course of history resulting from a social upheaval which has its origins in the sharp increase of poverty caused by relations of domination and dependence.172.	The present international situation is very fluid and very revolutionary. It becomes apparent in the multidimensional struggle of the countries of the third world to create a new international economic order which takes concrete form in the defense and recovery of natural resources; in the affirmation of the right to explore and exploit the riches of the seas adjacent' to their coasts; in the effort to regulate and control the excessive power of the great multinational corporations; in the general struggle for liberation from imperialism  colonialism and neocolonialism; and in the endeavor to achieve authentic revolutionary models without foreign interference  bolstering national culture and identity.173.	It is in that vein that the President of Peru  General Juan Velasco Alvarado  said: ""We are also aware of the radically new meaning of the present moment in the history of mankind; this is more than a mere rhetorical expression. It is a proven description of reality  for we must all understand that the old system of domination and dependence must be abandoned and the categories which served in the past to express the political reality of the world must now be redefined. The concepts of peace  security  and international co-operation  among others  must be profoundly revised. And  in the deepest sense of the expression  the moral order which was the foundation for international relations in the past must also be substantially altered.""174.	Cyprus and the Middle East are contiguous areas of grave international tension  which require preferential consideration in this forum. Cyprus is occupied and divided  and it is the task of the United Nations to bring about the restoration of its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. Direct dialog under the auspices of the Organization might constitute a procedure that would allow a peaceful solution capable of reconciling the interests of the two communities inhabiting the island and lead to the withdrawal of the foreign forces that are there today. In that same spirit  the non-aligned movement  which the Government of Cyprus helped to found  must play a substantial role in achieving those objectives.175.	The Middle East continues to be a zone of conflict  although the conflict has now acquired a new form. The use of oil as an instrument of negotiation has become an effective means of securing compliance with the resolutions of the Security Council  which have been so often reiterated by the non- aligned countries. The cease-fire and disengagement of forces  though only provisional measures  must constitute a necessary basis for the achievement  through the negotiations at Geneva  of a just  lasting and definitive peace  based on the principles of respect for the existence  integrity and sovereignty of all States in the region  the non-acquisition of territories by force and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.176.	The Revolutionary Government of Peru  with a firm pacifist conviction  has contributed to achieving the relaxation of tension in the area by sponsoring resolutions of the Security Council and by sending a battalion as part of the United Nations Force  which initially carried out a mission in the Sinai and at present has as its sphere of operations the Golan Heights  as part of the disengagement observation force in that critical area.177.	Without any doubt Africa is the area where a considerable change for the better has taken place with regard to the fulfillment of the purposes of this Organization. The tenacious struggle of liberation movements  with the political support of the non- aligned countries  has resulted in a positive change in the colonial situation. The new Government of Portugal and its progressively oriented armed forces have participated decisively in the change  thus permitting the confirmation of the independence of Guinea-Bissau and the taking of steps towards the emancipation of Mozambique and Angola. The heroic feat of Amflcar Cabral  who set in motion the liberation of his people  has achieved a happy and a just result. His spiritual presence remains with the young nations that have joined and strengthened the ranks of the third world in the movement towards justice and for the continued struggle against all forms of colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination.178.	Peru  as one of the first countries to recognize Guinea-Bissau  welcomes that valiant nation on the occasion of its admission to the United Nations and offers its fraternal co-operation.179.	We also view with pleasure the formation of the Provisional Government of Mozambique and trust that that country will achieve its full independence as soon as possible.180.	In Latin America a unified conscience is clearly emerging which will not allow exclusions and which is founded on ideological pluralism  nonintervention and the sovereignty and equality of all States. Historical experience underlines the fact that the achievement of unity within our plurality is essential in order to define and defend our true interest  deepen our interrelationship and reach our common destiny within the overall global context. 181.	December of this year will mark the 150th anniversary of the epic feat of liberation which occurred at Ayacucho  where armies from South American countries  as brethren under the leadership of the liberator Simon Bolivar  put an end to colonial domination  thus consolidating the emancipation of America. The Government of Peru wishes to celebrate that historic anniversary with the presence of the presidents of those countries which were represented on the battlefield at Ayacucho  where the first kind of independence  political independence  was achieved. At that summit meeting we must lay the foundations for the reaffirmation of the imperative need to preserve our unity and solidarity in order to achieve  once and for all  true economic independence for our peoples  which is the second kind of independence.182.	The Revolutionary Government of Peru  which participates actively in the search for formulas to help in bringing about peaceful coexistence and co-operation for the development of the region  firmly rejects and condemns intervention in the internal affairs of other States  whether it be political or economic  military or paramilitary  overt or covert intervention. Peru reaffirms that respect for the principle of non-intervention  in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and with the charter of the Organization of American States  must be one of the basic foundations for bilateral  inter-American and global relations.183.	Latin America shares an identity of structural situation with the countries of the third world and therefore its struggle for liberation acquires a universal scope. My country has made a contribution to a review of existing international relations by offering Lima as the site of the forthcoming ministerial meeting of non-aligned nations to be held in 1975  so that that review may take place. The meeting will serve to co-ordinate the efforts of countries of Africa  Asia and Latin America to achieve a new international order which will ensure the effective democratization of international relations. In that way the Peruvian revolution  which is ideologically autonomous  humanist and essentially Latin American  and imbued with a third-world policy  will contribute once more to the constant improvement of the international situation in America and in the world.184.	The United Nations is still the most visible international stage  as it were  where it is possibleDigitized by Dag Hammarskjold Libraryto observe with t'.e greatest clarity a world situation characterized mainly by the persistent struggle of the third world for liberation. That struggle is taking place not only in the military and politico! fields but also in the economic and technological fields  wherein lie the main factors for obtaining full and total independence. In that sense it is no mere coincidence that the three major conferences of the United Nations held this year have addressed themselves to the defense of human potential and natural resources both from the land and from the sea. The sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and development  the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the World Population Conference dealt essentially with one and the same problem the inexorable need to modify the anachronistic and unjust system of domination and dependence.185.	The sixth special session showed  in the light of the energy crisis  that the wealth and growth of opulent industrialized consumer societies depend on the extraction of natural resources from developing countries. This in turn shows clearly that the relationship between the industrialized countries and those of the third world has entered upon an era of interdependence  which must take the form of an effective equality in the political relations of States  based on a new technological and financial co-operation  geared towards the full development of the developing nations and respect for their sovereignty.186.	The sixth special session also showed that the international economic order which has been in existence since the first capitalist industrial revolution is fragile  does not make economic sense and threatens to worsen the world economic crisis. That experience demonstrates the need to change the present unjust international economic structure. For this purpose we feel that one of the tools of change is the establishment of associations of developing countries which are producers and exporters of raw materials  in order to create the negotiations power necessary to defend their prices  setting aside sterile confrontations  and also to correct the imbalance of economic power which is so unjustly weighted against us.187.	The existence of multinational corporations which exercise enormous economic and political power is a contemporary phenomenon which has a world-wide dimension and has of late become a serious means for imperialist penetration  responsible to a large degree for the economic crisis and the pollution of the environment which is detrimental to human life itself. I therefore believe that one of the greatest challenges facing us is that of limiting once and for all the uncontrolled freedom of action of those corporations in order to safeguard the sovereignty of States and the heritage of mankind.188- The Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States has not been finalized because of the lack of political will shown by certain industrialized States. This important document must include legal and economic rules which  while ensuring the rights of States to full development  must also include the basic principles of the historic Declaration on the Establishment of a New International EconomicOrder adopted by consensus at the sixth special session of the General Assembly.189.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held at Caracas  has also called into question the system of domination and dependence  and rejected the old order. At that Conference the 200-mile limit was virtually accepted as an irreplaceable symbol of the new law of the sea  for the recognition of which Peru  together with other nations of Latin America and Africa  has struggled unflinchingly. Peru has defended for 27 years  in a firm and dignified manner  the position of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the sea  its subsoil and soil up to 200 miles as a substantive element in the new legal order and the recognition of a cause that is indissolubly linked to the security  welfare and development of peoples.190.	Another event of singular importance is the consolidation of the principle of universal social ownership of the sea-bed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction  the administration of which should be carried out by an international authority to be established with the equitable participation of all States. In accordance with the consensus of the Group of 77 developing countries  the exploitation of the resources at the bottom of the sea should not be carried out for the purpose of mere profit. Rather  it should be truly placed at the service of the peoples of the whole world as the common heritage of mankind.191.	At Caracas  thanks to the cohesion of the third world  the formulation was begun of a new law of the sea  which  in its humanist inspiration  must become an instrument of justice  co-operation and peace  and no longer a tool for hegemony at the service of the great Powers.192.	Contradictory positions were put forward -\t the World Population Conference  held at Bucharest last month. The theses which link underdevelopment solely to the population explosion and its solution to birth control were rejected by numerous developing countries  because population growth beyond resource supplies reveals a social and economic imbalance originating in structures of domination and dependence which prevent a proper balance between population and resources. The solution lies not in birth control  but rather in a structural change which would allow for true economic development. Today the problem of the population explosion may be seen as a consequence of a poor distribution of wealth  which  in turn  gives rise to unequal levels consumption.193.	As long as opulent consumer societies  which constitute a minority  absorb 40 per cent of the total natural resources and energy produced in the world  there is no justification whatever for the attempt by those societies to impose population policies and measures on an international scale because  really  all they reflect is their own interests. For these reasons  my country  together with other States of the world  has stated the need for each country to set its population policies independently  and has supported the World Plan of Action on Population.194.	An industrial development which will permit a just distribution of wealth  while ensuring at the same time the protection of the marine environment  is a great challenge to today's civilization. Peru has endeavored to contribute to meet this challenge by offering Lima as a site for the Second General Conference of UNIDO. That Conference will have to consider  with imagination and audacity  the type of industrialization most advisable for the different developing countries. Hence the need for all Members of the Organization to lend their full support and co-operation for the success of the conference.195.	The United Nations must reflect institutionally the new international situation  as has been stated by the Secretary-General in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization [AI9601I Add.I]. We need a more dynamic  critical and creative Organization  that is to say  an instrument for change  uninfluenced by the trappings of bureaucracy. This creates the need for a more effective participation of the Secretariat in order to give more force and effectiveness to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.196.	The rule of unanimity in the Security Council  also known as the right of veto  was based on an international order in which the risk of conflict arose principally between the great industrialized Powers. This was the result of the experience of the Second World War. Today  new forces have emerged on the international scene  requiring a review of this institutionalized way of wielding power. The countries of the third world  to which international conflict has shifted  are those which have to withstand the critical situations  and in most cases  they suffer the consequences of an arbitrary veto and have no option in that situation.197.	It is therefore an imperative necessity to reach a formula that will limit this excessive prerogative  which simply reflects a past realism and violates the principle of the sovereign equality of States. Accordingly  we feel it is advisable to consider a possible solution. A veto by a great Power could be superseded or neutralized when a large majority of the General Assembly came out against it. Thus the hegemonic interference of a great Power in a conflict affecting small or medium-sized Powers would be neutralized and the prevalence of a single will over that of the international community would be avoided.198.	As we have stated  international peace and security  which are elements of the same reality  demand institutional change in view of the new world structure of power. It has been clearly demonstrated that for the third world the absence of major conflicts between the great Powers is not the same thing as peace. Hence the need to widen the concept of security by injecting into it an economic content.199.	For a developing country the use of economic pressure can have effects which are as deleterious as armed aggression. Therefore  since it threatens international security it constitutes aggression in itself. Security Council resolution 330 (1973) created precedents in this new context in calling for an end to economic measures of coercion by States or multi-national corporations. As a corollary to this we feelit is necessary to stimulate efforts towards the establishment of a system of collective economic security to preserve the sovereign right of States to self-sustained development.200.	The strengthening of the United Nations as an organization capable of creating a framework of political confidence among States is closely related to the problem of general and complete disarmament. At present  the fragility of peace in all regions of the world is the result of the development of the destructive power of sophisticated weapons  which threaten the very existence of the peoples of the world. Fear and uncertainty have generated an alarming arms race both among the great Powers and among the developing countries. According to United Nations studies on the subject  about $270 000 million are spent on weapons annually that is to say  20 times more than is spent on development cooperation. This is a sum greater than the combined gross national product of Africa and Asia and far greater than that of all of Latin America. Hence it is necessary to establish the requisite control machinery and to formulate a disarmament policy directly related to a new philosophy for development co-operation.201.	Peru  which has recently been invited to participate as a member of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament  is extremely interested in contributing to an acceleration of the work of that Committee. Our deep pacifist convictions have been properly expressed in the initiative of the head of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru  General Juan Velasco Alvarado  who has proposed that in Latin America the acquisition of armaments be limited for a period of 10 years in order not to divert resources needed for development. The proposal has earned the determined support of many countries of the Andean Pact. We are sure that by these means we shall establish the confidence needed to facilitate integration and development in Latin America.202.	If we want a new world order in which justice will prevail we must help to create it. We can hardly call for international change and participation in it if we do not transform the obsolete structures of our own society. Consequently the Peruvian revolution humanist  just  libertarian  socialist and Christian builds its doctrinary base on a permanent awareness of our own reality and formulates an authentic ideological and political concept of a social democracy with the participation of all. In Peru today the profile of a new revolutionary society is clearly emerging. Large sectors of the population  fully conscious of their historic role  are rising and participating in solidarity in the process of the social creation of wealth and in its benefits.203.	An important step in this direction has been the creation of social ownership a sector which will enjoy priority and preponderance in the economic organization of the country. This form of social and common ownership is different in essence from a system of private or State property and will be exercised through the workers themselves organized in free production associations  which in our concept of revolutionary humanism makes man a profound creator and doer. In this context and as a necessary step towards the future Peruvian society  the revolution has freed the press from the minority circles of private and family ownership and handed it over to the organized sectors which are truly representative of the Peruvian people.204. Freedom of the press in Peru will no longer be mistaken for the biased freedom of private publishing companies or the manipulatory concentration of the publishing industry in the hands of the State. Today in our country freedom of expression is a right extended to all the people. These measures are in conformity with Economic and Social Council resolution 756 (XXIX)  which states that the information media must be at the service of the people.2051 I cannot fail to stress in concluding that the emergence of the peoples of the third world constitutes a new  dynamic force which is transforming contemporary international relations. Our nations have abandoned the status of petitioners  which flourished in the paternalistic atmosphere of the past  in order to follow the path of autonomous development. Liberation for the third world is development  and there is no development without liberation. The order of the day for them is to make unity a principle and solidarity a strategy so as to transform our peripheral and marginal status and achieve  in dignity and justice  the position in the international community which is rightfully ours.206. There will be no peace in the world until we see the end in our countries of conflicts which originate in different forms of imperialism  the remnants of colonialism  distorting cultural penetration  intervention and pressures of all kinds  no matter how subtle. In a word  peace in opulence is not the peace of the third world. This forum  which is so familiar with conflicts  must become familiar with justice. To that end we  the peoples of the third world  demand respect of our right to be masters of our own destiny  to achieve our full development  and especially to eradicate  in this way and forever  uncertainty  social unrest and poverty."
"97",5558,"PHL",29,1974,"The Philippines offers its warmest congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  the Foreign Minister of Algeria  on his election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. President Bouteflika's background is that of a revolutionary  and that is what the world needs right now a dedicated revolutionary.74.	In the session just past  we depended on the ripe wisdom of Mr. Leopoldo Benites to guide us through a series of crises more formidable than many we have faced in previous years. Having succeeded in drawing up the firm guidelines for coping with crises  we must now lean upon the vitality  the energy and the strong convictions of this youthful new President of the Assembly to see us through the next  and even more difficult  stages of implementing agreements reached in principle.75.	We wish to congratulate at this time and to welcome into our midst the latest members of the United Nations  the new sovereign States of Grenada  Bangladesh  and Guinea-Bissau. Their presence here is another affirmation of the powerful tides of self-determination which began sweeping the world shortly after the end of the Second World War. It is to the credit of Portugal  and a stern warning to the remaining colonial Powers in Africa  that it has recognized and accepted the fact that the course of decolonization is irreversible.76.	We listened this morning [2242nd meeting] to the moving statement of the representative of Honduras. I hasten to assure him  on behalf of the Philip pine Government  of our deepest sympathies for the tragic calamity which has befallen his people. I come from a country which is periodically buffeted by typhoons and often devastated by floods  and we in the Philippines understand the suffering of the Honduran people. We feel for them deeply.77.	The accession to the presidency of Mr. Abdel aziz Bouteflika is appropriate and timely in a very important sense. The world is in the midst of an economic dislocation so grave that its repercussions are bound to be felt far into the future. While all nations are in the grip of these dangerous economic trends  it is the developing nations which today feel its effects most strongly. Indeed  many of them are on the brink of economic collapse.78.	As a recognized leader among the developing countries  our new President can be expected to provide profound insights into their difficulties. At the same time  he is in a position to moderate what we most wish to avoid  namely  the degeneration of the understandable conflicts of interest between the rich and the poor countries conflicts inherent in the present economic system into bitter and frustrating confrontation. The future of mankind  both of its affluent and of its disadvantaged segments  lies not in confrontation but in co-operation based on equity and justice.79.	Addressing the Governing Council of UNDP at its eighteenth session held in Manila earlier this year  the President of the Philippines called strongly for the immediate implementation of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order and of its accompanying Program of Action. He was the first Head of State to do so in an international forum. Recalling the debates during the sixth special session of the General Assembly an historic special session he said:""[The] concern [of the sixth special session] was not with the past but rather with the present and future. Historical injustices were recalled  not to be exacerbated but to be redressed and transcended. The challenge presented to the rich  industrialized countries was not to irreconcilable conflict but to a massive joint commitment to fashion together a more rational and equitable relationship.""80.	The grim prospects confronting the developing countries emphasize the importance of institutionalizing this new type of relationship as promptly as possible. Time has made their economic problems more acute  with further deterioration in sight in the coming year. Nor can we overlook the possibility of political and social upheavals in the wake of irresistible inflationary pressures coupled with worsening shortages.81.	The encouraging rise in commodity prices has now reached a peak and will soon decline. Only a quarter of the considerable gain in commodity prices went to the developing regions  and of this gain the bulk was negated by the steep increases in the prices of food grains and fertilizers.82.	Furthermore  the developing countries experienced sharp deficits in trade in 1973  with every prospect that the deficits will increase this year.83.	Few aspects of the world-wide economic up heaval cut closer to the bone than the food crisis. What was once viewed as an unfortunate but temporary state of affairs is now correctly regarded as a chronic condition which will grow worse in time unless concerted international action is taken promptly.84.	As long as their vast food resources remain untapped  because of understandable deficiencies in capital and in technology  the developing countries will continue to be the victims of hunger and malnutrition. On humanitarian grounds alone they deserve assistance from the more fortunate industrialized countries  for the toll in human lives now and in the years ahead can well exceed our most pessimistic calculations. And its effects on world stability  on peace and security should be obvious to all.85.	Solving the problem  of course  is not easy. A rising population  competition for sources of food  the ever-present possibility that food assistance will be subject to narrow political ends rather than broad humanitarian objectives  the growing food requirements of the affluent societies themselves  these admittedly complex factors should not' deter us from confronting the very real dangers posed by hunger and famine.86.	The Philippines would therefore favor the establishment of a world food reserve in order to ensure assistance to countries suffering from food shortage regardless of the amount of surplus among donor countries. To this most basic of human problems the principle of special preferences for needy regions should be applied.87.	In the long run  expanding the world's food supply is a fundamental consideration. But in order to do this  greater assistance to the agricultural sec tors of developing nations would be required. Dwindling food stocks  even in many industrialized countries  make this step even more urgent. Beyond the immediate needs of food  improving the level of agriculture is a fundamental contributory factor to the national development of countries in the developing regions.88.	The Philippines attaches great importance to the forthcoming World Food Conference  with the strong hope that it will be able to evolve a concrete plan of action without too much delay.89.	An integral part of the food problem is the hap less plight of an estimated 400 million children in the developing countries. At its fifty-seventh session  in its resolution 1880 (LVII)  the Economic and Social Council endorsed the decision of the Executive Board entitled ""Declaration of an emergency for children in developing countries as a result of the current economic crisis""  and made an urgent appeal to all Governments for increased contributions to UNICEF. It is  indeed  a sad commentary on the world's conscience that UNICEF  after almost three decades of quiet and dedicated service  has not received the adequate financial support it has always deserved. It is our hope that the 1974 United Nations Special Pledging Conference on UNICEF scheduled for November will elicit a generous response and demonstrate the anxieties and concerns of the international community over the world's suffering children.90.	It should be evident that the foregoing problems I have mentioned  being global in character  are susceptible only to collective measures on the part of the international community. The Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  the World Population Conference  the World Food Conference  and the projected seventh special session of the General Assembly constitute historic efforts to tighten the web of world wide interdependence in order to solve the problems which impede development and endanger the world economy. They are important in still another sense  for they will be a test of whether we have developed in the United Nations the requisite political will to override narrow particularist concerns for the sake of the world community as a whole.91.	In this connexion  the Philippines hopes that the remaining difficulties with regard to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States could be resolved to permit the adoption of the Charter at this session of the Assembly. We feel that adoption of the Charter would be an indispensable step towards the establishment of the new international economic order. 92.	I have spoken of the profound interest of the President of the Philippines in a new international economic order. Committed as we are to expanded development and focusing all resources on the achievement of this objective  the Philippines under the New Society has been inevitably affected by the world-wide economic upheavals. Only through the most strenuous efforts has it been able to approximate the dramatic improvements achieved through drastic economic restructuring in the first year of our New Society. Our stake in the improvement of the world economic climate is therefore great  for it can be of decisive importance in our pursuit of the accelerated time-table for national development.93.	Like most developing countries  the Philippines has been affected by the sharp increases in import prices  raising the probability of a deficit in our balance-of-payments position. Inflation  though our rate is among the most moderate in South-East Asia  has prevented further improvement in living standards without  however  causing a real decline.94.	Despite the expected difficulties  however  the gross national product of the Philippines increased by 5.8 per cent in the first eight months of 1974  a figure which is higher than in previous years  with the exception of 1973. Last year the Philippines was in the upper third in the roll of developing countries which exceeded the target growth rate set by the Inter-national Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)\ in the field of manufactures 95.	As a result of measures taken to prevent massive rice shortages caused by typhoons  the Philip pines increased its grain production by 12 per cent  short of self-sufficiency  but enough to avert wide spread shortages in the event of expected natural calamities.96.	Overall food production  however  is at a record level  the Philippines being one of only four Asian countries to show this remarkable performance in a year of falling production in most developing regions.97.	In another field  the Philippines is among the fortunate few to exceed the amount of $200 million in gains in international reserves.98.	But the Philippines is under no illusion that its present generally favorable situation will persist if the world-wide economic situation continues to deteriorate. Nor can it dissociate itself from the plight of other  poorer countries which are now rapidly approaching the point of irreversible descent into anarchy and chaos caused by extreme poverty. Whether we wish it or not  their fate instills an awful sense of foreboding in the entire human community.99.	It is in this context that we view the arms race and the ever-increasing amounts wasted in its pursuit as a terrible comment on our sense of human values. It bespeaks a deadening of the finer impulses of man that he should place the development of weapons of destruction on a far higher scale of priority than the fulfillment of his most basic requirements.100. Nor is this race for weapons confined to the great Powers  for the supply of arms to the smaller Powers has increased at an unprecedented rate thereby increasing the danger of conventional wars which nevertheless always carry the risk of involving the great Powers.101.	An equally disturbing development is the dangerous proliferation of nuclear weapons. The capability for manufacturing them is no longer the exclusive monopoly of the rich  industrialized countries. This suggests that the threshold of nuclear danger has been lowered to a degree that may in the near future prove dangerous to world peace and security. That there should be nations whose populations are starving and afflicted by famine but that are producing nuclear arms is indeed a sad commentary on the world today.102.	In the light of the foregoing developments  the United Nations should begin seriously to con sider fresh initiatives to moderate the runaway arms race  halt nuclear proliferation and ban test explosions completely.103.	These matters acquire particular significance at a time when the Middle East problem still carries the potential for renewed conflict and at a time when agreement has yet to be reached on the tragic war in Cyprus. On the Middle East question  we of the Philippine delegation reiterate our view that a just solution should be based on the relevant United Nations resolutions calling on Israel to withdraw ; from all occupied territories.104.	Another important aspect of the Middle East problem  which is basic to its solution  is the question of the Palestinian people. Having no wish at this time to reopen a generation-old debate  I shall confine myself to quoting my original intervention in the Assembly on the same subject in 1947  when the sessions were being held at Flushing Meadows.I said then:""We have assessed the legal arguments and found that they are not the decisive factors in shaping a just and practical solution. Whatever the weight we might choose to assign to the arguments of the one side or the other  it is clear to the Philippine Government that the rights conferred by mandatory power  even if subsequently con firmed by an international agreement  do not vitiate the primordial right of a people to deter mine the political future and to preserve the territorial integrity of its native land.""105.	Continuing  I said that the issue was primarily moral and that the enforcement of the partition policy was and I quote again ""repugnant to the valid nationalist aspirations of the people of Palestine"".2106.	Because the shape of the problem has been modified in the intervening years  the Philippines shall  against this background  speak on this subject j again at an appropriate time in this Assembly.107.	Turning to our part of the world  the spirit of the Shanghai communique is alive in Asia  and a rearrangement in the balance of forces on its basis has ensued quietly and without fanfare. The apparent stability in the region has encouraged diplomatic activity  tending further to cement existing relation ships. Prime Minister Tanaka of Japan visited South-East Asia  and Prime Minister Whitlam of Australia made a similar tour earlier this year.108.	The pursuit of normalized relations between (he People's Republic of China and South-East Asian countries continues. In mid-1974  Malaysia established full diplomatic relations with the People's- Republic  and trade and cultural missions from Peking and various South-East Asian capitals have exchanged visits visible evidences of a more relaxed relationship between them. At this very moment  Mrs. Imelda Marcos  wife of the President of the Philippines and his designated envoy  is in Peking on a goodwill mission and has been very well received there.109.	Behind these activities lies the hope that the new balance of power will be a force for constructive changes on the basis of complementary interests  not alone among the big Powers with interests in the region  but also between them and the smaller Asian Powers.110. However  the problem of stability and security in the region remains the principal responsibility of the nations of the region. Among the six member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the first large step in enhanced economic co-operation was taken this year when active negotiations began on the implementation of industrial complementation projects and on the establishment of a free-trade zone in the region. An expanding web of relationships has also begun to develop between the ASEAN member countries and other countries and organizations  with  among others  Australia and New Zealand  and with the European Economic Community.111.	Much  of course  remains to be done to ensure the security of the region. As long as the Paris agreement remains unenforced and apparently unenforceable the situation in IndoChina will continue to be a threat to the general security of South-East Asia.112.	In the Khmer Republic  an unprecedented situation has emerged  raising political  legal and moral questions of great complexity. Last year the Philippines opposed the ""back-door"" grant of recognition to the rival Sihanouk ""Government""  which would give it the right to represent Khmer in the United Nations. We will continue to oppose this move  in the belief that the people of Khmer should be free to decide their own political future and to adopt the economic and social system of their choice without interference from any outside sources.113.	On the question of Korea  the peaceful reunification of the divided halves remains our objective  and we are prepared to lend our support to mutually acceptable means of reaching this goal. Provided it is acceptable to both the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of Korea  we shall support the admission to the United Nations of both those States in the hope that this would provide an additional avenue for reaching agreement on reunification.114.	Let me touch on other items on the agenda that are of particular interest to us. My delegation feels that the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is one of the most significant endeavors of the world Organization. The objective of developing a progressive international law based on equity and social justice in order to bring about peace and stability in the oceans and to permit the full utilization of the vast resources of the sea for the benefit of all. mankind cannot be long deferred. Moreover  we cannot ignore the possibility that an area comprising two thirds of our planet will  unless agreement is reached  become yet another focus of intense rivalries dangerous to the peace of the world.115.	From the particular point of view of an archipelagic State like the Philippines  the Conference has given us and similar States an opportunity never before provided us to secure recognition of the unique problems arising from our geographical configuration.116.	Although we cannot  in complete candor  say that we were entirely satisfied with the result of the session held at Caracas  we feel that it has generated a momentum which should be maintained. It is our view  therefore  that no time should be wasted in permitting the Conference to continue its work. For this reason  the Philippines will support the recommendation that another session be convoked in Geneva from March to May 1975.117.	Our traditional respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms remains undiminished. Indeed  our recent experience has given us a deeper insight into the nature and meaning of human rights. We realize today with special force the truth of the observation that the achievement of economic and social rights through accelerated national development is an indispensable requirement for the exercise of civil and political rights. Without the effective enforcement of law and order and without a sound economic base  respect for human rights remains at best theoretical. In this connexion  I am pleased to inform this Assembly that the Government of the Philippines deposited with the Secretary-General on 7 June 1974 its instruments of ratification of the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights [resolution 2200 A (XXI)  annex].118.	At this session we shall support all measures which assist in advancing the cause of human rights throughout the world. And we shall continue to give the most vigorous support to the struggle against racist policies of all varieties and against all efforts to segregate peoples on the basis of color and race from the mainstream of their national life.119.	As a nation which by tradition has held women in high esteem  the Philippines favors the prompt elimination of discrimination on the basis of sex. Women in my country are the full and equal partners of men in national development; we look forward to the day when this practice is made universal. The observance of International Women's Year in 1975  for which the Philippines has already made preparations  is a timely reminder of the need to integrate women  who  after all  constitute half of the world's population  into the total human resources available for national development.120.	Let me reiterate that this Assembly is faced with global problems which demand global solutions. Those solutions can be achieved only through greatly enhanced international co-operation. In turn  co-operation of such scope and depth requires the full use of the United Nations in the entire range of human concerns.121.	As the problems become progressively more acute  the need for effective solutions becomes more urgent. Some of the sense of urgency and the strong feeling of interdependence assured by the sixth special session of the General Assembly last April still remain. Our task is to maintain the momentum generated by the special session and to continue to foster the spirit of interdependence arising out of the very seriousness of the problems which confront us.122.	But a fundamental element seems to be missing. In a rare note of pessimism  the Secretary-General predicted that perhaps the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will be in the grip of a crisis of helplessness. A deficiency in determination  a lack of political will  delays the Assembly from taking the required courses of action that could lead to firm decisions. I suggest that this deficiency may also arise from the shortcomings of the Charter itself a Charter which  as I shall presently explain  contributes to a sense of division rather than of harmony in the context of today's realities. My delegation therefore welcomes the recommendation of the General Committee that item 95 entitled ""Need to consider suggestions regarding the review of the Charter of the United Nations: report of the Secretary-General"" should be retained on this year's agenda.123.	Over the past 30 years  events and long-term developments have imposed the conclusion that the structure and processes adopted at the end of the last world war by the victorious allies very quickly lost their relevance and validity. I speak as one of the original signatories of the Charter in 1945 at the San Francisco Conference. The ideological confrontation destroyed the possibility of unanimity among the five permanent members of the Security Council  and their veto power was transformed from a guarantee of international unity into an instrument for the protection of national interests.124.	It is needless to review  for all of us remember  the various conflicts  large and small  brief or protracted  for which the Organization  under its present Charter  was unable to find a solution  much less to enforce one. More and more often  solutions have been sought  and sometimes found  outside the framework of what was originally conceived to be the unchallengeable arbiter of the world's disputes.125.	Perhaps the original ideal was impractical  beyond the possibility of realization in a world of sovereign States. All the more reason  then  to under take a serious and continuing review and revision of the structure and procedures of the Organization. The last of the Western colonial empires is now in liquidation; the emancipated nations have almost tripled the membership of the United Nations  while the former metropolitan Powers  which could formerly presume to represent their millions of subjects  can now speak only for themselves. On the other hand  it is perhaps understandable that they should seek protection against what may appear to them to be the tyranny of numbers at a time of a proliferation of States in various stages of development but all equally jealous of their equality in the vote.126.	Few will deny that the United Nations has devised ingenious procedures to overcome the inherent limitations of the present Charter. It has broadened the scope of its activities to cover a wide spectrum of issues which the founders of the Organization never anticipated. Still  for our time  the Charter fails to reach the heart of the matter  which is the disturbing division between the developing and developed countries  or  to put it more bluntly  the few rich and the many poor. Never in the history of the United Nations has that division been more apparent that it is today.127.	The paramount need of the United Nations is a Charter which provides the institutional means for reconciling the two sides  for bridging the gap between them  and for inducing them to co-operate  instead of deepening the distrust in which they hold one another. On these terms alone  if no other  there is  I submit  little to be lost if we place the provisions of the Charter under continuing review  to study how they work and have worked in the past and  above all  to explore the possibilities of bringing them more in accord with present realities.128.	It is disheartening to see the United Nations unable for all these long years to put an end to the Palestinian problem  to the apartheid regime in South Africa  to the illegitimate occupation of Namibia  to so many other situations that haunt session after session of the General Assembly like ghosts that can neither be buried nor forgotten.129.	It is disillusioning to see the United Nations playing no direct part in reshaping the international monetary system 130.	It is deeply dismaying to realize that the United Nations  for all the bright promises of its Charter and declarations and proclamations  is unable to do more to protect the human rights of millions of human beings. No doubt  there are serious legal and political difficulties to be faced in any study or revision of the Charter. Such a revision might even entail its renegotiation. Any fundamental change is painful and calls for much thought and heart-searching; but when change is needed for survival  it is inevitable.131.	Allow me to illustrate this with any example from our own national experience in the Philippines. Two years ago  almost to this very date  the President of our country placed it under martial law. It was within his constitutional powers to do so  as the Supreme Court of the Republic decided only last week; but it was also a very drastic  even revolutionary measure  for it meant a fundamental change  a radical revision of our political and social structure and institutions which had been part of our way of life since the proclamation of our independence in 1946 almost the same length of time as the United Nations has existed and  indeed  for about 40 years before that. 132.	The change was a shock; it was agonizingly painful to many; but it worked  and it is working- It forestalled a revolution that  after all  sought only the same goals; it staved off financial ruin; it restored peace and promised social order. Above all  it worked because it brought the constitutional and govern mental structure and processes into line with the political  economic and social realities in a nation that had been groping for the true balance between them for more than a quarter-century.133.	We in the United Nations  I dare to suggest  have also been trying to strike that true balance for almost the same measure of time. To find it now  when it is so needed  if not for survival  at least for significance and effectiveness  we must  I suggest  be equally bold after long patience; we must be persistent with long deliberation and unafraid of radical departures when confident of our ultimate destination. For that reason my delegation will sup-port  and indeed sponsor  any initiative to establish a continuing or permanent group to study the revision of the Charter and submit recommendations thereon.134.	Two years ago  at this same forum  I made the observation that radical changes had overtaken the world. How profound these changes were we now fully realize. The detente begun in Asia and subsequently followed in Europe has  for all practical purposes  revised the structure of international relations. The beginning of concord and harmony in the political field  despite temporary set-backs  has be come visible  amid our hopes are buoyed by the rich possibilities of peace and security for all mankind. We fully expect it to create the environment in which we can pursue with greater vigor the progress and development of nations.135.	Today  we are at the painful beginning of that search for progress. Because we view the problems at such close range  we tend to be traumatized by their immense difficulties. The danger is that this should lead to a fatal paralysis of will  leaving the problems unsolved and worse than they were be fore. I venture to say that in the midst of difficulties we have learned the lesson that today  more than ever  we must shed parochialism  discard selfishness  and dismiss the narrower demands of sheer self-interest. Never before has this thought emerged with greater clarity and force: if our society is to survive  we must accept collective responsibility for its well-being. Interdependence has ceased to be a mere pious wish. Inevitable  indeed inescapable  it is the very basis for the continuation of the society of man in the twentieth century."
"98",5664,"POL",29,1974,"It is with profound satisfaction that I address you from the rostrum of the United Nations on behalf of Poland  one of the founding Members of the Organization and an ever active participant in its activities  which are so vitally important to the world.3.	I am happy  Mr. President  that this session is taking place under the guidance of an outstanding representative of Algeria  a country to which Poland is linked by bonds of mutual solidarity  sympathy and friendship. I wish to extend to you my congratulations on your election to a post of such eminence  and to all participants in this session my best wishes for all success in dealing jointly with the important problems on the Assembly's extensive agenda.4.	I am addressing you in the year when the Polish People's Republic is celebrating its thirtieth anniversary. Its emergence marked a major turning point in the more than one-thousand-year-long history of the Polish nation  and its present development and policies stem from our nation's most significant experiences. It is from the standpoint of those experiences that I wish to address myself to certain problems which are the subject of the constant attention of the United Nations.5.	The pre-eminent objective of the United Nations  an organization which came into being during the most devastating of all wars  is to ensure world peace  for that is the greatest treasure of all nations.6.	The Polish nation has had to pay an exceptionally high and tragic price for peace. And it has learned to appreciate the inestimable value of peace over the past 30 years of construction  thanks to which the country has risen from ruins and its economic potential has been multiplied; education  science and culture developed; and favorable living conditions created.7.	Our deep conviction of the indivisibility of peace and of the overriding importance of preventing a new world war is based on our experiences as well as on an appraisal of the state of affairs in the world of today. Ensuring lasting peace in our socio-economically and ideologically divided world depends above all on full implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence among countries with different social systems  principles which the socialist countries have espoused and consistently put into practice.8.	We believe that the most appropriate approach to that objective lies in the continuation  further development and consolidation of the process of inter-national detente in an effort to make it irreversible  in contrast to the aims of the forces of aggression and cold war. This process of detente is essential in order to overcome the political and military confrontation imposed by the imperialist forces  which constitutes the main cause of the arms race  tensions and threats to world peace.9.	The improvement of Soviet-American relations in recent years is of exceptional importance in easing and overcoming this global confrontation. We attach great importance to the agreements concluded between these two great Powers  which serve to further the overriding cause of all mankind: the prevention of nuclear war and the consolidation of the process of detente. The Soviet-American dialog exercises a positive influence on the entire world situation and is conducive to a general improvement in international relations. Hence  we are gratified at the prospect of further progress in that direction. That dialog in no sense limits but on the contrary creates more propitious conditions for a constructive contribution by all States  including medium-sized and small countries  irrespective of their social system and level of economic development  to the solution of the important problems facing various regions and the entire world.10.	My present official visit to the United States is one of the manifestations of the positive results of detente. I believe that the further development of Polish-American relations  for which we are jointly opening up new opportunities  and the exchange of views we have had will serve to shape international relations successfully on the basis of peaceful coexistence and mutually advantageous co-operation.11.	We favor detente throughout the world. The growing role of the non-aligned countries in the struggle for peace and international relations based on equal rights is an important factor in the consolidation of the positive processes in international life.12.	The great significance of the process of detente also lies in the fact that it is helpful in containing and extinguishing local conflicts and in the effort to settle many critical problems in accordance with the principles of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and security of nations. Poland favors precisely such a permanent settlement of the Middle East conflict  which above all calls for completely eliminating the consequences of aggression and ensuring the Arab people of Palestine its legitimate rights  We are also in favor of a peaceful settlement of the Cyprus conflict  which will restore that country's sovereignty  neutrality and territorial integrity. We are convinced that this objective would be attained by convening a representative international conference within the framework of the United Nations.13.	We are hopeful that through the full implementation of the Paris Agreements  the heroic  war-weary Vietnamese nation will be able to live in peace and that peace will be restored throughout IndoChina. Poland  which has been involved in peaceful missions in those regions  will do its best to continue to work in that direction.14.	The cause of peace is inseparable from the cause of freedom. The Polish nation is well aware of that fact. In its striving for independence it has made the greatest of sacrifices. We have always linked our struggle for independence with that of other nations under the banner ""For your freedom and ours"". A deep conviction of the indivisibility of the freedom of all nations and of its links with the revolutionary forces of progress stems from our experiences; hence our solidarity with those nations. The issue which today arouses the strongest protest by world public opinion is the brutal suppression of democratic freedom in Chile.15.	Decolonization  which is nearing completion  and the struggle to put an end to all forms of neo-colonial domination  are of great  historic significance  as is the right of all nations to be represented in the United Nations. Accordingly  I wish to express our satisfaction that new Members  the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada  have taken their rightful place in the United Nations.16.	International detente also promotes the joint consideration and solution of major world problems. We are in favor of that process becoming universal  encompassing all regions and ensuring continued progress in all key questions relating to the consolidation of peaceful international relations.17.	By virtue of its geographical location  true to its interests and convictions  and in concert with its socialist allies  Poland is making its contribution to the consolidation of detente  particularly in Europe. We are working towards that end through our participation in the overall improvement of the situation on our continent  through the all-round development of friendly relations with France  the Scandinavian countries and other States  and through our involvement in the process of normalizing relations in CentralEurope  which was initiated by the treaties concluded between the socialist countries and the Federal Republic of Germany  as well as by the Quadripartite Agreement on West Berlin.18.	Europe  which in the past has been both the source and the major theater of both world wars  has enjoyed peace for nearly 30 years  thanks to the victory of the great anti-fascist coalition  the emergence of the socialist community and the appearance of a new relationship of forces. The necessary conditions exist today for maintaining in the future the present state of affairs in Europe  which is so vital to world peace. It is here that the shift from ""cold war"" and ""power politics"" to normalization and detente has been most pronounced. Universal recognition of the territorial and political realities which came into being as a consequence of the Second World War and of the post-war development has been achieved. On this basis  mutual trust has grown and peaceful co-operation has developed more extensively. An awareness that there is no alternative to peaceful coexistence is taking ever stronger hold.19.	Under those circumstances  the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  advocated by the socialist countries  became possible. As will be recalled  Poland first advanced the idea of such a conference in this Assembly a decade ago.1 The great achievement of the Conference  which may well be able to terminate its deliberations within the next few months  will have been the adoption of the principles governing mutual relations among European States a sui generis charter of their rights and duties.20.	At a time when the Conference's activities are drawing to a close and talks on troop and arms reductions in Europe are under way at Vienna talks which will  we hope  also produce positive results a pertinent question arises. What should be done next in order that the process of consolidating European peace and security may continue and become irreversible?21.	It is our conviction that the peaceful future of Europe is linked to the construction of a system of collective security. At stake is a system in which prohibition of the use of force would become the supreme law  a system which would provide for durable security guarantees to each country. An essential precondition for a joint program for the future of Europe must always remain an awareness of the importance of the inviolability of frontiers and the territorial integrity of all States as well as respect for the principle of non-intervention in their internal affairs. Only in this way can the division into opposing political-military blocs be overcome. We also attach great importance to the creation of machinery for further consultation and common efforts aimed at consolidating security and developing mutually beneficial co-operation in all fields. The all- European body which we hope will be established by the Conference could become a forum for seeking common solutions to common problems. To this end  Europe's existing regional organizations  including those of the United Nations system  could and should also be properly utilized.22.	Bilateral  regional and subregional co-operation also promotes favorable developments on the European scene. We believe  for example  that the state of relations thus far achieved by the Baltic States has created conditions conducive to the transformation of that region into a zone of peace and friendly co-operation. Owing to the process of detente  all the traditions of positive  peaceful relationships have come alive and efforts are now being made for the joint solution of problems relating to navigation  fishing  utilization of maritime resources and protection of the natural environment. On the basis of the progress already achieved and in order to consolidate it  Poland plans to submit further proposals for governmental and public endeavors aimed at developing mutually advantageous  peaceful co-operation among the Baltic countries.23.	The consolidation of security in Europe renders an important service to world security  for the creation of regional systems points the way to the constriction of universal security. Hence  we fully support Soviet proposals calling for the creation of such a system in Asia and we shall support other endeavors with similar aims in view.24.	The halting of the arms race  full implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]  and the elaboration of agreements which would ban the use and production of such weapons and open the way to general and complete disarmament are measures inextricably linked to the consolidation of international security. The steps that have been taken in these vital areas in recent years have laid the groundwork for the early convening of a World Disarmament Conference and for progress in the implementation of other important proposals  such as the reduction of military budgets  a ban on chemical weapons  and the elaboration of a convention on the prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military purposes  as proposed by the Soviet Union at the current session [2240th meeting]. Poland will continue to make a constructive contribution to the realization of all those initiatives.25.	The experience of our nation has shown that the natural rights of each country  in conditions of peace and security  is the creation of favorable opportunities for its development. Not so long ago  Poland was a country marked by socio-economic backwardness  and the consequences  of that fact adversely affected the nation's standard of living and its international standing as well. In a relatively short span of time  our nation has tackled the unfinished work of many centuries and carried out a basic reconstruction of the country  which now ranks as the world's tenth largest industrial producer. At present  we are dynamically expanding the country's potential.26.	The sources of this progress have been many. They include the transformations carried out by the socialist policy  fraternal co-operation with other socialist countries  particularly the Soviet Union  and the planned concentration of the nation's resources. The most important factor is the nation's toil: the liberation of its creative resources and the involvement of minds  hands and hearts in a common cause. Also of great importance are human qualifications the intensive training of. personnel capable of facing the challenge of rapid  all-round development. We are willing to share with the developing countries our achievements and experience in this field. We favor broad co-operation among all countries in the training of qualified personnel.27.	At its recent sixth special session the General Assembly drew attention to a series of urgent problems of international economic co-operation which call for joint solutions. Such co-operation is of crucial importance in eliminating the gaps between levels of development and in consolidating peaceful world relations  since it creates the material basis for those relations.28.	The growing utilization of the achievements of the scientific and technical revolution  combined with detente and the steady consolidation of the forces of progress in the world  offer an opportunity to create a just international division of labor and to develop the mechanisms needed to regulate international economic relations. Our Governments and  to a large extent  the United Nations must assume the historic responsibility for making proper use of that opportunity. Are special regional interests  the interests of more or less closed groups and inequality of access to the world market to continue to dominate the world? Or should we not rather set out to build a new open world system which would ensure each participant identical benefits? Poland  like the other socialist countries  has supported and will continue to work in the latter direction.29.	The sovereign right of each nation to the resources it possesses and the equality of all countries are our fundamental assumptions. On the strength of these elementary principles we favor a scheme of world economic relations which will ensure the equitable  non-discriminatory flow of the raw materials and technology indispensable to development.30.	The formulation of suitable principles in that regard is  in my opinion  one of the major tasks facing the United Nations. It is of great importance to base international economic relations on long-range ties and the co-ordination of development plans. Such a step would provide more advantageous conditions for world trade and economic co-operation for the benefit of all countries  especially the developing ones. Poland will continue to contribute to the achievement of such solutions.31.	I have presented our views on certain issues connected with the development of peaceful relations among States. Let us continue to promote those relations in a spirit of detente  co-operation and peace. I should like to emphasize  however  that it is of equal importance to mold among nations and societies a consciousness that reflects these lofty aims. That is the special duty of our generation  which has known the tragedy of war  hatred and destruction. It is our obligation to overcome prejudice  distrust  intolerance  chauvinism and racialism  to inculcate in the younger generation a respect for other nations and a conviction of the right of all people to live in freedom  equality and peace. These ideals  deeply ingrained in the traditions of freedom and progress of the Polish nation  have in my country been transformed into the essential element in the system of education and upbringing in a socialist society. Let us make the cause of raising the younger generation to live in international peace and friendship one of our principal aims. Let us give practical expression to the deeply humanistic ideals contained in the United Nations Charter. Let us introduce them into the educational and training programs of all countries. Let us do everything possible to make the remaining quarter of this century  a century which has seen untold suffering brought upon mankind  an era of peaceful construction and of peace-oriented education.32.	The thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations will be universally celebrated next year. This Organization was brought into being by nations which sought peace  freedom and equality and by a desire for friendly coexistence and collaboration. Let us honor this anniversary with the greatest possible contribution by our Organization to the construction of a world in which the attainment of these goals will be ensured.33.	Poland will continue to give its full support to the United Nations in the implementation of these lofty ideals"
"99",5735,"PRT",29,1974,"95.	 Mr. President  speaking for the first time in the General Assembly  I feel a double satisfaction not simply because I represent here a new Portugal which has nothing to do with the one which was so repeatedly condemned in this Organization  but also because I have the opportunity to speak in a session presided over by you.96.	This new Portugal has ceased to be a hostile and silent country within the United Nations constantly refusing to fulfill its obligations. Today it is a country ready to participate fully in international life and to respect the recommendations of the United Nations and determined to re-enter in all good faith the community of nations  thus assuming the position to which its ancient culture and multi-secular history entitle it.97.	I am equally delighted at the welcome circumstance of your presence here as President of the twenty-ninth session of this Assembly. As a Portuguese and a freedom fighter  I  like so many of my fellow citizens  cannot forget that your country  Sir  generously welcomed many dozens of Portuguese expelled from their country by the oppression of the previous regime people like General Humberto Delgado  later assassinated by Salazar's political police. We all have in mind the solidarity of your Government with us in our struggle and the position of Algeria as a meeting point of the Mediterranean  Arab and African worlds and of a third world  so ofter misunderstood  whose voice has now come to be heard with ever more respect. For it was in your country that the decisive negotiations between representatives of the Portuguese Government and the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC] took place so successfully  resulting in the Algiers accords and thus putting an end to the war and to colonial domination in Guinea-Bissau.98.	I should also like to congratulate the outgoing President  Mr. Benites  for his excellent work which culminated in the important sixth special session of last April. Only last year  I had a welcome opportunity of visiting his beautiful country  and  apart from so many other things I learned there  I can state that the Galapagos Islands constitute an exemplary model of a balanced policy of ecological and environmental preservation matters that cannot be overshadow by the great economic and political problems of the world without endangering all human activity.99.	In the name of the new Portugal  which I represent here today  I wish to declare solemnly that henceforth we shall collaborate fully with the United Nations  to whose supreme ideals we now adhere without reservation  in the hope that we may be able to contribute in our modest way towards the building of a world of peace and understanding among nations.100.	Unfortunately  the oppression and obscurantism which prevailed in Portugal for almost SO years have up to now impeded any fruitful co-operation and have resulted in the systematic disregard of the recommendations of the United Nations. This negative and unrealistic policy  which defied the comprehension of the real world  brought my country to a position of sterile isolation  thus subjecting the Portuguese to a veritable constraint. The dictator Salazar  in his absurd arrogance  even reached the point of proclaiming that we were ""proudly alone"" in the world. I wish to make it quite clear that the free and democratic Portugal which we are building now with great difficulties certainty  but strengthened by the general confidence of our people is now beginning to feel itself proudly accompanied. Indeed I see no better company for my country than that which it will find through intensely  faithfully and sincerely living the life of this international community which is the great family of the United Nations  an organization almost planetary in its universality.101.	From the very dawn of the first hopes born of the Atlantic Charter  born amidst the full horror of a devastating war  the first objective proclaimed was ""to see the establishment of a peace which would create for all nations the means of living in security within their own boundaries and providing the assurance that all men in all countries would be able to live out their lives free from fear and want."" To that end it was proposed that the nations create a center designed to harmonize their activities  which would spread the practice of tolerance  good-neighborliness and peace and security for all. This task of the United Nations  despite difficulties and failures  has become better and better understood and realized in the sense that every year new countries join this Assembly.102.	At this twenty-ninth session we can express our gratification at the admission of three new Members: Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. Permit us  however  to express our particular pleasure at the admission of the Republic of Guinea- Bissau  which Portugal is proud to see in this Assembly a Portuguese-speaking country to which we are linked by such strong historical and socio- cultural ties. I feel particularly honored to have participated personally in the process of the decolonization of Guinea-Bissau  a process which I hailed a year ago  with the unilateral proclamation of independence  and which now culminates with the entry of Guinea-Bissau into the United Nations. It can only be regretted and I say this with a feeling of anguish that this process of decolonization  so long delayed  has left behind it a long  useless war in which so many of the young men of both countries died or were left disabled  I can only hope that this blood so needlessly shed will serve to cement a future fraternal friendship between the two peoples  which gave so much of themselves to each other and which can benefit so much from close co-operation on the basis of ir'Uual respect and absolute equality.103.	One of the concerns of the Government I rep-resent in this Assembly was to draw the attention of its allies to the advantages of the immediate entry of Guinea-Bissau into the United Nations. It must indeed be recognized that during so many years of war and privation the PAIGC  whose leaders have demonstrated in so many instances their maturity and high sense of responsibility  practiced  through the establishment of its own popularity and spirit of resistance  the principle of the self-determination of the people whom it unquestionably represents today.104.	Now I should like to address a word of special appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his persuasive personal action. His visit to Lisbon  in response to an invitation by the Portuguese Government  took place at a decisive phase in the process of decolonization and contributed a great deal to the acceleration of this process which today  in record time  has already yielded so many positive and concrete results.105.	None of this  however  would be possible if the changes caused by the military and popular movement of 25 April had not occurred in Portugal. Those changes have made it possible for the Portuguese people to construct a free and democratic country in which man's inalienable rights and fundamental liberties are respected  a country in which everyone works to bring about the reign of social justice.106.	The movement of 25 April was the result of a long and persistent struggle on the part of the Portuguese people against the tyranny and obscurantism of a dictatorial regime which made all decisions without ever consulting its citizens an anachronistic regime which boasted of turning its back on the realities of the contemporary world and which  never having wished to understand the interaction of political  social and economic phenomena in a world where such interdependence was increasing daily  made a tabula rasa of the major events of the second part of the twentieth century.107.	It was in the light of that state of affairs that the Portuguese people  without help from outside and counting only upon itself  engaged in a long battle which ended in the revolt of 25 April  launched by the young officers of the armed forces  conscientiously interpreting the dominant sentiments of the Portuguese people. The movement of 25 April 1974 thus revealed itself as a spontaneous and authentic movement of the people in arms and constituted  in the words of President Spinola  ""a victory over ourselves  over our errors  over our contradictions"".108.	Indeed this struggle acquired irresistible momentum  inasmuch as the colonial wars imposed upon the country by reactionary forces were prolonged  in defiance of good sense. Therefore it was the colonial wars which hastened the maturing and political awakening of the Portuguese and their armed forces. The latter  finally understanding that such a conflict could not yield a military solution  made apparent the uselessness of an aimless war. The officers and the soldiers realized that the solution to the wars born of Portugal's domination could be achieved only through a political act  requiring the replacement of the dictatorial regime by a democratic one.109.	In that context  the three principal objectives which the movement of 25 April proposed to achieve in the shortest possible time were as follows. First  the democratization of institutions through the holding of free elections on all levels of national and regional life. Legislative elections for a National Constituent Assembly will be held in March 1975  and we hope they will be exemplary in their freedom in so far as laws will guarantee  as they do already  freedom of thought  expression  press and assembly and the formation of political parties authentically representative of the differing options. Second  the rapid and reliable decolonization of the Territories under Portuguese administration  to be carried out in accord with the legitimate representatives of the will of the respective peoples and leading necessarily to independence. Third  the accelerated development of the country  whose economy has been overburdened by enormous  intolerable and unproductive spending designed to sustain the colonial war effort  which now will have to meet the high expenditures of peace and co-operation. In that context  Portugal would appeal to international solidarity. We welcome aid  facilities  investment and economic co-operation from all countries of the world  beginning  naturally  with our traditional allies and the European Common Market. In the light of its national interests  Portugal is open to such co-operation in order to free itself from atavistic conditions of under-development which persist in certain strangled areas of its economic and social structure.110.	I should like here to develop one of the three points relating to decolonization as it concerns a question which not only is of concern to Portugal but  in fact  has been and remains an object of profound interest to the international community.111.	Members may already know that on the very day the provisional Government was established in Portugal  immediately after I assumed my post as Minister for Foreign Affairs  I left for Dakar  where I had the first meeting with the PAIGC leaders  which opened up the possibility of a de facto cease-fire. There followed the talks; in London and Algiers  which culminated in the signing  on 26 August last  of the Algiers accords. These accords definitively established recognition of the de jure independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  solemnly proclaimed in Lisbon on 10 September by the President of the Republic  General Antonio de Spinola  thus assuring the transfer of power to the new State.112.	Between 16 May  when contacts between the two delegations were initiated  and 26 August  when the Algiers accords were signed  there elapsed little more than three months  a fact which indicates an undeniable willingness to conclude the process of decolonization and seems to us to be worthy of note in the light of the other examples of recent history and in the light of our own internal difficulties  which we have had to overcome.113.	With respect to the negotiations between the delegations of Portugal and the Freiije de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] concerning the future of Mozambique  it can be stated that the process has been carried out in a relatively short period of time  given the magnitude of the problems that were faced.114.	The High Commissioner of the Portuguese Government  representative of the Chief of State  has now assumed office in Mozambique and will guarantee until 25 June 1975 the date set for independence the functioning of a transitional government. The latter  composed of a majority of FRELIMO members and a number of Portuguese representatives  will unless precipitate acts prejudice the future of an independent Mozambique ensure the transfer of administration and of all State powers to the State.115.	It should be noted that each Territory under Portuguese administration is a .separate case with its own special features  which must thus be considered in the light of those special features in a pragmatic and realistic manner. The case of Angola  for example  is one of enormous complexity because of various factors  the principal one being the diversity indeed  the division among the necessary partners in negotiations. It is also  of all the Territories under Portuguese colonial domination  the one with the largest population of European origin. Nevertheless  contacts have been made on various levels  not only with the liberation movements   but also with the leaders of neighboring countries  and we are sure that in the case of Angola  as in the previous cases  the best possible solution will be. found  a solution which assures an independent future free of colonial and neo-colonial pressures and promotes the progress and racial harmony of its people.116.	With respect to the other Territories in accordance with the declaration made during the visit of the Secretary-General to Lisbon  Portugal has solemnly reaffirmed what its constitutional laws already guarantee: that it fully recognizes the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. Portugal is therefore ready to apply the United Nations decisions to that effect  reaffirming also the fulfillment of its obligations arising from chapter XI of the United Nations Charter and General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  which contains the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  as well as those resolutions that refer to Territories under Portuguese administration.117.	Following the traditions of this Organization  and in accordance with the practice which seems most appropriate  the territorial integrity of the present colonies will be maintained during the process of decolonization. Thus  in a few months a free and democratic Portugal has given to the world irrefutable proof of its intentions the sincerity of which can no longer possibly be doubted and now presents itself to the international community with concrete and definite achievements to its credit in the area of decolonization.118.	Portugal wishes to put an end to the sad position of isolation to which the force of events had condemned it and declares itself ready to co-operate actively with all the countries of the world  regardless of their political and social systems or ideological preferences. Thus  and for the first time  Portugal comes to this rostrum with a sincere desire to integrate itself fully within the international community and to assume within it its proper place. I therefore call for the unreserved acceptance of the new Portugal by the community of nations  as is only just. I call  too  for the new Portugal to be able quickly to establish normal relations with all States without exception  and I should like to mention here as an example the desire  which I believe to be reciprocal  of the Portuguese and Indian peoples to see their old and fruitful relations restored on all levels.119.	The breaking off of relations with the Republic of India the consequence of a conflict which could have been avoided had there been a minimum of flexibility on the part of Portugal represents one of the consequences of colonialism. At the time when Portugal is now breaking definitively with its colonial past  the re-establishment of friendly relations with the Republic of India would constitute a great symbolic gesture.120.	Consequently  I believe that it would be unjust to continue to apply moral or other sanctions against my country  since  in a solemn declaration of faith  it proclaims its sincere adherence to the ideals of peace among all peoples and all nations and its unshakable confidence in fraternal dialog among all peoples; while at the same time it affirms unequivocally its desire for co-operation and for embarking upon mutually advantageous co-operation.121.	This profession of faith is quite clear and was laid down from the very beginning in the Program of the Armed Forces Movement and in the Program of the Provisional Government  released on 25 April  which enumerated the fundamental points of our foreign policy. Permit me to mention them here:Respect for the principles of independence and equality among States and /ion-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.Respect for current international treaties  especially the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  and also trade and financial commitments undertaken previously; active contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security.Intensification of trade and political relations with the countries of the European Economic Community.Measures to strengthen the practical effectiveness of the Luso-Brazilian Community.Maintenance of links with the United Kingdom  Portugal's oldest ally. Continued good-neighborly relations with Spain.Greater solidarity with the Latin countries in Europe and the Americas.Maintenance of our traditional friendship with the United States of America.Creation of diplomatic and trade relations with all the countries of the world.Renewing of historical relations with the Arab countries.Revision of the information policy in foreign countries.Cultural and social support for the Portuguese communities scattered throughout the world.Definition of a realistic policy towards the third- world countries.Participation in  and active co-operation with  the United Nations and  in general  with international organizations of co-operation.122.	In accordance with those principles  we feel entitled to hope that the United Nations and the specialized agencies will lift the embargoes and restrictions which hitherto have affected Portugal and will henceforth promote the participation of Portuguese representatives in bodies from which they have been excluded for so many years.123.	All around us  despite the efforts of the United Nations to avoid conflicts and wars  there are arising in various places confrontation resulting from inequalities among people  from ambitions to dominate  from social and other injustices and from racism and colonialism. Portugal  a renewed and developing country  a country without any thirst for power  which has begun to undertake  with the courage it has found in its own people  the gigantic task of peace  voices the hope that all the nations of the world will refrain from conflicts which can solve nothing.124.	It is indispensable for a formula to be found which will make possible the diversion of the astronomical sums of money designed for armaments so often a total waste to the accelerated development of the less favored nations. Reconsidering the General Assembly's resolution proposing that each country apportion 10 per cent of its arms expenditure to aid economic growth [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)]  we would like to suggest that apart from this minimal contribution which the majority have not made a fund could be created  the size of which would correspond to the development needs of the third-world countries  which are so poor. More than agreement for the partial reduction of certain weapons  more than promises of detente  which are also important  it is development and it is the gradual reduction of the gap dividing the poorer countries of the world from the industrialized countries which will contribute most towards peace between men.125.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  which is continuing in Geneva  is making a praiseworthy effort to bring about a climate of detente. Portugal  within the measure of its own modest influence  will seek to contribute towards this detente  and  to that end  has already established normal relations with the socialist countries of Eastern Europe. But beyond European detente  I am thinking now of world detente which requires from all of us a moment of reflection on the oneness of the human race  so rich in its diversity.126.	The cosmic and planetary man of the centuries to come cannot afford to be divided by the differences of race  creed and ideology which today confront the world and diminish it. Portugal  so many centuries old  a pioneer in contacts between the most varied civilizations  turns towards the horizon of the year 2000 with the hope that humanity will awake to its common origin and its common destiny.127.	The Portuguese people  free from the burdens of internal oppression and colonial domination  have recovered their traditional character and their universal humanism which  in the perhaps somewhat exaggerated words of Arnold Toynbee  has brought them to do ""more for human brotherhood than any other people"".128.	I cannot help but think of the violation of human rights still frequent in so many countries which have subscribed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but which do not respect it in their every-day practice. That was the case in Portugal itself only a few months ago. In this regard  the Portuguese Government declares itself opposed to all forms of oppression and racial discrimination  and  though it holds as fundamental the rule of non-intervention in the affairs of other States  it cannot but condemn most categorically the existence and perpetuation of discriminatory social systems such as apartheid.129.	As I have said  I believe that the problems posed by international insecurity result above all from an unjust distribution of the world's wealth  a reflection  certainly  of natural conditions  but also of old injustices which so many peoples throughout history have had to suffer. We cannot allow the world to continue to be divided into two hemispheres: the developed and the under-developed  the latter providing raw materials and receiving  in the form of all kinds of discriminatory measures  nothing but humiliation. 130.	As became so obvious during the sixth special session in April  machinery must urgently be created at the global level  to diminish the imbalance between rich and poor countries. Portugal situated at the cross-roads of the world  a European country and a country which has so many ancient links with Africa  a European country but so close  by the very character of its people  to the third world  a country facing the sea  a sea which will be the road of the future as it was in the past knows that development is the new name of peace  as was so well stated by Pope Paul VI  And this peace  as we know  will be obtained  only when we have eliminated the great imbalances among peoples.131.	Before concluding  I would like to salute our brother countries in Latin America  pioneers in anti-colonialism  with which we are linked by so many historical ties and this is something I am compelled to mention today. I trust you will understand me if I address myself particularly to Brazil  with which we are connected by undying affinities of history  culture  sentiment and humanity  and with which we form a linguistic and cultural community  the development of which will yield many advantages to the international community.132.	My last words will  however  be for Africa  a continent with which Portugal has always maintained special relations  unhappily affected in recent years by a stupid colonial war  which is now happily being brought to an end. Permit me  therefore  to issue a call for reconciliation and the re-establishment of the most fraternal relations between Africa and the new Portugal  the new Portugal where Africa will always find support and aid. In that continent  where we follow so attentively the co-ordination of interests and efforts through that great regional organization the Organization of African Unity [OAU]there live Portuguese-speaking peoples  who populate new and important countries that can benefit from the maintenance of close ties of. co-operation among themselves. Similar ties of cooperation are being formed and developed with Portugal  on the basis of equality  fraternity and strict respect for the independence of each country.133.	Ties should be formed also with other countries of Africa with which Portugal desires to establish solid links of co-operation and friendship. Since there is no danger of the creation on the part of a country like Portugal which has no ambition for power of ambiguous relations of a neo-colonialist type  relations that in any case the Portuguese socio-economic structure could never permit  my country will be able to rediscover its vocation as a meeting ground between two worlds and might even become an exemplary connecting link between Europe and Africa."
"100",5782,"PRY",29,1974,"On behalf of the delegation of Paraguay  we greet the illustrious President of this universal Assembly and express to him our most whole-hearted congratulations and our certainty that owing to his knowledge  vast experience  spirit of fairness and sense of service to the international community  this vast international gathering is assured of success from the very beginning of its work.136.	To former President Mr. Leopoldo Benites  we express our appreciation for the manner in which he guided the past session of the General Assembly  lending lustre to the Latin American presence iii this world conclave with his valuable experience and skill.137.	Our joyful and brotherly greetings go to the States which have recently joined the Organization. We are happy to have them with us and we wish them every success in their undertakings.138.	We also greet the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  and on this solemn occasion we wish to say to him that Paraguay fully appreciates the assistance and support it has been receiving from the United Nations and which constitute a most important factor in our development.139.	At the beginning of our statement we wish to express to the sister Republic of Honduras our deep and sincere solidarity  and our deep sorrow for the tragedy that has befallen it  to which all the preceding speakers have referred. It is our hope that United Nations solidarity will find concrete form in effective aid and co-operation  and not in these and other words  however expressive they may be.140.	The world picture has not altered fundamentally since the twenty-eighth session  although it is true that some positive progress has been achieved in peace and in the general detente among the great Powers.141.	Peace and development are and continue to be the main goals of our Organization  it being understood that  as has been said  there is no peace without development  just as there is no development without peace. Peace continues to be the guiding star and the hope of all peoples on earth  wherever they are. Above all  peace with honor  with human dignity  with effective justice  without dominance  or situations of force or obvious inequity  in whatever form. Peace resulting from a situation of scorn for the supreme values of justice has no foundation. Peace which is not based on the heart and mind open to brotherly greetings is built on sand  and has no real basis. Peace which is not the result of a positive effort to improve the economic and social situations for the majority of peoples  harassed by the grave problems of under-development  can have no firm footing or long life.142.	Peace must necessarily be viewed from above  beyond all geographical  regional or ideological differences  beyond the desires of individuals  or of groups or subgroups. There must be only one peace for all  in a world made better for all  where distribution is just  with a sound economy and equitable international trade at the service of free man. Therefore  the only course  the only way to peace is the development of all peoples.143.	Peace still suffers violent disturbances  an affront to mankind. In this Assembly and in other appropriate places it is customary to sing the praises of peace and vow to serve it unconditionally. Yet the passage of time brings us Jeep disenchantment and disappointment. How many times in the course of this year of 1974 have the communications media not brought us the sad news of hatred  of violence between brothers and neighboring peoples  the play of overweening appetites  of the criminal assault of man against man  of the velvet glove  at the propaganda level  concealing beneath it the greedy hand of domination or influence  in some part of the world.144.	Terrorism continues to destroy lives and property in brazen defiance of civilization itself. Kidnapping intrudes its hated presence into our daily lives. It is time to think seriously about these ills  which disturb the development of mankind and make us doubt our own culture. In this ignoble work the men of violence admit of no reason and respect no values. At times they respond with further terrorist action to favorable treatment from governments and organizations which  in a moment of weakness  had tolerated their actions or tried to justify the use of such ignoble means.145.	Terrorism is a boomerang which in the end strikes or threatens all in its mad frenzy and in its abysmal scorn for the respect for the life of another. Those who shelter  encourage  or are merely indifferent to acts of terrorism carried out in other countries are miscalculating. Sooner or later  terrorism will do away with its own protectors  and with those who are in-different  too.146.	During the days when we are meeting here  violence and terrorism have seized new victims  as if they wished to take this opportunity for more wide-spread publicity  or more effective intimidation.147.	Peace requires the purity of a noble spirit on the part of those  who govern and their peoples  of countries and of ideologies. We must do away with the hotbeds of war  violence and terrorism  in striving zealously for the spiritual disarmament. It would be of no avail to put an end to disorder  to armed confrontation  to the advance of armies and to the dread wave of terrorism  if we do not first seek with conviction to eliminate hatred  and the cult of violence and ideological extremism in the minds of men  particularly among those who decide matters on this earth.148.	We still speak the language of peace  while the minds of men retain mental reservations which in advance set up barriers to the objective triumph of justice. We still speak the language of peace  but behind the scenes the resolve is only to look after selfish interests  without recognizing the right of developing countries to better conditions for their peoples. We still speak the language of peace when  in fact  we are seeking the triumph of one special interest over another.149.	A false dialog is sought through confrontation without arms  but confrontation which after all seeks only the strengthening of certain groups  sects or ideologies which are determined to overthrow many established values because of their desire for immediate successes for their cause.150.	The United Nations is expanding and is growing stronger as new Members are admitted to it. Its universality is a sign of the modern times and betokens the fact that the United Nations no longer  as of yore  accepts the isolation of peoples and nations from its own structure. The Organization seeks  through its universality  to represent all mankind without odious or unfair discrimination which  ab initio  reduces the chances of effective action seeking the well-being of all peoples.151.	The world has not lost faith in the Organization. On the contrary   the world demands of the United Nations a realistic and vital attitude in order to enable it to meet every contingency  particularly at the political level  which is the most difficult but the one closest to peace and justice.152.	The mere action of bilateral diplomacy  miraculous though it sometimes is  must be followed by United Nations action  since it is the United Nations which represents all countries on earth  at the later stage of concretizing the remedy to situations of conflict. A truce is not enough  nor merely maintaining the peace. We must go to the root of things  to definitive political agreements based on a real and general disarmament of minds.153.	That is where the clarity of intentions of all countries of the Organization comes into play  starting with those countries which  for one reason or another  under the Charter have entered into commitments of broad  world-wide responsibility.154.	We must mention with some satisfaction some other positive achievements. There are clear signs of detente in the world in which we live. The great Powers have taken a first step by eschewing war or confrontation. Yet  we are bound to say that in regard to dis-armament a long road lies ahead. Military expenditure continues to add up to astronomical figures  while the amounts available for development of the needy nations are  relatively speaking  risible. Here in this universal forum we move ahead step by step  but we do move forward in the formulation of rules which define aggression. Yet  so much has to be done to disarm minds  to get rid of the desire for predominance or sectorization of groups of countries  or the exporting  surreptitiously sometimes  of the ideology which one seeks to introduce like a Trojan horse.155.	""Development is the new name of peace"" is the marvelous definition of Pope Paul VI. There is a universal sign which floats in the air we breathe and which requires that  with the development of all countries  we seek better days for all mankind.156.	We have no quarrel with the right of any nation to enjoy the riches of its territory  even though an unequal geographical distribution leads to privileged situations for some and irritating injustices for others. But it is intolerable that the mechanism which has arbitrarily been sustained and imposed for international trade  a mechanism of ridiculous prices for raw materials and high prices for industrial goods  should continually widen the gap between the developed and the developing nations. This gap is widening because at differences in infrastructures  in financial resources and  paradoxically  in the unequal possession of technology  of know-how.157.	Hunger  housing  education  culture  agrarian reform  health and social security are problems which should have no abstract frontiers or limits. Besides a higher moral imperative  expedience itself requires that all countries  starting with the super-Powers and continuing with the developed ones  realize henceforth that mankind and its future cannot be built on the well-being of a few and the poverty of the majority to the essential detriment of the supreme values of justice. Given this elementary maxim  the figures provided by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament are scandalously discouraging. While military expenditures amount to $220 000 million  of which more than 80 per cent is spent by the six countries with the largest military budgets  official assistance for development barely amounts to $8 000 million.158.	Is it possible to build a lasting peace and well- being on the pain of this tremendous reality? Elementary logic tells us that it cannot be done and that this is a mistaken short-cut which will inevitably produce grave situations and may lead to the worst internally and internationally. On the pain and hunger of millions of human beings no peace can be built nor can human understanding be reached.159.	Among the causes which arrest the development of most nations is world inflation  imported inflation. It is like a thief who surreptitiously breaks in and removes a substantial amount of the value of labor and of savings. My country  Paraguay  for example  because of a free  orderly economy has considerably raised its production  its exports and its monetary reserves. In these conditions how are we to explain to simple and humble workers that  although the Government has not erred or been mistaken  in future there are goods which they will no longer be able to acquire or which they will have to consume on a reduced or sharply curtailed scale?160.	In this last year the substantial rise in the price of oil and its by-products has distorted the economy of most developing nations and also the economy of many industrialized  developed countries which do not produce oil.161.	The oil-exporting countries certainly have a legitimate right to receive fair prices for such a vital product  but so do the consumer nations have a legitimate right  since in the contemporary economy there is no immediate alternative to buying. This is an extremely difficult problem to study  and one which it is even more difficult to solve  and the Organization should devote its best efforts to it.162.	The world energy crisis  brought about by a reduction in the volume of extraction and sale of oil and its derivatives and by the increase in their prices  has consequences for industrial production  transportation  the cost of living and general inflation.163.	In the Republic of Paraguay  the Government of General Alfredo Stroessner will first modify and later eliminate the economic impact of the world energy crisis by using our own hydraulic power sources. The thermal plant which formerly supplied the capital with power has already been replaced by the hydroelectric plant of the Acaray River  which supplies the capita! and 100 cities and exports its surpluses to the neighboring territories of Brazil and Argentina.164.	Further  it gives me great satisfaction to announce that the Government of Paraguay  in equal association with the friendly and neighboring Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil  is already building what will be the largest hydroelectric power station in the world  Itaipu  at a cost of more than $US 3 000 million and with an output of 10 750 000 kilowatts. The first turbine will come into operation within less than eight years.165. Similarly  with the friendly Government of the neighboring Republic of Argentina  Paraguay is to build  also on conditions of equality  the hydroelectric power station of Yacyreta  which will be able to produce up to 4 million kilowatts  at a cost which may easily amount to more than $US 2 000 million. Further-more  negotiations are well under way to build  also with Argentina  an even larger hydroelectric power station  that of Corpus.166.	Paraguay  an internal or land-locked country  attended with confidence the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. There we again proclaimed before the whole world the irrevocable right of all land-locked countries.167.	I expressed the essence of our position at the fourth regular session of the Organization of American States in Atlanta  Georgia  on 24 April  when I said:""It will seem strange to you  Mr. President  and delegates  that the Foreign Minister of a landlocked country -whether it be termed an internal or a non-coastal State - should state its position on extending to 200 miles the maritime sovereignty of some nations. The fact is that the nations without a coast or without a maritime coast at present have a right to what are called the high seas  to their free navigation  to their riches  to their fisheries and to their subjacent wealth  as well as to overfly freely the suprajacent airspace. And  to the extent that coastal States increase their sovereignty by their own decision  they are automatically and arbitrarily limiting the rights on the high seas of more than 30 land-locked countries. Mindful as we are of international law  we maintain that such a decision cannot be the result of the will of a single nation: it must be the expression of the general will of all nations as stated in agreements or international treaties resulting from specialized conferences.""168.	Paraguay hopes that  in the coming international meetings dealing with this very difficult and complex problem  elementary justice  which requires that land-locked countries or countries at a disadvantage geographically should have their share of all the re-sources and benefits that the sea yields or may yield in the future  will be strengthened.169.	The World Population Conference was another landmark in the work of the Organization. On balance  it gave only broad consideration to what is a matter of dispute at the universal level  but it paved the way for the future.170.	We know that  if present population growth rates are maintained  the population will double in 24 years in Latin America  in 30 years in Asia and in 25 years in Africa. But these figures must be advanced with serious reservations. There are imponderable factors which deserve attention. A mere change in climate could radically alter the situation. Technical and scientific advances may render habitable in the future places that are today inhospitable  and may introduce an enormous series of changes in the system of agriculture and livestock production and in  the production of all kinds of food  not to mention the reserves of food in the sea.171.	The Conference in itself gives a clear-cut impression that mere technical reports prepared by inter-national experts do not exhaust the subject or the innumerable possible points of view. Every country has its own view of the problem in accordance with its socio-economic structures  its ethical and religious convictions and the composition of its population. What must be emphasized is that any population policy must preserve intact the dignity of the human couple and the decisions which it alone can make: and  furthermore  that in this matter with which we are concerned widely differing views were expressed by the highly developed countries and by the developing countries. It is clear that the former are concerned about an increase in the number of possible consumers of world production. The others maintain that the major problems which are forecast from an increased population go deeper than this and are related to the unequal treatment which really exists today between wealthy countries and developing countries.172.	The United Nations took another positive step when it convened the sixth special session of the General Assembly. In a realistic and objective frame of mind it considered the grave problems of raw materials and development and the most important economic issues which the international community faces. An attempt was made  with some reservations by some countries  to establish a new  more equitable world economic order  and it was agreed to take emergency measures to assist those countries which faced grave problems derived from the latest international economic events. The developing countries not only asked for more remunerative prices -which means better salaries- for their raw materials. We also asked for social justice  that is to say  autonomous development. We not only asked to exchange our raw materials for dollars but also asked to exchange them for the transfer of technology  financial aid and food.173.	We hope that these noble demands receive a concrete answer; they must do so if all nations are to develop. We also hope that the emergency aid will be practical  effective and swift  because otherwise the avalanche of problems will lead to grave situations. A new rise in the price of crude oil on the international market could create situations which would be catastrophic for most of the developing countries which are not oil-producing.!74. From now on the world community has an absolute duty to be watchful and on the alert so that its action can be immediate when disturbances in the economic order affect the least developed countries  to the obvious detriment of international social justice.175.	Paraguay supports and will continue to support with renewed confidence the work of the Organization  which is useful in every direction and so vital to the affairs of the international community.176.	Paraguay is pleased to see the spirit of detente among the great powers  but we are bound to repeat that the aspiration of the world is for a just and honorable peace for all with full dignity  a peace based on the supreme values of civilization  culture and true coexistence. 177. Paraguay hopes once again that the seed> of violence and death which continue to germinate will' be destroyed through the compliance of all States with the principles of the Charter.178.	Paraguay would wish to observe in the day-to-day activity of the Organization a faithful correspondence between what is proclaimed as a principle and what is done in the daily dealings of life.179.	We want a better world without economic or political oppression  without ideologies of domination that stifle freedom; we want a world of respect where the supreme dignity of man as an individual will guarantee the dignity of nations  constitute the basis for coexistence and make possible a new international economic order; we want a world where self-determination and the sovereignty of peoples will be an incontrovertible fact; a world where the powerful  whoever they may be  will not try for whatever reason to interfere in the affairs of other countries; a  world where the international community will carry on its affairs in absolute obedience to the exemplary principles which we here proclaim  and where mankind will enjoy peace  employment  freedom and well- being."
"101",5846,"QAT",29,1974,"Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues who have extended to you their warm congratulations on the occasion of your election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that your qualities of statesmanship will actively contribute to the success of the tasks of the session and the achievement of additional important goals. These same qualities were those of your predecessor and have earned him our deep appreciation and gratitude.267.	I also take pleasure in acknowledging the sincere and continuous efforts of the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  in the course of fulfilling his duties and responsibilities and with the aim of consolidating the Organization.268.	The wide range of items on the agenda of this session represents to us  a people of the third world  a good step in the right direction as well as a very important stage in the strengthening of the ability of the United Nations to discharge its basic responsibilities.269.	I note with optimism and appreciation the special attention that is being paid to industrial and agricultural development  particularly the efforts aiming at the establishment of funds for development  population settlement  health childcare and nutrition. I also note the role of the specialized agencies in offering expert assistance to the developing countries. The deplorable situation of millions of persons who suffer from poverty  disease and ignorance at a time of great scientific achievements by mankind not only is a cause for sorrow and shame but in itself constitutes a cause for doubting the morality of our civilization and the truth of its human values. We are therefore called upon to treat the inhuman situation of these millions by eradicating its root causes. This can be done through the establishment of a new world order of economic development that will provide to every developing country the kind of financial and technological assistance it needs. To this end we should work towards the creation of a favorable international climate devoid of tension; towards arresting the tidal wave of armament acquisition which has spread to small countries; towards confronting all forms of aggression with courage and determination; and towards re-channeling the huge sums of money that the powerful countries are expending on destructive weapons  in order to meet the needs of construction and development in those countries that lag behind as a result of subjugation by imperialistic and exploiting Powers.270.	The State of Qatar  firm in its belief that international cooperation constitutes the sound basis for all human progress is  in addition to its interest in building up its own strength  doing its utmost to contribute  in cooperation with its sister Arab nations  to the realization of a comprehensive regional and Arab development plan. It is  further  anxious to participate in a number of development activities in Africa and Asia and in the world at large. I shall refrain from giving the details of these efforts  but I earnestly believe that they are in the direction that we all seek and support.271.	My country  always welcoming every step towards international understanding  hopes that this understanding will spread to encompass the entire world community. We further believe that the achievement of the goal of international understanding and amity is contingent upon the peaceful and just solution of international problems within the framework of the Charter and the resolutions and recommendations of the United Nations. It seems natural  while talking of just solutions  to refer to the resolutions and recommendations of the Organization aimed at halting the chronic state of war that has existed for over a quarter of a century and that is . commonly known as the Middle East crisis  I especially note the earnest efforts that are being made at present with the aim of implementing Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 339 (1973). These efforts have kindled great hopes of arriving at a just and honorable settlement of the crisis. 272.	In this context it is important for me to reaffirm a basic fact that faces all efforts made previously and being made at present to resolve the Middle East crisis. That fact is that the cause of the people and the land of Palestine lies at the root of the crisis; it is its origin as well as a continuous source of its exacerbation. Ignoring this fact has consistently led to the failure of international arrangements for the resolution of the crisis ever since the question of Palestine was first put before the General Assembly in 1947. Persistence in ignoring this fact will  quite naturally  not lead to new results. If the problem of the Palestinian people is still viewed as one of relief  employment and assimilation; if the land of the Palestinians is still viewed as an area of human agglomeration  with no borders and no existing structure; or if it is regarded as nothing more than a secure Israeli boundary liable to alteration and modification  then one must conclude that such an attitude is in conflict with the Charter of the United Nations and with its noble aims and purposes.273.	To disregard the natural desire of the Palestinian people for freedom and self determination in its own land  and to ignore its legitimate aspiration to the establishment of a national entity where it could bind up its wounds and cast off the burden of destitution that has weighed on its shoulders and its conscience for many years  would constitute open encouragement to the Israeli spirit of aggression. That spirit of aggression has attempted and continues to attempt to procure all of Palestine a Palestine without Palestinians and to thwart the struggle of the Palestinian people to regain its rights. The Israeli aggression has not contented itself with the collective and individual terrorism that it has practiced since its presence in the occupied land. It has indeed gone beyond that to haunt and pursue the Palestinian refugees everywhere. The daily strafing and bombardment of Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon is well known. I believe that the report of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East [A/9613 and Corr.l] includes details on the total destruction of the Nabatya camp in southern Lebanon as a result of an air raid.274.	The auspicious war of OctoberRamadan has left a deep imprint in so far as it served to acquaint the world with the realities of the Middle East crisis and to provide certain facts about the strength  condition and intentions of the parties concerned. In the light of these facts and for the purpose of averting a new and very powerful military conflict  it has become the duty of all  inside the Organization or outside it  to work actively and in a positive manner to ensure the implementation of the conditions of a just peace in the area. Such a just peace can be attained by implementing the Security Council resolutions and the recommendations of the General Assembly through ensuring the withdrawal of Israel from lands occupied in 1967 and through the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. This ought to be accomplished without any repetition of the bloody spectacle of the Syrian city of Quneitra. The blowing up by Israel of every house  mosque and church before its withdrawal from that city is a clear indication that the Israeli spirit of aggression views all international peacemaking efforts as undesirable pressure.275.	I note with regret that a State Member of the United Nations has ignored the Special Committee formed by the Organization for the purpose of investigating Israeli practices in violation of human rights in the occupied territories. That Member State  further  has prevented the Special Committee from performing its role  thus acting in flagrant disdain of the resolutions of this Assembly. Everyone here knows that the abject violation of human rights in the occupied territories  in total disregard of elementary human  religious and moral principles  is the real reason why the Special Committee was prevented from carrying out its assigned tasks. If this indeed is the reason behind the Israeli position  scornful as it is of the United Nations  does it stand to reason that we should allow it to pass without curbing or punishing it?276.	The recent bloody and regrettable events in Cyprus have led to an increase in tension in the region of the Middle East and have added a huge and new international problem to those of the international community in general and those of the Mediterranean region in particular. It is our great hope that the parties concerned will appreciate that the implementation of United Nations resolutions aiming at the settlement of international conflicts is considered to be among the primary means for consolidating the authority of this Organization. Any weakening of this authority would be detrimental to the structure and prestige of an organization to which all humanity looks for the realization of international peace and security.277.	It is quite natural that the painful and bloody events that the Middle East is experiencing today and their increasing acuteness impel us to support the Iranian proposal for creating a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East [AI9693]. It appears clear that if Israel does not become a signatory to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty  then the accelerating danger of military conflict may assume a more ominous form. ""}278.	My Government welcomes the step taken by the new Government in Portugal regarding the problem of imperialism in Africa. We hope that the representatives of Mozambique and Angola will join us in this Organization  so that both these nations will occupy the important place among us that they deserve.279.	The arm of liberty will continue to strike at the last remaining bastions of colonialism in Rhodesia  South Africa and everywhere else  until these bastions fall and vanish for ever from our world.280.	I would also like to welcome the new States that were admitted as Members in the Organization at this session  hoping that their presence with us will have a positive bearing on the strengthening of international peace and security.281.	We have pinned great hopes on the accomplishments of this session. I pray to God to guide us in transforming these hopes from the realm of studies  proposals and recommendations to the realm of realization."
"102",5892,"ROU",29,1974,"The unanimous election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly of Mr. Bouteflika  the distinguished representative of Algeria  a country with which Romania entertains warm relations of friendship and co-operation  is for the Romanian delegation a source of deep satisfaction. In extending to him our most cordial congratulations  I express the firm conviction that  thanks to his qualities and to his country's international prestige  he will substantially contribute to the successful out-come of our proceedings and thus of this session.20.	I should also like to renew our tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who  with tact and competence  presided over the work of the last regular session and the sixth special session of the Assembly. 21.	May I from this rostrum discharge the pleasant duty of conveying once more to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  our special thanks for his untiring efforts in the service of the United Nations dedicated to enhancing the contribution and effectiveness of the Organization in solving the complex problems of our time and to strengthening its prestige in the world. We are convinced that the lively dialog between the leaders of the Socialist Republic of Romania and the Secretary-General will proceed in the context of concerted efforts aimed at strengthening the United Nations.22.	This session of the General Assembly can be proud that an important step has been taken towards achieving the universality of the Organization. I refer to the admission to membership in the United Nations of Guinea-Bissau  Bangladesh and Grenada. On behalf of the Romanian Government  I should like to extend to them our most sincere congratulations and our welcome to the Organization  and to pledge our full co-operation in the promotion of the aims and principles of the Charter.23.	The delegations of States Members of the United Nations are meeting this year for the twenty-ninth time in order to consider together the problems that confront mankind today  to analyze them in the light both of the specific information available to us at present and of the prospects for the future  and to find acceptable solutions to all. These solutions must be lasting  and must benefit both each individual nation and the international community as a whole.24.	This year is significant for the Romanian people in that we can see the good results of profound structural economic  social and political changes which have taken place over the 30 years since the liberation of our country from Fascist domination. Romania today is an industrial and agricultural State  with a vigorous industry developing at a rapid pace on the basis of the latest achievements of modern science and technology and a flourishing Socialist agriculture. Those achievements  without precedent in the ages- long history of the Romanian people  demonstrate its creative capacity to build up its own way of life freely  in accordance with its own desires and aspirations.25.	Romania's international activity  in full accord with the new historical realities  has taken on new outlines and new dimensions  the attributes of the policy of an independent and sovereign Socialist State. This activity expresses the aspirations and the fundamental hopes of the Romanian nation  which are in full harmony with the general interests of peace and progress  of understanding and close co-operation among all States in the world.26.	The dynamic character of Romania's foreign policy  the variety of the forms it takes and its re-sounding message are reflected in the number of States with which we have diplomatic relations  amounting now to 120. The Romanian people has never had as many friends as it has today. In our opinion  this is proof of the realism of the international policy of our State  and its harmony with the legitimate aspirations of all peoples to a life of freedom and dignity  to the establishment of a durable peace on our planet and the elimination of war and of force in general in international relations.27.	In this spirit  Romania is developing and expanding its relations with all Socialist States and is striving to expand its relations with all developing countries and with all States struggling for their independent development. Our State  in keeping with the principles of peaceful coexistence  is also working for the promotion of mutually advantageous co-operation with the developed capitalist countries.28.	Romania has firmly established its international relations on the basis of the principles of full equality of rights  respect for independence and national sovereignty  non-interference in internal affairs  mutual advantage  and the non-use of force or the threat of force in relations among States.29.	The change in the balance of forces on the world scale resulting from the innovative ideas of socialism  the appearance on the international scene of many States vitally concerned to strengthen their independence and the rallying of new social and political forces to the flag of peace  democracy and progress has developed concurrently with  and is closely linked to  the technological and scientific revolution. This adds new factors to the international realities of today.30.	Events  wherever they take place  have rapid repercussions on international relations as a whole  and in one way or another affect every State. These are factual reasons which  in addition to the solid grounds of law  justify the growing concern of States with international questions and with their rights and obligations to participate and to make their own contribution to efforts aimed at settling international problems.31.	Nations wish to live in peace and tranquility and to be complete masters of their own destiny  abolishing for ever imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism  and the policy of force and the diktat. People wish to co-operate and not to destroy each other in devastating wars  which have never provided viable solutions to international problems. Nations wish to join their efforts in order to discover further mysteries of nature  to confront the difficulties that arise  to progress together with all speed  if possible during our own outstanding period of history  towards the summit of civilization.32.	Lately the international community has been giving more frequent and systematic consideration  in a spirit of co-operation  to the major problems of its present and its future. There have been a number of international conferences  and there will be more and in this context I should like to stress the particular value of the United Nations  its Secretariat and its Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim)  which have discussed  and will continue to discuss  such problems as energy  the environment -population  food  industrial development  the law of the sea  and science and technology  Fundamentally  these are aspects of a question which is on everyone's agenda  namely  development. Man and society are engaged in a development process which nobody can avoid. In order to cope with this process we must  on the one hand  eliminate obsolete situations and renounce methods and procedures that have prevented us from advancing rapidly  and  on the other  unite our efforts to find solutions to the major problems we face.33.	I have the privilege of reminding the General Assembly of the vibrant appeal of the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania  Mr. Nicolae Ceauescu  at the session of the great National Assembly to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of Romania:""We appeal to all Governments and to all peoples to act in concert and to co-operate actively in order to promote a policy of detente in the world and to make the present international situations thoroughly democratic.""We should co-operate intensively in order to find unanimously acceptable political solutions to all the problems confronting mankind today  to bring about the triumph of reason and equality in international relations  to avert new armed confrontations and forcefully to defend the free life and work of all peoples.""34.	It is true that  following profound transformations in international life  a new trend towards detente is making itself felt in the world. We must devote all our efforts to encouraging this tendency so that it may become the dominant and definitive trait in international relations. Unfortunately  however  the trend is not yet irreversible. The developments of these past few months remind us once more that in this world there are still forces opposed to peace  detente and co-operation. Consequently  we should continue to strive for the triumph of the policy of peace and understanding among peoples. It is certainly not an easy task; but  by relying on the will of peoples and by proving our sense of responsibility for the future of present generations and of those to come  we shall be able to overcome all the difficulties.35.	The protection of peace  the supreme good of all mankind  is inextricably linked to the achievement of general and complete disarmament and  above all  of nuclear disarmament. We cannot lose sight of the fact that  while negotiations on disarmament are under way in Geneva  the arms race  the increase in the number of nuclear  chemical and bacteriological weapons  as well as of other means of mass destruction  are a source of grave danger for the peace of and for civilization itself. The United Nations is in duty bound to take this state of affairs into consideration and to take relevant measures. Progressive forces and all peoples should unite their efforts and act with energy for the implementation of a truly new policy on disarmament.36; The Romanian Government favors the adoption of specific measures aimed at putting an end to the arms race  the reduction of military budgets and troops  the dismantling of foreign military bases and the elimination of military blocs. We favor the acceptance by all States of solemn commitments to prevent all aggression or interference in the affairs of other States. In our opinion  the proliferation of atomic weapons can be halted only by putting an end to the production of nuclear weapons and by proceeding  on the basis of agreements  to the destruction of existing stocks.37.	During this last quarter of a century it will be the task of all the Members of the United Nations to take resolute steps towards the establishment of new relations among all peoples of the world and the building of a new economic and political order in accordance with international decisions. By acting in this manner  we shall be responding to the vital aspirations of all peoples for the total elimination of the old imperialist policy of force and diktat  of colonialism and neocolonialism  and of all forms of interference and pressure.38.	We should encourage the solution of disputes among States by political means  unconditionally respecting the fundamental principles of contemporary international law. This law is itself subject to continuous changes reflecting the transformations that have taken place in society and in relations among States. Life shows that in our time the major problems confronting the international community can no longer be solved by a small group of States. The search for just and lasting solutions requires the participation  on a footing of equality  of all States concerned  thus strengthening the role of small and medium-sized countries in international life. It is only thus that we shall be able to find the solutions that most nearly correspond with the interests of all nations and fully serve the cause of peace. 39.	The establishment of truly democratic and equitable relations in the world and mankind's advance along the path of progress are inextricably linked to the establishment of a new international economic order. The experience of history shows that there is a close dialectical correspondence between the development of an independent economy and the realization of true national sovereignty. It is a truth  proved in practice everywhere in the world  that to ensure real independence it is essential to forge a powerful independent economy.40.	The work of each nation has always been and will remain the main determinant of the development of its material production and its social and economic progress. The manner in which each people by its labor successfully exploits its national resources plays a decisive role here. At the same time  more rapid progress on the part of the developing countries requires firmer action to strengthen relations between developed and developing countries on the basis of just principles that will further their own efforts for economic and social progress. It is high time and we should realize this fully for us to act forcefully to close the vast gap between the economies of various States and to bring their levels of development closer together.41.	The elimination of discriminatory measures hampering economic exchanges and a broader access for all States to the achievements of science and technology of our time are other important requirements for the reorganization  on new bases  of inter-national economic relations.42.	Romania  which is itself a developing country  is broadening and diversifying its economic relations with the other developing States. Those ties are an expression of its solidarity with those States in their efforts towards economic  social and national emancipation. The political actions of the leaders of our State  the many visits made by President Nicolae Ceaugescu to developing countries everywhere and the economic agreements that have been concluded in recent years have highlighted the better utilization of the material and human resources both of Romania and of those other countries. Such undertakings make it possible to contribute to the training of officials in the countries concerned and to meet the mutual interest in the development of industry  agriculture and other economic sectors  with a view to the accelerated economic and social progress of those countries.43.	The establishment of that new kind of international economic and political relationship requires a perfecting of the system of participation and action of States in international life. An ever more important role must be played by the United Nations.44.	Romania wishes to make a positive contribution to the full use of the possibilities and means of the United Nations in the solution of international problems and the encouragement of co-operation and understanding among States  and it has therefore proposed that the General Assembly study the possibility of strengthening the Organization's capacity for effective action  so that that action will truly reflect the new social and political facts of the present-day world and conform to the trends towards making international life more democratic. The Romanian Government bases itself on the concept that the primary interest of all nations in finding just and viable solutions to the great problems facing mankind necessitates the creation of conditions in which the United Nations will be truly able to carry out the functions and responsibilities entrusted to it by the Charter.45.	We think that the Organization has a considerable number of means for more energetic and effective action on all the situations arising in international relations. Many of the Charter provisions have been rarely or insufficiently used; others have not been applied at all. Still others have been interpreted in such a way that they have proved to be unusable or impossible to apply.46.	The General Assembly has the duty to study responsibly and with the greatest attention all the means that would ensure the application of the Charter provisions and the use of the methods made available to us by the Charter in particular  those provisions concerning the prevention and peaceful settlement of disputes  the confirmation of the process of the democratization of international relations  and the development of wider and more equal co-operation among all nations.47.	We view that study as a process in which the General Assembly will give constant attention to the question of strengthening the role of the United Nations and will periodically evaluate the efforts made  the progress achieved and the measures to be taken in the future. At the same time  we believe that other United Nations bodies should also  within the limits of their competence  study and put into effect proposals and suggestions by States designed to improve the activities of those bodies and thereby strengthen the role of the Organization in the world.48.	Of course  the ability of the United Nations to deal with the questions it must solve depends in the final analysis on the political will of its Member States —I would even say on their commitment to finding acceptable solutions in the interests of all the peoples and putting into effect the obligations they have assumed under the Charter and other international instruments  as well as the undertakings and actions to which they have subscribed under various United Nations resolutions.49.	The Romanian delegation is pleased with the way the General Assembly's sixth special session devoted to raw materials and development worked and the results it achieved. We are in favor of the implementation in relations among all the States of the principles laid down in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and of the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)].50.	In the Romanian delegation's opinion  the specific study and effective implementation by inter-national bodies within the United Nations system and by other international organizations of measures which were envisaged by the special session and which fall within their competence are very urgent tasks. The adoption during this session of the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  elaborated on the proposal of the President of Mexico  Mr. Luis Echeverria  will be a further step towards the preparation of a whole body of principles governing economic relations among States.51.	We have similar views regarding the recent World Population Conference  which was organized by the United Nations and to which the Romanian people had the honor of playing host. In our opinion  resolution V  entitled ""For a more just world""  adopted by that Conference  has particular significance. The document once again makes clear the international community's attachment to the ideals of a new and better world. We are convinced that the constructive way in which the representatives cooperated at that Conference and the fact that they succeeded in defining  on the basis of a consensus  the directions that action in that field should take action closely linked to the broad efforts of States to achieve economic and social progress create a very good basis for the continuation and improvement of such activities in the future.52.	Convinced of the role that modern science and technology play in the process of development  the Romanian Government is in favor of the organization by the United Nations of a conference on science and technology. We intend to propose some practical actions in that respect.53.	An important role in the strengthening of the process of detente in the world is played by the efforts to achieve security and co-operation in Europe. The Romanian Government believes that the results achieved so far by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have created conditions for the successful preparation of documents and for the convening in the very near future of the third phase of the Conference  at the highest level. The documents that will be adopted at that time should lead to the definition of new principles governing relations among the European States and to the opening of the path towards peaceful multilateral co-operation among all the States of the continent. They should also provide guarantees to each nation against any use or threat of the use of force and my interference in its internal affairs; they should provide also the possibility for each State to develop freely and as it wishes  without any impediments.54.	Romania  as is known  has actively participated in the Conference. It has made and will continue to make a specific contribution to the process of defining measures aimed at rendering the non-use of force in inter-European relations effective and at defining the context and the objectives of the institutional consequences of this first political forum of European States. We believe that the States which have participated in the Conference should now  in a constructive spirit of mutual understanding  devote all. their efforts to speeding up and successfully concluding the work in Geneva  and to agreeing unanimously on measures so long awaited by the peoples of our continent and capable of strengthening security and the development of co-operation on the European continent.55.	Within the context of this process of reorganization on a new basis of relations among European States  Romania will continue to work for multilateral cooperation among the Balkan States so that the Balkans may become a zone free from nuclear weapons and from foreign military bases  an area of peace and cooperation. We are also in favor of the Mediterranean becoming a zone of peace and international co-operation. We support the proposal of the Soviet Union aimed at achieving the withdrawal from the Mediterranean of all Soviet and United States ships and submarines carrying nuclear weapons.56.	It is with satisfaction that we note that a qualitatively new element has intervened in the struggle to remove the remaining vestiges of the system of colonial domination. Southern Africa  a bastion of colonialism  has begun to crumble under the pressure of the struggles of peoples for freedom. We have welcomed the accession to independence of Guinea-Bissau and we believe that we should resolutely continue this process so that the peoples of Angola at 1 Mozambique may freely decide on their own destinies.57.	In the spirit of its own traditions of struggling for freedom and justice  Romania will resolutely oppose all forms of colonialism and neocolonialism and foreign domination. We firmly support the right of peoples to self-determination and independence  and we call for the full implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)). The Romanian people  to whom racism and chauvinism is alien and who reject them  strongly condemn the outmoded minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia  as well as the policy of racial discrimination and apartheid.58.	In the opinion of U Romanian Government  the present session of the General Assembly and the United Nations in general are called upon to adopt firm and effective measures  making use of all the means provided by the Charter in order to force South Africa to put an end without delay to the illegal occupation of Namibia  so that the people of that country may preside freely over its own destinies  in keeping with its national aspirations.59.	To achieve the objective of the total elimination of colonialism  we believe that it is particularly urgent and timely to intensify efforts in order to bring about a broader recognition of national liberation movements and to secure the participation of their representatives in all the activities of our Organization which are of concern to them. From this rostrum  I should like to reaffirm the militant solidarity of the Romanian Government and people with the just struggle of national liberation movements  to whom we provide multilateral diplomatic and material support.60.	The frequent meetings and the fruitful discussions held by President Nicolae Ceaugescu with the leaders of the national liberation movements  by the recognized value of direct contacts at the summit level  have enshrined in international relations the lasting nature and depth of the sentiments of solidarity of the Romanian people with their just struggle for national independence.61.	The changes that have taken place in the Middle East and the military disengagement agreements concluded  which the Romanian Government has welcomed as a first major step towards the settlement of the conflict  strengthen our conviction that we should now take Anther action to establish peace in that region.62.	In the opinion of the Romanian Government  a just and lasting solution in the Middle East requires  as a first step  the withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied Arab territories  recognition of the right to existence and independent development of all States in the area  the right of the Palestinians to self-determination  including the creation of an independent Palestinian State  and its recognition by the international community  bearing in mind the relevant resolutions adopted by the United Nations. Moreover  as the Romanian Government has often stressed  we cannot achieve a lasting settlement of the situation in the Middle East without a proper solution of the Palestinian question. Certainly  in order to finalize this process  it is necessary to make unremitting efforts and to resume as soon as possible the Geneva negotiations under United Nations auspices  with the participation of all States concerned  of the Palestine Liberation Organization  and of all other States which wish to contribute to the implementation of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.63.	The overriding interests of the peoples of that region  as well as the interests of international peace and security  require that ail States strive resolutely to put an end to the conflict and to achieve a just and lasting peace.64.	The situation arising from developments in Cyprus is a cause of legitimate concern for international peace and security. As a country situated in the same geographical region  Romania is keenly interested in the evolution of the situation on that island and strongly supports respect for the independence  sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Cyprus  the withdrawal of foreign troops   primarily of Greek and Turkish troops  and the settlement of those questions by political means  not by arms or force.65.	In the solution of the problem of Cyprus  based on the maintenance of the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country  a decisive role must be played by the Cypriot people.'Direct contacts and discussion between the two communities  as well as the immediate and specific consideration of all those questions  should lead to lasting agreements ensuring peaceful coexistence on the basis of full equality before the law of all the citizens of the Cypriot State. The prolongation of the present situation can have grave consequences for the Cypriot State and for international peace and security.66.	As regards the Korean question  the United Nations  in our view  has a moral obligation to help further the positive process begun through the political initiatives and persevering efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Consequently  an end should be put without delay to all those institutions which  against the national interests of the Korean people  have functioned as barriers on the road towards realization of that people's aspirations to peaceful and independent unification.67.	The General Assembly has already taken a first step in that direction by deciding at its last session to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea.4 It is therefore incumbent upon the Assembly to continue courageously along this path  and to work for the withdrawal of the foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations.68.	Romania stands firmly by the side of the Cambodian people in its just struggle for national liberation and independent development in accordance with its national aspirations  without any outside interference. We believe that the United Nations has a duty to take into account the realities of the situation in that country  the de jure and de facto situation in Cambodia  and to proceed at once to the restoration in the United Nations of the legitimate rights of the Royal Government of National Unity  under the leadership of the Cambodian Head of State  Norodom Sihanouk.69.	In full solidarity with the just cause of the VietNamese people  the people and Government of my country have always given their support in a variety of ways to the heroic struggle of the Democratic People's Republic of Viet Nam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Viet Nam  and welcomed with satisfaction the end of the war and the conclusion of the Paris peace agreements. It is now the duty of all peace-loving States to exert positive pressure for the implementation of those agreements  thus contributing to the defense of the freedom and independence of the VietNamese people  and to support for its efforts for peaceful rehabilitation.70.	In keeping with the same position of principle  the Romanian Government welcomed the conclusion of the agreement re-establishing peace and national harmony in Laos  and the moves to put the agreed arrangements into effect.71.	At the beginning of my statement I mentioned the fact that the representatives of Member States are holding their twenty-ninth session. The United Nations now has a past history of almost three decades. This year we have a new opportunity to prove to the entire world that the United Nations is an international forum capable of keeping step with the processes of innovation now going on in the world  with the unprecedented changes that characterize our time.72.	It is incumbent upon us  the representatives of the Member States  to devote all our efforts to ensuring that the present session will represent  in the history of the United Nations  an important step forward in seeking solutions to the problems confronting us  especially in eliminating the use of force or the threat of force  and banishing war from the international scene. Situations of tension and military confrontation must make way for understanding and co-operation among peoples. Let us join our forces  let us do everything in our power to ensure that peace reigns in the world  and that all peoples go forward ever more speedily towards the summits of civilization. It is thus that the United Nations will succeed in justifying the confidence placed in it by all peoples almost three decades ago."
"103",5938,"RUS",29,1974,"Mr. President  on behalf of the Soviet delegation  I should like to congratulate you upon your election to the important post of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I should like to wish you success in the fulfillment of this important task. The unanimity with which you were elected once again demonstrates the respect which is enjoyed internationally by your country  the Algerian People's Democratic Republic.120.	No session of the General Assembly is the same as the previous one  nor is the world situation against the background of which they convene the same. This is particularly noticeable against the swiftly changing background of events in recent years. What does remain unchanged  however  is the criterion that the United Nations and each of its Members must be guided by at all times and in all things -namely  concern for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is against this fundamental criterion that the activities of the United Nations and the practical actions of States in the international arena should be measured.121.	With regard to the Soviet Union  we throw onto the scales of peace the entire influence of our State  the whole authority of our policy. This has always been the case and it will continue to be. Those who are earnestly seeking for ways to establish and consolidate peaceful relations and to settle disputed problems around the negotiating table can definitely count on the reliable co-operation of the Soviet Union.122.	For more than half a century our country has consistently pursued a policy of peace  a policy of rebuffing aggression and safeguarding the rights of peoples  as that policy was formulated by Vladimir ilyich Lenin. In present-day conditions too the struggle for peace means for us not just an abstract category but a matter of concrete efforts to give practical effect to the foreign policy guidelines laid down by the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It is the expression of the Soviet people's will for peace and uncompromising determination to make it stronger.123.	Implementation of the Congress's decisions the program of Peace and Co-operation has already yielded tangible results in the improvement of the international situation. This is clear to any impartial observer. It is equally clear that the current positive changes are to everyone's benefit. Indeed  if there is an area where the fundamental interests of all nations  without exception  do converge  that is the maintenance of peace.124.	The Soviet Union pursues its policies in close co-ordination with its allies and friends. The socialist community of States unites its participants in a common creative effort the building of an advanced society which by its very nature rejects war. It is no accident that many major peace initiatives have been sponsored by the socialist countries. The session of the Political Consultative Committee of the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty last April reaffirmed their joint determination to fight for the triumph of the ideals of peace and the economic and social progress of the peoples.125.	The general state of world affairs is being molded by a tremendous number of factors  ranging from political and military to national or even psychological factors. And it therefore hardly lends itself to one-dimensional assessment. But the main trend of international development arouses no doubts: it is detente and the desire for detente which are today the predominant features.126.	For the first time  international detente has gone beyond good wishes and verbal assurances. It is a term that has now found a place for itself in the political vocabulary precisely because it is backed by some very real content the positive changes in reality itself. From the vantage point of recent years one can distinctly see how much has been done in this respect.127.	Through joint efforts by many States it has become possible to reduce the risk of armed conflict between the two social systems. But of special significance are the well-known agreements of 1972-1974 between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. This applies above all to the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War. The two major Powers undertook to make efforts to preclude entirely the risk of military conflict  including that involving nuclear weapons  between the Soviet Union and the United States  or between either of the parties and other States. At the same time  they agreed to refrain from the use of force against each other and against other countries in circumstances which may endanger international peace and security.128.	Not long ago there was bitter fighting in IndoChina  in the Middle East  and in South Asia. And these were not the only areas where events took a dangerous turn. Now several international conflicts have  to a certain extent  been channeled in the direction of political settlement.129.	It is well known that on more than one occasion tensions in Europe have risen to an alarming level. There were no military clashes  but if the total damage inflicted by the ""cold war"" and its tensions is estimated  it will prove enormous from all standpoints. Nowadays the political development of the European continent is ever more steadily taking a different course. Not only have acute problems of the territorial and political arrangements arising out of the Second World War been solved there  but also prospects for a safer  peaceful future for Europe have been opened up.130.	Alongside this there is another major asset of detente— the development of bilateral relations between States with different social systems. In the past too there were periods when it was impossible to organize business-like co-operation between them. But the experience of decades has shown us that that was rather the exception than the rule. Now peaceful co-existence is increasingly becoming the law of contemporary life. And the very nature of these relations is changing in many ways as they become steeped in the spirit of peaceful co-operation.131.	Finally  it was precisely detente that put on the agenda the question of restructuring economic relations in the world. The point of this was to eliminate inequality arid discrimination  and to ensure in practice the sovereign right of States to dispose of their natural resources. The sixth special session of the General Assembly called severely to task those who for centuries have been exploiting the labor and resources of others  and indicated ways of eliminating economic oppression. The Soviet Union supports the just demands of the developing countries.132.	On the whole  it can be stated with confidence that international events are now taking a course closer to peace. However  one should also see one other thing clearly: the movement towards peace does not always follow a straight line  and difficulties along this road will not necessarily decrease with each passing year. In a certain sense the problems which have to be dealt with today are not simpler but perhaps even more complicated than those of yesterday. And there is more to it than just objective causes.133.	In the final analysis  the solution of the accumulated problems is hampered by the deliberate opposition of those forces whose interests are associated with policies contrary to the policy of detente. A closer look will reveal behind each instance of aggravation whether caused by encroachments on the freedom and independence of nations  by the stepping-up of the arms race  or by attempts to test the durability of existing international treaties the overt or covert activities of those forces. And when at times you hear people say that detente is a purely temporary phenomenon or allege that it has exhausted itself  you can recognize without fail from what quarter these statements come.134.	The Soviet Union counters them with its own motto  which is not to slacken efforts to ensure that the healthy processes which have now been embarked upon should become irreversible and consolidated. As the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union  Leonid I. Brezhnev  stressed recently  ""If you want peace  pursue a policy of peace and struggle for that policy"". We are convinced that in our time the complete elimination of the threat of war is feasible albeit not close at hand provided active and persistent efforts are made to that end.135.	The fact that the world is still far from what the peoples would like it to be is demonstrated by the tragedy which has afflicted the Republic of Cyprus. Some may have the impression that this is an event of local significance. The Soviet Union takes a different view.136.	Before the eyes of the world the force of arms is being used ruthlessly to trample on the independence and territorial integrity of a sovereign Member State of the United Nations  a participant in the non-aligned movement. The fact that this is a small country presents developments in a special light. Another hotbed of tension has appeared in the eastern Mediterranean  and unless urgent measures are taken no one can guarantee that the situation will not deteriorate even further.137.	From the very beginning the Soviet Union came out in defense of the inalienable rights of the State of Cyprus. It has been resolutely calling for an end to outside interference in the affairs of Cyprus  for the withdrawal of foreign troops from its soil  for the restoration of constitutional order  and for the Cypriots to be given a chance to decide their destiny for themselves. That is the only way radically to remove the tension. The demand that   the Charter of the United Nations be observed should not be an empty phrase as those responsible for events in Cyprus would like to see it. It must be complied with in the case of the Cyprus tragedy too.138.	The Cyprus problem must be brought out of the impasse resulting from attempts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] to solve it in camera  in political darkness  and in the narrow interests of militarist circles. This purpose that is  a just solution to the Cyprus problem is promoted by the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an international conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations.7 The decisions of such a conference  adopted with the direct participation of representatives of the Republic of Cyprus and aimed at ensuring the country's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  could be effectively guaranteed by the States permanent members of the Security Council  for  under the Charter of the United Nations  it is precisely they who are entrusted with special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.139.	IndoChina is situated on the other side of the planet  and the situation there is different. But the underlying reasons why the guns are still firing and blood is still flowing in some parts of the region are the same as in Cyprus. It is all due to the stubborn reluctance of foreign-backed reactionary forces to respect the legitimate rights of the peoples.140.	To bring to a conclusion the political settlement in Viet Nam it is necessary  in the first place  to make the Saigon regime give up its military provocations and attempts to undermine the Paris agreements on Viet Nam. Strict observance of these agreements by all parties is an indispensable condition for the normalization of the situation. As for Cambodia  its problems must be solved by the Cambodians themselves  in accordance with their national interests and without any outside interference. The positive results of agreements reached in Laos should also be consolidated.141.	The comprehensive assistance and support given by the Soviet Union and other States of the Socialist community to the Vietnamese people have helped them to achieve victory in the long and heroic struggle against aggression. The Soviet Union will continue to support the Vietnamese people in peacetime too. The aspirations of the patriotic forces of IndoChina to freedom and independence will always be met with our understanding and solidarity. 142.	For almost 30 years now the Middle East has been in a state of fever. Over this period wars have broken out there time and time again. In fact  the last one was only a year ago. This should be enough to convince anyone that the Middle East problem must be solved and solved justly  with the interests of all the peoples of the region being taken into account.143.	What does that imply? First of all  the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all—I stress  from all the Arab lands seized by them in 1967 and the assurance of the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine. Otherwise there can be no stable peace in the Middle East. It does not need a prophet to foresee a new flare-up of hostilities if the Middle East settlement is reduced to half-measures  no matter how-well advertised they may be.144.	There are increasing signs that Israel regards the disengagement of forces on Sinai and the Golan Heights not as the first step towards a general settlement which is what it should be but as a maneuver intended to freeze the situation. The clear unwillingness to leave the occupied Arab territories and  moreover  a desire to consolidate Israel's hold on them are quite evident. What other explanation can there be for the militarist intoxication which has again overcome Israel and for the attempts to exert military pressure on the Arab States? Unless this stops  the disengagement of troops may prove to be a mere regrouping of forces prior to a new clash.145.	The Soviet Union believes that there must be no delay in implementing measures leading to a political settlement in the Middle East  and this means prompt resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East  the most appropriate forum for considering the Middle East problem in all its complex totality and for finding solutions satisfactory to the parties involved in the conflict. Naturally  this fully applies also to the Arab people of Palestine  whose representatives must take their rightful place at the conference.	;146.	We believe that the time has surely come to address ourselves earnestly to the problem of Palestine. A wider approach is required here  which would open the way to ensuring not only in words but in deeds the legitimate national rights of the Arab people of Palestine  and that is why we favoured including the question of Palestine on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly as a separate item.147.	There are some who try to represent the Soviet Union's position as one-sided and only serving the interests of the Arab States. Yes  indeed  we do support and will continue to support the legitimate demands of the Arabs. But it would be wrong to see only this particular aspect in our position. When we insist that territories acquired by force should not become a prize for aggression  the implications of our demand go well beyond the limits of the Middle East. It reflects intolerance of aggression in general. What this involves  therefore  is a major international principle and the question of consistency in policy.148.	Furthermore  the Soviet Union is in favor of Israel's existence and development as an independent sovereign State. We have said so many timesinand we affirm it once again. Real  not illusory  progress towards a Middle East settlement will create prerequisites for the development of relations between the Soviet Union and all the States of the Middle East  including Israel.149.	The scope of the policy of peace and detente is broad. It is important not to lose momentum in any field and  above all  wherever serious work has already begun to build more stable relations between States on the basis of the observance of the principles of peaceful coexistence.150.	In this context  the Soviet Union attaches primary importance to the successful conclusion of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This is question number one in European political life today. An objective assessment of what has already been done at the Conference prompts the conclusion that  on the whole  the results are impressive.151.	Has anyone ever before succeeded in jointly elaborating practical standards of peaceful relations among States in Europe  in particular  on questions which have hitherto seemed insoluble? Until now nothing of this kind has been seen  at least on such a scale. Today  this work is proceeding successfully. Several important principles have been formulated in detail as specifically applicable to Europe. The arrival at generally acceptable decisions on them  on the basis of a reasonable balance of interests of the parties  is not a routine phenomenon. Not all the participants in the Conference rely  even in their bilateral relations  on such a solid foundation as the one which is now being laid for an all-European agreement.152.	It has also proved possible to reach agreement on a wide range of questions relating to cooperation among States in the most varied fields: from trade and economics to culture; from the protection of the environment to the extension of human contacts and exchanges of information. Experience has shown that such questions can be settled if they are viewed in direct proportion to the main problem of ensuring peace in Europe  and if the principle of non-interference in internal affairs is strictly adhered to.153.	The Soviet Union is convinced that there is an opportunity to conclude the Conference at an early date by adopting weighty decisions in the interests of security in Europe. In saying this we not only properly appreciate the collective work that has already been done; we also proceed from the premise that solutions to the still outstanding problems can be found  if all the participants display the necessary political will and realism.154.	Naturally  it would not be right to expect the Conference to settle at one fell swoop all the questions accumulated over the long years of tension and mistrust. But it is equal to the task of achieving agreements. on crucial problems which can determine a stable peaceful development in Europe for the foreseeable future. It will also be easier to tackle other outstanding issues in the atmosphere of detente. 155.	The Soviet Union will continue to do everything to ensure the complete success of the Conference. We trust that our Western partners will also take a constructive approach to this task. It is in the interests of the peoples of Europe  and not just of Europe alone  to work to bring nearer the day when agreements designed to legitimize peace and co-operation on the scale of an entire continent can be signed at the highest level.156.	It is also important to achieve results at the Vienna Talks on the Mutual Reduction of Forces and Armaments and Associated Measures in Central Europe. The key to this is strict observance by all of the rule of undiminished security for each side. Agreement on the questions under discussion would in practice supplement political detente in Europe with military detente.157.	The conversion into a practical proposition of the idea of consolidating peace in Asia through the joint efforts of States should not  in our opinion  be a matter for the distant future. No doubt  the situation there remains complex. There is no small number of trouble spots  conflicts and international disputes on the continent of Asia.158.	Political thought in Asia  too  is switching more and more to the search for ways of securing peace and stability. And surely this is demonstrated by the efforts of India  Pakistan and Bangladesh to normalize relations on the Hindustan Peninsula  or by the idea of converting the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace.159.	We note with satisfaction the growing interest in the Soviet Union's initiative concerning the establishment of a collective security system in Asia. More and more States in Asia are supporting it. The Soviet-Indian Declaration signed as a result of the visit of Leonid Uyich Brezhnev to India in November 1973 contains important principles which can serve as a basis for the development of an effective system of relations between States in Asia.160.	The establishment of peace and co-operation in Asia meets the fundamental interests of all the Asian people. The achievement of this goal is a matter which concerns every country of that continent.161.	The agenda of this session includes an item which has a direct bearing on the improvement of the situation in Asia. This is the proposal by 34 States  including the Soviet Union  on the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations [AI9703 and Add. 1-3}. The presence of those troops  which have now been there for more than two decades  represents a source of constant military and political tension in the Korean Peninsula. Their presence is still more inappropriate under present conditions when  on the initiative of the Korean People's Democratic Republic  efforts are being made to bring about the peaceful reunification of Korea.162.	If we analyze the reasons which have so often caused acute tensions in the world  and which even now frequently lead to dangerous situations  we shall easily see that in many cases this was the result of the armaments race. It is indeed a fact that immediately after the Second World War some States embarked upon a course of building up armaments and setting up military bases on foreign territories  thus making the creation of tensions and saber- rattling their policy. It is a secret to no one that it was precisely that policy of theirs which at times brought the world to a very dangerous brink.163.	How many speeches have been made on disarmament and the cessation of the arms race in the last 25 years? Probably no other problem has absorbed the attention of statesmen and public figures to such an extent in the post-war period. And this is understandable. Stable and lasting peace is incompatible with the arms race. They are antipodes. One cannot seriously think of eliminating the threat of war while at the same time increasing military budgets and endlessly building up armaments.164.	Facts must be faced. So far it has not proved possible to stop the arms race. Furthermore  today the arms race absorbs more money than ten or twenty years ago. It has been estimated that the world annually burns in the furnace of armaments over $250 000 million. This is more than the entire national income of the developing States of Asia and Africa. One can only imagine what benefits these resources could yield if they were used for peaceful purposes  for development  to combat hunger  poverty and disease.165.	No Government -at least openly- declares that it favors the arms race. Nevertheless  arms are accumulating. For three months every year appeals to end the arms race are heard at the session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. But the arms race continues. Ever more and newer papers and resolutions on disarmament are filling the archives of the United Nations. But disarmament still does not manage to overcome its inertia. Conveyor belts keep on moving inexorably  turning out new consignments of destructive weapons.166.	And so a paradoxical situation develops. The peace movement has never had such momentum as it enjoys today  and never has the world produced such quantities of arms as it does today. On the one hand  there is the longing for peace on the part of hundreds of millions of people who realize the grim danger of the arms race  but  on the other hand  there is the increasing avalanche of armaments.167.	What is the matter? Maybe some forces which have got out of human control are at work? Certainly not. The reason is policy. And if it is policy  well  one may ask  whose policy?168.	If it all depended on the socialist countries  the arms race would have been eliminated long ago. No one has tabled more concrete proposals on disarmament than they. Ever since the non-aligned countries moved into the forefront of international affairs they too have been actively working in favor of disarmament. Voices of reason are to be heard in other countries too  and they resound with ever greater confidence both in parliaments and in broad public circles 169.	Military-industrial circles that profit from the arms race oppose its cessation. Those politicians who are linked with these circles have long since placed their narrow interests above the aspirations of the peoples. The influence of these circles has had a telling effect on all disarmament negotiations  including those in the General Assembly and the Security Council. 170.	The arms race affects all States  even those not directly involved in it. All the peoples of the world live under one and the same roof. The risks posed by the unrestrained build-up of armaments are a danger to all. On the other hand  is there any country in the world whose economy is not affected  one way or another  by the burden of armaments? Everyone here could adduce numerous examples in confirmation of the correctness of this argument.171.	Furthermore  recently economic upheavals  which have been affecting many States  have increased in intensity and increasingly affect the material situation of people. Statesmen and economists are racking their brains over the causes underlying all this. But there is one undeniable conclusion that is borne out every day and every hour: the aggravation of economic problems is largely connected with the rising scale of the arms race and with soaring military expenditures.172.	But if the disarmament problem affects everyone  then the solution to the problem should be sought jointly by all States.173.	The main thing here is not just to mark time  hiding behind arguments about the complexity of the problem. If right now it cannot be solved at one stroke  solutions should be sought for individual aspects so that this should lead at least step by step to the ultimate goal of disarmament  and in effect  such an approach has already been tried out in recent years and has justified itself.174.	As positive changes make their way in the world  so objective prerequisites for finding real agreements in the sphere of disarmament improve. It is noteworthy that the largest number of agreements of this kind have been reached in the last few years. Although they do not reverse the arms race  they do curb it in a whole series of ways.175.	In one case  this takes the form of limiting further perfection of nuclear weapons and the creation of their new destructive models. The Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963  has been serving this end well for over a decade now.176.	The same objective is served by the Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States of 3 July 1974  whereby both countries have undertaken to stop  as of 31 March 1976  underground testing of nuclear weapons with the most powerful nuclear charges and also to limit underground nuclear test explosions in general. The Soviet Union will strive to see to it that the prohibition of nuclear weapon tests eventually becomes comprehensive and universal.177.	In another case  it takes the form of a limit on the territorial spread of armaments. Such is the purport of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  which has proved its effectiveness. We are in favor of making full use of the possibilities inherent in that Treaty and of increasing the number of States parties to it. The objective is to make this Treaty universal.178.	A number of agreements exclude the sea-bed and the ocean floor  outer space and celestial bodies from the sphere of possible emplacement of nuclear weapons. In accordance with an international agreement bacteriological weapons have been prohibited and eliminated from military arsenals  and prospects are emerging for the outlawing of another deadly means of warfare  namely  chemical weapons.179.	And what about the agreements on the limitation of strategic arms between the Soviet Union and the United States? I feel that there is no need to explain their unprecedented significance since they are designed to narrow the actual material basis of the nuclear-missile arms race. Quite recently these agreements have been supplemented by new important agreements. Last July  the Soviet Union and the United States decided further to limit their anti-ballistic missile systems and mapped out ways of achieving further limitation of strategic offensive arms in terms of both quality and quantity. The Soviet delegation in Geneva  where talks on these questions were resumed the other day  has firm instructions to seek their solution 180.	The supreme interests not only of the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States but also of the peoples of the whole world require that the Soviet Union and the United States  possessing the colossal might of nuclear weapons  should make every effort to achieve appropriate understandings and agreements. We should like to express our gratification at the fact that this idea was clearly stated too from the rostrum of the General Assembly by President Ford of the United States [2234th meeting].181.	When two Powers voluntarily limit their military preparations  when they establish a ceiling above which they will not increase nuclear missile armaments  their actions  apart from anything else  must set a good example for others.182.	The Soviet Union will continue to work tirelessly to further the cause of disarmament in areas where this is possible; it will look for new fields where concrete results can be achieved through the joint efforts of States.183.	The Soviet Union took the initiative by proposing the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty- ninth session of the General Assembly  as an important and urgent question  of item 103  entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human well- being and health"" [4/9702].184.	What is the motive for this? The achievements of scientific and technological progress have expanded the possibilities of influencing nature and the climate of the globe and  in a certain sense  of controlling the complex and powerful processes involved. Unfortunately  the latest discoveries can be used not only for creative  but also for military  purposes with extremely destructive consequences for mankind. These are not the conjectures of science fiction writers  but an actual threat that is assuming an ever more realistic shape. It is in the interests of all peoples to nip this threat in the bud.185.	The Soviet Union proposes that an international convention should be concluded which will outlaw the military use of the environment. Compliance with the provisions of such a convention  a draft of which we will submit [see AlC.JIL.675]  could be secured through the adoption by each State  in accordance with its constitutional processes  of appropriate measures to prohibit activities contrary to the convention and through consultations and co-operation among States  notably within the framework of the United Nations.186.	The conclusion of such a convention would prevent the emergence of new means of warfare and  at the same time  would facilitate the solution of a problem common to all mankind the protection of the environment. We trust that all the participants in the Assembly will fully appreciate the universal significance of this important initiative and treat this proposal accordingly. The Soviet Union and the socialist countries as a whole seek to gain .nothing from this. We have made this proposal because it is in the interests of all States  all peoples and the whole world.187.	In its attitude in the United Nations  the Soviet Union proceeds on the assumption that the Organization can and must play an important part in developing and consolidating the positive processes characteristic of the present-day world situation. We have quite a number of useful resolutions to our credit aimed at strengthening international peace. Now  everything depends on their being consistently implemented.188.	In this regard  I should like to refer especially to some resolutions adopted by the United Nations over the last two or three years by a large majority of votes. In the first place  I have in mind the one on the prohibition of the use of force in international relations and the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons [resolution 2936 (XXVII)]. This is an Assembly decision of fundamental importance. It must acquire binding force for all States and  in this regard  the Security Council has an important role.189.	One cannot say that the General Assembly resolution on the convening of a world disarmament conference [resolution 2833 (XXVI)] has not been followed up. An Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference [resolution 3183 (XXVIII)] has even been set up  in which  among other States  three nuclear Powers are participating. However  in fact  the question is not really being dealt with. It is time for the Committee to proceed  in close co-operation with the nuclear Powers  to prepare concrete recommendations on the practical aspects of the convocation of that conference. The boycotting of this important measure by several States is contrary to the clearly expressed desire of the overwhelming majority of States Members of the United Nations. We regard it as a challenge to the world Organization.190.	Through no fault of the Soviet Union  there is delay in the implementation of such a commonly useful enterprise as that of the reduction of the military budgets of the States permanent members of the Security Council by 10 per cent and the utilization of part of the funds thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries. This example belongs in the same category. This action would have a double effect: it would promote the limitation of the arms race and  at the same time  provide additional assistance to States that need it most. The attitudes towards this proposal act as a kind of litmus paper revealing the intentions of States regarding acute present-day problems.191.	The further development of bilateral relations between States based on the principles of peaceful coexistence is a vast and far from exhausted reserve for deepening detente. On this basis our country is prepared to establish and expand not just normal but  where possible  friendly relations with all States sharing this approach. This has been and remains one of the most important lines of the Soviet Union's foreign policy.192.	It is our desire to see the consolidation of all the positive results that have been achieved so far in our relations with leading capitalist States on the basis of fruitful efforts on both sides. We' want to move ahead and make these relations stable. In this context  the statements by the new leaders of the United States  France and the Federal Republic of Germany about their intentions to continue to move towards detente and co-operation have been met in the Soviet Union with satisfaction.193.	Today economic  scientific and technological links assume an increasingly large role in relations between States with different social systems. If co-operation in these fields is built on respect for the principles of equality and non-interference  it will not only be mutually advantageous but will also promote the establishment of a material basis of sorts for durable peace and good neighborliness.194.	We value highly the good and  in some instances  close relations which have been established between the Soviet Union and many developing countries. The countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America which have embarked upon the road of national independence and the consolidation of economic independence can continue to rely firmly on our support. We were in at the source of their struggle against colonialism  and at each and every stage of it we have supported and will continue to support the developing States in word and in deed. That is our line of principle  and we shall not deviate from it.195.	The solution of such complex and urgent problems as those of energy and food  which are attracting much attention  particularly in the United Nations  should also be sought on the path of peace and co-operation  of strict observance of the principles of equality and sovereignty  and of the right of States to dispose of their natural resources.196.	The number of young States Members of the United Nations has increased at this session of the General Assembly. We should like to express our particular satisfaction at the fact that the People's Republic of Bangladesh has become a full Member of the United Nations and that thus an end has been put to an injustice with regard to that major Asian State.197.	The Soviet Union  which was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  welcomes that State's admission to the United Nations with great satisfaction. The Soviet Union also welcomes the admission to the United Nations of the newly independent State of Grenada. Soon to come is the proclamation of the national independence of Mozambique. The current attempts to frustrate the process of decolonization that has begun in that country must be most resolutely rebuffed. That of course applies equally and fully to Angola. That will  indeed  be the crowning moment of the armed phase of the struggle for national liberation of the former Portuguese colonies  and will provide even further evidence of the irresistible march of social progress.198.	The year that has passed since the Fascist coup in Chile has revealed the great depth of the tragedy that has befallen the Chilean people. But it has also demonstrated that endless terror and the suppression of elementary human rights cannot break the will of the people of Chile for a free and independent life. The bloody deeds of the junta are in glaring contradiction with the lofty human principles and purposes of the United Nations  and are a challenge to human honor and decency. It is no accident that the junta in fact remains in a state of international isolation.199.	The struggle for national independence and economic liberation and for the elimination of the vestiges of the colonial system has been scoring impressive victories in recent years. But that struggle is by no means ended. The manifestations of economic oppression and inequality and the fact that there are still dark blemishes of colonialism  apartheid and racial discrimination on earth cannot be tolerated. Until they disappear  the peace-loving States and the United Nations as a whole cannot slacken their efforts to eradicate them.200.	It is always necessary to identify the most topical issues among the great variety of problems posed by the course of world developments. At any given moment  the efforts of States striving to achieve the strengthening of peace should be concentrated precisely upon them. It is the opinion of the Soviet Union that some of the high-priority tasks of today are the following:-to proceed in practical terms to a Cyprus settlement; stop the violence against that country and its people; secure respect for the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of that State and  for those purposes  convene a representative international conference on Cyprus within the framework of the United Nations;-to resume as a matter of urgency the work of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East to solve questions concerning the establishment of a just and durable peace in that area;-to complete the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at an early date by adopting  at the highest level  decisions ensuring a peaceful future for Europe;-to achieve specific agreements in the Soviet- American Strategic Arms Limitation Talks  in the multilateral negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Central Europe  and in the Committee on Disarmament;-to take measures to implement the decisions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly on strengthening the economic independence of developing States.201.	No one would venture to claim that the solution of all those problems  and of others to which we have drawn the attention of this Assembly  is an easy task. But their solution is necessary and feasible  and all States really interested in developing peaceful and reasonable forms of international inter-course should work towards that end. The Soviet Union will be unstinting in its efforts to promote the establishment of durable and lasting peace on earth."
"104",5985,"RWA",29,1974," Mr. President  your unanimous election to the presidency of this Assembly is sure proof of the eminent personal qualities with which you have been so generously endowed and which have won for you today the esteem and confidence of this Assembly. That esteem  through you  goes to Algeria  your motherland  which throughout the sombre years of its history has fought with courage and determination to achieve its independence  and which today  under the noble guidance of its leader  Colonel Houari Boumediene  is the most successful example not only of the political  economic and cultural liberation of a nation  but also of a perceptive and tireless champion of universal social justice and of the full development of the third world.148.	Your election pleases us all the more since it comes at a time when Africa  of which you are an illustrious son  is at a turning point in its total decolonization. We are convinced that your customary flexibility in negotiation  your dynamism and the clear thinking which has always characterized your approach to problems will enable our debates to reach realistic and practical solutions. My delegation would like to assure you that it pledges its full contribution to the success of this session of the General Assembly.149.	I am also called on to repeat our expressions of appreciation to Mr. Benites of Ecuador  who during two sessions directed our work with wisdom  competence and devotion rarely equaled  especially in view of the exceptional circumstances of his presidency.150.	This is also a good opportunity for us to reiterate to the SecretaryGeneral  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  the expression of the confidence of my Government because of his untiring and ceaseless efforts to render the Organization an effective instrument in the service of peace  social justice and security in the world. We publicly recognize the keen awareness with which the SecretaryGeneral has discharged his noble mission  to promote  at whatever cost  cooperation among the nations. Throughout his world travels his constant concern has been the endeavor to protect and defend understanding among men  peoples and nations.151.	More than ever in the past  this Assembly requires that we all become more keenly aware of our international responsibilities  in the interest of the fate of mankind as a whole. Since the twenty-eighth session many changes have taken place in the world. It has been clearly demonstrated to us that it is high time for the Organization to be given the adequate moral and material power  which is needed effectively to thwart the misdeeds of the ever present or latent forces of retrogression and reaction.152.	My delegation is pleased to welcome the new States Members of the Organization  Bangladesh  Grenada and GuineaBissau  which  through their admission  have enlarged the family of nations. Our particular welcome goes to the Republic of Guinea Bissau  which has achieved its independence at the cost of so many sacrifices. Our sister country knows very well what our sentiments were at the dawn of its hopes  and we express our best wishes as it takes its new path towards progress and full independence.153.	In Africa  the thaw in the situation in the Territories administered by Portugal is an event without precedent in the history of that country  which was the most unshakable bastion of colonialism. That development calls for adjustments on our part  and the international community  in order to carry out its mission properly  must channel that change towards a successful conclusion that is to say that on the one hand it should strike an appropriate balance between social justice and economic growth and on the other hand it should promote the maximum conditions for the exercise of equality and freedom for all men.154.	The efforts towards decolonization made by Portugal are appreciated by all of us. We know that the problem is to strike a balance between the imperatives of legal principles and the economic interests of the moment or of an era. That has often been the stumblingblock to the best of compromise formulas. Lisbon needed real courage to come to such a change of heart  but it is urgent to transform intentions into actions. Mozambique ar.d Angola await impatiently the glorious sun of real  authentic and unclouded independence.155.	The crises and tensions in certain corners of our planet  the deportations and separations of peoples and nations  have always been  and still are  a matter of great concern for my country  whether the problems concern Palestine  Korea  Viet Nam  Cambodia or Cyprus. My Government still believes that any attempt to settle the crisis in the Middle East must take full account of the legitimate aspiration and inalienable right of the Palestinian people to return to the country of which they have been robbed  and to decide their own fate.156.	The Government of Rwanda is following with great feeling the evolution of the situation in IndoChina. It hopes that the Paris agreements on Viet Nam will be fully implemented in order to improve the fate of the VietNamese people as a whole  We are pleased at the very substantial improvement of the situation in Laos and we follow with the closest attention  and with feelings of sympathy  the situation in Cambodia  a country torn apart by a long and harsh internal war. It is high time that an equitable and rapid solution be found  to bring that war to an end and allow the Cambodian people full opportunities of accomplishing the heavy task of national reconstruction and economic and social development.157.	The Korean problem is a cause of great concern. My delegation has never ceased to assert from this rostrum that the Organization must deal effectively with that problem. After the withdrawal of foreign troops from the entire territory of Korea  the peaceful reunification of the country  without foreign interference  is a matter for the Korean people alone.It is for them  in the full exercise of their sovereignty and independence  to bring about democratically the reunification of the country and to ensure its future. That is why the Organization should beware of sanctioning any acceptance of a separation between the Korean peoples. Rather it should facilitate renewed contacts between North and South Korea with a view to reaching an equitable solution to this most important problem.158.	Finally the drama of Cyprus still warns us of the fragility of peace on our planet. Aims of geopolitical and strategic supremacy in the Mediterranean and the Balkan peninsula have created a new hotbed of tension  which could lead to incalculable consequences if it is not dealt with in time. The solution of the problem of Cyprus will come only from concerted efforts  on a basis of sovereignty and free from all foreign interference  of the two communities inhabiting the island of Cyprus.159.	All sorts of foreign interference mark the four corners of the world  but IndoChina  more than any other region of the globe  has been a permanent source of conflicts and of insecurity. Today  as yesterday  the strengthening of peace and justice is one of the great aims of the United Nations. But everybody is aware that we live in a world of insecurity and injustice. This world which possesses this power of mass destruction; this world of local conflicts  sought and tolerated on behalf of power politics; this world where the most fundamental rights of men are daily flouted; this world of great masses  that have become aware of their destinies in the modern era  but have not become free from hunger and misery; this world  finally  where there is little security because many States have violated the principles solemnly proclaimed in declarations that reverberate around the walls of this house.160.	The sovereign equality of all States  the noninterference in the domestic affairs of other States  the respect for the commitments undertaken in good faith  the peaceful settlement of disputes  the renunciation of the use of force  freedom and self-determination as well as universal social justice are the principles that should guide an international community worthy of our times and of future generations.161.	Unfortunately  reality does not reflect these principles. It is said that peace reigns among the great of this world  that there is detente; but there are devastating conflicts in various parts of the planet. IndoChina  the Middle East  Cyprus and southern Africa are still theaters of internal conflicts  sources of destruction and of misery. Since the last world war there have been 50 local wars  all of them disastrous. The world today is full of contradictions and a series of euphemisms. Thus  total and complete disarmament is no longer mentioned; rather we talk about mutual control of armaments. Peace have taken the name of detente among the great Powers. Hence there will be no ""war"" unless it is an atomic war and unless the superPowers are directly involved.162.	These are the facts that we cannot resign ourselves to. Far from finding an excuse for discouragement  the United Nations should redouble its efforts to become more effective. Universal morality advocates these efforts not only to thwart the nefarious forces of colonialism  racism and imperialism but also to silence weapons and to seek a new economic order which should transcend narrow egotisms and aim at universal social justice.163.	Peace  a thinker has said  does not come by accident; it is created; it is built; it is a constant creation; it can be imagined only as a supreme duty rather than as the fruit of a well meaning order coming from outside. We are duty bound within our means and .our specific responsibility to work for the building of peace and international security. Our Organization cannot expect lasting peace as long as the arms race and the perfecting of increasingly deadly weapons and their introduction into hitherto peaceful regions proceed uncontrollably.164.	The international community cannot believe in peace when here and there in the world there are wars of attrition  struggles for influence  and millions of victims are claimed throughout the world. The international community will not know true peace as long as the unrepentant supporters of colonialism  apartheid and of zionism oppose with bad faith the appeals of this Organization to abide by its recommendations and resolutions.165.	The sixth special session forcefully proved that it is not only wars that violate peace but also social injustice. It is for this reason that we very clearly state that the international community will always be far removed from peace as long as three quarters of mankind possess only the right to live in poverty while a quarter of the inhabitants of the planet hold for themselves in their own consumer society 80 per cent of the wealth of the world.166.	May I take this opportunity to deal with the problem of the present international economic situation. My delegation as well as others have expressed the views of their Governments on the nature of the economic relations between the developed and the developing countries. I do not claim that I am bringing up a new subject  but I think that we should return to these matters more insistently than in the past since any objective observer of the present international situation must acknowledge the fact that there has been no tangible improvement On the contrary  there are signs of deterioration that constantly cause us concern and worry.167.	In almost all the developing countries  economic relations with the developed countries are characterized by a dependence that is far too close. The developing countries are forced to export raw materials and to import manufactured goods. But in this field  injustice and inequality could become the rule and could be systematized to the detriment of those who are weak.168.	For over a century the terms of trade have constantly deteriorated and still do so to the detriment of the poor countries. These countries cannot influence the market laws that are set by the wealthy countries without any consultations with the developing countries. Thus the prices of raw materials follow the inherent factors of the political  economic and financial situation of the industrialized countries.169.	The deficit in the balance of payments further aggravates the already precarious situation of our economies. The poor countries are deprived of a sizable amount of foreign currency upon which they were entitled to rely to cover the cost of imports they require in order to survive  such as capital goods and consumer items. The scarcity of these articles leads to a general increase in price since the local products inevitably follow the movement of inflation.170.	We must also not forget that the reduction of imports has also reduced the revenues of States since in our countries customs duties generally represent the greater part of government revenue. Since the prices received for exports have also followed a downward curve the State is forced to subsidize exports for obvious economic and political reasons. Often this can be done only by reducing or eliminating export dues  which  again  is a drain on the national treasury and a policy from which we at the moment cannot escape.171.	The situation that I have just outlined is serious enough to call on the international community to put an end to itFor  when all is said and done  proof has been given that in the long run the developed countries in turn may also suffer from an overall lack because of the breakdown in the harmony that should exist in international relations.172.	In order to force the wealthy countries to take into account the interests of three quarters of mankind  some countries have already taken drastic measures to control the development and marketing of their own resources on terms which they themselves fix. But this is a decision that must fall to the sovereignty of each State  and my delegation has repeatedly and unreservedly supported this fact. We stress that the States that can today act in this way are not too numerous. It is therefore  more than ever  indispensable that an international understanding be arrived at on terms of trade between the wealthy and the poor countries.173.	My delegation welcomes the conclusions and recommendations of the sixth special session  on raw materials and development. It was  in fact  encouraging for the international community to have recognized that it is urgent that everything possible be done to remedy the present situation by taking the necessary steps to improve the terms of trade for the developing countries by eliminating all maneuvers that might leave our countries in a deficit trade balance situation every year.174.	But to achieve these goals  the international community must insist that the developed countries eschew all action detrimental to the poor countries. It is  therefore  urgent to take drastic measures to abolish the trade barriers with the developing countries. That trade must be carried out at prices that take into account the interests of the exporting countries. The various techniques designed to manipulate the raw materials market in order to force a decrease in prices must be eliminated from international trade practices  which must remain fair  sound and mutually advantageous.175.	As I pointed out here at the sixth special session [2222nd meeting]  for my country the question of world currency exchange is but one aspect of the much greater problem that covers the entire range of international relations  including the particular aspect of cooperation among nations. For years  the idea of international solidarity among the wealthy countries and the developing countries has been gaining ground. All the international conferences that have been held over the past decade have insisted  in vain  on the absolute necessity for the developed countries to lend their assistance to the economic and social development of the poor countries. Those appeals have fallen on deaf ears; and thus disturbing signs have been appearing more and more frequently in the gloom as the situation regarding assistance among nations deteriorates.176.	In fact  since the world energy crisis  bilateral aid has been diminishing. Multilateral aid  which generally draws its resources from investments made by the developed countries  will inevitably follow this trend if the attitude of those countries is not changed. This is why my delegation takes this opportunity to make a solemn appeal to the developed countries  urging them to maintain and to improve the volume and quantity of their aid to the developing countries. In this field  certain developing countries deserve particular attention  above all those which  as a result of the petroleum crisis  have lost considerable amounts in foreign exchange.177.	However  the picture is not entirely gloomy. For the developing countries  it is encouraging to note that international cooperation relations have more and more been assuming new forms. In fact  besides those vertical relationships that have hitherto existed between the rich countries and those less favored  and principally between the former colonial Powers and their ex-colonies  we are witnessing the birth of a new horizontal international cooperation. I mean the cooperation that has been in existence for some years now among the developing countries themselves. These relations already exist in Africa  where efforts at regional integration are ready under way  with varying degrees of success. The friendly and fruitful relations that have been building for some time between the African States and the Arab States constitute a specific example of such solidarity among the developing countries. More often than not it is a question of the type of cooperation that can speedily prove to be mutually advantageous to the partners involved. Arab countries with capital available to them .can channel that capital into productive sectors and thus participate in the development of the African countries  while at the same time being assured of an adequate and reasonable return on their investments of capital.178.	My delegation is gratified at the progress achieved in this field. By their decision to create a development fund  the Arab countries that possess considerable financial means as a result of the petroleum prices have demonstrated to the world that the lofty proclamation of solidarity among the third world nations is not a mere exercise in rhetoric. The important actions they have taken in full exercise of their sovereignty deserve our admiration  for not only do they open up financial possibilities for the less favored countries but they also constitute a real change in international financial policy.179.	Here likewise we have a profound transformation in the conception  on the part of the developing countries  of what they have to do in order to win the war against ignorance and want. In fact  for some years now our countries have realized that the development of the third world will take place first and foremost through the efforts of the parties concerned  and that foreign assistance will only complement our own efforts.180.	This realization on the part of the developing countries constitutes a guarantee to the wealthy countries that th; assistance the latter may grant will not be wasted  for the simple reason that it is regarded by the beneficiary countries as a necessary complement for continued economic  social and cultural development of their populations  who mu be the first to benefit from assistance to development. For it is to my delegation an obvious fact that man must be the focal point of concern in any economic policy or plan /or cooperation.181.	Since I have raised the problem of the economic  social and cultural development of our peoples  I should also like to set forth briefly the point of view of my delegation concerning the question of population growth  which is still a very timely subject. This obviously involves a complex problem that concerns individuals as much as States and each country as well as the international community as a whole; and it is precisely because we are dealing here with a complex problem that the views expressed and the solutions proposed with regard to the question of population growth are far from receiving unanimous approval. Some utter cries of alarm; in a few years there will be too many human beings on the earth and there will not be enough to feed them. For others  more optimistic  the as yet unexploited potential of the earth will be sufficient  and the real problem is to mobilize all the manpower and all the technology  so that every human being  thanks to his own labor and assisted by international aid  will have every opportunity to lead a new and better life.182.	My delegation is of the view that  whatever the opposing positions may be  this question  in the last analysis  cannot be isolated from the general political context. The international community as a whole is involved. It is for this reason that my delegation was highly gratified at the initiative taken by the United Nations in convening the World Population Conference. We are very pleased that the third world succeeded in making itself heard there and was able to refute certain theories that all too often reflected only the selfishness of certain poorly disguised interests. For have we not  as a matter of fact  often heard it said that the developing countries should  at all cost  slow down the growth of their populations if they wish to develop? Certain theoreticians have gone even further than that and have subjected foreign assistance to the conditions of this twentieth century Malthusian policy. But in Bucharest the bell tolled with a different sound. The third world wanted to see birth control matched by a simultaneous limitation on the waste that goes on in the industrialized countries; in other words  they want to see a parallel reduction in both fecundity and inequality.183.	My delegation is not unaware of truth of the profound realities and difficult problems created by the population explosion. On the contrary  Rwanda is all the more aware of those problems in that we are confronted with them. In fact  though a small country  we must feed a population of an average density of more than 150 inhabitants per square kilometer. In certain regions our population density reaches 200 or 300 inhabitants per square kilometer. And may 1 add that the annual rate of natural increase stands at about 3 per cent  while at the same time our arable land is being exhausted day by day and our limited means do not permit us for the time being to modernize our agriculture and live stock raising so as to increase their yield.184.	Yet we believe that birth control  or  more generally  the slowing down of population growth cannot itself be set up as a valid policy. On the contrary  we are convinced that instead of being a goal  population policy must be considered as only one instrument among many used by a State to achieve its fundamental purposes  which must be primarily social and economic progress and the ""welfare of its inhabitants. For after all  the latest discoveries of the scientists demonstrate that the present total resources of our planet could feed more than 30 000 million human beings. For this reason we agree with those who say that the target in the field of population should be that of improving the standards and qualities of each individual's existence  bearing in mind  on the one hand  the diversity of conditions in the different parts of the world  and  on the other  the sovereign right of each country to determine its own population policies.185.	My delegation also feels that we should no longer try to impose a population policy that would be valid for the entire world. That is thinly disguised imperialism. We can agree to the United Nations coordinating national policies  but it must do so in absolute respect for the sovereignty of each State as also in respect for the right of each family to have the children it wants.186.	As the French Minister of Labor and Population  Mr. Michel Durafour  stated:""A population policy must be integrated into the general development policy that is a prerequisite for the prosperity of mankind. In this perspective  the developed countries must give their technical and financial assistance to the underdeveloped countries that request it.""187.	That statement coming from the representative of an industrialized country is highly encouraging. We hope that the other developed countries will adopt the same view and  above all  will implement it in the interest of the international community as a whole.188.	My delegation once again makes a solemn appeal to all the wealthy countries not to express international solidarity merely by declarations of good intent that are not followed up by concrete acts. We still see the insufficiency of official development assistance. That assistance not only falls short of the needs of the third world and of what the industrialized nations can afford but it is only half of the target set by the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade. That target was to bring official development assistance up to 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries. But  unfortunately  we note today that official aid has not passed the 0.35 per cent of the gross national product of all those countries.189.	In speaking of this economic selfishness  we may recall another matter that is also of current interest  namely  the law of the sea. This is surely a field in which international understanding and cooperation should replace the traditional egotism of nations.190.	It is regrettable that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea that was just held at Caracas concluded without arriving at very positive results. On the contrary  the positions of the wealthy countries and those of the poor countries were so opposite that we might even say that the Conference was a failure.191.	My country considers it normal that a coastal State should claim the right to a much larger maritime economic zone than the area that is at present held to constitute territorial waters.192.	As regards the utilization of the sea  one principle has long prevailed  namely  the freedom of the high seas. To be sure  that principle corresponded with the colonial and naval interests of the great Powers. It was a satisfying basis for world order at a time when oceans were only used for navigation and fishing and in a manner that was relatively harmless for the marine environment. But that principle has already begun to be challenged. The development of technology has made possible a far greater and more intensive exploitation of the oceans. Thanks to modern technology  very possibly the resources of the ocean floor beyond the limits of national jurisdiction can soon be exploited on an industrial and commercial scale.193.	It is to be feared that these resources will only profit a small number of countries that possess the advanced technical means required for large scale exploitation of this common wealth. In this field again  economic selfishness on the part of the developed countries may become widespread to the detriment of the countries of the third world  if we do not elaborate a new regime that will take into account the needs of mankind in general and of the developing countries in particular.194.	A hard task awaits the codifiers of the new law of the sea  namely  to reconcile the particularly wide divergences of interest between States. In fact  the great Powers wish to maintain as wide a zone as possible  free from any restriction. On the other hand  the coastal States would like to monopolize the exploitation of the resources of the waters adjacent to their territories. It is therefore imperative that international law should succeed in taking account of the interests of both sides in order to ensure better worldwide cooperation.195.	But there is another category of countries that follows questions concerning the law of the sea with an interest that is all the greater since they do not have a natural access to the sea the landlocked countries. My delegation asserts that  in order to survive  the landlocked countries must have free access to the sea and freedom of transit across the coastal States. And within the framework of international cooperation  they should also be able to take advantage of the harbor facilities and related services of the coastal States.196.	We note that at present all countries seek to join or have already joined wide regional or international groups. Cooperation in this field therefore is possible. There are numerous examples all over the world to prove it. We all know how the landlocked countries of Europe have been able easily to gain access to the sea and thus develop their own maritime trade thanks to the understanding of their neighbors. All these examples prove that cooperation among the landlocked and coastal States is possible and that it can be consonant with respect for the interests of both sides. The new law of the sea will thus be founded on actual practice and will become a charter respected by everyone.197.	It is imperative for all countries  including the landlocked countries  to be able to benefit from the wealth contained in the oceans. An equitable distribution must be carried out in the interests of the international community as a whole in order to ensure a balanced development which is an absolute condition for lasting peace among nations.196. We trust that all these appeals will be heeded and thus by combining all their efforts men will cooperate from now on in the effective creation of a world of justice  progress  understanding and peace. A world where with the prospect of a new world order  all men of all continents and of all races will at long last be able to enjoy freedom  equality and dignity."
"105",6031,"SAU",29,1974,"Mr. President  it is a pleasure to congratulate your excellency on your unanimous election as President of this session which  in itself  is a sign of respect for the continent you hail from  which contributed greatly to the field of learning. Please allow me to congratulate you personally on this great confidence  which you rightly deserve  since I have /or many years known your personal qualities and abilities which qualified you and our beloved sister country  Algeria  to obtain the highest level of international recognition. I am sure that under your wise leadership we will bring the work of this session to a successful conclusion.287.	I should also like to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor for the untiring efforts which were crowned with success during an eventful year.288.	I should like to sincerely thank our Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his continuous efforts for the observance of the principles of the United Nations.289.	I should like on this occasion and from this rostrum to welcome the new Members which have joined the family of nations of this Organization thus taking their natural place among us. We are sure they will contribute their share to implement the noble purposes which all members of the international community endeavor to achieve. It is our hope that before long all other countries which have not yet attained their full right to freedom and sovereignty will also be able to participate with us in the work of this Organization.290.	As we review the events that have occurred in the past and still confront us during this session  I find myself much more optimistic in believing that the majority of Member States which co-operate with one another in upholding the Charter will continue in their effort to carry out their obligations in fulfilling their responsibilities and in meeting the aspiration of peoples and countries of the world. Those are the obligations enshrined in the Charter.291.	As you know  Saudi Arabia was a founding Member of this Organization  and His Majesty King Faisal Ibn Abdul Aziz was amongst those who played a praiseworthy role in giving full support to this Organization and to its noble principles of peace  hoping thereby to raise the standard of moral values of postwar society in conformity with those prescribed in monotheistic religions and those spiritual values which are vital to the promotion of co-operation in a better world civilization.292.	Despite the fact that we have been disappointed on more than one occasion when the principles of the United Nations were violated  it has not in any way diminished our faith that the truth will eventually prevail and justice will triumph. I should  therefore  like to express the hope of His Majesty's Government  while we examine our agenda containing various very important items relating to world peace and security  that we might be able to deal with these matters in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter so that oppressed people will be able to achieve their political  economic and social freedom  and to curb the aggression of those who have not heeded United Nations resolutions and have consistently refused to recognize the right of peoples to live in their own homeland peacefully and in security.293.	Since 1948  people in our region have been living in the shadow of constant unrest and upheaval due to the violations of the Charter by the aggressor and his non-compliance with various United Nations resolutions. On many occasions our region has been subjected to military incursions of the racist Zionists with the result that Arab Palestine was occupied by those alien forces. As if this were not enough  the Zionists embarked upon an expansion by occupying territories belonging to neighboring Arab States in total violation of the principles of international law  which prohibit the acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force  challenging thereby the authority of the United Nations and disregarding its various resolutions.294.	At this stage  I do not wish to go into all the details of the Palestine problem  at the heart of which lies the question of Jerusalem and the rights of the Palestinians made homeless and stateless by the Zionists. These Palestinians have been living nurturing the hope that they would be able to return to their homeland to exercise their right to self-determination. There have been many victims of this occupation.295.	However  I should like to mention here the unremitting efforts exerted by Arabs  coupled with those of well-intentioned friendly countries  to find a solution and to co-operate with friendly States in their search for a solution to the Palestinian question which would ultimately bring peace in the region based on equity  justice and self-determination in our region. The position of Saudi Arabia on this question has  on many occasions  been made known from this rostrum.2%. We continue to proclaim it. In other words  there should be a total Israeli withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied as a result of repeated Israeli aggression. Arab Jerusalem should be returned to its rightful Arab inhabitants since this Holy City is sacred to hundreds of millions of Arabs and non-Arabs whether they be Moslem or Christian. We must also make it abundantly clear that the Palestinian people should exercise their right to self-determination.297.	The position of Saudi Arabia is in conformity with that of other Arab and Moslem countries  as expressed at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers  from 5 to 9 September 1973  and also at the Islamic Summit Conference in Lahore in 1974.298.	The non-aligned countries and the countries of the third world  as well as the OAU  have made their position clear by condemning Israeli aggression and have called upon the aggressor to withdraw from all the occupied territories. The large majority of countries in the world have taken a stand on this question. Some even went to the extent of warning Israel to abandon its aggression.299.	Israel persisted in defying the will of the inter-national community and the resolutions of the United Nations  and has thus become a symbol of aggression  like those remaining regimes which base their policies on racial discrimination  such as South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. It is therefore not surprising that Israel has found itself isolated from the international community blinded  as it were  to the impact which its aggressive acts has had in arousing the conscience of mankind. We believe that if total withdrawal from all Arab territories is not carried out  it will be extremely difficult to establish peace in the Middle East. That is the kind of peace which all regard as being essential for the broader peace and security in the world.300.	We also hope that Spain will adopt the Arab position as regards the situation of occidental Sahara  to consolidate the good relations which exist between Arabs and Spain. We abide by these relations and we hope that they will be strengthened as far as possible.301.	The world is in the midst of severe trials and tribulations. The policy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia may be summed up as follows.302.	First  Saudi Arabia  as a member of the inter-national community  is deeply conscious of all its responsibilities to that community. It has aided some countries  and will contribute to the development bank funds; it has also granted contributions to IMF and to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  so that they may be able to finance development projects in developing countries. I have informed the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  of this. I should also like to state on behalf of His Majesty King Faisal and his Government that we shall also be making a grant of $30 million to the emergency fund. In this connexion  I attended the meeting last Friday on the invitation of the Secretary-General  for which I should like to thank him.303.	Secondly  aware of its share of these responsibilities to the international community  Saudi Arabia hopes that all the countries of the world will appreciate its position and not make oil-producing countries a target for unjustified criticism and covert threats.304.	Thirdly  the position of Saudi Arabia as regards the price of oil is well known by all. While adopting this position  Saudi Arabia hopes that the big Powers and industrial and non-industrial countries alike will do their utmost to put an end to the rampant inflation and control the spiraling prices of finished products  raw materials and foodstuffs  so that the developing countries are not adversely affected.305.	This is not the time to go into the other items listed on our agenda  which we will deal with when they are discussed in the General Assembly and its main Committees."
"106",6067,"SDN",29,1974,"Mr. President  all of us assembled here have worked  negotiated or chatted with you at one time or another. We know that you are the outcome of prowess in war and peace in a country which is almost a latter-day Sparta. Algeria made history and made men. Guided and inspired by the genius of your people  you have cultivated over the years a talent for getting over the many hurdles you had to leap while operating at home in Algeria  in the OAU  in the League of Arab States  in the group of non-aligned States  and  indeed  in the councils of the Organization. What more could we ask of one who will preside over a session fraught with hope and risk  a session gathering together world leaders  bewildered by an era most certainly in the grip of a value-shift.179.	This is not just another session. Several memorable dates  many political episodes  and numerous battles have been called epoch-making or turning- points in history. A case in point is 1848  which was marked by the discovery of internal combustion  and 1815  which was marked by Waterloo  The mid-1970s will be looked upon as one such period. The decade between now and 1985 is bound to be a watershed in the long march of man  a decade of shifts and changes: shifts in the centers of economic power; changes in the chemistry of international politics -the crumbling of old colonial empires and the retraction of imperial outposts. For this reason it will be the decade in which the gravest decisions man has ever been required to make will be made. Man must make these decisions as a unit and not as individual centers for  after all  one center's decision ultimately affects all. And it is here that many of those decisions will be initiated or formulated. The Assembly is the only instrument  and with all its inadequacies the United Nations is our anchor.180.	The gravest of all these decisions is this: will the rich and the poor work out the new economic order we decided upon last spring? Some of us are frustrated indeed  alarmed because very little has been done to further those proposals. There is a redeeming feature  however. The many sicknesses plaguing the world have been noted and pointed out by a world press awakened to responsibility. There was a conscious effort by intelligent  educated young men who have dared hunger and disease  in camps and tents  in drought-stricken regions of Africa  exposing the cynicism of some and showing the world what it is like to live in despair. Thanks to them we have had an abundance of books  broadcasts  brochures  seminars  symposia and conferences. The world is better informed and no longer blind to the need for proceeding with the decisions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly. But it remains for this Assembly to take stock of these ideas. Leaders of eminence are now in the thick of the battle to save a world adrift  and adrift it is. Let us help them.181.	The facts and figures are there. I realize that our heads are buzzing with figures and that they need not be disturbed further. A few figures  however  must be urgently considered to indicate the magnitude of the problem we face.182.	The ILO tells us that in 1970 2 542 million persons lived in the developing world  while 1 090 million lived in the industrialized world. In less than 30 years from now  twice as much food  water  power and jobs will be needed if present standards are to be kept. By then the labor force in the world will have increased by 30 per cent. There will be 457 million newcomers between now and 1985. The share of the rich countries from this influx will be a mere 10 per cent; that of the poor is staggering: 289 million new hands in Asia  55 million in Africa  and 42 million in Latin America. This is the magnitude of the crisis that is shaking the world  and whose greatest impact is falling on the hard core of the developing countries.183.	The deliberations of the sixth special session of the General Assembly last April have identified the new opportunities as well as the new dangers that surround the world economy. And though the outcome was not entirely satisfactory  it is none the less conducive to optimism. If nothing else  we have examined and brought to a fruitful end ways and means of employing international machinery for bringing about a rapid transformation of the world economic system so that economic domination would yield to economic co-operation and confrontation in matters of trade  finance and technology would yield to negotiation and conciliation.184.	A much greater sense of interdependence has emerged. A healthy sign of balanced progress is already taking shape. Yet a range of adverse factors still persists. Negative symptoms tend to overshadow our efforts to create an atmosphere of goodwill and confidence  and many they are. To mention only a few: there are inadequacies in the flow of finance that hamper the emergence of a mutually advantageous international division of labor; rigidities in trade patterns that generate instability in currency markets; inadequacy in the rate of growth in the export earnings of the developing nations that impair their capacity to service accumulated debts.185.	Obviously  international adjustment will be impeded and rendered more costly so long as the policies pursued by some of us are mutually inconsistent. For a properly functioning adjustment process  we require a minimum of conflict among national and international objectives. We require a high degree of awareness of the notion of economic solidarity. More than that  we require in this decade of change and shifts a will to accept the idea of change itself -change of roles and change of rights and duties. That is a necessary prerequisite for mutual confidence.186.	Statements we have been hearing of late reveal a lack of will to accept change and a tendency to fly in the face of reality. The oil crisis hit everybody bang in the face. It exploded old myths. But instead of facing the new reality with objectivity and reason we decided to obliterate the picture. We have practically been told that it was all milk and honey till the oil crisis dominated the scene. Nothing is further from the truth.<m187.	The operation of inflationary trends in the Western economy started long before the increase in oil prices. For years the rich industrial countries  particularly the erstwhile colonial Powers  have been balancing their budgets at home while exporting inflation to others  building welfare societies at home while perpetuating pauperism elsewhere  engaging in willful waste at home while prolonging woeful want in the poor countries of the world. And to the pleas of those who suffered most  there was lip service some-times and cold economic justification often- if only to make the soul of John Meynard Keynes rest in peace.188.	The world economic system is dislocated today because the rules of the game have changed. The new facts are to be understood. Some of us cannot go on living with colonial and neo-colonial hangovers. When Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the devaluation bill  the first in the United States  his Director of the Budget cried  ""This is the end of Western civilization"". That was in 1935. Since that date many things have happened. The mighty economic horse on which some of us had been riding is no longer that mighty. Nor do its riders want to agree to dismount with grace. The fireworks we have been seeing in the past few weeks in Detroit and Washington  and indeed in the Assembly  are but evidence of that attitude in the face of those statements one cannot be asking  are we honestly ready to accept the new economic realities of the day  or do we wish instead  as I said  to fly in the face of those realities through willful distortion? Do we really mean to engage in a sincere dialogu or do we still think that we can change the world through Olympian declarations and veiled threats? Do we seriously wish to undertake an objective appraisal of the situation  or do we seek an alibi in the guise of such an appraisal?189.	The facts of the situation are not what those statements and declarations purported them to be. The record of the last two decades is a record of frustrated hopes and broken promises: the inconclusive first  second and third sessions of UNCTAD; the unaccomplished target of 1 per cent of the gross national product in aid to development; the un-replenished funds of the International Development Association; the empty coffers of UNDP; and the empty silos of the World Food Program. The millions of dear souls that we lost in the Niger  in Ethiopia and in Bihar could have been saved if the ""haves"" had been more responsive- and  indeed  more responsible.190.	We understand that those established rich countries have their problems. We understand the impediments in the way of a change of heart and attitude. One of the most stubborn impediments and we have said this time and time again -is the multi-national corporation  the major culprit in the world economic crisis. That is not wild talk  nor is it un-substantiated accusation. By the end of 1971  $268 000 million of short-term liquid assets were held by private institutions on the international financial scene. These institutions were mainly American banks and multinational corporations. That sum represented more than twice the total of all the international reserves held by all the central banks and international monetary institutions in the world at that date. Those huge sums are called legitimate profits. To us in the third world they are unearned increments. One cannot help but feel sorry for the many Governments of the rich  tossed hither and thither by those who sustain them or mislead them: multinational corporations and groups of producers and consumers. Just think of the way in which Governments have been exposed by an intelligent world press over the past few years. More disquieting still is the way ideals and codes of behavior that we conceived here have been mocked or dismissed out of hand as unrealistic fantasies of radicals. The new voices and forces will eventually prevail  as they must  as they have always done in the darker times of the past. But here again we have to move fast  for the world cannot wait any longer for the soldiers of justice and sanity to conquer the iron gates of greed and for the advocates of a return to codes of morality in public and international affairs to find their way.191.	The crisis cannot be solved by mutual recrimination nor by the apportionment of blame. We know that. The solution requires reconciling ourselves to the new realities; it requires the establishment of a modicum of mutual confidence between the rich and the poor; it requires our joining hands in a concordant effort to create a better world. And to that end  again we should move fast. The Assembly should move fast. The rich industrialized countries should move fast. The oil-producing countries should move fast. We all have a stake in acting with alacrity. The Secretary- General rose to the occasion and created the machinery to convert the ideas expressed then into action  both for aid and for trade. How much help that machinery received from those who hold the keys of the kingdom conceived by us all I would hot like to say.192.	As I speak here  25 million poor are facing death in Africa alone. For them it is either now or never. And  equally foreboding  is it not likely that the poor of the world will rise in revolt and ruin whatever resources they happen to possess in their lands? Are these resources not geared to benefit others under their very noses? And in the same vein  why preclude another sinister possibility? Did not some catastrophe- bound minds interpret the sixth special session as a ganging up by the poor against the rich? Did not some ""superior minds""  in Washington primarily  plan counter-offensives? I assure you that there are rumblings among the not-so-very-poor. Some leading economists are asking questions that should jolt the established rich into action. One repeatedly hears of the inability of the industrialized rich to curb inflation or manage the vagaries of currency. The suggestion is to establish the Arab dinar as a new economic basis. The idea is not to dislocate money matters further but to earn money that can be managed. Other moneys are managed by others. If that is not ganging up  what is it? And who is to blame for the fissure in the world community?193.	As I said earlier  there are few signs of awareness of some aspects of the problem. The World Food Conference to be held in Rome is certainly a sign in that direction. Many men and women are beginning to awaken to the perils ahead. The Sudan pledges here and now its support for the Conference. A large team of our experts on meat  grain  fish and related resources has for some time now been preparing itself assiduously for that Conference. We feel that our contribution must reflect both our potential and our will- for our sake  and the world's sake. In co-operation with some of our many friends  we have taken a few steps  but we realize that the road is long and that the more co-operation we get the more quickly we can help.194.	What we know of population growth and food shortage leaves us little time to maintain even the miserable standards of today. As I said from this rostrum last spring at the sixth special session [2219th meeting]  the world food crisis is an artificial one. Perhaps the Sudan is one of the most striking examples to prove this. Its enormous untapped potential can substantially contribute to the alleviation of the world shortage if the necessary requirements are met. The Sudan is endowed with an abundance of water and 50 million hectares of land suitable for agricultural and livestock production. By contrast the population is only 18 million. The conditions for much faster agricultural development are inherent in this endowment of ample agricultural land free from the pressures of population. A necessary condition for harnessing this potential is the availability of adequate and concessionary financial and technological aid and particularly the intensification of investment in the agricultural sector.195.	We are discussing development and conditions for creating a better world economic order. But development and progress are not isolated concepts. We need peace and tranquility to develop and to progress. Let us now ponder a little the conditions required to make effective the ever-increasing voice of sense and sensibility -the voice calling for peace  I mean. Every time we think one hot area of the world has cooled off  or is on the point of doing so  another area explodes. This has been the story of peace ever since that war to end wars ended in Versailles  sowing in its Peace Conference the seeds of wars to come.196.	An instance of this phenomenon is the predicament of Cyprus and the Middle East. Were the events that occurred in Cyprus really necessary  while the latter is trudging along a weary route to peace? I am not thinking of the few hundreds that descended on the island like thieves in the night. They could not have been anything but instruments of a design bigger than the biggest of them. I am not thinking of the other party  which went in on behalf of its kith and kin. It did that in a desperate effort to settle old scores. I am thinking of neither. I am thinking of the apparent waywardness of events. The great Powers sat watching the outcome  and the United Nations  hamstrung by obsolete limitations of the Charter  could neither foresee the oncoming gale  nor do much about it when it was on. This is what I call the waywardness of events. Nobody seems to be in control.197.	For what it is worth  the Sudan would like to be explicit on the subject of Cyprus. First  the Cyprus question should be isolated from other entanglements. Land and sea frontiers  disputed areas and other problems have to wait  I hope not long  for a fair solution of the current crisis. A fair solution in out view would put the island on its feet; there could be minor rectifications  of course  but there must be a return to the sensitive balance so well guarded by Archbishop Makarios and his Turkish colleagues in the administration that ought to be restored even in its personnel  if that is acceptable to the Cypriots. One hopes it will be. The Cypriots will be giving a lesson to the world: force cannot be allowed as a means of making and breaking Governments.198.	It is a lesson relevant in the area. Israel  built and maintained by fire and sword  has thrown the area into a cauldron that often blazes and simmers all the time  working itself up to an explosion. I am afraid such a situation is prevalent in the area at the moment. The talk of war is everywhere  the smell of war is everywhere  and again the world is merely watching. Our indefatigable Secretary-General has been in and out of the area several times after the initial talks in Geneva but his clarion calls to hurry up to Geneva are drowned by the din and clash of arms pouring into the area and the bellicose pronouncements polluting the climate of peace that was worked out by protracted agony.199.	When I spoke here at the twenty-eighth session [2142nd meeting]  I saw a glimmer of hope in the younger men at the helm in Israel  who were mostly born in Palestine  and who have their hearts in the right place regarding the Arabs. But alas! These young men must be under some constraint. The talk is the same. It has not yet dawned on them that there is no getting away from a Palestinian State  that the world including the United States of America is getting weary of a seemingly endless wrangle. The freedom fighters  in and outside Israel  have won the right to speak on behalf of all Palestinians. This right was not granted them; they earned their way to it by sweat  and shall do the same as regards Geneva.200.	The angry blasting of southern Lebanon and the carrying on with creating facts in Jerusalem and Sharm-el-Sheikh cannot undo what the sequence of events since 1967  culminating in the October war  has done. Like the older persons that gathered in Israel from the four corners of the earth  the younger ones count on the supposed rift between the Arabs. One day it is Sadat versus Arafat  another day it is Arafat and Habash  a third day it is Hussein and the fedayeen. It is true that points of view are not identical; how could they be in a situation that has been building up over generations? What is true and incontestable is that the goal is one: to retrieve their home. There is no quarrel over matters of principle; there is dialog about matters of detail. If the Israeli illusion were right  Palestinian leaders would not have been here among us. Palestinians are no longer an appendage to a crisis. They are the nub of that crisis. And so said the world. They are here to tell their tale of woe and valor. They are nobody's wards now.201.	The role of the super-Powers is greater than that of any of us. And here is where detente comes in. If detente means peace for all  and not peace among the mighty  there is need for quick action in the Middle East. The traffic between Moscow and the Arab capitals is heavy; so is the traffic between those capitals and Washington. Nobody except the participants knows what goes on. The little that percolates to the press  however  leads one to feel that a cold war of sorts is now on. One often is led to think that detente seems to do with short-term trading of grain for vodka. How else shall we explain the fivefold increase in United States aid to Israel after the October war  at a time when all Israel's losses in that war had been replaced. The jittery atmosphere pervading the area is justified. The big Powers that take it upon themselves to handle the problem by themselves have to prove that they are doing it. Perhaps they are  but how do we know? What we know for certain is not reassuring. Israel's defense expenditure accounts for twice as much as its gross national product a year ago. Firebrand generals  who retired or were retired after the war  are back in the service. The fiscal aid in the coming year will rise from $50 million to $250 million. The Jewish lobby is fuming and thundering -indeed  it is challenging) a Secretary of State the like of whom the United States has rarely had  a man who fits the times. The head of the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee could not have been more arrogant when he threatened: . . I am not going to sound the fire bell yet  but when I do you will hear it"". One wonders whether Americans have not grown weary of this kind of talk and behavior. It is not prudent to say that the American citizen is taken too much for granted by such organizations and institutions  but it is too obvious a fact not to face up to.202.	This session must help. What is to be done is not that complicated. First  let us impress on Israel that it must refrain from acts likely to lead to another war. We have had four major ones and several minor ones. None of them brought the much cherished security to Israel. Geneva  if we ever get there  might do it. Secondly  let us urge the permanent members of the Security Council not to abdicate their right to know and help to the extent they see fit. They have a responsibility  and they have a stake.203.	Another area of the world should teach Israel a lesson. Salazar and' Caetano lived ancient fantasies similar to those of Israel  but five centuries after their beginning  these fantasies- turned to ashes. At the OAU  the Sudan had occasion to say many kind words about the new men in Portugal battling against impossible odds. We warned of settlers in Portuguese territories going the way of Ian Smith and his friends. J wish to maintain the sentiments we expressed in Mogadishu. We have all the more reason to do so because of our admiration for those who had the courage to subdue the insurgents instantly by force of arms. The new men have earned our respect  and Africa hopes nothing will interfere with their plans and endeavors. We are not ashamed to say that the hand held out by Portugal must be taken with sincerity. The Sudan sees more than the proffering of a hand in what has already been achieved. Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau have regained their independence  and the infighting in Angola cannot go on much longer. The way things are shaping up  a powerful State composed of Mozambique  Zambia and Angola might emerge in the years to come and deliver areas around them from an alien rule rejected by the majority of mankind.204.	What is happening in southern Africa today is bestial; it is provocative; it is an ever-present incitement to Africa. As a philosophy  it is a challenge to the very basis of African independence. The world did not fail to express its detestation. But in the face of global reprobation there was only crass defiance by South Africa and Rhodesia. South Africa had its reasons; Rhodesia had its reasons.205.	The United Nations sought to induce change through measures provided for in the Charter: sanctions. But the effectiveness of those measures was diluted  and the act itself was reduced to a mere political gesture. Sanctions are conceived to be forged into a viable instrument of collective action short of force. But that action was frustrated; it is frustrated. And who is to blame? The very monitors of international order  the very champions of human rights. Recent events in southern Africa are leading Africans to ask a number of questions which bear upon the formulation of western countries' policies towards southern Africa: the extension of their defense network to protect what they have come to perceive as their global system of interests and the belief that they have political  economic and strategic interests in the southern African subcontinent which should be defended at any cost. These now appears to be a clear commitment by NATO planners to work for the military defense of the southern African region. That crucial step carries NATO towards a de facto military alliance with the white settler regimes in southern Africa.206.	We do not question any country's right to perceive its own interests in its own light. What we ask those countries  however  is if it is in their interest to isolate themselves on the side of anachronistic regimes. Are they not really wearing blinkers as they look at realities in southern Africa? Are they not missing the whole lesson of 25 April in Portugal? The lessons of the last two decades go to prove that no single country or bloc of countries has mastery over historical changes. Those who thought otherwise have been proven wrong in Algeria; they have been proven wrong in Viet Nam; they have been proven wrong in Mozambique. And they will be proven wrong in southern Africa  and no less so in the northern part of the continent  where the question of so-called Spanish Sahara still awaits resolution in a manner consistent with the interests of the peoples of the region as well as with the provisions of the United Nations Chatter and the successive resolutions on decolonization.207.	The Powers with special privileges in the Security Council must realize that there is a responsibility correlated to that privilege. The cynicism of Paris  the callousness of Washington and the vacillations of London are deplored by the whole of Africa  and they are deplored because of their short-sightedness.208.	In an over-all assessment of global security we must guard against making partial references to realities with which the international community must come to grips in order to ensure better prospects of a strengthened world order. Attention given to one set of facts which reflect incipient conflict must not mean relative neglect of another set of facts with a similar conflict potential. In a world made more precarious by the existence of nuclear weapons  it is wise to stress the need for international peace  the need for global peace. That need is certainly more apparent to those who have much to keep than it is to those who have little to lose. Destitute Africans in the shanty towns of Johannesburg or Bulawayo feel themselves somewhat closer to death because of the deprivation and the cruelty of the white settlers' regimes  rather than because of nuclear conflagration. What we have in southern Africa today is despair so deep among Africans  and resentment so passionate against racial oppression  that normal fears are ceasing to exercise their expected restraint on governments and people alike. Mr. Kissinger has told us that if the underlying causes of conflict are permitted to fester unattended until the parties believe that their only recourse is war  then we cannot guarantee that it will not explode beyond control [2238th meeting  para. 46].209.	The colonial and racial war will continue in that part of the world  however many new intimidating weapons and alliances the settlers' regimes acquire. The question confronting us  therefore  is whether we will permit the spread of violence until the whites and blacks  the dominant and the dominated  are engulfed in mutual annihilation.210.	Those are the challenges of the coming decade  the decade of shifts and changes. To face those challenges we need a contrivance of human wisdom rather than insane reactions arising from comfortless frustration. We need to accept with grace the reality of change. Facts do not cease to exist because we decide to ignore them. We need to recognize that the wealth of the world is big enough for everybody. The world will not endure half rich and half poor. We need to persuade our neo-Romans that vaulting greed will end by overlapping itself to fall on the other side.211.	We need to prove Nietzsche wrong. To him  ""The world is beautiful but has a disease called man""."
"107",6113,"SEN",29,1974,"Mr. President  I particularly welcome this opportunity of associating myself with the speakers who preceded me to this rostrum to extend our congratulations and express our satisfaction on seeing you preside over the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. I do this all the more willingly since you are the worthy representative of a country whose militant faith in defending the causes of the third world deserves to be mentioned as an example. Knowing your great ability and your sense of duty  I have no doubt as to the success of this session.74.	I also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Renites  of Ecuador  who had the signal honor of presiding over two sessions of our Assembly.75.	I must not forget to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  most sincerely for all the efforts he has made and the success he has achieved for our Organization in his struggle to bring about a world based on peace and justice.76.	I would also wish to avail myself of this memorable occasion to welcome  on behalf of the Government and the people of Senegal  the admission to the United Nations of the sister Republic of Guinea-Bissau  the homeland of the late lamented Amilcar Cabral  to whom even today we pay a moving tribute for his sacrifice in the cause of African independence and freedom. I rejoice at the admission of Guinea-Bissau all the more as Senegal has the honor of being one of the African countries which most assisted that sister State in its long and glorious struggle against Portuguese colonialism.77.	I am also pleased to welcome the admission to this Assembly of the  courageous People's Republic of Bangladesh  which has again been sorely tried by natural calamities  and Grenada  whose independence puts an end to 320 years of colonial rule.78.	Allow me  at the outset  to express the very high consideration in which my country holds the United Nations. The Organization is  indeed  the bulwark of the small countries  enabling them to become aware of their full and complete existence on an equal footing with the great Powers. It endeavors to be the conscience of the world and  as such  to prevail on all large and small by the standards which it defines. My country will do everything it can to help it.79.	However  the Organization  which is in the process of attaining its profound goal  is fa/ from having recorded only successes  particularly m all the major questions which concern us. In this connexion my delegation is bound to note that at the opening of the twenty-ninth session major problems  which are among those which condition our very existence  particularly those relating to international peace and security  disarmament and development  remain without solution  even though in the past year some progress has been registered. 80.	but can one reasonably speak of solutions when the arms race continues ceaselessly? Indeed  the military expenditures of the great Powers  far from decreasing  rose by almost 50 per cent  from $200 000 million to $300 000 million in the course of a single year. This is ironic when one considers the recommendation of the General Assembly requesting the permanent members of the Security Council to reduce their military budgets by 10 per cent and to use part of the resources thus saved to provide assistance to developing countries [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)]. This being so  how can one not bitterly deplore the attitude of the atomic Powers  which continue to strengthen their military arsenals and to carry out nuclear tests in the atmosphere and underground  thus causing the disappearance from our dreams of the idea of a peaceful world?81.	Senegal of course welcomes the recent agreements signed between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of strategic weapons. Moreover  my Government  which condemns the continuation of nuclear tests  welcomes the accession of the People's Republic of China and France to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco)  which prohibits nuclear tests in Latin America and the Antilles.82.	However  in order for these positive acts geared towards peace to be really significant  they must be copied by all States which are concerned with inter-national peace and security. Similarly  the application of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] must also be marked by a condemnation of any militarization of that ocean. The great Powers  the coastal States  the land-locked countries and the other users of the Indian Ocean must enter into consultations in order to achieve the objectives of the Declaration.83.	The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe now meeting in Geneva  should lead to the convening of a world disarmament conference  which my Government earnestly desires.84.	In such a context  it is not surprising that many flash-points of tension exist where war goes on or may break out at any moment.85.	In Viet Nam  where my country has recognized the Regional Revolutionary Government of South Viet in order to promote the process of peace which was started by the Paris agreements  it is our wish that the United Nations intervene strongly to ensure strict compliance with the provisions of these agreements  particularly by the Saigon administration  whose aggressive attitude is based on I know not what encouragement.86.	As for Cambodia  my Government is more than ever convinced that peace depends solely on a return to the legitimacy represented by the Royal Government of National Union  which has already been recognized by more than 60 Member States of the Organization. In this connexion  my delegation particularly welcomes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the item entitled ""Restoration of the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations"" [item 25].87.	As regards Cyprus  my delegation expresses the inalienable rights of the people and the Government legitimately represented in the person of Archbishop Makarios and voices its constant concern for maintaining the integrity of the island  subject  of course  to proper account being taken of the interest of all the communities on the island.88.	Similarly  in Korea the United Nations should create conditions conducive to acceleration of the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. My Government  by maintaining diplomatic relations with the Governments of Pyongyang and Seoul  hopes to contribute to the reunification of Korea.89.	When one examines the burning problem of the Middle East  there are grounds for believing that the conditions for a lasting peace in that region can result only from the dialog which might begin at the Peace Conference on the Middle East in Geneva. The disengagement agreements between Egypt and Israel on the Sinai and between Israel and Syria on the Golan Heights constitute important progress in that direction. We hope that the parties concerned will agree to implement strictly the relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which provide for the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied Arab territories and for the settlement of the Palestinian problem  as well as commitments that would give each State the right to live in peace within secure and recognized frontiers.90.	My Government wholly subscribes to these principles because such an attitude will undoubtedly assist the United Nations in giving a new impetus to the peace efforts. But our Organization must always bear in mind that this peace depends  too  on an active and sincere quest for solutions to the problems of survival and development which weigh on all the countries of the third world.91.	Indeed  the convening of the sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and development  showed the wealthier countries that the third world  now fully aware of the weight of its influence in international economic relations  is no longer prepared passively to accept the present economic order. The situation in most of these countries deteriorates from year to year as a result of the present state of affairs  compounded by the frequent occurrence of natural catastrophes of every kind.92.	No very effective procedure has been worked out by our Organization for providing speedy assistance to States Members which are victims of natural catastrophes. Thus  Bangladesh  having just emerged from war  has been almost entirely flooded; in India millions of men and women are likely dying of hunger as the result of a long unprecedented drought; and in Honduras hundreds of human lives have been lost  thousands are without shelter  and the economy has been hard hit by the passage of the latest hurricane. All these countries need immediate aid from the inter-national community  channeled through the Organization. 93.	My own country  as you know  belongs to a region that has been the victim of one of these natural disasters. May I be allowed to recall here that  in our battle against drought  Senegal has always made great efforts by giving the highest priority  particularly in its development plans to the construction of dams  which are the only means to make our agriculture proof against climatic changes. Furthermore  the Governments of the Sahelian States have jointly undertaken important hydro-agricultural projects for the progressive transformation of ecological and meteorological conditions over the medium and the long term.94.	The conclusions reached at the last meetings of the organizations of the United Nations system for the development of the Senegal River prove  if that were necessary  how determined the Sahelian States are to eliminate the effect of the drought  which is a serious handicap to the economic and social development of their region.95.	As I had occasion to say from this rostrum last year [2132nd meeting]  when we were faced with the disastrous effects of this scourge  African solidarity and international assistance were not lacking. The Government of Senegal again wishes to thank its brother States  all friendly countries  the United Nations and other international organizations for their invaluable assistance to the Sahelian countries facing difficulties due to natural disasters. I also wish to express my gratitude to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  who by his official visit ?n February 1974 brought us convincing proof that our Organization is concerned for the fate of the most disadvantaged.96.	I am furthermore pleased to announce that  for the time being  the rainy season is almost normal throughout the Sahelian region  and that if there is sufficient rain in October  the harvest will be saved. However  two or three years of good rainy seasons will be needed for things to return to normal.97.	However  in the Sahelian region  a return to normal will not put an end to uncertainty. The need remains above all  to control nature through the implementation of our major projects  so that periods of drought are not followed  as is frequently the case  by equally catastrophic floods. I therefore invite all men of good will  within the framework of international co-operation  to participate in the gigantic task of rebuilding and equipping the Sahelian region.98.	Even more serious than natural disasters is the continuance of an economic order based on injustice and the exploitation of the least developed  whose progress is thus blocked  while the compensation measures provided for by the international community prove inadequate to improve that situation.99.	Indeed  it is no secret to anyone that the situation of the developing countries is deteriorating more and more because the measures provided for  as well as the commitments undertaken within the framework of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  have not been respected by the wealthy countries.100.	If we observe the present rate of official external assistance  we see that in 1976 it will barely amount to 0.35 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized countries  while three fourths of mankind will continue to incur billions of dollars of debts.101.	According to data furnished by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD]  the aid given by the wealthy countries  in 1972  was only 0.30 per cent of their gross national products  a far cry from the 0.70 per cent set by the United Nations for official development assistance.102.	As for the net total of funds provided to the developing countries  it represented  for the same year  0.78 per cent of the gross national product of the industrialized countries  whereas the United Nations target was -let us remember 1 per cent.103.	A widening of the gap between the ""have"" and ""have-not"" countries  where it results from this state of affairs  may be prejudicial to the cause of international peace and security. It is in the context of the efforts to prevent such a possibility that my delegation sincerely thanks the United Nations for having convened this year  under its auspices  two conferences of an unprecedented political scope: the sixth special session of the United Nations  on raw materials and development  and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  which met in Caracas from 29 June to 29 August 1974.104.	May I again express my gratitude to President Houari Boumediene of Algeria for having taken the initiative in convening the session of the Assembly on raw materials and development. That event  which had its origins in the fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers in 1973 and which challenged the system that today governs international relations  shows us. clearly how non-alignment has found its raison d'etre in defending just causes against all forms of political hegemony and economic domination.105.	To this end  my delegation believes that any real political desire to make a frontal attack on the problem of development should  in the first place  recognize the distribution of natural resources as a key question. The appropriation of those resources by the strong to the detriment of the weak constitutes the basis of the unequal and unjust economic order that we know today  and that calls for a radical transformation if we are to establish the new economic order that is a sine qua non for collective economic security. Indexation of the prices of raw materials in terms of the value of the goods manufactured by the developed countries might perhaps constitute a palliative measure against the deterioration in terms of trade which result from this situation.106.	The fact that the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted  at its sixth special session  a Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order shows that the countries of the third world are fully determined to claim something more than a back seat on the international scene. The Program of Action  intended to ensure the implementation of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  adopted at the same session  will enable our Organization to deal better with questions relating to the fundamental problems of raw materials in relation to trade and development; the reform of the international monetary system and the financing of development; industrialization and the transfer of technology; and  lastly  the regulation and control of transnational corporations  not forgetting the sacrosanct principle of nationalization  which is an expression of the sovereign right of each country to safeguard its natural resources. The seriousness of the problems raised by the countries of the third world at the sixth special session makes clear the importance that must be attached to them.107.	Furthermore  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  which it has not been possible to finish drafting thus far because of the lack of political will of some of the developed countries  must be based on the fundamental principles adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and development.108.	Furthermore  my delegation fully appreciates the launching of the Special Program under the Program of Action for the Establishment of a New International Economic Order to provide emergency relief and development assistance to the countries most seriously affected by the present crisis.109.	Seeking a solution to those problems of economic and social development necessarily implies consideration of questions relating to a new law of the sea. The convening by the United Nations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  even though that Conference did not fulfill all the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries  may be regarded as the beginnings of justice in that field.110.	The fact that the United Nations has for years been interested in the law of the sea Within the framework of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-bed and the Ocean Floor Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction shows the importance it attaches to that problem  which is basic to the development of the countries concerned.111.	We all know that it was due to the developing countries that that Committee extended its discussions to cover the whole of the law of the sea  and finally agreed on the need to hold a Third Conference on the Law of the Sea at Caracas. My delegation shares the view of most African delegations which participated in the Caracas session  and believes we must abandon the traditional doctrines of the law of the sea in favor of a new concept  that of the common heritage of mankind  which implies free access by all to the riches of the sea  and an equitable distribution among all of the income obtained from the exploitation of its resources. In that connexion  Senegal supports the establishment of a new international organization to administer matters relating to the high seas  the common heritage of mankind  the resources of which would be used mainly in the fight against underdevelopment. Hundreds of millions of dollars might thus be devoted every year to that noble cause.112.	My delegation  aware of the importance of the Caracas Conference  unreservedly confirms its support of the position taken by the Organization of African Unity [OAU)  which can be summarized as follows.113.	First  we must recognize the right of all coastal States to establish  beyond their territorial seas  an exclusive economic zone  which should not in any case exceed 200 nautical miles. Within that zone coastal States would exercise permanent sovereignty over the biological and mineral resources therein  without jeopardizing other legitimate uses of the sea  in particular freedom of navigation and overflight  the laying of submarine cables or pipelines  and so forth.114.	Secondly  we must recognize the right of land-locked and other geographically disadvantaged countries to participate in the exploitation of the biological resources of the economic zones on an equal footing with the coastal States.115.	Thirdly  the biological resources must be protected against the inroads of pollution and intensive fishing. It is therefore necessary to set up adequate institutions and establish an international authority which will see to it that the principles of defense against such inroads are respected.116.	In this field  Senegal  like OAU  advocates the establishment of a treaty governing the international zone so as to protect the ocean spaces and their living and mineral resources. The relevant machinery should have substantial and far-reaching powers. Its role should be to exploit resources and regulate the activities in the zone  and to reduce to the utmost the harmful repercussions of civilization  and the fluctuations of raw material prices.117.	Those two great conferences  which should have left their mark on the Second United Nations Development Decade  unfortunately proved to be disappointing  partly because of their somewhat hasty preparation  but above all because of the lack of political will on the part of certain Members of our Organization  especially the industrialized countries.118.	On the other hand  my delegation expresses its satisfaction with the holding in Bucharest of the World Population Conference  and of the forthcoming World Food Conference sponsored jointly by FAO and UNCTAD at Rome. We affirm that the long-term problem of world food can be resolved only by a strategy which combines the target of increased productivity with that of equitable distribution. The Conference must consider a world food policy as a consistent whole  and include the questions of food aid and the best arrangements for emergencies  as well as the price stabilization and the balancing of supply and demand. Such a policy cannot  however  be formulated and executed without the support and co-operation of the developed countries  which must accept their responsibilities in this area  since inter-national peace and security will always be threatened if the developing countries cannot improve their food situation.119.	In the realm of peace  there is one sector where our Organization has made definite progress  which leads us to hope for a speedy solution of the problems concerned: decolonization and the fight against apartheid. My delegation rejoices at the overthrow of the Caetano regime; it welcomes Portugal's return to democracy and the recognition by the new Government of Portugal of the inalienable right of the African peoples to self-determination and independence. The recognition of the de jure independence of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau by Portugal and the Republic's admission to the United Nations are a source of satisfaction and reassurance to us  because those acts are directed towards the attainment of the universality of our Organization  which we all earnestly hope for. The meeting at Dakar between Mr. Aristide Pereira and Mr. Mario Soares  followed by meetings in London and Algiers  helped to hasten Portugal's recognition of the independent State of Guinea-Bissau. My Government will spare no effort to assist that brother State firmly to take its place within the family of free and independent nations.120.	My delegation sincerely hopes that the Cape Verde islands will soon join Guinea-Bissau in achieving independence and unity  and that Mozambique  where an important step has just been taken with the establishment of a Provisional Government of the Frente de Libertasao de Mozambique (FRELIMO)  Angola  Sao Tome and Principe will shortly attain freedom and international sovereignty  in the interests of their peoples.121.	The declaration adopted at the eleventh ordinary session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of OAU at Mogadiscio called upon all States members of the Organization and on friendly countries not to restore diplomatic relations with Portugal until such time as it had recognized the right of its colonies to independence  started negotiations with liberation movements with a view to the transfer of power  and recognized the State of Guinea-Bissau.122.	It must be acknowledged that Portugal was then in the initial phase of its internal revolution  a stage  we must admit  of sometimes contradictory declarations and attitudes. But today  when the independence of Guinea-Bissau is recognized de jure  when FRELIMO  after the Lusaka agreements  heads a government of transition  when the transfer of authority has been properly carried out by the two countries  and finally  today  when Portugal declares that it is only wailing for a genuine representative before it decolonizes Angola  and solemnly proclaims that it will do the same for its other colonies  no one can deny that the requirements of the OAU have been fully met 123.	The Portugal of today deserves to be encouraged and helped. Recent events in Mozambique which have led to close co-operation between the FRELIMO and Portuguese armies  as well as the latest changes that have occurred in Portugal  illustrate this proposition clearly 124.	Senegal for its part  being fully aware of its African responsibilities  has decided to re-establish diplomatic relations with Portugal. In so doing we are conscious of aiding both Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique  which already have important relations with Portugal as well as with other Territories that remain to be decolonized.125.	Senegal  which has been watchful and ready immediately to revise its position if Portugal were not to comply with its commitments  believes that it would be to the honor of Africa to pay a tribute and to do justice to the new Portugal.126.	As for Sahara under Spanish domination  the Government of Senegal  consistent with the position which we have always defended in the United Nations  considers the decolonization of that country to be an imperative necessity. But  as has been indicated by the heads of the delegations of Mauritania and Morocco  there may be a special form of decolonization. There is a legal dispute between the African States concerned and the colonial Power. It therefore seems most desirable that the General Assembly  before considering this question  should request the opinion of the International Court of Justice. In this connexion  Sahara under Spanish domination reminds us a little of Namibia. The reason is that when South Africa set itself up in Namibia there was a lawful claimant to the Territory (the League of Nations and later the United Nations) which subsequently claimed its rights before the International Court of Justice  whose opinion is known.127.	In the present case  those who had rights before the colonial period of so-called Spanish Sahara  called on the same Court  an organ of the United Nations in which they had confidence  to state the legal position before our Assembly was seized of the problem. It seems to me to be wise and equitable to accede to this request  which I hope will enjoy the unanimous support of Africa  a continent primarily interested in decolonization. At any rate the sole concern of my delegation in this case is the rapid attainment of decolonization of the Territory by peaceful means.128.	Our Organization has a special responsibility  that of helping the populations of Southern Rhodesia to attain their independence on the basis of equality of rights for all. Despite the efforts made by most Members of the United Nations  the minority regimes that are in power in Namibia and in Southern Rhodesia continue to base their retrograde policy on racism  segregation and discrimination.129.	In Southern Rhodesia  the illegal minority regime of Ian Smith consolidates itself from year to year despite the sanctions taken against it  sanctions  which  we must confess  are largely ignored by certain Members of the Organization  some of which are permanent members of the Security Council. It is obvious that the illegal Ian Smith regime ostentatiously thwarts every United Nations decision regarding the establishment of equality and justice in that country  where the minority  which imposes itself by force  constantly provokes neighboring Zambia at the same time.130.	Zambia has encountered great difficulties be-cause of the unilateral decision of the .illegal Ian Smith regime to seal off the common frontier. In this connexion my Government reiterates its full support for every positive measure taken by the world community to preserve the independence and dignity of the people of Zambia.131.	With regard to South Africa  my Government  which would have wished that South Africa's decision not to intervene in the recent events in Mozambique marked the beginning of a radical change in its internal policy  cannot for the time being do other than continue to condemn its policy which is based essentially on total contempt for the non-white races.132.	For us the point is not so much of including black members in a delegation than of having South Africa admit the elementary principle that a man is a man  whatever his color  religion or degree of evolution; and that a man is only a man whether he is an atomic scientist  a philosopher  an eminent Head of State  or whatever. As long as this is not recognized that country cannot find an honorable place in the international community.133.	In the meantime  South Africa must immediately liberate Namibia because  as it had failed to discharge its obligations as mandatory Power  the General Assembly  on 27 October 1966  was compelled to decide [resolution 2145 (XXI)] that the Mandate of South Africa was ended and that henceforth the rights of the League of Nations would be exercised by the United Nations. That was confirmed  we know  by the opinion given on 21 June 1971 by the International Court of Justice.5 The Security Council  by its resolution 269 (1969)  confirmed the termination of SouthAfrica's Mandate over Namibia and called for its withdrawal from the Territory. That order should have been scrupulously complied with.134.	It is in the framework of this struggle to restore the rights to self-determination of the people of Namibia  which has always refused to become a feudal part of South Africa  that my Government fully associates itself with the measures adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-eighth session inviting the Security Council to put an end to the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa  and calling on the United Nations Council for Namibia to participate fully in the various activities of the subsidiary organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations [resolution 3111 (XXVIII)].135.	My delegation calls for the continuation  in the greater interest of the Namibian people  of the close co-operation between the United Nations Council for Namibia and the South West Africa People's Organization  which the General Assembly has recognized [ibid.] as the genuine representative of the Namibian people and which my country has authorized to open a permanent office at Dakar.136.	And yet  despite the well-known obstinacy of the leaders of South Africa and of Rhodesia  my delegation ventures to hope that the emancipation movements which are liberating entire countries in southern Africa  together with the growing pressure of world reprobation  will lead them to a better understanding of history.137.	It seems proper  at a time when resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 on decolonization is making notable progress  giving greater credit to the principles of universality of the United Nations  that our Organization be closely associated with the settlement of all international problems.138.	It is  indeed  necessary  to avoid frustrations and imbalances that can only serve the interests of the great Powers  to give the United Nations full responsibility and the necessary authority in problems of international peace and security to which are linked the progress of the developing nations. The small- and medium-sized Powers must no longer be kept out of the settlement of problems of world interests because peaceful coexistence among the great Powers alone is no longer sufficient to create conditions for a real peace  prior to the emergence of an era of collective economic security  which we so earnestly desire.139.	In conclusion it only remains for me to express the deeply felt wish that this session may be that of the realization of the legitimate aspirations of all peoples to freedom and economic and social justice in newly found international peace and security."
"108",6159,"SGP",29,1974,"Mr. President  permit me to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. You have the distinction of being the youngest person ever to occupy that august position. Your youth is  however  a deceptive quality  for you have enormous experience both in the world of diplomacy and in the field of battle. You were a valiant soldier in Algeria's armed struggle for independence. You have been the Foreign Minister of Algeria for more than 10 years. You have also played an important role in the leadership of the group of non-aligned States.50.	I should also like to pay a deserved tribute to Mr. Benites  who has earned our respect for the efficient and impartial way in which he presided over the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.51.	My delegation would also like to extend its welcome and good wishes to the three new Member States: Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau.52.	I should also like to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Waldheim  for the manner in which he has discharged his onerous duties during the past twelve months. I should like to single out two examples of his positive contributions to the cause of international peace and security. In the case of the Middle East  we all owe him a debt of gratitude for the efficiency and speed with which he organized the United Nations Emergency Force. The Force has played a crucial role in enforcing the cease-fire agreement and the subsequent disengagement agreements. In the case of Cyprus  Mr. Waldheim has also played an important role in bringing about a cease-fire between the belligerents and in the field of humanitarian relief to the more than 200 000 persons who have been displaced by the fighting. The decision of the Secretary-General to order UNFICYP to take over the airport at Nicosia  in order to prevent it from becoming a point of contention between the two opposing force was a good example of his initiative and for courage.53.	It would appear  to judge by a number of speeches made at this session of the General Assembly and the reactions to them  that we may be moving away from a long era of political and military confrontations  which for three decades provided the major issues of international relations  to one of economic confrontation. True  what we have heard so far are only the distant rumbles of an approaching storm  but whether it will gather force and break over us or mercifully pass away will depend on the measure of rationality we bring to bear on our mounting economic problems.54.	We should  however  first recognize that the potentialities for economic confrontation undoubtedly exist. Even our overriding preoccupations with problems of decolonization and cold-war commitments during the past three decades did not prevent economic conflicts obtruding from time to time  though for the most part these were treated as tedious distractions from the more pressing political and military issues.55.	Up to early this year the great industrial Powers  which  until recently  between them accounted for some 70 per cent of the world's income  were supremely confident that they had their economic problems licked into good shape. They sincerely believed that they had established an international economic order capable of indefinite expansion and of providing them with unlimited affluence. A whole new branch of learning called ""growth economics"" provided the ideology to sustain this optimistic vision of the future.56.	The newly independent countries of the third world  too  had their own grand fallacy. It had for long been their contention that the injustices and poverty which afflicted them were wholly attributable to imperialism and that  therefore  once foreign rule was ended  they would automatically enter an era of plenty and fair shares for all.57.	There were  however  those who questioned whether either of those optimisms was justified and whether rich and poor nations were wise in assigning a low priority to economic problems. They questioned the prevailing conviction that some 138 sovereign States could best promote world prosperity simply by developing strong  independent national economies. They questioned the belief that purely national solutions could overcome domestic economic difficulties.58.	Even as late as last year confidence in the essential soundness of the international economic order was as firm as ever. Such doubts and fears as may have momentarily crept in were dispelled by the unexpected boom of the years 1971 to 1973. It confirmed the prevailing belief that the international economic system had an infinite capacity for self- correction.59.	Today  however  there is a growing feeling that the ups and downs of the world economy are not temporary lapses but symptoms of the gradual breakdown of the economic order put together some three decades ago at Bretton Woods. It is now becoming increasingly clear that unless the Bretton Woods system is replaced by another which more fully accords with the economic realities of today  the next three decades could well be given over to bitter and destructive economic confrontations. Nothing short of a fundamental re-evaluation of the world's economic problems will redeem mankind from distress and upheavals far more universal and more violent than anything we have seen hitherto.60.	All this is not mere rhetoric. The first casualties of the breakdown of the old economic order have already appeared. Many of us do not find it incongruous at all that in this age of affluence and high technology we should be able to start our breakfast every day with a cursory glance at news of thousands of people dying of starvation. Many knowledgeable experts state that the age of famines has returned but this time on a world-wide scale. Only a few days ago the Secretary- General drew our attention to the fact that today some 32 countries are running out of food and facing economic collapse. Another estimate by Dr. Norman Borlaug  the Nobel Prize-winning American scientist  states that something like 50 million people will die of starvation this year a larger number than the populations of many countries represented in this Assembly. The actual figure is  of course  open to dispute but what is not in dispute is that millions will die and there is apparently very little the nations of the world  victims of outmoded economic doctrines  can do to save but a fraction of the doomed millions. And there is very little that this Assembly can do to offer these 50 millions any ray of hope  by our speeches or by our actions.61.	This is because  it is claimed  the vast food surpluses of the 1950s and 1960s may not return for a long time those days are over  so the experts tell us. A major contributing factor one of the major factors is that today's population is increasing faster than we can provide food by some 70 million people a year. Even if there were to be a more equitable distribution of the world's food resources  starvation or near-starvation will still be the lot of millions of people. The claim that modern science and technology can cope with an indefinite population increase is  in my view  cruel  wishful thinking. Generous though nature has been  it has not provided us with infinite resources. There are definable limits to the amount of food that this planet can provide. We have already reached a point where the economic cost of extracting additional food is increasing  partly because of higher production costs. I am told that in the United States  where farming is perhaps the most efficient and most technologically advanced  it has been found that it is more expensive to raise yields from 90 to 100 bushels per acre than from 50 to 60 bushels per acre. Any additional increase in grain yield must cost more.62.	The population problem is more crucial to developing countries than to developed countries and the formers ability to cope rationally with population growth will determine whether they make it into the twenty-first century as free  viable and prosperous States or remain festering  disintegrating areas of despair and violent unrest. It is no accident that famine today stalks and claims its victims only in developing countries. Because those countries have done very little to successfully regulate population growth and that means regulating population to resources nature therefore seeks to restore the balance and to be the corrective force  as it has done in ages past  by resorting to famine  pestilence and war. These have traditionally been nature's cures for overpopulation.63.	In the likely event of the world sliding into an indefinite period of economic confrontation  the in-ability of third-world countries to control population growth will make them particularly vulnerable. Countries with large surpluses of grain for export are limited to a few rich and developed countries like the United States  Australia and Canada. Hitherto  and for many years  these countries have mitigated acute food problems in developing countries through food aid under various programs. But it would be optimistic to hope that they will continue to shoulder the whole burden of feeding the ever-increasing hungry peoples of the world.64.	It is my submission that  in an era of unbridled economic confrontation  food could become a weapon  especially if other commodities  too  are converted into weapons in an economic war. It may well be that threats to use food and other commodities as weapons in an economic war may at the moment be nothing more than rhetoric born out of exasperation. But if rhetoric is indulged in often enough and economic frustrations mount  then the temptation to translate it into reality might prove irresistible. And we should remind ourselves that the most devastating of all commodity weapons would be food and the most vulnerable would be countries with large populations and poor food resources.65.	I hope that the recent use of oil as a weapon against industrial countries will not be cited as a precedent for the conversion of other commodities whether raw materials or industrial products into weapons in an economic war. The reasons which led oil-producing countries to use oil as a weapon were not altogether invalid or immoral. In a way  the wealthy industrial countries forced the decision. For three decades commodity producers  including* oil producers  pleaded with industrial nations to pay more equitable prices for their raw materials. The raw- material producers pointed out  quite justifiably  that year after year for the last 30 years they had been trading on less favorable terms against increasingly expensive manufactured products. The consequence was that poor countries were  to some extent  subsidizing affluence in the wealthy countries. The wealthy nations for their part listened to these appeals with great sympathy and dutifully expressed amazement and concern over what was called the widening gap between rich and poor nations and that was about as far as they were prepared to go. Three decades of pleading did not move the rich nations simply because the poor nations so the rich nations were convinced had no leverage more persuasive than verbal and moral exhortations.66.	Anyone rereading the proceedings of the various meetings of UNCTAD would come away with the strong impression that industrial nations had accepted the kind of Calvinistic doctrine that God has already selected for all time the nations that were to be rich and those doomed to be poor and that any action by man to reverse this judgment would be blasphemy.67.	Whatever our other reservations on the use of oil as a weapon  there is no denying the fact that its users managed to get the industrial countries to grant what gentlemanly arguments failed to elicit. It would be understandable if other raw-material-producing countries  whose pleas for equitable prices still go unheeded  should ponder hopefully over the possibilities of forging similar weapons to enhance their bargaining position.68.	However  in my view  the use of commodities as weapons in an economic war would be a disastrous course for the countries concerned and for the world economy. What I should like to do is to draw the attention of the wealthy  industrial countries to the growing economic frustration of developing countries over the failure of the former to deal equitably with those that produce raw materials. Equally  the producers of raw materials must be conscious of the fact that prices must bear some rational relationship to what the international economic system is capable of supporting.69.	True  many of the economic difficulties en-countered by developing countries can be attributed to sins of omission and commission on their part. But what is equally undeniable is that the policies of industrial nations  short of their pious platitudes  are basically designed to make rich countries richer and poor countries poorer. As far as I know  no industrial nation has come forward with any systematic policy or plan deliberately to bridge the widening economic gap between it and the poor nations  however much it may deplore that gap in theory. This may be because the industrial countries feel that  except for the oil- producing countries  primary producers have no leverage against them.70.	In my view  such complacency is both shortsighted and unwise and shows an abysmal and dangerous ignorance of the international economic system. It is my contention that  even if poor countries do not have the necessary leverage  such leverage is being applied against all of us by the new kind of international economic system which has today come to maturity. This new system which envelops us all can function smoothly only if the wealth of the world is more rationally distributed. All national economies  even the most powerful and the most dynamic  can survive and flourish only by coming to terms with the international economic system that today is the foundation on which national economies rest. Basic to this system is the acceptance of the interdependence of nations  not as a pious aspiration or piece of rhetoric but as a cold reality. The smooth functioning of this global system today depends on some 138 national units working in a co-ordinated fashion for the common good. If the international economy can be compared to a chain made up of 138 sovereign nations  then  I submit  the economy cannot be stronger than its weakest link.71.	It was the fact of the economic interdependence of nations which made it possible for the handful of relatively underdeveloped oil-producing countries to throw th? world economy  and in particular the powerful industrial countries  into disarray. This economic interdependence has grown without our noticing it or even planning it over the past 30 years. Despite intense economic nationalism  nation States have been drawn willy-nilly into a complex network of economic relations world-wide in scope. All but the most primitive of national economies develop and grow more and more through international trade  international exchange. The present crisis into which we are drifting stems largely from the reluctance of national economies to come to terms with the imperatives of the international economic system.72.	That  I believe  is why the present economic crisis into which we are moving is qualitatively different from the great depression of 1929. We cannot hope to get out of this crisis by short-term national solutions founded on a spirit of beggar-my-neighbor. That is why so far the application of remedies tried out in 1929 and in the 1930s is not only proving to be ineffective but appears to be exacerbating matters.73.	What distinguishes this crisis from the earlier one is that it is far more international in scope  involving not  as in the past  a handful of imperial units and a few industrial Powers but some 138 sovereign nations. Since all nations are struggling with inflationary problems  it is clear that we are dealing in fact with a world economic problem. The more we seek to cope with a world problem and a world system in national terms  the worse becomes the crisis  the sharper the conflict between nations  the more inevitable an economic crash.74.	However  given the reality of interdependent economies  the clearer should become the futility of economic confrontations. The use of commodity weapons to hurt foes would be an irrational response simply because it would  in the long run  hurt everyone foe  friend and eventually the user himself. Like the atom bomb  such a weapon  in an economically interdependent world  would not distinguish between the innocent and the guilty  between the rich and the poor  between the weak and the strong. But if  for want of imagination and courage  we should blunder into economic confrontation  then the first victims must be the weak developing countries. This is already the case. They do not have the resources to stand up to the strains of what must be a long and bitter economic confrontation. Eventually  all nations will be drawn into the struggle. The devastation will be great and only a few battered countries will emerge the nominal victors.75.	That is why it is imperative that we cease trying to put the blame for the approaching economic crisis on this or that country or on the specific action of any one of them. That is the surest road to economic confrontation which  once begun  cannot be halted or reversed.76.	The fault lies with all those who refuse to face the fact that  unless national economies are made more responsive to the imperatives of an international economy  we must continue to flounder hopelessly. If the crisis should persist and worsen  then there is a strong probability that desperation and fear of an inevitable economic collapse could  as in ages past  drive nations to seek the most dangerous and hopeless of all remedies: military confrontation."
"109",6239,"SLE",29,1974,"My first very pleasant duty is to convey to you all the personal greetings and salutations of Mr. Siaka Stevens  President of the Republic of Sierra Leone. To see you  Mr. President  a dear and distinguished colleague and friend  seated as you are  guiding our deliberations  leaves me completely reassured that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will conclude its work with speed and satisfaction. Your unanimous election is not only adequate testimony to your capabilities but also an acknowledgment of the role Algeria is playing in world affairs today.180.	We also wish to thank most sincerely your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Benites of Ecuador  for the manner in which he presided over the twenty- eighth regular and the sixth special sessions of our Assembly.181.	Congratulations must also go to the Secretary- General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. In the past year  as indeed in previous years  he has been indefatigable in his quest for peace notably in the Middle East  Cyprus and IndoChina. He has traveled far and wide in the due execution of his multitudinous duties journeys which have taken him to drought-stricken areas  and to many countries throughout the world. We in Sierra Leone will long remember his very successful visit to our country earlier this year. Sierra Leone wishes Mr. Waldheim and his colleagues ever- increasing success.182.	Today sees three new Members of this world body: the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. The history of the struggles  sufferings and tribulations which preceded the emergence into nationhood of these nations is sufficient indication that they will contribute in a positive way towards achieving the great ideals of the United Nations. Sierra Leone is proud to have contributed in its own modest way towards Guinea- Bissau's assumption of its rightful place among the community of nations. To all the new Members we extend our warm welcome. We also look forward to greeting Mozambique as a Member State next year.183.	Victory has crowned the dynamic struggles of the freedom fighters of Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  Angola and the Cape Verde Islands. Guinea-Bissau is now an independent State recognized by the entire international community as a full Member of the United Nations. Agreement for the granting of independence to Mozambique has been reached. We can look forward to the prospect of independence talks on Angola. Portugal itself has been liberated from 50 years of Fascist dictatorship  thus making the total liberation of all former Portuguese colonial Territories a possibility.184.	Whilst we welcome all these positive trends and support the progressive elements in Portugal  which alone are responsible for the warm welcome accorded Portugal in this Assembly this year  and rejoice at the prospect of genuine co-operation between former antagonists  we cannot but note that there are substantial racist elements in that country  still bent on pursuing outdated reactionary colonialist policies of plunder and exploitation for as long   as possible especially in Angola. We appeal to them to see that by such contumacy they are bequeathing to their children nothing but suffering  bitterness  hatred  even loss of life  which are all entirely avoidable today.185.	The events in Portugal  Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique and Angola clearly indicate that South Africa's policy of apartheid and minority oppression is doomed to failure. Yet that Fascist racist minority regime continues its odious policy. And for the first time  in a gesture insulting to the integrity of this august body and to the intelligence of representatives  it has included non-whites in its delegation. None but Mr. Vorster and his merry men are deluded by such subterfuge. In former years when Portuguese delegations employed the same trick  did this hide from this Assembly the nature of similar noxious policies then being pursued by that country? It is significant that it is on the occasion that the South African delegation is for the first time so composed that the United Nations has at long last reached the right decision and rejected the credentials of the alleged representatives of South Africa  representatives who with unrestrained ferocity continue the systematic eradication of all enlightened opposition to their heinous policy.186.	Given the history of the situation  it is obvious that no positive voluntary response from the South Africans is forthcoming. Our only hope therefore is to repeat our appeal to the rest of humanity to redouble its efforts to eradicate this stain of apartheid and racial discrimination from the face of the African continent.187.	Those States enjoying special economic and cultural relations with the South African regime have thereby a responsibility they have clearly not yet shouldered. We appeal for a total boycott of South Africa  because we are convinced that  in a world in which nations have become so increasingly interdependent  political  economic and cultural isolation is bound to make a corrective impression on even the most intransigent regimes.188.	The Government of Sierra Leone on its part pledges unfailing support for action by the Organization of African Unity  by the liberation movements in South Africa and by governmental and non-governmental organizations  and for the entire program of work of the Special Committee on Apartheid  particularly the program for intensification and coordination of United Nations action against apartheid established by resolution 3151 D (XXVIII)  which my Government sponsored at the twenty-eighth session together with 42 other Governments.189.	It is unfortunate that Ian Smith and his illegal racist regime seem impervious to reason. We appeal to them to follow Portugal's example and alter their collision course before it is too late. It is no disgrace to discard outmoded policies. ""Only God and fools don't change."" The peoples of Zimbabwe will unquestionably be freed but at what cost and with what legacy?190.	We urge Ian Smith and his racist oligarchy to release and hold immediate discussions   with the real African leaders such as Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Sithole with a view to arriving at an acceptable independence agreement with the British Government.191.	Increased racist legislation and practices will not help. Nor will the widespread detentions  the creation of ""protected areas""  the shutting down of schools- or the introduction of a system of passes. These in fact will exacerbate the situation further  making it even more unlikely that a peaceful solution of this problem can be arrived at.192.	The failure of the United Kingdom Government to shoulder its responsibilities in Southern Rhodesia one of the least creditable chapters in British history deeply saddens and embarrasses Britain's many African friends. Given this shirking of its responsibility by the British Government  it is thus only by the determined action of all members of this community  both individually and collectively  that we can hope to achieve any meaningful results by means other than conflict and bloodshed. Unhappily  the sanctions on which this Organization has decided are being imposed either partially  half-heartedly or not at all by those whose compliance is likely to make the greatest impact on the Rhodesian economy.193.	Our viewpoint is that unless there is a change of heart in this direction the only other possibility —a solution by force of arms—with all its attendant horrors and inevitable high! jcost in terms of human life  will be the personal responsibility of each and every one of us who failed to support faithfully this Organization's call for sanctions.194.	Not only do we recommend and continue to urge a strict adherence to the sanctions on which this Organization has decided but we will work for a widening of sanctions in both scope and intensity to include  in particular  travel  communications  sports and all other economic  political  social and cultural activities  because again  as with South Africa  we feel that the effects of isolation military  economic  diplomatic and cultural can only be salutary.195.	The situation in Namibia gives as much if not more cause for concern. Here we have an unrepresentative gang of desperadoes from a neighboring territory  having no right to govern even their own territory  illegally occupying and terrorizing this neighboring land for whose administration the United Nations itself is responsible. Our view is that the Namibian. issue is a direct test of the efficacy of the United Nations. No Member State therefore can treat it with indifference without betraying the principles that give this Organization its meaning. It is the sacred obligation of every Member of this Organization to co-operate fully in the search for a just solution of this problem.1%. Sierra Leone believes in non-interference in the internal affairs of others because it is perfectly conscious of the dangerous consequences of any contrary policy. The tragic events in Cyprus which caused untold suffering  loss of human life and property were precipitated by just such interference. We therefore not only condemned the coup which purposed to oust the elected Government of Cyprus but continue to recognize the legitimate Government of that island headed by Archbishop Makarios that distinguished head of State whose address this afternoon we eagerly await. It is our hope that the further talks between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus will solve the many problems complicated by accent actions and lay the foundations for a lasting peace on the island.197. The Middle East continues to be a sensitive region. The recent peace momentum appears to have decelerated. The principle that. Sierra Leone cannot support the acquisition of any territory by any country through force remains our guide-line here. We further believe that lasting peace will return only by compliance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  by the removal of legitimate Palestinian grievances  and by the recognition of the right of the State of Israel to exist.198.	In our view the tenuous semi-peace in Viet Nam will within the next 12 months be crucially tested and it is still our view that the Korean people themselves should be allowed to work together for the reunification of their homeland.199.	With regard to Cambodia  Sierra Leone supports the Government of Prince Sihanouk and recognizes his Government in exile as the legitimate Government of Cambodia  and we look forward to an early restoration of the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations  rights that were usurped after the coup d'etat by foreign troops in March 1970.200.	Last year from this rostrum [2133rd meeting] it fell to me to enunciate our concept of one of the duties incumbent on each and every Member State  namely  to work towards a truly harmonized community of nations. It was suggested that it is high time we stopped talking interminably about the gap between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" and did something about it. The reduction of this gap  it was suggested  not only is worthy of the attention of the galaxy of talent available to this Organization but should be one of our association's priority action programs. We therefore proposed  as important and urgent  item 47 entitled ""Reduction of the increasing gap between the developed and the developing countries"" and had that item included in the agenda of the present session.201.	Since then the oil-producing countries took certain practical steps within this context. And if the phraseology economic co-operation and not confrontation was not born then  it was at least revitalized. Since then President Boumediene's initiative  culminating in the sixth special session  enabled all of us to agree that the establishment of a new international economic order was necessary.202.	The need to eradicate these disparities and establish this new economic order is not rooted in charity or philanthropy  otherwise throwing a few provisions into the abyss of hunger would suffice. There can be no peace where the few  by the exploitation of the many  utilize and waste the resources which the many need barely to survive  let alone have a decent standard of living. Fully to appreciate that this need is firmly rooted in respect for human dignity and welfare is indispensable to the safety of each and every one of us. Yet we are not all doing however much or however little we can to eradicate these disparities. To fail to do this  to miss establishing this new economic order as a matter of the utmost priority  is to jeopardize the future of mankind.203.	We must never forget that today wars  however local  have a global significance  and economic confrontation has profound international repercussions. We live in a tiny  ever-shrinking and organically cohesive world  wherein no-one's destiny is isolated. A world where starvation is only avoided by economic confrontation is not a healthy one; when desperation generates terrorism  who is safe?204.	And still we fail to appreciate the urgency. We really ought not to be surprised to find in President Ford's words that: ""Today  the economy of the world is under unprecedented stress."" [2234th meeting  para. 22.] It will remain so unless and until we tackle these problems resolutely.205.	It is for these reasons that Sierra Leone supports the Program of Action decided upon at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  subscribes to the principles of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  joins in any world-wide effort to increase food production  negotiate  establish and maintain an international system of food reserves  and looks forward to the forthcoming World Food Conference in Rome  an important initiative in the right direction.206.	We advocate and support regional  continental and other international groupings calculated to improve the socio-economic conditions of the developing countries  and join in any serious effort to support the economic self-reliance of these countries.207.	We are deeply concerned to avoid the path whereby no significant development of the third world is likely without confrontation. This is why at the outset of an era when the resources of the sea will play an ever-increasing part in feeding the world's population and in providing the necessary mineral and geological wealth  we are watching with the keenest of interest the developments at the Conferences on the Law of the Sea  the last of which was held in Caracas. We look forward to the emergence of an agreement encompassing a global strategy preserving the vast resources of the seas for the equitable use of all mankind.208.	If I have dwelt at some length on the economic aspects of the problems facing the international community as a whole  but more particularly the developing countries  it is because I am of the opinion that it would be one of the major tragedies of the world if we did not  on the economic stage  avoid the fatal and costly mistakes our forebears and we ourselves made in the political arena. We can proceed to making the world's resources available to all mankind by the road of co-operation  if we are seriously prepared to take that path today; if not  we shall proceed tomorrow not even the day after to the same goal by the much thornier and more wasteful road of confrontation  terrorism and chaos.209.	Of direct relevance to the social and economic well-being of each individual is the question of disarmament. While we welcome the process of detente and acknowledge that there are signs of continuing mutual accommodation  not only between the super-Powers but in the international community generally  it is still totally intolerable that the world spends hundreds of billions of dollars every year in the arms race. Stockpiles that could destroy humanity are being amassed by an ever-increasing number of nations  but particularly by the two super-Powers. Imagine what transformation could be wrought by the application of even a fraction of those sums to the development of agriculture  the improvement of the environment  the growth of food and the fight against disease.210.	The vision of our destiny we must conjure up is that of a world geared to the availability of the fruits of the earth  to each and every individual. And the instrument for translating this vision into reality as speedily as possible is a reformed United Nations Organization.211.	I reaffirm Sierra Leone's faith in the United Nations. Its past contribution to the peace and security of the world has been inestimable. Its future role in evolving a true community of nations  in harmonizing the interests of all  in utilizing the world's limited resources for the benefit of all  and in settling disputes by peaceful means is unique.212.	On behalf of my country  I speak up for the most important form of co-operation  embracing all mankind  namely the United Nations. Sierra Leone again pledges to do ail in its power to assist this Organization in achieving its full potential. To do this  we are convinced that the situation where one nation can by the exercise  arbitrary or otherwise  of a veto frustrate the wishes  and often the collective wisdom  Of the rest of the entire international community is unacceptable. It is also our position that now is an appropriate time for a review of the entire question of the permanent membership of the Security Council.213.	We shall  within and without this forum  search  along with any and all other peace-loving nations dedicated to the betterment of the lot of all mankind especially the underfed  the underprivileged and the oppressed we shall with those nations search for the solutions to our many problems  always conscious that we live in an increasingly interdependent world. But indeed in order to realize our vision we believe that it is necessary also to change even the nature of the Organization itself  and that the kind of world organization we need is one growing rapidly and steadily from a platform for propagandist slogans to an embryonic world parliament with all necessaryancillary legal and physical powers. To this end we again pledge that we stand ready and willing to surrender as much or as little of our national sovereignty  dearly prized as this is  to such a world body as is necessary to give the latter reality and meaning.214.	These are the views of my Government that I have been privileged to present. We restate that one of the fundamental tenets of Sierra Leone's foreign policy has always been support of this Organization. We will continue to give that support in accordance with the principles enunciated above."
"110",6285,"SLV",29,1974,"Sir  it is a source of particular satisfaction and a great honor for me to start my statement in the general debate in this Assembly by expressing to yoU  on behalf of my Government and my delegation and on my own behalf  our warmest congratulations on the significant manner in which this supreme body of our Organization elected you President of its twenty-ninth session. Your vast knowledge  experience and diplomatic skills constitute the best guarantee for the successful conclusion of the work of this Assembly . May I also avail myself of this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Leopoldo Benites most sincerely on the most skillful manner in which he presided over the work of the last regular session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly.135.	It is with similar satisfaction that I express my most affectionate welcome to the States of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau  which have now entered the United Nations. We are convinced that their participation in this world forum will make an effective contribution to the cause of maintaining and strengthening world peace.136.	In the present general debate  as it has done in past ones  the State of El Salvador wishes  through me  to state its views on some far-reaching aspects of contemporary international realities so as to contribute to the efforts exerted by the United Nations in its struggle to achieve a better world for all mankind.137.	The economic problems which beset the world society have become a grave crisis  and the present channels of co-operation and exchange do not meet the needs of a mankind which is in the process of unparalleled economic and social change. The widening gulf between developed and developing countries makes it urgently necessary to seek effective  practical  generally-accepted solutions. Adequate ways can be found if we manage to determine the reciprocal advantages which the developed and developing countries would derive if the latter improved their level of economic progress.138.	The establishment of points of common interest may be the basis for the developed countries to manifest the political will to co-operate in the efforts to develop the backward countries. That political will is necessary for the viability of measures taken in response to the shortcomings of the world economic system. But we believe that there is at present no such political will of sufficient magnitude.139.	In connexion with the foregoing  it is most important to mention the results and projections of that great international event  the recently-held second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  held in Caracas from 20 June to 29 August of this year. The facilities for that Conference were provided by the Government of Venezuela  which also created an atmosphere of confidence and friendship propitious for the success of its work. It was in Caracas that we started work on matters of substance  since the first session  held in New York in December 1973  was devoted to organizational and procedural questions.140.	The 10 weeks in Caracas resulted in the establishment of the bases for negotiation  which  we hope  will culminate in a general agreement in 1975. Indeed  it must be remembered that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction had to pass over the preparatory work for the Conference; accordingly  in Caracas not only was that gap filled  but  furthermore  the channels of dialog were vastly improved as we delved more deeply that ever into the thorniest subjects  observing in the process that positions which had been very divergent in the past tended almost to converge. More eloquently than is reflected in its records  the Conference proved that in the years that have elapsed since 1967  when the United Nations launched the great theme of the international zone of the seabed as a common heritage of mankind  there has been a ripening of the general conditions necessary to produce a general agreement establishing a new regime for the seas based on the equality of States  their real claims to their marine resources  and the linking of these to the great problems of development which the international community has yet to solve.141.	It must be pointed out that the purpose of the Conference is not to alter the bases of the 1958 Conference but to establish a new regime for the seas which will be in accord with the principles of justice as required in the present-day world.142.	Among the achievements of the Caracas Conference there is the broad support which  regardless of geographical groupings  .was obtained for the concept of the right of the coastal State to a zone adjacent to its coast not to exceed 200 miles. The battle waged for three decades by the Latin American countries is thus about to bear fruit. With that prospect  we are warranted in trusting that the third and fourth stages of the Conference  in which we have high hopes  will recognize not only the interests of the great maritime Powers but also the just aspirations of the developing countries.143.	Praiseworthy too are the repeated efforts of the United Nations in other areas to contribute to the reformulation and eventual solution of the most important world problems. Thus  this year it went into the population problem in depth and in breadth at the World Population Conference  1974. This is of the utmost importance  since the real effects of the problem have not yet been fully evaluated.144.	Population growth  to a considerable extent  determines the process and strategy of development. World-wide co-operation is indispensable so that the effect of this phenomenon on social life will be positive and not constitute a barrier. Population policy must be based on respect for the freedom of man and on the particular circumstances of each country.145.	El Salvador reiterates its special interest in the progress of the work of formulating a Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  the main objective of which will be the rule of justice and equity in international economic relations. That instrument could contribute to bringing about a more rational distribution of wealth among countries  on the basis of possible common benefits and the elimination of barriers to international trade. In that line of thought  El Salvador considers it important that we study the desirability of setting up a council of economic security which would promote international economic justice as the supreme good.146.	The year 1974 has been marked by events with delayed and complex consequences in international relations and in the life of each and every one of the States grouped together under the aegis of the United Nations. The holding of the sixth special session of the. General Assembly was the organized response of the international community to the energy crisis  to the growing deterioration in the terms of trade between the industrialized and developing countries and to the export of inflationary elements by the highly developed countries.147.	The energy crisis started with a shortage of fuel  that almost instantaneously rose in price  draining the foreign exchange reserves of many countries and producing a radical imbalance in the balance of payments  which in turn forced a readjustment in imports and the adoption of extreme economic measures of austerity. A chain of repercussions shook to the very core the economies of many countries: social disquiet  development plans which became mere good intentions  growing disorder in monetary parities and new elements in the vertiginous growth of inflation.148.	On 1 May 1974  the General Assembly adopted two most important resolutions: the Declaration [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. These resolutions are significant milestones in the process of readjusting international economic relations. Yet  the lack of support on the part of key countries for their implementation that appeared at the 2231st meeting  the last of the sixth special session  jeopardizes the results.149.	What is to be obtained as a result of that special session is as yet uncertain. Nevertheless  the Ad hoc Committee on the Special Program established by resolution 3202 (S-VI)  which is charged with implementing the resolutions  can play a valuable role in obtaining the needed support to make of these resolutions a real basis for international economic relations.150.	Two facts are to be emphasized in connexion with the sixth special session of the General Assembly: the maintenance of solidarity among the Group of 77 developing countries which sustain their community of interests vis-a-vis the industrialized countries  despite recent imbalances that were rendered more acute by external pressures on petroleum importers; and the negotiation  of an almost bilateral character  between the Group of 77 and the industrialized countries  which is proof of the enormOus importance in world politics of co-ordination among the developing countries.151.	While the General Assembly opens the way to economic relations  positive political achievements have lessened tensions and indirectly assisted in the formation of new international economic relations. Among these positive achievements  which are so promising in 1974  the agreement on the disengagement of troops in the Near East and Portugal's correction of its African policy should be noted. No one can reverse the process of decolonization. An end to the practices of apartheid and discrimination has been emphasized in General Assembly resolutions as a political condition for new international economic relations.152.	Since nuclei of colonialism still exist  it is appropriate for El Salvador emphatically to proclaim its support for the cause of anti-colonialism. Within the colonial system are included both the direct expressions of colonialism  which are clearly becoming fewer and the more subtle forms disguised by various methods and strategies. Claims against colonialism  in their focus  must assume various forms. It is to be hoped that in those regions where the burden of colonialism subsists  the principle of liberty will be claimed without losing sight of the fact that in every case and circumstance the idea of liberty without an economic basis lacks meaning  because it is only a liberty to enjoy what one has not and what  if the present international economic relations are maintained  one will never have.153.	On the other hand  in General Assembly resolution 2919 (XXVII) of 15 November 1972 the Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination was proclaimed  and its activities were inaugurated on 10 December 1973  when we commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That resolution is of historic significance because it clearly states the will of all peoples to eliminate racial discrimination. Such discrimination is an anachronism which denies freedom and can only be overcome if we turn our eyes towards the full observance of human rights and direct international action to that end. We know that this is a responsibility with which the United Nations has been charged since its inception. But we must renew our faith in so laudable an objective.154.	Since the United Nations is committed in various provisions of its Charter to attain and preserve human rights throughout the world  it must have the necessary instrument to discharge this duty fully. It is true that it is a valid legal concept that the establishment or restoration of human rights calls for priority in international action—action on whose effectiveness the establishment of a firm peace throughout the world largely depends.155.	We must single out the praiseworthy work of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression  which has submitted its final report to the General Assembly [AI9619 and Corr.l]. Aggression has been a subject for study almost since the very beginning of the United Nations  first under the responsibility of the International Law Commission  and later under the aforementioned Special Committee. It should be pointed out that the Special Committee  for methodological reasons  restricted itself in its work to direct aggression  as it indicated in one of its annual reports. Accordingly  there is lacking any consideration of the type of aggression most frequent in the twentieth century  namely economic aggression.156.	We recognize the progress achieved in this delicate matter  but we note that at present there are ever fewer cases of armed aggression and more and more cases of economic aggression. To reduce agreement to something which is historically in a process of debilitation while ignoring something that is increasing would be to perform something less than a service to the international community. Achievement of this end must be considered a first step  one to be completed with steps that will give real dimension and content to the first one.157.	The draft definition of aggression submitted to the General Assembly by the Special Committee on the Question of defining Aggression [ibid.  para. 22] makes no reference  not even the slightest  to the very important circumstance that aggression includes two types  direct and indirect  as the Special Committee itself took into consideration in the course of its labors and as is evident in its previous reports. The proposal is conceived in terms which suggest that direct aggression is the only possible type of aggression. It was to be expected that the final report of the Special Committee would be consistent with the methodological principles that it had adopted for the discharge of its mandate. It could have recalled what happened with indirect aggression  particularly with economic aggression  in the course of the agreements among the contact groups representing the three principal proposals that were submitted to the Special Committee. The concept of the articles proposed  presented in apparently unconditioned and exhaustive terms  converts all possible aggression into direct aggression consisting in the use of armed force  and  taking a part for the whole  weakens the positive value of the agreement obtained. That outcome favors the great Powers  because in the present state of international relations the cases mentioned in the report have almost Ceased to occur; meanwhile indirect aggression  in its various forms and gradations  remains in the shadows  in a sort of political limbo. It seems necessary to draw the attention of this Assembly to the fact that the definition proposed should be set out in dimensions appropriate to its nature and purposes.158.	I conclude these words by pointing out that the grief at this time being felt by all the countries of Central America serves to awaken feelings of solidarity that at times are momentarily forgotten. Though the enormity of the disasters varies  El Salvador shares with its sister Republics of Central America the same sufferings  a point which may itself be regarded as a promising factor for better understanding."
"111",6357,"SOM",29,1974,": It is for me a great honor and privilege to address this Assembly in my capacity both as current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity [OA U] and as head of State of the Somali Democratic Republic. It is a happy coincidence for me also to see this historic session of the General Assembly presided over by a great statesman and an outstanding son of Africa  Abdelaziz Bouteflika.65.	I take this opportunity to extend to you  Mr. President  our warm congratulations on your accession to the important office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Our satisfaction at your election to this high office arises first of all from the confidence we have in you because of the qualities of statesmanship you have so brilliantly demonstrated in the course of your long and distinguished career in international politics. It stems also from the close political and cultural ties that bind our two sister countries  both of which are members of OAU  the Arab League and the group of non-aligned States.66.	My sincere congratulations go also to Mr. Leopoldo Benites  whose illustrious and wise chairmanship guided us all so ably in the United Nations during the momentous period of the twenty-eighth session and the sixth special session of the General Assembly held in April 1974.67.	It is always a pleasant task to welcome newly independent countries to membership of the United Nations  and we are happy to extend our congratulations to Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau on their admission to membership of the Organization. In acquiring these new Members the United Nations has been brought closer to its goal of universality  and it will undoubtedly be strengthened by the additional contributions that will be made to its work for peace  justice and progress.68.	The ideals which brought OAU into being and which have sustained its vigorous life and growth are those cherished ideals which inspired the Charter of the United Nations. Faithful to those lofty principles  OAU seeks to complement rather than supplant the efforts of  the United Nations to produce an atmosphere of justice  freedom and progress for all mankind. The close co-operation between the two bodies should be intensified even more in the coming years to solve the vexing problems of our times and especially those which concern the twin scourges of racial and colonial domination and economic underdevelopment.69.	With OAU  as with the United Nations  achievements sometimes fall short of goals. But in working to promote peace and progress on the African continent through political  economic and social cooperation on the basis of African solidarity  and in using non-alignment as the governing principle of its external relations  OAU contributes to the consolidation of international peace and security and the development of co-operation among States.70.	The evil forces of colonialism and racism still remain the most pressing problems facing both OAU and the United Nations. The struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination in southern Africa and elsewhere has long presented a challenge to all men of good will. The major initiatives taken by the African Members of the United Nations in keeping these issues before the conscience of the world have been an important factor in establishing their prominence in international affairs. But the campaign against colonialism and racial discrimination is a world responsibility  not just an African responsibility  for the evils which the campaign seeks to eliminate run counter to the basic principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.71.	The dramatic developments in the situation in southern Africa brought about by the change of Government in Portugal should elicit the support and sympathy of the world community. These developments have opened the way for extensive progress to be made towards the fulfillment of the long-standing goals of the world Organization in its pursuit of peace  justice and freedom.72.	The leaders of the new Portuguese regime are to be congratulated on realizing the futility of a colonial war. In recognizing the sovereignty of Guinea-Bissau and promising full and orderly independence for Mozambique in June 1975  and in declaring its commitment soon to grant independence to Angola  Sao Tome and Principe and the Cape Verde Islands  the Portuguese Government has shown political vision and wisdom. It is a matter of great pride for Africa and for the United Nations  which has done much to further the cause of freedom and justice that Guinea-Bissau is amongst us today as a sovereign State. In reality  Portugal has not given away anything it had not already lost  but that does not lessen its credit for averting further bloodshed.73.	While Africa will reciprocate the good will of the new regime in Portugal by ending decades of diplomatic isolation and centuries of African resentment towards that country  yet we are watching anxiously and with the utmost vigilance the pace of progress towards independence for all the Portuguese colonies in Africa. Thus  our degree of appreciation for Portugal will depend on how far it fulfills its solemn obligations and undertakings in implementing its policy of independence for the remaining African Territories under its control  namely  Angola  the Cape Verde Islands  Sao Tome and Principe. The Assembly is aware of the fact that there are reactionary forces that may try to obstruct and sabotage the progress of emancipation for the African peoples concerned.74.	In addition  during the crucial period following their independence  the new African States emerging from colonial rule will require material  technical and even military assistance to consolidate their hard-won independence and to promote their economic development and national reconstruction. The United Nations with its special committees on decolonization  apartheid and Namibia should  in co-operation with OAU  prepare a comprehensive plan which will take into account all foreseeable requirements and eventualities. We feel strongly that only thus can we safeguard the newly emerging independent African States and provide them with an opportunity to consolidate their independence and national development.75.	Having given that solemn warning against undue complacency which might tempt hostile forces to reverse the policy of mutual understanding and co-operation now unfolding in Afro-Portuguese relations  I should like to state for the record  on behalf of OAU  that Africa is ready to extend friendship and co-opera-tion to Portugal and its people. They should have no fear for the safety of their people  property and interests in liberated Africa. It is not in the nature of the Africans to be vindictive. Africa has amply demonstrated to the world that its former colonialists can live in peace and prosperity as long as they are willing to abide by the laws of the country in which they reside. The Portuguese are no exception  and we are confident that they will have greater peace in liberated Africa than they had in Africa under Portuguese colonial domination. We Africans have suffered for centuries from discrimination on grounds of racialism and so we are ever on guard against inverse racialism.76.	The current events in Africa have demonstrated beyond doubt the effectiveness of the armed struggle waged by African liberation movements against colonial and racist domination. When the colonialists and racists rejected our pleas and peaceful gestures  as put forth in the Lusaka Manifesto  Africa realized that armed struggle was the only avenue open to subjected African peoples to liberate themselves from colonial bondage and racist domination. It was in this spirit that the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU held at Rabat in 1972 endorsed the historic Mogadiscio Declaration.77.	The present developments in Africa have illustrated also the importance and effectiveness of the United Nations campaign against colonialism and racial discrimination. That campaign elicited from the world community a great deal of moral and material support for the liberation movements  which were given the means and the courage to continue their struggle in the knowledge that they did not stand alone. In this connexion  we would like to express our profound thanks and deep appreciation to the socialist and Scandinavian countries and the countries of the third world for their constructive attitude and support to the cause of African liberation.78.	The Organization of African Unity can take particular pride in the part its members played in working for United Nations recognition of the legitimacy of the liberation struggle and in making the organization a source of and channel for aid.79.	It is to be hoped that those lessons are now understood by those who have tended to underrate the effectiveness of the liberation movements  to discredit the international campaign and to question the value of the allegedly unenforceable resolutions of the United Nations. Those lessons should be taken to heart  particularly by the racist minority regimes which continue to operate in the remaining pockets of colonial and racist domination and which are even now attempting to undermine the progress attained in the decolonization process.80.	The momentum of these times must be used to press home a campaign that will complete the process of decolonization and to end the dehumanizing policies of apartheid. The United Nations must continue to expose South Africa's main trading partners  to condemn the violators of sanctions against Southern Rhodesia  and to identify those Governments and corporations whose activities in Namibia are in direct contravention of the findings of the International Court of Justice and the provisions of relevant resolutions of the United Nations.81.	There is no question about the extent and urgency of the task that still remains to be completed in southern Africa. In the case of Zimbabwe  the genuine political representatives of the people are either in prison  in exile or muzzled by the tyrannical regime which is steadily increasing the pace of its application of apartheid policies and yet successive British Governments  whatever their political coloring  have not recognized their political  legal and moral obligation to use all means  including the threat or use of force  to end the tragedy that is unfolding in Southern Rhodesia.82.	The grave escalation of repressive measures against the people of Namibia must be of particular concern to the United Nations because of its special responsibility for that Territory. Here is another area where there must be an intensification of aid to the liberation movements which represent the oppressed people of Namibia  and a universal campaign should be launched to inform international public opinion on this question. In this regard  attention must be directed to those financial and other interests which recognize and support South Africa's illegal administration over the Territory in order to exploit the Territory's natural resources.83.	We feel that the time has come for more drastic and concrete action to be taken by this world body against the racist regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury. The presence of the South African regime in the Organization is unjustified  and indeed a liability to this world body. It is gratifying to learn that the Credentials Committee at the present session has taken a historic decision in rejecting the credentials of this regime. That decision reflects the state of high political maturity reached by the Members of the Organization  and we trust that the Security Council will accept it as reflecting the general consensus of this Assembly. I therefore appeal to the Member States to support the call for the expulsion of the racist regime of South Africa. This is the only meaningful step which can be taken in view of the chronic refusal on the part of the South African regime to comply with the rulings of the United Nations. This step should be followed up by economic sanctions and by the tightening up of the arms embargo.84.	We call especially upon the Western Powers to use their decisive influence to induce the racist regimes of Salisbury and Pretoria to accept the implementation of the just resolutions of the United Nations. We feel sure that without the material and economic assistance of those Western Powers the racist regimes of southern Africa would soon be brought to reason.85.	I take the opportunity to mention other countries that are also being denied their right to freedom and self-determination  namely  Spanish Sahara  Seychelles and French Somaliland. These Territories are retained by the big colonial Powers primarily because of their economic  commercial and strategic value. Both OAU and the United Nations have long pressed for the complete and unconditional independence of those Territories. It is the earnest hope of OAU that the Assembly at its present session will intensify its pressure so as to attain self-determination for these peoples.86.	Before concluding my remarks on the African liberation struggle  let me also say a few words about those other parts of the third world suffering from imperial domination. The cause of the progressive forces in the pursuit of justice and freedom and their struggle against the evil forces of imperialism  colonialism and neo-colonialism is a reflection of con-temporary world developments. The trend of world events demonstrates that the struggle of people for independence represents an irresistible force which can never be stopped or weakened. We are observing with admiration the many successes scored by the liberation movements and progressive forces in different parts of the world in their efforts to secure their freedom and human dignity. It is incumbent upon the Organization to support a"" subjected peoples in the attainment of their just cause and the fulfillment of their human aspirations.87.	In this connexion  we call for withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea  Viet Nam and Cambodia  and we demand that the people in these Territories be allowed to shape their own political future without any foreign intervention or external pressure. The right to self-determination and the fundamental principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of States  both enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  should be strictly observed and given full expression in our inter-State relations.88.	Another vital issue of immediate concern to us is the Middle East crisis. The Middle East situation is of particular importance to OAU  since it involves the Arab Republic of Egypt  a founding member of that Organization. The OAU has spared no efforts to reason with the Israeli authorities in the hope that they would change their callous negative attitude and comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions calling upon Israel to evacuate the Arab lands it is illegally occupying and to restore the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine. But Israel chose to turn a deaf ear to our appeals  and consequently almost all the OAU Member States have severed diplomatic relations with Israel. With the blessing of some Powers  that country continues to persist with impunity in its defiance of universal public opinion and international morality.89.	The disengagement of Arab and Israeli forces on the Egyptian and Syrian fronts is no cause for complacency. The situation in the Middle East will continue to be dangerously explosive so long as Israel remains in illegal occupation of Arab territory and so long as the rights of the Palestinian people are ignored and so long as Jerusalem remains in Israeli hands.90.	The illegality of Israel's occupation of Arab territory is compounded by its active promotion of permanent Israeli settlements on the Golan Heights  the West Bank of the Jordan  in the Gaza Strip and the Sinai peninsula. In a policy of open expansionism  more settlements of Israelis have been established on occupied Arab territory since 1967 than in Israel itself. Israel has also made no secret of its intention to annex Jerusalem and to alter the demographic and Arab character of the City.91.	But that is not the end of these tragic developments. Israel continues to commit acts of aggression against the neighboring independent Arab States. The frequent military incursions into Lebanese territory  in violation of that country's sovereignty and territorial integrity  and the indiscriminate bombing of Lebanon's civilian population illustrate how far the Israelis are prepared to go beyond the rule of international law and beyond the norms of civilized behavior between States.92.	By acknowledging the Palestinian issue as a separate item on the agenda of this session  we are putting the Middle East conflict in its true perspective  and this reflects the mature development of the world body in coming to grips with the heart of the matter. The suffering and injustice inflicted on the people of Palestine for more than a quarter of a century is a tale of woe that defies any description. If there could ever be a crime against humanity in the same league as nazism and apartheid  it is this. What is even more tragic and depressing is that the principal perpetrators of this serious crime happen to be the very people who were themselves the victims of nazism.93.	The Organization of African Unity recognized long ago that the issue of the Palestinian people is a matter meriting special emphasis  and that is why the Palestine Liberation Organization was given observer status in that Organization.94.	Confronted by this problem  with all its implications for the countries of the area  we can no longer afford to bury our heads in the sand like ostriches. We should recognize the inevitability  indeed the desirability  of a Palestinian State; and once that is accepted in principle by all concerned  including the world Organization  then and only then can we hope to be on the threshold of peace in the area.95.	The solidarity of African States in support of the Arab cause has always been  and continues to be  solely a matter of principle. It constitutes a clear testimony to the determination of member States of OAU to support peoples fighting for their land  their freedom and their dignity  to support a member of the regional organization whose territory continues under military occupation and to support a cardinal principle of international peace and security.96.	The recent October war in the Middle East not only brought victory to the heroic Arab peoples  particularly those of Egypt and Syria  but also confirmed the bonds of friendship and solidarity between African and Arab peoples in their just struggle against imperialism  racism and zionism. The basis of Afro-Arab co-operation lies in the pursuit of common objectives by the African and Arab peoples in their commitment to achieve the total liberation of their territories and to speed up their economic development. The bonds between the two peoples have always remained firm and unshakable. Africa and the Arab world have been and are linked by similar experiences; they are committed to the same ideals and principles and are facing a common enemy in their struggle for freedom  peace and justice. There is a special relationship between OAU and the League of Arab States both of which have common aims and principles. It is important to stress here that the two organizations are complementary to the United Nations and that they are firmly committed to the furtherance of the principles of international peace and co-operation set out in the Charter of the United Nations.97.	The tragic events in Cyprus are yet another major concern to the United Nations. It is significant that we should address ourselves here to the fundamental issues regarding the present crisis in Cyprus. In this connexion  we feel that all the parties concerned should meet under the auspices of the United Nations with a view to seeking ways and means towards an appropriate settlement. To restore peace and stability in the island  we should ensure that the Cypriot people are allowed to determine their own political future.98.	Regarding the international climate  we are satisfied with the efforts of the Soviet Union and the United States of America to reduce tension and eliminate sources of conflict in the interest of world peace and security. We have been following with interest the major steps taken by the two big Powers to lessen the threat of cold war and to normalize relations as a contribution to peace and co-operation. We also noted with appreciation the recent dramatic events in the international situation  notably China's recovery of its rights within the United Nations  the acceptance ofEast and West Germany as full Members of the United Nations  the East/West summit meetings  and the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.99.	While we welcome the progress that has been made towards East/West detente  we are also shocked by the tragic developments occurring in many parts of the world. It is significant to point out here that the accomplishment of peace within the industrialized world alone does not necessarily mean world peace.100.	I am sure that the Assembly is fully informed about the serious developments in the Indian Ocean where strategic naval bases of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been established. This is a direct threat to the peace and security of Africa and particularly of those countries adjacent to the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean should remain as it was in the past  a zone of peace  free from any big-Power confrontations. We therefore call upon all Powers that have strategic bases in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere to dismantle those bases immediately in the interest of world peace and security.101.	Speaking on the role and the functioning of the United Nations  it is important to emphasize the need to review the basic structures and institutions set out in the Charter. The United Nations cannot continue as a static Organization. It is imperative that we assess its current structural weaknesses and suggest remedial measures. The scope of its powers should be widened  some of its basic organs should be made more representative and  above all  it must be vested with more effective authority to satisfy the demands and aspirations of mankind. The role of the Organization in its quest for peace and progress calls for a new approach as well as firm dedication in dealing with pressing international problems. What we urgently need is a genuine world body vested with the powers and authority required for the realization of its declared aims and objectives.102.	In this connexion  the big Powers have a major part to play. Instead of acting individually or unilaterally in their peace efforts  it would be more desirable if they supported and co-operated with the United Nations in its peace-keeping operations. This would be a major contribution to a more effective discharge of its functions by the Organization.103.	Despite its legal and practical limitations  the United Nations has on many occasions demonstrated its capacity to deal with major international issues. As an experiment in universal co-operation among nations  its capabilities and potentialities for world peace cannot be underestimated. It is our only hope for survival in our time. I am confident  therefore  that it will continue to be a major source for peace  progress and prosperity of mankind.104.	I should like now to say a few words on some of the major economic and social problems that are facing not only the African countries but also most of the developing countries.105.	The important and historic resolutions adopted by the Assembly during the sixth special session on raw materials and development  convened on the initiative of President Houari Boumediene of Algeria  provided an equitable basis for future international economic co-operation. We have high hopes that those resolutions will be fully implemented.106.	The road to social transformation is long and arduous and the constraints to real development have both internal and external dimensions. Developing countries are fully prepared to tackle their own internal problems. The situation is  however  made all the more difficult and complicated by the volatile nature of certain factors outside the control of the developing countries. These are international trade  inflation  monetary crises  the insensitivity of the world's richest countries to the problems of the poor and  above all  aggression and insecurity. The world's consciousness of these problems has been heightened and the developing countries are completely aware of the causes of their plight. This is a great achievement. Once the true diagnosis is made  the most effective remedy can be prescribed.107.	Economic and social transformation of developing countries is the responsibility of those countries themselves. That responsibility cannot be delegated. Transfer of resources from developed countries to developing countries can only supplement domestic effort; it cannot supplant it. Only through self-reliance and complete commitment to economic and social transformation can developing countries be the masters of their destiny. It is imperative that agriculture  industry and human development be given top priority in consolidating national economies and in striving to abolish complete dependence on developed countries for markets  technology and manpower.108.	The unfavorable economic position of the developing countries is the result of the inequitable position in which they have been placed by the capitalist international division of labor.109.	The developing countries are raw material producers whose prices in the world market have been declining in relation to those of the more sophisticated manufactured and processed goods. Even with today's unprecedented rise in prices for all commodities  the relative increase in raw-material prices in general is far less than the rise for manufactured goods  and consequently the terms of trade of developing countries have deteriorated even further.110.	The situation is untenable  and in the absence of an international mechanism to solve the problem  it can be redressed only through concerted action on the part of the developing countries. It is only logical that developing countries should form producers' associations and exert pressure jointly for fair returns on their real resources  so that they may achieve equality in international and economic relations among nations.111.	In establishing a new international order  the method by which the transfer of resources is affected  and its magnitude  should be changed in conformity with the real needs of developing countries. Developed countries have both a moral obligation and a self- interest in participating in the development of developing countries. In order that such participation may be meaningful  the transfer of resources has to be adequate in volume  reliable in supply  and soft in terms and conditions. Aid must be free from military alliance and be completely united to purchases from the donor countries. It is also appropriate to ensure more transfer of resources to areas where needs are felt most acutely. I have in mind here the least developed among the developing countries  and the areas that have been hard hit by natural catastrophes  especially the Sahel  some of the east African countries  Bangladesh and Honduras.112.	Another major problem is inflation. It is a phenomenon which has arisen entirely in developed capitalist countries and has been transmitted to the developing countries. The dominance of the multi-national companies  their struggle for markets  raw materials and investment opportunities in developing countries  and the high degree of militarism aimed at stifling national independence and social revolution in the third world  have introduced a world-wide inflationary pressure that is robbing developing countries of their real resources. The so-called oil crisis has been projected as the cause of world inflation. This is a calculated move to divide developing countries and to negate their new gains. If the fundamentals are to be tackled  it is imperative that we direct our attention more to the major capitalist exploitations  especially the enormous profits of oil companies; to the introduction of a more equitable division of labor in international trade; to a reduction of militarism abroad; and to genuine reform of the international monetary system.113.	A major problem that confronts most African countries in their development efforts results from the constraints imposed by the smallness of their markets and by the lack of genuine common markets at sub- regional levels. As a first step towards greater integration  the water tight compartments into which African countries are placed in respect of telecommunication networks  airlines  postal services  banking  highways and sea transport have to be dismantled. We see an urgent need for quick and fruitful action in this direction.114.	An immediate and pressing task for international action is that of dealing with the effects of the drought that hap been experienced in countries all around the world but which has been a disaster of incalculable proportions in the Sahelian countries and in Ethiopia. African States are grateful for the generous assistance that has been received from many countries and many international organizations. However  since there are strong indications that the drought has become a permanent phenomenon because of fundamental changes in world climatic conditions  it is necessary that this phenomenon continue to be studied  that regional and international machinery for dealing with its effects continue to operate  and that relief programs be established on a permanent basis.115.	Although positive developments have taken place in Africa and in international affairs as a whole  the difficult problems which lie ahead continue to pose a serious challenge to the Organization. We still live in a world divided between rich and poor; a world where imperialism  colonialism  neo-colonialism and racism still exist in many of its parts; a world which is still under the threat of nuclear war; a world that is governed by economic systems which are unjust. I am sure that none of us has any illusions about the magnitude of these problems.116.	In dealing with these pressing issues there is a need for closer co-operation and understanding among nations at both regional and international levels. All countries  particularly the big Powers  should have greater faith and trust in the United Nations as a peace-keeping organ  thereby increasing its strength and effectiveness. In an interdependent world there must be a global approach to the solution of international problems. The Organization of African Unity will continue to make valuable contributions to the United Nations by promoting its international role and increasing its effectiveness.117.	Before I conclude  I will in the name of OAU and in my capacity as Soman head of State  to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  for his dedication to the work of this great Organization. Since his accession to the office of Secretary-General  he has exerted determined efforts in promoting the cause of peace  justice and freedom. May I extend to him and his staff our warm congratulations.118.	I am fully confident that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will bring about adequate solutions to the pressing international problems facing us  thus fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of mankind. I wish you every success in your work and I thank you for giving me this opportunity to address you here."
"112",6521,"SWE",29,1974,"On behalf of Sweden  I wish to join in the congratulations that have been addressed to Foreign Minister Bouteflika on his election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. The high responsibilities entrusted to him testify to the important role of Algeria in international politics today  as well as to his own outstanding qualities as a statesman. The excellent relations that exist between Sweden and Algeria are an added reason to express pleasure in seeing him occupy this distinguished office.182.	Let me take this opportunity also to thank Mr. Leopoldo Benites for his outstanding work as President of the General Assembly at its last two sessions.183.	Since last year's general debate important  often dramatic  events have occurred which clearly have influenced relations between countries and groups of countries. Those events have illustrated both the possibilities and the limitations of our Organization.184.	Since this is the first time that I have spoken before the General Assembly  let me confirm the determination of my Government to support  as before  all efforts to strengthen the authority of theUnited Nations and its capacity to further the aims of the Charter. At the same time  Sweden consistently pursues a policy of non-alignment in peace aiming at neutrality in time of war.185.	These two principles in Swedish foreign policy have the overwhelming support of public opinion in Sweden. They supplement each other.186.	We are deeply aware of the connexion between peace and security in Europe  global detente and disarmament  a more just relationship between rich and poor nations  and respect for the right of all peoples to decide their own future. We have found that the aims of our foreign policy  as I have described them  give rise to expectations that Sweden should make active contributions in these various fields. At times they may also give us special opportunities to act.187.	The Organization should be a forum where all peoples can present their policies and defend their interests. That is also what we need in order to tackle the immense problems which now confront us and which concern all human beings. In this spirit I wish to welcome our new Members  Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau.188.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and development  became a milestone in the history of the United Nations. It stressed the increasing interdependence between all countries. It made clear that co-operation on equal terms between developed and developing countries is a necessary condition for the progress and development of the world community. This is also true for the fight against world inflation.189.	The gap between rich and poor nations is widening. The world's resources are unequally distributed. They are scarce  and tend to become even more so  in relation to a growing world population that expects at least satisfaction of basic needs for food  housing and employment. A more just world economic order must be created  where the rich countries show restraint in the use of the world's resources. We must be aware of the limits of what the human environment can bear when the world's resources are being exploited at a rapidly increasing pace.190.	The World Population Conference in Bucharest emphasized  in its Plan of Action  the relationship between  on the one hand  population trends and  on the other hand  economic and social conditions  as well as the distribution of the world's limited resources.191.	Today millions of people suffer from hunger. If we do not succeed in solving the problems of food production  we have to reckon with the fearful prospect of new millions being condemned to malnutrition and premature death. The World Food Conference in Rome must be followed by concrete measures and commitments.192.	The next session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea must establish conditions for the exploitation of the oceans with a view to guaranteeing good management and fair distribution of their wealth.193.	The United Nations has to come to grips with the problems arising from conflicts between growing multinational enterprises and the legitimate needs and claims of individual countries.194.	The world conferences in 1974 and 1975  together with the review of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade  provide a unique opportunity to work out an integrated approach to problems of global development. We regard this work as an indispensable part of the efforts to secure peace in a long-term perspective.195.	Of equal importance is the work of the United Nations to avert and overcome crises which constitute imminent threats to peace and security  and to create the foundation for lasting peace by means of disarmament.196.	The Charter of the United Nations places the main responsibility for peace and security on the permanent members of the Security Council. This assumes a willingness and ability on the part of the States to reach agreement. Two of them  the United States and the Soviet Union  have come to play a special role on account of their economic strength and their military resources  particularly in the field of nuclear weapons. All attempts to limit their immense armaments should be greeted with satisfaction. The results so far  however  have been quite inadequate. No efficient barriers have yet been created to halt the development of their most destructive weapons. The cessation of all nuclear testing still meets resistance. The unwillingness or inability of the leading nuclear-weapon States to live up to their commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is one of the reasons why the Treaty has not gained  sufficient support. The threat increases that nuclear arms may be produced by a growing number  of countries. Six Powers have carried out nuclear explosions during the past year. A strengthening of the control of fissionable material is a matter which requires urgent international attention. The multilateral agreements which have so far been reached in the field of armaments are of limited value. The negotiations on a ban on chemical weapons proceed only too slowly. The efforts to prohibit the use of particularly cruel weapons have not yet resulted in any decisions.197.	States Members of the United Nations must raise their voices to make it clear that practical results are now needed in the struggle against war and the means of war.198.	The United States and the Soviet Union have tended to seek bilateral understanding also on other vital issues. The efforts towards detente by these Powers seem to imply mutual recognition of  and respect for  the interests of the other party as well as an understanding to follow closely and to attempt to limit any crisis which ultimately may lead to a major war. Agreements between them for these purposes are essential for lasting world peace. However  this policy also entails problems for States and peoples whose legitimate interests may not be duly taken into account. The policy of detente is incomplete as long as it does not tackle the basic political problems which create local tensions and conflicts.199.	The great Powers have in a number of cases been anxious to anchor their agreements in decisions by the United Nations. If other Member States are given reasonable opportunities to influence the final results of negotiations  such ratification by the world community is in the interest of all. Confidence in the United Nations is strengthened. All States are given joint responsibility for translating the agreements into practical action and for making them a basis for peaceful and permanent solutions.200.	There is anxiety in many quarters that States commanding superior resources may use them in order to influence internal political developments in smaller countries. The Charter of the United Nations as well as the Declaration on Principles of Inter-national Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations [resolution 2625 (XXV)  annex] aims at establishing protection against such interference. The Declaration emphasizes that every State has the duty to respect the right of all peoples freely to determine  without external interference  their political  economic and social conditions. It is emphatically stated that no nation shall""... organize  assist  foment  finance  incite or tolerate subversive  terrorist or armed activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the regime of another State  or interfere in civil strife in another State"".Evidently those principles are as binding for great Powers as for small nations. No State may evade those obligations by referring  for instance  to interests of national security.201.	The tragic fate of Cyprus is a matter of serious concern for the United Nations and its Members. No one can deny that the crisis was triggered by the irresponsible policies of the earlier Greek regime. The dangers of expansionist dictatorship  lacking democratic support  have again been demonstrated. We welcome the fact that the people of Greece will have the opportunity to shape its own destiny.202.	The military intervention of Turkey in Cyprus could be viewed against the background of 10 years of unsuccessful attempts to regulate the relationship between the two population groups on the island and the situation that suddenly arose this past summer; but in the light of the Charter  the Turkish intervention is a matter for serious concern. Today there is an urgent need for clear confirmation that the objective of the intervention is restricted to maintaining the independence of Cyprus and protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish minority.203.	In our opinion  any settlement of the Cyprus problem must provide guarantees for the independence and territorial integrity of the country. Independent Cyprus must also be enabled to continue its policy of non-alignment. Sweden does not try to persuade other States to adopt a policy of non- alignment but regards it as essential that such a policy  once freely chosen  be respected. Strategic interests must not take precedence over the right to self-determination of small countries.204.	In the other serious conflict in the Eastern Mediterranean  the United Nations involvement dates back to the role played by the General Assembly in the question of Palestine during the years immediately following the Second World War. Time and again basic United Nations principles have been violated in the tense situation that has since then prevailed in that area. Negotiations aiming at a peaceful solution did not prove possible. The way in which the great Powers pursued their interests  often in competition with each other  contributed for a long time to the aggravation of the situation. When they changed their policies in the direction of mutual detente  they left the Middle East problem as deadlocked as before. It was a tragic paradox that a new military flare-up became a precondition for the active involvement of the great Powers in bringing about negotiations which might open up prospects for a settlement. The world now waits with impatience for the parties to begin at last substantive negotiations in Geneva. It is obvious that the endeavours towards a lasting peace in the area must be based on certain principles which have gained widespread support among the Members of the United Nations. The acquisition of territory by war is not admissible. The right of the State of Israel to exist must be clearly recognized. All States in the area must be able to live in security. The legitimate interests of the Palestinian Arabs must be satisfied. The responsibility of the United Nations for any solution that may be reached must be clearly stated.205.	The United Nations has been kept out of the problems in a third conflict area  IndoChina; but important principles of the United Nations have been at stake in the Viet Nam conflict. Resistance to a necessary process of decolonization lay behind the many years of cruel and brutal fighting. The Paris Agreement put an end to the extensive and direct great-Power intervention; but fighting is still going on in Viet Nam  and tens of thousands of human lives are being sacrificed. This is because the fundamental political problems have not been solved in accordance with the Agreement. In particular it is obvious that the Saigon Administration has no intention of implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement. A devastating war is driving Cambodia ever deeper into chaos and misery. The United States still bears a heavy responsibility for the absence of a solution to the problems in IndoChina. It should also be noted that the Paris Agreement provides for international machinery to be put into effect should the Agreement be violated; but this machinery has not yet been used.206.	The continuous debate and pressure of opinion within the United Nations led to the increasing international isolation of the former Portuguese regime and eroded the basis for its antiquated colonial policy. Within Portugal  strong popular forces carried on a courageous struggle against the dictatorship and its policies.207.	The liberation movements in Africa contributed to creating a new situation. Portuguese soldiers and officers who all too long had been forced to fight a meaningless war without hope decided one day to set their country upon the path of democracy and human rights. Thereby the road was cleared for negotiations on a peaceful liquidation of colonial rule. The new Portuguese Government has shown a constructive attitude which deserves the appreciation of the international community. The African States and the liberation movements have important tasks to fulfill in the final solution of the problems of decolonization. GuinearBissau has already gained independence. Mozambique has taken decisive steps in the same direction. In Angola  it is necessary to create appropriate and effective forms for the transition from colonial rule to true independence. Sweden has  within the .framework of international law  supported and will continue to support the forces striving for decolonization.208.	Our Organization must now consider how to tackle the problems of Southern Rhodesia  Namibia and South Africa. Great vigilance is called for against any effort to secure or expand white minority rule. The sanctions against the illegal regime in Southern Rhodesia must be made more effective. The Smith regime has every reason to fear future developments. Nor can the white ruling class in South Africa remain unaffected by the ever stronger winds of change.209.	The United Nations must increase its efforts to make South Africa abandon its abhorrent policy of apartheid and respect United Nations decisions on Namibia. The non-white majority in South Africa deserves all possible support in its struggle for liberation. Sweden is prepared to make practical contributions to the efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia.210.	When the United Nations was founded  problems such as apartheid were considered to be outside the competence of the Organization. Developments since then have meant the rejection of too narrow an interpretation of the expression  in Article 2  paragraph 7  of the Charter  ""matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State"".211.	In a similar way  the United Nations has demonstrated a growing interest in human rights  traditional civil rights as well as economic and social rights  which have a decisive importance for safeguarding human dignity and for offering a better life to all inhabitants of the earth. There are still no means available to induce Member States to respect those rights even when they are stipulated in conventions and solemn declarations. A wide gap often appears between legal documents and reality. But public opinion must constantly be mobilized in support of human rights. Non-governmental organizations have an important task to fulfill in this field. Commitments made by Governments must be observed. New commitments must be prepared. This work also serves the cause of peace and detente. Extreme violations of human rights evoke international tension. The campaign of protest against the brutal regime in Chile is a case in point. The new rulers of Chile must be reminded that the exercise of power based on brute force can only bring misery to the people and dishonor to the country.212.	Only through strenuous work for justice in relations among nations  as well as among citizens in any one nation  can the United Nations realize the ideas embodied in its Charter."
"113",6564,"SWZ",29,1974,"Mr. President  those who have addressed this Assembly before me have ably expressed their congratulations to you on your unanimous election as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Allow me  nevertheless  to add the cordial greetings and congratulations of His Majesty King Sobhuza II  the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland.2.	Your distinguished career as leader of your great country  Algeria  and your well-known and tested experience in international affairs are qualities that eminently make you suited to preside over the deliberations of this Assembly  convened as it is for the first time since the sixth special session  of which your country was the initiator and in which it played a very important role.3.	My delegation is confident that the deliberations of this Assembly under your able guidance will succeed and contribute towards removing the obstacles that lie in the way of peace  justice  progress and international understanding.4.	The onerous duties of your high office  Mr. President  were efficiently discharged last year by your predecessor  the representative of the Republic of Ecuador  Mr. Leopoldo Benites.5.	The maintenance of international peace and security  by efforts to harmonize the actions of nations through the Organization  is one of the principal aims of the Charter. In this regard  my delegation warmly welcomes the newly independent States of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau into the fold of free and sovereign nations. The admission of these three new Member nations  in the view of my delegation  is a silver lining in a sky overcast with clouds of dubiousness about the universality of this supreme body.6.	The serious thing for the United Nations is that problems of world peace  justice and progress  to the solution of which this Assembly rededicated itself at the twenty-fifth session  have not diminished. Our world has no shortage of problems. It is constantly being terrorized by war and local wars  division  oppression  poverty and hunger  inflation  unemployment  decline in production  social demands and financial shortages. All these are with us left  right and center  and are sprouting all over the globe  like thorns in the flesh. Even before the recent increase in the price of oil and other commodities  the world economy was in a state of disorder. World-wide inflation and monetary instability are the major causes of that disorder.7.	Although the industrialized world experienced a remarkable economic growth during recent years  the developing countries never really participated in this development. In fact  their terms of trade constantly deteriorated  causing balance-of-payments problems and slowing down economic growth. At the same time  the relative magnitude of official development assistance declined.8.	The recent increase in oil prices and in the cost of essential products such as fertilizers  insecticides and base chemicals has aggravated the problems immensely. Already part of the world? s population is experiencing severe food shortages  and every effort should be made to increase world agricultural output.9.	Now that even the developed world is experiencing acute balance-of-payments deficits and unacceptable inflation rates  the dangers of increased monetary stringency  even higher interest rates and a general economic recession are imminent. Imports of primary commodities  most of them supplied by developing countries  will fall  with the ensuing effect on prices and export receipts.10.	My delegation sincerely hopes that a solution will be found whereby capital may be recycled from the strongest world economies to the weakest. Whatever solution is found  it is essential that the resistance rendered to the less developed countries be equivalent to the loss incurred by them and that such assistance be given on concessional terms in order not to increase further the financial burden of the recipient countries.11.	In this connexion  my country attaches great importance to the co-ordination we expect will be achieved as a result of holding the sixth special session of the Assembly  and we look forward to reaping the/ benefit of the establishment of a new international economic order  which we trust will not become a dead letter to be found in the archives of this Organization.12.	Finally  my delegation feels that the difficulty in controlling the world-wide activities of multinational companies justifies examination by this Assembly. Although their provision of capital and know- how is important for the development of the less developed world  questions on the equal distribution of benefits and power remain.13.	With the independence of Guinea-Bissau  with the restoration of the rights of the people of Mozambique which will soon lead that country to complete independence and with the blueprint for Angola's independence now a reality  Africa has moved closer to its main goal of territorial freedom and unity. My delegation views the installation of the transitional Government led by the Frente de Libertasao de Mozambique [FRELIMO] in Mozambique as a good sign for peace in southern Africa.14.	The disturbances in Mozambique that followed the historic Lusaka Agreement between the FRELIMO leadership and the Portuguese Government were unfortunate and uncalled for. The Lusaka Agreement itself  seen in its true perspective  is a brilliant victory of the vision and diplomacy of all those who have contributed by their sacrifices to the liberation of Mozambique. To Africa  the Agreement is an unmistakable prelude to the complete decolonization of the African continent.15.	The recent attitude of the Portuguese Government in facing up to the truth about the rights of people of their former Territories  particularly their right to self-determination and national independence  should inspire all peace-loving people of the world to cooperate in closing honorably the rather soiled pages of the history of Portugal. In this regard  my delegation joins those States which have called on the Angolan nationalists to close ranks and work for the immediate independence of their country on the basis of majority rule.16.	We in Swaziland sincerely hope for and look forward to a speedy solution of the political dilemma in Namibia. The people of Namibia  like any other people  are entitled to self-determination to allow them to achieve complete independence and majority rule. Swaziland's policy remains strongly that of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other States. But this policy is irreconcilable with any form of denial of fundamental human rights.17.	We have all of us  as Members of the United Nations  collective and individual responsibility to engender proper respect for the authority of the Organization  so that the brotherhood of men can be a practical reality in our world. All African States uphold the policy of good neighborliness  .and one would rightly assume that all desire to practice it. Racial and discriminatory policies militate against fundamental human rights and the establishment of fruitful and normal relations between men.18.	The settlers' regime in Rhodesia should learn the lesson of Portugal and settle for peace with the majority. My delegation is of the opinion that the British Government which  after 10 years of illegal rule in Rhodesia  is still responsible for that Territory is able and equipped to transfer power to the people of Zimbabwe. So long as the privileged minority is allowed political power  it will not voluntarily give it away. Yet self-determination is vital for the survival of Africa and independence a necessary base for its unity. All Africa must be free in order to unite.19.	In the unfolding panorama of the Middle East an uneasy calm still reigns. Attempts to secure and to confirm true national sovereignty for the Arabs as well as for Israel are being hindered by disharmony  suspicion and mistrust. These are human attitudes attitudes of one State towards another  attitudes of one racial group towards another attitudes of one power bloc towards another. Nevertheless  all of us should have long realized that in the Middle East  we as human beings are faced with one fundamental need  that is  for peaceful coexistence in that area so that the potential resources  both human and natural  could be harnessed to create a climate for a new society that should ""learn war no more"".20.	Peace in the Middle East has become a national issue for all of us  for the survival of an international society is inherent in reciprocity and interdependence of nations. The absence of peace in the Middle East means the absence of peace in the world. It is in this spirit that my delegation would like to express appreciation and admiration to all the parties concerned in the Middle East conflict for showing human understanding and seeking a solution through negotiation. We admire also the diplomatic efforts of the leaders in that area in co-operating with those of the United States and the Soviet Union in bringing about better prospects for peace. All men of good conscience who value human life are encouraged by these prospects of lasting peace in that war-torn zone.21.	Nor is the Middle East the only area of an in-creasing gravity that threatens such world peace and security. The continuing failure to reach a lasting solution in Cyprus through the apparatus set up by this Assembly is now an obvious handicap to the people of Cyprus in dealing with their own problems in their own way.22.	The fabric of national unity is being woven in countries still divided and torn by conflicts  and a pattern of national existence is being developed  but not with ease. In the spirit of non-alignment  my delegation applauds these processes and in no circumstances will it take any action that could be seen to prejudice their fuller development.23.	The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the people of Cambodia are capable of solving their problems without outside intervention  and we maintain that they need the necessary encouragement from this Assembly to do so. This principle is equally applicable to North and South Korea in the present circumstances.24.	My delegation would suggest  in connexion with the Korean question  the following: (a) that the Secretary-General institute a special commission to find out what it is that bars South and North Korea from their declared desire to peacefully unite their country; (b) to ascertain whether  in the event of the withdrawal of the United Nations Command  hostilities would not escalate into another major war.25.	Mankind today is not only faced with the question of achieving and maintaining world peace; it is not only faced with the problem of ending local wars  it is not only faced with the dilemma of improving the conditions of life for millions of human beings who now suffer from dire poverty  disease and hunger. Mankind today is also faced with the danger of self-annihilation. The world must achieve complete disarmament in order to re-channel human and material resources to those areas that will bear fruits of meaningful human fellowship for peace and progress.26.	In this regard  the Swaziland Government will continue to support efforts towards declaring the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace. I wish to repeat what His Majesty's Government said on this matter in this very Assembly only two years ago:""The area of this [the Indian] Ocean  up until recently not regarded as a sensitive military zone  is becoming a target for the less peaceful attention of some Powers. The nations that rightly regard the Indian Ocean as being on their own door-step have no nuclear designs or any other hostile ambitions in the area. They are in the forefront in seeing that other Powers regard the Ocean in a like manner. Unless the seas and oceans of the world come to be regarded as areas of peaceful and economic development only  un-peaceful usage will become more and more difficult to stop.""27.	It is common knowledge that all the big Powers and North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] members have pledged themselves to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"". The scars of slavery  the wounds of colonialism and exploitation  are still all too fresh and painful to us Africans. Therefore  we view with great concern the military buildup in the Indian Ocean by the superPowers and the military alliance of NATO members. Our continent should not be made a battlefield at a time when we are trying to rebuild it from the ashes of colonialism.28.	Finally  the Organization  despite the glaring ineffectiveness inherent in it  has many attributes. One of these is that it has the ability to talk and has been talking for the last 28 years. Talking to each other is a rare gift to man; but as we talk let us listen not only to other people talk; let us listen also to ourselves  so that together  as sons of man  we can rise to heights of freedom  justice  peace  happiness and prosperity to realize peace and security in our time. This can happen if the representatives here present see to it that the deliberations of this Assembly  in the circumstances of our troubled times  search for the highest common factor in peace efforts rather than elegant equations in resolutions."
"114",6633,"SYR",29,1974,"Mr. President  permit me at the outset to address to you my most sincere congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Your election not only is a tribute to the militant sister-country of Algeria but also attests to the general appreciation of your personal talents and your constant efforts to support the movements of national liberation by backing them with effective means and by moving to a successful confrontation with imperialism and Zionism. We are confident that under your presidency this session will be one of the most important and most effective. You have our most sincere wishes for success.109.	We also wish to extend our heartfelt thanks to Mr. Benites  President of the last session  for his efforts which yielded such good results. To him and his friendly country  our best wishes.110.	May we also congratulate the States of Bangladesh  Guinea-Bissau and Grenada on their admission to our Organization. Their role in the bringing about of justice and peace will be  we are sure  a very prominent one.111.	We must ever bear in mind that the objectives for which the United Nations was created still fall short of complete realization. There is no doubt  however  that international relations have gone a long way towards international detente  thanks to the dialog established in all fields between the two greatest Powers.112.	Moreover  a number of peoples have taken a great step forward in their continuing struggle to achieve liberation and independence  albeit at the cost of tremendous human and material sacrifices. In the vanguard stands Guinea-Bissau  which has gained its independence through its heroic struggle;  and the people of Mozambique are about to attain independence  thanks to the blood shed by its sons. We salute the courageous policy of the Government of Portugal  which has come to understand the real interests of the Portuguese people and has Abandoned its colonial policy  thus turning a new page in its co-operation with the international community after a long period of boycott by this community. We are confident that the peoples of Namibia  Angola  Zimbabwe and South Africa will obtain their independence and will do away with the remnants of racist and colonialist regimes which have been exploiting their homelands and their resources.113.	The dialog which is taking place in Europe  the disappearance of the hotbed of the German conflict  and the process of peace in the Indian subcontinent are all positive signs of the evolution of international religions towards a better world.114.	Despite all these welcome trends  however  international peace is still threatened by many hotbeds of tension and danger  in defiance of the Charter of the United Nations and the will of peoples for liberation  independence and unity. The critical situation in Viet Nam persists; the unpatriotic regime in South Viet Nam constantly violates the Paris agreements; and barriers are set in the path of the Korean people  preventing it from achieving its national unity. Moreover  one aggression after another is committed against the militant Cambodian people  which has mustered all its strength  under the leadership of the Royal Government of National Union  headed by Prince Sihanouk  to confront the agents of imperialism who are engaged in a desperate last-ditch fight.115.	Furthermore  it is impossible to speak of international detente and of respect for the Charter and for the right of peoples to self-determination in isolation from the events in the Middle East  a region which so many factors combine to make one of the most important in the world. The strategic position of the Middle East as a bridge between three continents  the Arab history with its civilization and culture that have been established in that area  its tremendous wealth in raw materials  its surplus of exports and the impact of all these factors on the international economic and monetary order are all realities which make it necessary to stop and reflect on the Middle East question and to approach it with the utmost care.116.	The October war of liberation demonstrated this  underscoring the sensitivity of the region in relation to international peace and security and the international economy. The danger of possible military confrontation between the two great Powers was then clear and present  and the crises to which the world economy was exposed as a result of the war that was imposed on the Arabs were acute. The Arabs  in order to defend their legitimate rights  were compelled to fight for their national existence and for the liberation of their own territories.117.	The tragedy that besets the region began after the First World War  when British colonialism undertook to facilitate Jewish emigration in accordance with a colonialist Zionist plan. The tragedy crystallized in the establishment of the racist entity of Israel  which has received backing and support from imperialist and colonialist States and from international Zionism  with a view to consolidating a racist entity in the very heart of the Arab homeland  constituting a factor of continual blood-letting. This entity was created to prevent the Arabs from freeing themselves from economic and political colonialism and to obstruct their national unity. It is not difficult to grasp the nature of this entity  for it was founded on the basis of exploiting religion for racist and expansionist purposes in an era when peoples reject such reactionary forms of national structure.118.	This racist entity was admitted to the United Nations in 1949 by virtue of General Assembly resolution 273 (III) of 11 May 1949  which made the membership of Israel conditional on the implementation of the United Nations resolutions relative to territories and to the return of the refugees especially General Assembly resolution 194 (III)  paragraph 11 in particular  a paragraph which provides for the return of the Arab refugees to their homes. The Foreign Minister of Israel undertook then  on behalf of the Zionist authorities  to respect the relevant United Nations resolutions and to abide by those conditions.119.	A simple comparison between the area under Israeli control in 1948 and the area under its control today and a quick review of the history of Israel  which shows that it has refused to adhere to any international resolution whatsoever  reveal the nature of Israel and the kind of ""peace"" it seeks.120.	The establishment of this entity was accompanied by the dispersion of the Palestinian people ever since 1948. The Arabs of Palestine have since been living under the worst of economic and social conditions. Israel has persistently rejected the United Nations resolutions requiring that the Palestinians be permitted to return to their homeland and to exercise their right of self-determination; Israel has intensified oppression and injustice and has repeatedly perpetrated raids on refugee camps. Israel  in its hostility to the Arabs  went so far as to wage war against Egypt in 1956; this was followed by continued territorial expansion up to the time of the June 1967 war  when Israel proceeded to occupy territories belonging to three Arab States Members of the United Nations  to disperse additional hundreds of thousands  to change the features of Arab towns  to set up scores of colonial to incarcerate thousands of citizens  and to practice Nazi methods of tyranny and oppression. Despite all this  the Arabs have always adhered to the emblem of peace based upon justice. But a just peace is impossible to achieve unless it is based on the principles of the Charter  which require complete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and full recognition of the national rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to return to their homeland  therein to exercise the right of self-determination.121.	The Arabs have spared no effort and have lost no opportunity to induce the members of the international Organization to take effective measures to bring pressure on Israel to honor the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations and to adhere strictly to their implementation. All such efforts have met with Israeli rejection on the ground that Israel needed ""secure borders"".122.	The Israelis mock people's intelligence when they use such childish pretexts. This comes from their superiority complex and the intense selfishness which mark all their thoughts and behavior. They tell us that geographic borders are secure borders  in complete disregard of the fact that this is an age of scientific advancement; particularly in armaments  and that technology has eliminated the immunity of terrain. In any case  the international community is entitled to ask why secure borders are demanded for a few Israeli villages white they are denied to millions of the Arab indigenous population. Does not the idea of unilaterally secure borders carry with it implications of racial discrimination? The Israelis have occupied the Golan Heights  announcing that they will not withdraw  using the ""secure border"" pretext again in proclaiming their intentions with respect to the West Bank  Jerusalem  and Sharm El-Sheikh. Yet did this occupation prevent Syria and Egypt from defending their  rights in the October war? The Israelis well remember what the Arabs achieved during that war  and what they might have achieved but for the airlifts and shipments by sea which submerged Israel with armaments  equipment and personnel to an unprecedented extent.123.	On 22 October 1973 the Security Council adopted resolution 338 (1973) which my country accepted on 24 October 1973 by a telegram which I sent iO the Secretary-General  declaring that we understood the decision to mean complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories and full safeguard of the national fights of the Palestinian people. In the period which  followed the cease-fire  however  we quickly came to realize that Israel was determined to persist in its aggression. Israel expressed this determination by provocative declarations that it would not withdraw from the occupied Arab territories  especially not from the Golan Heights. On the contrary  Israel considered the Golan Heights as part of Israel and by so doing tried to restore the situation to what it was before the October war  and to abort all the valuable political results which the Arabs had achieved in the elan with which they set themselves to defend their rights and to liberate their territories. Israel has resumed its delusion of invincibility; apparently the war held no lesson for it. The Arabs  who rejected the set-back of 1967  refuse to relinquish their achievements of the October war. They are more than ever determined to protect and defend and safeguard their national rights not only because these are their rights  but because to safeguard and defend such rights is to defend the Charter and the freedom and dignity of man.124.	We deployed our utmost efforts following the cease-fire to secure implementation of Security Council resolution 338 (1973). The Israeli response was more procrastination and more provocative statements  Our people is struggling for freedom. It has not tired of the struggle. It will not give way to despair. This was evident in our acceptance of the Golan war -as of any other war. That was brought to a halt by the agreement on separation of forces signed in Geneva on 31 May 1974. The text expressly stipulates that the agreement is but a step towards implementing resolution 338 (1973) and does not constitute the just and durable peace desired. Although four months have elapsed since the signing of this agreement  Israel still continues to maneuver  procrastinate and issue refusals.125.	Israel is escalating the tension with military preparations behind which lie new aggressive intentions  with no regard to the far-reaching harm this may do to international security and peace depending on the encouragement received from some Powers which continue to send economic aid and armaments to Israel. Israel fully disregards the harmful effects to international security and peace at a time when the situation in the Middle East has ceased to be one of mere regional dimensions and when its impact and dangers extend to all points of the globe.126.	We summon the attention of the international community once more to the fact that acquiescence in aggression and complacency in the face of its continuation in one part of the world encourage aggression in other parts. Therefore we appeal to you to stand by our people  who are striving for peace  to support us so that we can continue towards this goal  and take measures which will impress upon Israel that it cannot with impunity persist in its hostile policy against peoples  that violation of its commitments on the basis of which it was admitted to the United Nations makes Israel unfit for membership in the international community.127.	Indeed  it has become a focal point of disturbance and terror in this sensitive region of the world. Visit yourselves  my friends  the town of Quneitra to see what Israeli hatred did just before the evacuation  following the separation agreement. See for yourselves the evidence that Israel could not contain its racism and instinct to destroy  but indulged them by razing the features of the town  demolishing every house  every shop  mosque  church  school  hospital  water reservoir and electric generator  every precious antiquity  even desecrating the sanctity of cemeteries with tractors and explosives. After such criminal operations the Israelis found the easiest course was to claim that the destruction of Quneitra occurred during the war  thus adding lies and hypocrisy to their war crimes.128.	The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic calls upon the international Organization not to neglect the situation in the Middle East  for it is explosive  and hopes that it will go to the root of the problem. The Syrian Government insists that restoration to the Palestinian people of their national rights and other rights recognized by the Charter and United Nations resolutions is indispensable for the establishment of a just and durable peace in the Middle East  that the exercise by this people of its right to self-determination requires the implementation of paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III) adopted on 11 December 1948  which the Assembly has yearly reaffirmed  requiring the return of the Palestinians to their homes  and that Israel be compelled to annul all the measures it has taken to deprive the Palestinian people of its national and human rights. It calls upon the Security Council to take the necessary steps to safeguard those rights.129.	Persistence in depriving the Palestinian people of its rights is contrary to the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; it is contrary to the policy of the United Nations  which is to liquidate colonialism and combat racism. The identity and individual character of the Palestinian people have been manifested through its struggle under the leadership of PLO  which most States have recognized  as they have recognized the legitimacy of the struggle of the Palestinian people. Therefore we appeal to you to extend political  material and moral support to this struggling people  to achieve peace and justice in the Middle East.130.	Among the responsibilities of the United Nations  which inherited the question of Palestine from the League of Nations and has dealt with the Middle East crisis  is to declare without ambiguity that no just peace can be established save by the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Arab Territories occupied since June 1967 and by the revocation of all changes introduced by Israel in the demographic  economic and cultural structure of the occupied Territories. If Israel does not comply  the Organization should proceed forthwith to take all measures provided for in the Charter to deprive it of its membership and force complete withdrawal from all the occupied Territories and the restoration  to the Palestinian people of its national rights. Failure of the Organization to shoulder its responsibilities will jeopardize the progress achieved in international relations and allow them to revert to a state of explosive tension  for whatever occurs in the Middle East will have repercussions throughout the whole world.131.	On these premises  the Arab States and others have decided to request the inclusion of the question of Palestine as an item on the agenda of the present session [AI9742 and Add J-4]. All States have supported this request and merit our sincerest thanks. The question of Palestine has been On the world's conscience for more than half a century. It behooves the Assembly now to examine all its aspects  so that Members can form a clear picture of what Israel is an example of settler colonialism similar in its nature and in the way it has been achieved to that of South Africa and Rhodesia. When we insist on the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Territories  and associate with this the ensuring of the rights of the Arab Palestinian people  we base ourselves on a historical reality which neither the series of Israeli aggressions nor the policy of fait accompli can eliminate from existence. By refusing to comply with United Nations resolutions  by engaging in maneuvers in order to evade the obligation of implementing Security Council resolution 338 (1973)  Israel places the region in a condition hardly conducive to assuring international peace and security. Any co-operation with or assistance to Israel  militarily  economically or politically  will encourage it to persist in shunning its international obligations. All States  and particularly those which have been and are backing Israel  are called upon to fulfill their responsibility in the protection of the United Nations Charter and in the implementation of United Nations resolutions.132.	Any attempt to restore  in one form or another  the situation that prevailed prior to the October war will have a nefarious impact on peace. Hence the need for strong measures to be undertaken by the United Nations and by all peace-loving peoples  measures such as those urged in the resolutions adopted by the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  convened in Algiers  calling for a political  military  economic and cultural boycott of Israel and for the discontinuance of all sea and air communications facilities extended to Israel by any country. We are entitled to expect and the events of October have only served to emphasize this such an international effort for the fulfillment of the Arab nation's legitimate demand of complete withdrawal and the demands for the national rights of the Arab Palestinian people. Unfortunately  we do not believe that hope will be fulfilled  unless we reach this result as soon as possible  particularly since Israel is resorting to all sorts of maneuvers for the purpose of aborting all such efforts and evading its obligations under the United Nations resolutions and the Charter.133.	The policy of our country is that of a door open to the world in a spirit of friendship  positiveness and co-operation with all countries save those that base their philosophy and existence on racism. As a result of that policy  our country  together with other Arab countries  is witnessing a great and fruitful evolution in political  economic and spiritual relations with most other countries of the world. Some illustrations of this can be found in the top-level meetings that have taken place and are taking place in our country and in other Arab countries; in our active participation in the most important international conferences; in the series of visits undertaken recently by President Hafez El-Assad to a number of friendly States. In all of these there is an impulse for greater international understanding and co-operation  and a strong reaffirmation of a common faith in the principles of the Charter and in the moral values and norms of justice of the international community. The results of the conferences of the non-aligned countries and of the Islamic countries in Lahore and the summit meeting of the Arab States demonstrate and confirm this fact. Thus the way is being ^prepared for attainment by the people of Palestine of their national rights  under the leadership of PLO.134.	Our people look forward to the day when the Mediterranean will be a lake over which peace reigns supreme  following on the disappearance of the hotbeds of tension in the Middle East resulting from the Zionist aggression against the Arab nation. We are saddened by the events in Cyprus  that island  so close to our shores  to which we are linked by cordial relations based on proximity  co-operation  the principles of the Charter and the policy of non-alignment. When we consider that those events are not isolated from the situation as a whole in the Miduik Bast and Europe  we feel that we should do everything possible that can put an end to the ordeal of the Cypriot people and settle their problem on the basis of the territorial integrity and independence of their country  remove all causes of tension in the island  and ensure that Cyprus remains a member of the group of non-aligned countries. We appeal to all Member States to co-operate towards the realization of these goals. 135.	Our Organization faces a new era. As was stated by the Secretary-General  it must respond to challenges and changes without sacrificing its principles. AU peoples look to the Organization in the hope that it will be able to spare the world the horrors of war and to build an international community based on sound and proper political  economic and social foundations; that it may do so by eliminating injustice  upholding right  spreading international justice and securing to all peoples their full rights. It is imperative for this Organization to find solutions to the great problems facing the international economy  and it is mandatory that it work towards narrowing the gap between the developing and developed countries. The disparities resulting from that gap which made it necessary to hold the historic sixth special session of the General Assembly last spring require sincere  serious and prompt work on the part of the technologically advanced States on the basis of full and rapid implementation of General Assembly resolution 3202 (S-VI)  with restoration to all States of full sovereignty over their natural resources  easier access for them to technology  and technical assistance in promoting the construction of their economies on a sure  strong and self-confident basis  and the liquidation of aggression  foreign occupation and every form of foreign economic exploitation.136.	There is no doubt that indulgence in military aggression  the appropriation by great Powers of huge budgetary sums for military expenditures  the amounts of aid given or proffered to racist and expansionist regimes  and the control of third-world resources all figure prominently in the state of inflation that is overwhelming the world.137.	It is the right of the peoples of the third world that have suffered from colonialism and exploitation by imperialist companies to 'restore their full control over their natural resources and to utilize those resources for safeguarding their independence  sovereignty and national territory. If such utilization results in certain negative effects on other States  it is the duty of those States to cease giving their support to aggression  whether it be political  economic or military support  and to offer aid and assistance to the peoples suffering from aggression. The liquidation of aggression and its causes is one of the most important factors in eradicating the hotbeds of tension in the world  and it represents a process that will certainly have positive effects on the world economy and will serve the interests of different peoples.138.	Only by working tirelessly  with courage and profound faith in the principles of the Charter and their applicability  can we fulfill the hopes of humanity. We are optimistic  Mr. President  that this session over which you preside will be the starting-point for a new era  one highlighting the strength and efficiency of this Organization.139.	The Syrian Arab Republic  reasserting its belief in the Charter and in international law  feels strongly committed to the liberation of its occupied territories by every means available to it  and to securing the rights of the Palestinian people. In working towards these ends  we are giving expression to the aspirations and the interests of the international community in its longing for a just and lasting peace  and we are sincerely collaborating with all States and all forces working towards this. These are indeed the propitious conditions necessary for a climate of international relationships that can prosper under the auspices of the United Nations and become one of justice  love and equality in a world of peace  progress and prosperity."
"115",6678,"TCD",29,1974,"The delegation of Chad welcomes the election of Mr. Bouteflika as President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. Chad  which has always had friendly and close relations with Algeria  is pleased at this happy event and expresses its sincere congratulations. Even though Mr. Bouteflika is young  he has for 12 years vigorously expressed in this Assembly and elsewhere his faith and ideal in the advent of a better world where peace  freedom and justice will triumph. His positions were just  even though they ruffled the feelings of some  and he has accumulated a store of experience which fully justifies his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We trust  therefore  that with his experience as an Algerian and a diplomat he will bring the work of the twenty-ninth session to a successful outcome. In particular  we hope that  if by way of compromise we often manage to adopt grandiose resolutions here  we will now find the ways and means to implement them.151. I also wish to pay a special tribute to the outgoing President  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  for the devotion and competence with which he guided the work of our last session  as well as the sixth special session on raw materials and development.15.2. We also express our congratulations to the Secretary-General and to his assistants. Mr. Kurt Waldheim has been outstanding in the discharge of his functions as a genuine apostle of peace. His name is closely linked to the liberation of Guinea-Bissau  to the end of fighting in Cyprus  to the beginning of a solution to a very difficult problem in the Middle East  not to mention his firm determination to come to the assistance of suffering and deprived peoples.153.	Finally  we joyfully welcome the admission of new States to our Organization: the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau. The admission of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations is a brilliant victory for PAIGC and for the brave fighters who waged the sacred battle for independence under the high political command of the late Amilcar Cabral. We also wish to pay tribute to the memory of Mr. Eduardo Mondlane and all those who gave their lives in the struggle for African liberation.154.	The representatives who preceded me have eloquently spoken about all the problems before the international community  namely: decolonization  human rights  the emergence of the third world on the international economic scene  which so far has been dominated by a few privileged countries  the energy crisis  inflation  the law of the sea  population and food. The recalling of these problems by each of us simply confirms the need for all of us to find concrete solutions.155.	The delegation of Chad takes satisfaction in the recent statement by the Government of Portugal that it recognizes the right to independence of all the Territories which are still under its domination. Our satisfaction would be greater if Portugal's intentions were to be reflected in a concrete act enabling the Territories concerned to recover their freedom and sovereignty without delay and without conditions.156.	Spain  too  must liberate the Sahara in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and in consultation with the neighboring States which are directly concerned. We welcome the agreement between Mauritania and Morocco jointly to submit a request to the International Court of Justice to decide on their dispute with Spain.157.	Decolonization cannot be limited to Territories under Portuguese or Spanish domination. In fact  the situation in other occupied Territories does not leave us indifferent. My country  consistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the charter of OAU  once again reaffirms that we shall firmly support every effort for the self-determination of peoples which are still under domination wherever they may be throughout the world.158.	But how can we recall these problems without deploring the situation in southern Africa? We note with bitterness that in Rhodesia and Namibia nothing has improved  while in South Africa the racist regime is still trying to perpetrate the policy of apartheid. Those oppressive regimes and their acolytes must face the fact that the march of history is irreversible and that they must adjust to the new circumstances by exercising wisdom and reason.159. The situation in the Middle East remains disquieting. The peace efforts that were made some time ago disintegrated rapidly because of Israel's persistence in its policy of aggression. Israel must withdraw its troops from all the Arab territories it has occupied since 1967 so that peace efforts can succeed. The distress of the Palestinian people is  naturally  of concern to us. This question cannot  in our opinion  be the subject of a just and lasting solution so long as the Palestinian people continue to live cut off from their brothers in the region  deprived of their national heritage.160. We deplore the events in Cyprus which resulted in the death not only of countless Cypriots but also of messengers of peace who fell under the flag of the United Nations. This crisis  which developed because of foreign interference in the internal affairs of the island  threatens not only the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus but also international peace and security. We hope that the current negotiations between the representatives of the two communities will save the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the island where in the past Turks and Greeks lived together peacefully.161.	In South-East Asia men continue to ""die daily. In Viet Nam the continued violation of the Paris agreements keeps the situation tense. My delegation hopes that the integral application of those agreements will open up a way out of the deadlock.162.	With respect to Cambodia  the delegation of Chad recognizes the Royal Government of National Union presided over by Prince Sihanouk as the only representative of the Cambodian people for the good reason that it has the support of the entire Cambodian people and of more than 60 Members of the United Nations. The key to the restoration of peace in Cambodia can only be found in putting an end to foreign interference.163.	In the Far East  Korea cannot enjoy peace until the question of unification has been settled to the satisfaction of the two parties concerned. The decision of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly to dissolve the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea was a positive step in the search for a just and equitable solution of the question. The delegation of Chad  which associated itself with that decision  declares itself ready to support any initiative that can contribute to creating conditions favorable to the peaceful reunification of Korea. 164.	International security  which concerns us all  can be only an empty term until the disarmament of which we have spoken for years becomes effective. Every year resolutions adopted here recommend general and complete disarmament  yet the next year we are witnesses to underground or atmospheric nuclear tests  and mass deliveries of weapons of all kinds  with no assurance that any conflict that might arise in any part of the world would be prevented and still less that the danger of escalation  which would lead to a nuclear confrontation  would be averted. The delegation of Chad joins the delegations that preceded me to this rostrum in appealing to the conscience of the Powers producing nuclear and conventional weapons to take effective disarmament measures.165.	The year which has passed since our last session has been a period of disturbance for the world economy. The war of October 1973 gave a glimpse of the manifestations of an economic process which until then had been camouflaged under the then prevailing international economic order. The builders and advocates of that system saw their economies flourishing to the detriment of the majority of the peoples of the globe. It was only when the producers of the ""black gold"" united that the world unanimously became disillusioned: there was widespread inflation  a notable decline in the economic growth rate  and disarray in international payments. In truth  the origins of these troubles are to be found in the unjust imbalances which have persisted in international economic relations since the Second World War  which led to an accelerated growth of the industrial countries through the transfer of raw materials at low prices.166.	When pillage attained its peak  the poor countries insistently appealed for economic interdependence and co-operation so that the imbalances and injustices could be corrected. The stabilization of the prices of raw materials  the increased transfer of real resources to developing countries  the better organization of the international financial markets all these aspirations were unheeded by the rich countries  because it cost them nothing to ignore them  or to postpone them indefinitely. But now the time has come when the countries of the third world have become a reality. No nation can be proud of having a rich society in a world where poverty  famine and disease are rampant. The President of the World Bank has just declared at a meeting of the Bank that a thousand million human beings on our planet are condemned to death in the present economic circumstances.167.	Any one of the features of the present economic crisis deterioration of the terms of trade  widespread  runaway inflation  increased oil prices  or decrease in the growth rate of certain countries would alone have had serious repercussions on the developing countries. In combination they have led certain countries to the brink of disaster. The countries with a per capita income below $200 have seen that income decline in real value. The amount of aid for development  which is already limited  is not increasing enough to ' ^set the effects of inflation.168.	In this terrible situation my country  Chad  is feeling repercussions of the present crisis. Indeed  to imported inflation are added the various causes of higher domestic prices characteristic of developing economies  which are often linked to the structural shortcomings with regard to capital goods and technology. After the disturbing economic events of our time  we must jointly develop  a co-operation that will reflect a permanent and reinforced policy of solidarity. In this connexion  the equitable and realistic solution would be to bring order to the world economy through the practical application of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.169.	The Government of Chad would like to express its appreciation and gratitude to friendly and brother countries and to governmental and non-governmental organizations whose moral and material support made it possible to limit the consequences and effects of the drought which struck our national territory. The Government of Chad appreciates in particular the efforts made by the United Nations to mobilize inter-national opinion for the benefit of the countries that were struck by this natural disaster. In the face of this catastrophe  Mr. Kurt Waldheim expressed his fears by stating that in less than 50 years  perhaps by the end of the century  the continued encroachment of the desert might well wipe three or four African countries off the map.170.	Furthermore  an English scientist  Dr. Derek Winstanley  on the basis of past cycles of rain in the United Kingdom  concluded that the drought would inexorably continue its progression until the year 2030. Does this mean that in less than a generation no more will be heard of certain countries of the Sahel? That is a frightening prospect  and Mr. Boerma  Di-rector of FAO  in discussing a solution  said  ""essential donations are only a short-term solution; what is needed is a permanent plan to supply the desert with water and allow the planting of forests"".171.	There is no lack of water in the Sahelian region. The problem is how rationally to exploit the rains and the rivers  as well as the underground sources of water. For the disinherited people of the Sahelian region  the solidarity and backing of Governments and international institutions with respect to adequate financial and technical aid are indispensable to conquer the desert. We cannot speak of these natural disasters without recalling the calamities that struck Honduras and Peru. We present our deep condolences to those delegations.172.	As against the many problems which the poor countries face  we note that not only has public aid declined by one third in proportion to the gross national product  but it is now confined to financing quick short-term operations.173.	The delegation of Chad believes that it is time to attack the structural problems of these countries  in particular the road  water and agricultural infra-structures. Going a little further  our President  our great compatriot N'Garta Tombalbaye  launched an urgent appeal from this rostrum at the commemorative session of the General Assembly on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. He said:""... If mankind is an ocean of poverty  it is because it suffers from a lack of brotherhood; it is because  to repeat  everything is not geared to man. The day when man is brother to man  the attitude of one group towards another  the attitude of one nation towards another will be fundamentally different. It will no longer be a matter of understanding a people in order to exploit it  but of satisfying global needs  of seeking to harness technology and to institute modes of relations and trade which will bring into being the brotherhood of man.""174.	I should not like to conclude my statement without speaking of the recent change in our national policy following the creation on 27 August 1973 of the National Movement for the Cultural and Social Revolution under the leadership of our great compatriot N'Garta Tombalbaye  the founding Secretary- General. 175.	The National Movement for the Cultural and Social Revolution is a movement for liberation which unites all the living forces of the nation  all the people of Chad without distinction of social rank  tribe or religion  in a single body and mobilizes them to struggle against underdevelopment and against moral and intellectual slavery. This movement is centered on the man of Chad  and some of its objectives are: to reconcile the citizens of Chad with themselves  enhance the value of their natural culture and return to the source to discover their real and profound identity; to continue to consolidate national unity; and to guarantee democratic freedoms.176.	The movement encourages co-operation with all friendly countries on the condition that this cooperation be based on the principle of equality  and that it respect the independence and sovereignty of the State of Chad. It proclaims that non-alignment and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States constitute two cardinal principles of our foreign policy.177.	After all the eminent speakers who preceded me  I cannot speak further of the problems which concern us. To conclude  I believe that it is all a question of the conscience of each of us and  above all  of our faith in the future of the Organization."
"116",6724,"TGO",29,1974,"The heavy responsibility of conducting the proceedings of the General Assembly  assumed in such an exemplary fashion and with such remarkable mastery and outstanding distinction by the distinguished former President of the Assembly  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  now devolves upon Mr. Bouteflika. In associating myself with previous speakers  I should like to express to him on behalf of my delegation our warmest congratulations upon his election. His experience in international affairs  imbued With a spirit of nationalism at once intransigent  clear and open- minded  derives from his experience in the Algerian resistance. It was then strengthened during the difficult years of the struggle for the emancipation of his country  so that subsequently  attending to many matters and many people without losing sight of principles  he rose to full stature as a statesman.181.	The third world and even the international community will not soon forget the decisive role which he played at the third session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  held at Santiago  Chile  in 1972  at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers in 1973 and also at the sixth special session of the General Assembly. It has been often said of the President that he is a man of passion. Yes  he is one of those who have a passion for justice and who are able to put their heart and their talents at the service of a cause which they believe to be the noblest of alt. We would like to state here how proud and reassured Africa feels at seeing one if its best sons become President of the General Assembly.182.	Permit me also to say to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  how grateful we are for the dynamic and effective action he has undertaken in his three years as the head of the Organization. We are aware of the difficulties he faces and also* of the tenacity with which he confronts them. We also appreciate his sense of initiative and we are assured that the fertile imagination he has demonstrated in the past in guiding the Organization is a guarantee of future success.183.	Since the creation of the United Nations to this day  the number of Member States has constantly grown from session to session. We should like to welcome Grenada  the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations family.184.	The earnest desire of newly independent States to join the United Nations contrasts strikingly with the criticisms to which its operations give rise. But this is understandable when one realizes that for a young nation  membership in the United Nations is not only felt as a symbol of its succession to national sovereignty  but also  and above all  as a guarantee that it can participate more actively in the affairs of the community of nations and in the achievement of the noble ideals of that community. We  the so- called countries of the third world  particularly in Africa  endorse these ideals  and that is why we intend to strive relentlessly to maintain international peace and security  to develop social progress and to establish justice and human dignity.185.	This last year the situation in the world has undergone profound change. In some cases it is still too early to appreciate the scope of the changes. But one thing is certain  we are entering a new era in which ideas previously held to be false are being accepted and becoming established in the international community  while others once thought to be axiomatic should now be rethought  or even abandoned as outmoded. Accordingly  the world is becoming more and more aware of the obvious fact of the interdependence of nations and of the need for establishing a less iniquitous world economic system which will be more egalitarian and more human. Furthermore  we see everywhere that the forces of progress  justice and peace have won many victories over the forces of evil and oppression. It is clear now that  giving way before the defeats inflicted by the dominated peoples  and in the face of the intensification of the national liberation struggles  colonialism  neo-colonialism and imperialism  unmasked and revealed in their most iniquitous deeds  are now finally realizing that their time ha*> passed.186.	This is how the international situation appears to us  particularly in Africa where the liberation movements in the former Portuguese possessions have succeeded in shaking the very foundation of the regime which oppressed them. Today  Portugal  its back to the wall as a result of the irreversible process of history  is conceding  thanks to the lucidity and courage of its new leaders  the need for a political solution totally in keeping with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.187.	The Togolese  united in the Assembly of the Togolese people behind their Chief  General Gnassingbe Eyadema  must also warmly welcome the hard- won independence of the glorious fraternal people of Guinea-Bissau and pay a solemn and worthy tribute to the memory of all those who gave their lives in the colonial territories for the cause of liberty  in particular Amilcar Cabral  Secretary-General of the Partido Africano da Independencia da Guine e Cabo Verde [PAIGC]  and Mondlane  President of the Frente de Libertagao de Mozambique [FRELIMO]  both the victims of cowardly assassinations. We also wish to express our gratification at the agreement in Mozambique -and await the turn of Angola between FRELIMO and the Portuguese Administration with a view to the early accession to independence of that Territory. The people of Togo once again reaffirm their total and unfailing support for the young republic of Guinea-Bissau and all the liberation movements recognized by OAU.188.	We cannot pass over in silence the problem of what is called Spanish Sahara. This territory must be liberated pursuant to the relevant resolutions of OAU and of the General Assembly. We are happy to note that sister States concerned by the situation in this Territory have taken a common stand vis-a-vis the colonial Power by advocating recourse to the International Court of Justice for the purpose of receiving an advisory opinion.189.	The Government of the Republic of Togo appreciates the praiseworthy efforts hitherto undertaken by the new Portuguese authorities and exhorts them to persevere in this course  at the time when they are giving the best demonstration of their good faith and their determination to do everything in their power to complete the work of total decolonization and of granting each of the peoples still under their domination their inalienable right to independence. However  there can be no doubt that reactionary elements and a conservative right  backed by the white minority regimes  are already at work trying to undermine this process  although it is irreversible. That is Why my delegation considers that instead of being unduly optimistic  the international community must remain vigilant and try to prevent and crush any attempt to bring about a Rhodesian-type of solution in any of the Territories in question.190.	The situation in Rhodesia  and indeed in South Africa and Namibia  has shown no signs of change since the last session of the General Assembly. Rather  it continues to be for my Government a constant source of concern and  in its view  constitutes a constant challenge to the international community. In spite of numerous United Nations resolutions  the racist Salisbury regime is still denying any share of power to the people of Zimbabwe  and the only thing they are offered in response to their aspirations is repression and corporal punishment. The policy of apartheid remains the form of Government in South Africa and in Namibia  where the oppressed majority are deprived of the opportunity to exercise their fundamental rights. We think that by keeping silent in the face of the conditions under which these populations suffer -people who are committing no other crime than that of claiming the most elementary rights recognized by the Charter of the United Nations as belonging to the human being- the international community is inevitably contributing to its own complicity in these atrocities. I should not like to talk of the distressing attitude of certain nations which  albeit friendly  continue to give financial  economic and military support to these racist regimes. I hope  how-ever  that the events which have occurred in the Portuguese Territories will serve as a lesson and will have the consequence of opening the eyes of the racist authorities of South Africa and Rhodesia and make them understand the futility of their outmoded practices.191.	For almost a year new events have been occurring in the Middle East. The war of October 1973 reminded the world of the precarious situation in that region. My Government welcomed with satisfaction the troop disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt and also between Israel and Syria  and calls vehemently for a continuation of negotiations with a view to achieving a global peaceful settlement in the region  with the final objective of the total withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab territories and the recognition of the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.192.	Furthermore  the gravity of the situation prevailing in Cyprus  which is of concern to the whole world  inspires us to reaffirm our conviction that only dialog and common effort can resolve these most thorny problems. We would venture to hope  therefore  that the various parties to the dispute will finally achieve an understanding and so bring peace to the island of Cyprus. The international community will have to try to reconcile the divergent viewpoints but at th? same time continue its appeal for help for the suffering caused by the most recent events.193.	The situation in South-East Asia remains a matter of concern and even alarm.194.	On the question of Korea  my Government very much hopes for the reunification of the two existing States and gave a favorable welcome to the consensus adopted by the General Assembly last year. We do consider  however  that the presence of foreign troops in Seoul is a major obstacle to the reconciliation so ardently desired by the Korean people  and does not contribute to the peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean nation. That is why my country was among those which called for the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of the question of the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in South Korea [AI9703 and Add. I and 2] and was obliged to break off diplomatic relations with that country  whose stubborn attitude does not seem likely to promote this withdrawal and  in the long run  the reunification of the two States. We very much hope that  through its actions  the international community will assist the great people of Korea to achieve their reunification  and to play in the Organization a role befitting its genius.195.	In Cambodia  the persistent intervention of foreign troops in the political life of that country constitutes  without any doubt  a major obstacle to peace  security and the well-being of the Khmer people. The Togolese Government will  for its part  continue as in the past to support the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk  as the only legitimate Government. My delegation therefore takes particular pleasure at the inclusion in the agenda of this session of item 25  entitled ""Restoration of the lawful rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia in the United Nations"".1%. In spite of all the changes that have occurred In the world in recent times  it is distressing for us to have to note that in many regions poverty  racism  war  and imperialist and neo-colonialist exploitation are still afflicting mankind. With faith in the noble ideals of the Organization  and convinced of the necessity to work hand in hand with other nations to establish better living conditions for all  the Republic of Togo considers that it is the duty of the international community to continue to work on the problems of co-operation and economic development in the light of what is the now obvious interdependence of nations  the principles of equity and of the protection of the interests of all States  and in particular the poorer States.197.	It is no longer a secret to anyone that the results of the sixth special session of the General Assembly did not match the hopes which the third world had so justifiably placed in it. Yet at the conclusion of the work of the General Assembly  Member States solemnly proclaimed their joint determination to work for the establishment of a new international economic order based fundamentally on equity  sovereign equality  common interest  interdependence and co-operation among all States  irrespective of their economic systems  This new economic order which is being contemplated must be able to remedy inequalities  rectify present injustices and reduce the ever- widening gap between the developed and the developing countries  and ensure for present and future generations  in peace and justice  a balanced development and economic growth.198.	In spite of declarations of intention and pious wishes  the mayor problems remain and are getting worse every day. For some years now  the situation in most market-economy countries has been characterized by an increase in economic activity  escalation of prices  intensification of inflationary movements and imbalance of payments  all at the same time.199.	In the face of the expedients to which these countries have so often resorted  the developing countries have been obliged hastily to readjust the parity of their currency  without taking account as they should of their import needs  their export trade needs  internal production prices and external aid. All these are inter-dependent factors which  upon analysis  are without any doubt of crucial importance for the growth and development of those countries and have led to the erosion of their purchasing power  export earnings and external reserves.200.	Although the international community agrees in acknowledging that the economic development of developing countries remains the primary responsibility of those countries themselves  international action is indispensable to create a climate favorable for such development. My delegation feels that in order to lend credibility to all this  the market-economy countries should adopt a series of liberal policies in trade  and give new momentum  even a new orientation  to the whole matter of development aid.201.	I am afraid that the record in this respect is not very good. What is even more worrying is that the share of our countries in world trade is shrinking more and more. This is why my country has  on other occasions  associated itself with other countries of the third world in laying stress on the need for a liberalization of non-tariff obstacles and aid measures in adjusting the structures of the affluent countries. There is no doubt that non-tariff obstacles  including quantitative restrictions  create difficulties for poor countries in their efforts to increase their trade. Everyone is aware that the small share of the least developed countries in world trade continues to fall even lower. Hence the need to resolve the problem of non-tariff obstacles in their repercussion on the economics of third-world countries. That is why I should like to repeat the hope that I have already expressed from this rostrum that the developed countries will redouble their efforts ' o improve the situation  which is constantly deteriorating  to establish a new international economic order and to implement the Program of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its sixth special session.202.	On the subject of development aid  my delegation can only applaud the intention recently announced by some developed countries to increase their assistance. Despite that happy initiative  the general situation is overshadowed by uncertainties affecting the programs of certain other countries  particularly the United States  which would tend to restrict substantially United States subsidies to the Agency for International Development. It is ever more disquieting to note that  generally speaking  the terms for development and have a tendency to become harsher while those for government loans have remained unchanged. What is worse  export credits which our countries so often need are granted on very difficult terms. Furthermore  since interest rates are high  debt servicing absorbs much of the export earnings of those countries. If one realizes that the practice of tying aid to purchases in the donor countries is growing  one cannot fail to recognize that the real value of aid granted to our countries is proportionately reduced.203.	Apart from economic and trade and aid policy programs  to which I have just briefly referred  other equally urgent problems are at the forefront of the international scene today. The drought which has been raging in the Sudano-Sahelian region  and which continues  as we know only too well  to cause grave damage and to impose a very onerous burden on the populations of the region  remains a constant source of concern. Although there was an upsurge of international solidarity which was by no means negligible  the phenomenon of desertification  despite recent rains  constitutes for those areas a real sword of Damocles. Proof of this is the particularly disturbing picture presented by FAO  which confirms that this scourge continues to rage relentlessly throughout the continent  from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. We can only once again utter a cry of alarm and express the hope that concerted national and regional programs will together seek and find a final solution to this problem  which affects- the prosperity  tranquility and well-being of the people in the regions concerned.204.	The disaster in Honduras also calls for an upsurge of active solidarity on the part of the inter-national community.205.	Another no less alarming problem is that of the exploitation of the resources of the sea-bed. The position of the delegation of Togo  which is similar in this respect to that of the other third-world countries  is well known. The Government of Togo feels that an international authority  representing all States  should have absolute authority over the natural resources of the sea-bed  with a view to their rational exploitation by means of service contracts  the marketing of those resources and the deriving from them of profits which should be distributed equitably in the light of criteria to be determined.206.	The Government of Togo also endorses the view adopted by a number of developing countries particularly with regard to the territorial sea and the inalienable prerogatives of coastal States over the exclusive economic zone. It very much hopes that the developed countries  which contributed to the molding of certain concepts at a time when most third-world countries were still under domination  will revise those concepts in a spirit of equity  thus making possible the more rapid development of the poorer countries.207.	At the very time when the second session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea was coming to an end at Caracas  another conference  devoted to world population problems  was already under way. As we know  the World Population Conference held at Bucharest was convened in order to awaken the conscience of mankind to the world population situation and to the prospects for the development of that situation and the relationship between it and economic and social development. It was also intended to work out a world plan of action with the principal objective of providing the international community with increased resources and more effective means of equipping itself to solve the population problems as a whole. If  for the developed countries  family planning seems to be a panacea for the ills of underdevelopment  for the third-world countries in general and for Togo in particular  the real solution to demographic problems is rather to place this question within the more general context of economic and social development  for  I venture to point out  in Africa particularly  a new birth does not always mean just another mouth to feed; it means two arms and an extra brain to be used for productive purposes by the people concerned.208.	Aware of the periodic disturbances within the international community  my country  under the en-lightened leadership of its President  General Gnassingbe Eyadema  has for many years been waging a fierce battle against underdevelopment. We are aware of the fact that our country's independence will be illusory if the sovereignty which it claims over its natural resources and raw materials is not full and total. That is why we are now engaged in a ruthless struggle for the recovery and unconditional use of our natural resources  convinced that our efforts can be crowned with nothing but success. But the recovery of our natural resources and our refusal to allow foreign Powers permanently to despoil us in no way implies any doubt of our fundamental policy  which is in favor of economic co-operation and openness to the world at large.209.	It is in that spirit that Togo has undertaken  with its sister-State of Nigeria  the task of establishing an economic community of West African States which will transcend linguistic barriers. That project is at present at a very advanced stage  and we sincerely hope that in a short time this ancient dream of our subregion will become a reality.210.	This twenty-ninth session is taking place at a time when Africa is at a cross-roads in the process of decolonization but also  we would venture to hope  of its liberation from racism and all those practices which are so humiliating to human dignity. At the same time we are witnessing a particularly rude awakening to a fundamental requirement of our time: the advent of a new economic order. Thus  the United Nations which at times  it is true  has had very good grounds for discouragement  so remote did the possibility seem of realizing the noble ideas which are its raison d'etre  can today  relying on the results already achieved  contemplate the future with more optimism. It can now derive from the results achieved sufficient strength and courage to continue its arduous task  which  let us hope  will less and less resemble the rock of Sisyphus  and also derive from those results sufficient raison d'etre so that it can deliberately  with unshakable faith and unmixed enthusiasm  continue to work in the service of mankind for the building of a just and more fraternal world."
"117",6771,"THA",29,1974,"Mr. President  it is most fitting that the twenty-ninth session of the. General Assembly is presided over by an illustrious son of Africa. For it is Africa which  in recent months and after dramatic events elsewhere  has been destined to reap the fruits of its labor after a Hong but determined struggle to liberate itself completely from colonial shackles. Today it is Guinea-Bissau; to morrow is soon to come.197.	We also salute you as a distinguished personality of Algeria and the Arab world  whose ancient civilization and glorious achievements provide a solid basis for the present and future progress of a large and significant segment of the world's population. For this Organization  the active participation of the Arab delegations in its work has a continuing and profound impact on every important issue before it. Your eminent record in the fight for freedom and your progressive ideas will indeed prove to be important assets as you steer the proceedings of the present session to a just and successful conclusion.198.	My delegation would also like to pay a sincere tribute to Mr. Leopoldo Eenites of Ecuador  who  as President of the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly as well as of its sixth special session  guided our deliberations through one of the most momentous and challenging periods in the Organization's history. Thanks to his diplomatic skill and legal scholarship  as well as to his infinite patience and wisdom  the past year has been a truly productive one for the United Nations.199.	We were deeply shocked by the news from Honduras of the terrible havoc and devastation caused by the recent hurricane. Permit me  therefore  to convey the profound sympathy on behalf of the Thai people to the people of Honduras for their tragic losses and human suffering.200.	We warmly welcome into our midst the delegations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh  Grenada and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  following their admission to membership in the United Nations. It is rather significant that the three latest Members of the Organization belong to the three component parts of the third world  which is striving  in co-operation with others  to achieve economic progress and social justice for the international community as a whole. We are Confident that their presence among us and their contributions to the work at this session and in the future will be of immense value to all their colleagues in the United Nations.201.	I bring with me to this august international gathering the goodwill of the people of my country  Thailand. Goodwill is  in my belief  an essential dis-position of the mind at the time when one is to embark upon an analysis or discussion of problems and conflicts. Without goodwill as the guiding factor  the road to understanding and solution will indeed be a difficult one and will only lead to a rigidity of views and a selfishness of attitude. So it is with an ample store of goodwill that my delegation now approaches the task at hand.202.	In view of the series of crises in recent years  both economic and monetary  it is not surprising that the States Members of the United Nations  developing and developed alike  will give high priority and attention to economic issues at this twenty-ninth session. My delegation agrees with the view of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  that the economic upheavals and portents of the past three years are not a series of isolated events  but are rather symptoms of a profound malfunctioning of the global economy. The high prices of oil  the spiraling inflation  the inflated costs of manufactured products  the non-availability of fertilizers  the grim prospect of a substantial decrease in food production and the breakdown of the international monetary system are all interrelated events which could result in prolonged economic stagnation on a global scale  a stagnation of extraordinary dimensions.203.	The historic sixth special session last May  which was convened on the timely initiative of President Houari Boumediene of Algeria  has greatly contributed to the international awareness of economic inequities in the world  and the recognition of the new international economic order and the adoption of the Program of Action has provided a constructive answer to the shortcomings of the present world economic system. My delegation will continue to give its support and co-operation to all practical measures which will ensure the full implementation of the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. It is our sincere hope that the lack of political will on the part of some industrialized countries will yield to the spirit of co-operation between all nations  large and small  that must prevail in order to find an effective means to solve the economic problems which confront all of us. Only in this way can we. build a new society of nations based on an equitable redistribution of wealth arid opportunity for all mankind.204.	In this connexion  my delegation looks forward to the adoption of the draft Charter of the Economic Rights and Duties of States at this session. The adoption of that Charter  in our view  would constitute an indispensable Step towards the realization  of the new international economic order. It would also facilitate our tasks in restructuring the present economic system on a more equitable basis  thus contributing to the success of the seventh special session on development and international economic co-operation in September of next year.205.	Although Thailand is not classified as one of the countries most severely affected by the recent economic crisis  we have by no means benefited from it. On the contrary  the effects of the high prices of oil  fertilizers and imported manufactured goods  as well as world-wide inflation have been felt in all sectors of our economy. Being basically an agricultural country  Thailand has to rely mainly on exports of agricultural commodities at equitable prices for its foreign exchange earnings. Nevertheless  even before the recent energy crisis  Thailand's balance of trade  particularly with industrialized countries  has consistently been unfavorable to our side.206.	Our need for high-cost capital goods and manufactured products  price fluctuations of agricultural exports  as well as unfair and non-commercial com-petition by rich producers for our traditional markets  have all contributed to this unsatisfactory state of affairs. And now the sudden Shortage and the increase in prices of fertilizers by over 100 per cent in 1972 and 1973 has compounded our difficulty  with repercussions in the domestic situation due to the rise in the prices of staples for our own population. Without fertilizers  food production in developing countries at the level of past years will not be ensured  much less will there be an increase in production or a surplus for exports.207.	In the light of these developments  the respon-sibility of the world community to double its efforts to forestall the danger of a food crisis and to save the world from the scourge of hunger and starvation has become even more urgent. There aire already millions of people in the Sahel region and in other parts of Africa and Asia who are undergoing the agony of hunger and starvation. The trend is that millions more will be added to the list if the process of desertification continues and if the levels of food and agricultural production cannot be increased.201). My delegation  therefore  agrees with the view expressed by several other delegations that a global policy is needed to meet man's immediate and- long- term need for food. We are hopeful that such a policy will emerge from the forthcoming World Food Conference to be held in Rome in. November. Being a surplus food producer  Thailand has always given favourable consideration to the needs of neighbouring and other friendly countries and hopes to participate actively and constructively in the Conference.209.	Nevertheless  my delegation has stressed time and again  here as well as in other forums  that there are significant differences between a rich producer and a needy producer. A needy producer  such as Thailand  is threatened constantly by price fluctuations  scarcity of essential inputs and unfair and non-commercial competition by i.eh producers. In this context  my delegation strongly believes that in striving for a global policy every effort should be made to ensure a fair balance of interests between food- exporting and food-importing countries  bearing in mind the special needs of peoples beset by national calamities and economic crises as well as the precarious position of those developing nations whose populations depend on the production and export of agricultural commodities for their livelihood and well- being.210.	Another important world conference very closely related to world food problems was recently concluded at Bucharest namely  the World Population Conference. My delegation supports the World Population Plan of Action adopted by the Conference  which has brought into proper focus the inter-relationship between population and socio-economic development in accordance with the spirit of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. Although my country continues to advocate family planning as a means of curbing population growth  we also subscribe to the idea that every country has every right to formulate its own population policy  and that such policy can-not be wholly effective if it is implemented outside the context of social and economic development.211.	On the African continent  which has been subjected to the worst kinds of colonialism and exploitation  the white  minority regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia continue to pursue their abhorrent racist policies against the peoples of those lands in violation of human rights and in defiance of the denunciations and the revulsion of the whole world  as expressed in the resolutions of the United Nations. In this connexion  Thailand was one of those delegations which yesterday [2248th meeting] voted for rejection of the credentials of the representative of South Africa as well as for the resolution calling upon the Security Council to review the relationship between the United Nations and South Africa [resolution 3207 (XXIX)].212.	We address an urgent appeal  therefore  to those nations that still practise apartheid  oppression and colonialism to adhere to the course charted by the United Nations in these matters. Thailand unreservedly expresses its full support for the just struggle of the African peoples striving towards free-dom and independence and the preservation of their natural wealth  and calls upon the international Organization to exert all its efforts to assist their legitimate struggle.213.	With regard to the question of Territories under Portuguese domination  the changes relating to those Territories have signaled the beginning of a new era of hope and expectation for the achievement of the long-fought-for freedom and independence of millions of Africans. The new Government of Portugal has indicated its categorical rejection of the colonialist policy of the previous regime  as well as its full acceptance of the relevant international provisions concerning decolonization. In this connexion  Thailand welcomes the enlightened and co-operative attitude of the present Government of Portugal towards the work of the competent United Nations organs concerned with decolonization. Although the recent developments have been heartening  only through total and unambiguous decolonization can the reign of peace be restored in Mozambique and Angola  the Territories remaining under Portuguese domination.214.	The victory achieved by the people of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is a great inspiration to all those engaged in the struggle for the liberation of the continent of Africa  particularly in those parts of Africa  including Namibia  still under colonial control. It gives the people of Africa fresh hope  and a new impetus  that their goal of total liberation of the continent will soon be realized.215.	Some of the most disturbing developments have occurred in the field of disarmament. The staggering increase in the world's expenditure on arms cannot be satisfactorily explained by spiraling inflation alone. The growing investment of the world's available capital in weapons  unmatched by the level pf expenditure on more economically productive ventures  tends to slow down any international effort to narrow the gap between the rich and the poor nations. The continuing nuclear proliferation  which helps to divert world attention :om the nuclear Powers already in possession of an over-kill capability  may further weaken their will to carry out their responsibilities in the manner expected cf them by the international community.216.	It is also noteworthy that the important items relating to disarmament have been added to the Assembly's agenda while consideration of the older items is languishing in the face of serious differences among the major Powers themselves or the indifference of some of them to the interests of smaller nations.217.	Progress towards the future convening of a world disarmament conference has been hampered by continued lack of unanimity on the part of the nu-clear Powers whose participation is  in our view  essential to its success. The proposal to transform the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace has met with various arguments concerning global strategy in justification of those Powers' military presence in the area. It is perhaps not too much to hope that the interests of the littoral States will also be taken into account and that a policy of restraint leading to a reduction of big-Power rivalry and contention in the Indian Ocean will ultimately prevail  thus translating that worthy idea into concrete action. My delegation remains committed to that effort  as well as to the regional endeavor under the auspices of the Association of South-East Asian Nations [ASEAN]  to turn South-East Asia into a zone of peace  freedom and neutrality free from all forms of external interference.218.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has already acquired the distinction of being the largest international conference ever held in the history of man. Despite the enormous complexities involved  the Caracas session was able to achieve significant progress. Some of the delay in substantive work was unavoidable  due to the unprecedented procedural questions and the necessary allocation of time for the general debate. However  on such items as the international regime and machinery  where the issues were more or less clear-cut  it was unfortunate that no further progress was made owing to the unwarranted attitude of some developed countries  which threatens to undermine the common- heritage principle itself. Since the fundamental principle forms the bedrock of the emerging international law of the sea  and was  in fact  the initial raison d'etre for the Conference  there should be no misunderstanding of the import of this unhappy state of affairs.219.	On the other hand  my delegation is pleased to note the growing unity of the developing countries on these issues  based on their firm adherence to the common-heritage principle  as well as their recognition of the realities which demand a certain element of flexibility in their approach. My delegation believes that if the developing countries remain steadfast in their determination  as well as flexible whenever the situation requires  they will be able to contribute to the successful outcome of the Conference. Such a development would be most welcome  as it would ensure the early utilization of valuable sea-bed resources for the benefit of all mankind.220.	Many small nations  including my own  maintain a continuing interest in the progress of detente on the international scene  for we are as hopeful as ever that the process of accommodation and its out-come will be of universal benefit in the avoidance of armed conflicts and the promotion of world peace. Detente  in our perception  should not  however  be restricted to the conduct of global strategies by the major Powers in relation to one another; on the contrary  it should also have the beneficial effect of restraining local conflicts which could eventually lead to a wider conflagration. Moreover  detente is not a cure-all. Remedies must also be applied to the ills which constitute the causes of conflicts.221.	In the Middle East  where the present lull may be attributed in part to the exercise of self-restraint by the major Powers  no lasting settlement will be possible unless and until the legitimate rights of the Palestinians are met. Therefore my delegation welcomes the inclusion of the question of Palestine as a new and separate item on the Assembly's agenda. In so doing  we have also taken into account the views of the great majority of countries situated close to the area. We urge Israel to withdraw from its occupation of Arab territories  and in the meantime to desist from the usurpation of Arab rights in the occupied territories  as well as from other practices in contravention of the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.222.	The tragic situation in Cyprus has also been brought to the attention of the world and is once again an important item of business for the Organization. My delegation earnestly hopes that a just solution will be found which will ensure for all the people of Cyprus the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of their country. 223.	In connexion with the recent developments in the Middle East and Cyprus  the Thai delegation 362would wish to place on record its sincere appreciation of the indispensable role of our Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim. We should like also to pay a tribute to all the members of the United Nations forces on duty in the three areas concerned  as well as tc the memory of those who have lost their lives in the cause of international peace.224.	I now turn to an area which is geographically closer to Thailand and whose future well-being and stability will have direct repercussions on all the States of South-East Asia. The strife and turmoil which have existed in IndoChina in the past 25 years have brought untold sorrow and suffering to the peoples in the area  yet the prospects for peace and harmony are today really not much greater than they were a year ago.225.	In South Viet Nam  the Paris Peace Agreement which was so painstakingly and successfully negotiated in 1973 fails to bring about peaceful conditions and the settlement that we all desire. War  on a smaller scale but no less ferocious  continues unhampered by obligations solemnly undertaken in the Paris Agreement. Non-observance of the Agreement is the major stumbling block to its full implementation. My delegation would therefore like to urge the parties concerned to demonstrate a stronger political will to ensure strict observance of both the letter and the spirit of the Paris Agreement. In this connexion  I would like to express our appreciation to the Governments of Iran  Indonesia  Poland at. J Hungary for their continued willingness to serve as members of the International Commission of Control and Supervision. We hope that their services  in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement  will contribute to the restoration of genuine peace in Viet Nam.226.	Recent developments in the political field in the Kingdom of Laos have been more encouraging. The political will  so lacking in other political conflicts  appears to be the motivating force which has moved the Lao factions to engage in serious talks and reach a compromise agreement on the formation of the Provisional Government of National Union and the National Political Coalition Council in Laos. That Government  under the effective and impartial leader-ship of Prince Souvanna Phoui   to whom we send our best wishes for a speedy recovery  has been functioning for some months now. It is the cherished hope and belief of the Kingdom of Thailand  as a sister nation  that with its present set-up Laos will have a greater chance of success in preserving its independence  neutrality and territorial integrity. My Government extends its support and full co-operation to the Government and people of Laos in their efforts to achieve peace and stability  which cannot fail to have a positive impact on neighboring States.227.	Unlike the situation in Laos  where a common desire and determination displayed by all Laotian sides enabled the parties to arrive at a peaceful settlement of their problems  the political conflict in the Khmer Republic remains unresolved. The tragic suffering endured by the Khmer people is a source of deep concern not only to Thailand but also to all other States in the region. We in Thailand  who have close historical and cultural ties with the Khmers  have no other wish but to see peace and tranquility return to the country 228.	Thailand's basic approach towards the question of Cambodian representation has not changed. We continue to maintain that the Khmer people them-selves should be allowed to solve their own political problems peacefully  free from outside intervention in whatever form. Such political settlement should be reached by the indigenous parties concerned  and nothing should be done in the United Nations which may prejudge the decision of the Khmer people and which may prolong the suffering and the loss of lives and property  including cultural treasures  in the Khmer Republic.229.	Our views are not basest on personal preference for this or that personality. Nt>r do we concern our-selves with political ideology of this or that leadership. On the contrary  the attitude of my Government is governed by historical facts  the actual situation on the ground  and our firm adherence to the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of a State.230.	It is a historical fact that the leader of the former Government of Cambodia was removed from power not by force but by a vote in the national parliament in accordance with its own constitution. It is also a fact that the present leadership came into power not by the use of force but through constitutional means.231.	The present situation shows that the present and legitimate leadership in the Khmer Republic has effective control and support of the major portion of its population. The seat of its Government Continues to be in Phnom Penh  the capital of the country. On the other hand  the other leadership  which is said to control some parts of the country  is a Government- in-exile with its headquarters in fre capital of another State.232.	It is the considered view of my Government that the United Nations has neither the authority nor the jurisdiction to exercise self-determination for the Khmer people. The choice is theirs and theirs alone. Any United Nations action which is tantamount to a change of national leadership in the Khmer Republic is sheer interference in the domestic affairs of the Khmer people  and would create such an undesirable precedent that a government-in-exile of any independent State might challenge the legally constituted government within the State itself. Instead  the United Nations would do well to respond to the appeal made by the Government of the Khmer Republic at Phnom Penh on 9 July 1974 by  giving support to all Khmers  whatever side they are on  and assisting them in bringing about the talks  without prior conditions  with a view to achieving a just and lasting peace guaranteeing the independence  neutrality and territorial integrity of the Khmer nation.233.	Thailand will continue its policy of good-neighborliness and peaceful co-operation with all States in the area  irrespective of their political inclination or economic orientation. The security interests of each State in the nation can only be safeguarded by strict compliance with the five principles of peaceful coexistence. In this respect  Thailand will not be found wanting. 234.	Regional co-operation continues to be an important goal of Thailand's foreign policy. My delegation would like to refer in particular to the efforts of ASEAN to intensify and broaden the scope of co-operation among member countries. It is with a keen awareness of collective responsibility born out of experience that we in ASEAN have adopted and continued the practice of regular consultations as a means of dealing with important matters affecting the peace and stability of our region.235.	My delegation recalls with satisfaction that the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly witnessed the participation  for the first time  of both the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the discussion of the Korean item. My delegation sincerely believes that the participation of both sides in the work of the Organization produced a positive result and that the consensus which finally emerged with the endorsement of both sides had a beneficial effect on the situation in that part of the world.236.	From the beginning  Thailand has actively contributed to the United Nations efforts in Korea  which were based on the legitimate right of the Korean people to decide their own destiny  peacefully and free from coercion. Consequently  my delegation whole-heartedly welcomed the joint communique of 4 July 1972 establishing a dialog between the two sides and paving the way for their constructive co-operation and peaceful reunification. Thus  we sup-ported the dissolution of the United Nations Com-mission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea  which during its existence had performed a useful role.237.	Against this background it is deeply regrettable to note that the appeal for a widening of many- sided exchanges and co-operation between the South and the North  as envisaged in the consensus statement "" has not been fully answered. It has become apparent that the North-South dialog has made little substantive progress. Moreover  there have also been other incidents which could exacerbate existing tensions on the Korean peninsula. There is  therefore  an even more urgent need at present for both parties namely  the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to try to find accommodation with each other within the framework of last year's consensus  and to continue and carry to a successful conclusion the endeavor  which can only be to their own direct benefit and be conducive to the lessening of tension in that important part of Asia and the world.238.	With regard to the United Nations Command in Korea  we maintain our conviction that any decision concerning its future should be taken by the appropriate United Nations organ that is  the Security Council in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.239.	While the past 12 months have brought forth many momentous developments in the life of the United Nations  Thailand itself has also undergone innovative and evolutionary changes in the national life. The events of October last  led by the student movement  resulted in the change of our Government and has enabled the nation to improve upon its constitutional and political institutions. Respect for political and civil liberties is no longer an ideal but has truly become an everyday fact. Democracy  with the full participation of all people under constitutional rule  which will be reflected in the general elections due to be held early next year  is designed to promote economic development and social justice for the equal benefit of all people. This new trend is a source of pride for our Government and people and  we hope  will strengthen national unity and ensure progress for the whole nation. We believe that such a development will contribute to greater understanding and harmony among all States in the region of South-East Asia."
"118",6932,"TUN",29,1974,"Mr. President  the Tunisian delegation is happy to associate itself with all the speakers who have already congratulated you on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly  succeeding Mr. Benites  whom the Organization will always remember as a man of great competence and ability. Tunisia has more than one reason to take pleasure in this demonstration of confidence in you and  through you  in the Government of Algeria  its President  the Algerian people  the great Arab Maghreb  and the African continent as a whole.2.	We are all the more pleased to see a statesman of your stature presiding over this session of the Assembly because the agenda before us indicates that this will be a very important session  in view of the acuteness and gravity of the problems facing it  particularly those affecting international peace and security. What could be more normal than for these problems to be submitted to the international community  and particularly to the General Assembly  which in our view is the principal instrument for the search for appropriate solutions  however grave the problems may be and whatever ramifications they may have. The United Nations represents the international conscience -indeed  it should represent the only sincere conscience that exists -thus becoming a source of hope for nations and peoples through the way it deals with all the problems that may confront the world  whether they be conflicts and crises or questions concerning progress towards peace and development.3.	We do not  however  think that the United Nations must completely upset the order established in international relations since the Second World War. Indeed  we are too much attached to the Organization to wish it to engage in such a course; we are sufficiently mature also not to wish it to do so. Nevertheless  we think that the present circumstances are perceptibly different from those existing when the United Nations was created. That obliges us to study ways of developing the methods used by the Organization so that it may remain in harmony with the changes occurring in the world and fully meet the requirements flowing from those changes. Indeed  realism and sense of responsibility oblige us to consider things in a balanced and rational way and to seek effectiveness when we choose our methods of action.4.	It is true that the great Powers have special responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security  and the situation is not likely to change soon. But the development process that I have just mentioned and our concern to avoid a situation in which the Organization will be overtaken by events make it necessary to search for such means as can reconcile the requirements of the present order with those of that development process. Hence  we believe it indispensable to associate the United Nations with the great Powers in dealing with all problems affecting the fate of mankind.5.	In that respect I wish to pay tribute to the tireless efforts that the Secretary-General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  has been successfully exerting to strengthen the chances for peace throughout the world and to give the Organization .its proper place and the supreme responsibilities for which it was created.6.	Mr. President  permit me to express my great satisfaction at addressing the Assembly in the Arabic language  which now has the legal status that is due to it  and to consider this change as illustrating the capacity of the Organization to adapt itself to one of the requirements of the evolution which I have mentioned.7.	Today  we have to deal with many questions on our agenda  each of which has its importance and its gravity. But the most serious thing perhaps is the fact that those problems are not new ones and are not confronting us for the first time. They have been submitted to us today in fact in far more acute terms than hitherto and there is real urgency surrounding some of them.8.	Thus  the past year was marked by the consequences of the war of October 1973 in the Middle East and despite the progress resulting from the troop disengagements  the problem is still there in its entirety. We very much hoped that the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East would lead to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories occupied in 1967  thus opening up the way to an examination of the fundamental problem  which is the Palestinian question.9.	But this hope has disappeared. The difficulties raised by the Israelis have prevented peace efforts from succeeding. It would seem that the leaders in Tel Aviv have learned no lesson from the October war and that  in spite of changes in their Government  they persist in believing that security can be built on the conquest of the territories of others. In other words  they continue to believe in the supremacy of might over right.10.	The Arab countries  which agreed to sign the disengagement agreements  have seen Israel once again profiting from their desire for peace by freezing a situation that both suits it and permits it to strengthen its grip on the occupied territories. It is the duty of the great Powers  which have agreed to assume a special responsibility for the safeguarding of world peace  to bring Israel to reason  with a view to serious negotiations. For  if the Geneva negotiations or negotiations elsewhere do not within a reasonable period of time lead to the implementation of the Security Council's decisions there is a risk that the crisis will deteriorate dangerously and even degenerate into a new conflict with very serious consequences not only for the region but for the whole world.11.	The Assembly is duty-bound to draw the attention of the Security Council to the dangers involved in prolonging such a situation  the perpetuation of which would be tantamount  against all logic  to the recognition of the legitimacy of the occupation of the territory of others and the supremacy of injustice over right.12.	While the evacuation of the territories occupied in 1967 is indispensable  it is far from being sufficient to get to the root of the problem because  as everyone realizes  including Israel  the essential problem is still the fate of the people of Palestine. This is not just a question of housing refugees or of international charity  but of the right of a whole people to its homeland  its dignity  its national character  its identity  and its freedom to decide what shall become of it. That is the fundamental reality  and no one will ever understand the Middle East crisis if he not grasped the truth of the Palestinian tragedy in all its ramifications. Therefore  we can only take pleasure; at seeing the question of Palestine included as a separate item on the Assembly's agenda [item 108] in accordance with the analysis of it made by President Bourguiba for more than 10 years now. It is time for the world to realize the will and determination of the Palestinian people to impose its right to life with its homeland and its security restored to it.13.	It is time to realize that without the Palestinian problem  there would never have been a Middle East problem  nor the specter of war that-from day to day threatens the whole world from this region.14.	The struggle of the Palestinian people is a natural phenomenon because it expresses the will of a people to affirm its right to existence. This struggle indeed does credit to all men  as it does credit to all those who  in spite of their misfortunes and the vicissitudes of history  have remained faithful in their conviction of their rights  without ever despairing of human justice. It will be simply doing them justice to permit them to come and make their voices heard in this hall before the representatives of world public opinion.15.	Yes  indeed  it is high time for the United Nations  which assumed great responsibilities with regard to Palestine  when in 1947 it decided on its partition [resolution 181 (II)]  to examine this problem in the light of new developments that have occurred in the area.16.	We are all aware how things have developed. The decision to partition in 1947 was one of the most flagrant injustices in the history of mankind. In spite of that injustice  and since the decision of the world Organization conferred legitimacy on the partition plan  President Bourguiba tried to have it accepted both by the Arab States and by the Palestinians  and in 1965 appealed to have it conceded. That solution  which was not accepted at that time  now seems in the eyes of many the only way out of the crisis because it guarantees the existence of Israel within legal frontiers  as the great Powers required  at the same time as it permits the existence of the Palestinian State on a legal basis recognized by the United Nations.17.	But while the existence of Israel has become a fact  that State persists not only in refusing to evacuate the territories occupied in 1947  or those it has occupied ever since its aggression of 1967  but what is more  it categorically denies the very existence of the Palestinian people  an existence provided for in the document upon which its own existence is founded. For 20 years Israel has succeeded in arguing its extremist claims; but today  after the rebirth of the Palestine resistance movement  centered in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  whose leaders are the authentic and incontestable representatives of the Palestinian people as a whole  after the war of October 1973  it is no longer reasonable to continue to claim that Israel can still prolong its supremacy over the Arab Middle East. The myth of the invincibility of Israel has been destroyed  and that country  together with those who support it  must accept the new state of affairs. The chief element in that state of affairs is the determination of the Arab countries  whatever their differences with regard to other questions  to bring about a just and lasting solution based upon the right of peoples to self-determination and on the recognition that that right belongs to the Palestinian people in particular. And do we need to remind the Assembly that the Arab countries have demonstrated their capacity to use for that purpose all the resources available to them?18.	There is another question  which does not date from yesterday and which  because a satisfactory solution has not been found for it  is dangerously rearing its head once' more in the form of a crisis that is likely to upset the balance of powers in an important strategic region in the Mediterranean basin.19.	The question of Cyprus is among those which have always been of concern to the United Nations. The United Nations troops have effectively helped to prevent a confrontation between the two communities on the island. But the calm brought to the island by those forces has not been used profitably in order to achieve a final solution to the fundamental problem that would guarantee the coexistence of the two communities.20.	Some people thought they could settle for a de facto situation which is in contravention of the Tripartite Agreements of Zurich and which is flagrantly prejudicial to the rights of a minority. It is not surprising that the minority should have felt that its rights were being dangerously threatened. When the already precarious balance that prevailed was destroyed by a coup d'etat endangering the independence of the country  the inevitable happened  and a conflict  grave in its consequences  came close to pitting two neighbouring Mediterranean nations against each other  two nations which had every reason to be reconciled.21.	Now that the worst has been avoided  the problem of Cyprus must be resolved once and for all in a way permitting the coexistence of the two communities  with full respect for the character of each of them  within the framework of a single State  with the constitutional rights of each so guaranteed that neither of them can challenge the rights of the other  while at the same time the complete independence of the island is preserved under an international guarantee.22.	Although the situation in the Middle East and in Cyprus is a cause of profound concern  the developments in the southern part of the African continent give grounds for hope  even though that region still continues to suffer the nightmare of colonialism and apartheid.23.	We have no doubt that sooner or later the bastions of colonialism will yield to the struggle of the peoples of those territories  supported by the fraternal solidarity of all the African nations and all anti-colonialist countries. But we must in all frankness admit that we did not expect the decolonization of those territories to come about in such favorable circumstances. As a result  the Portuguese nation  which has so admirably  changed its attitude towards Africa  is today restored to its proper place in our hearts. The Government of Tunisia was among the first to welcome the efforts of the Portuguese Government  and to resume its natural relations with that country; for it was the colonial policy of the old regime alone that divided us from Portugal  which throughout the course of history has had numerous ties with our Arab Maghreb. For that reason we take the greatest satisfaction in seeing this reconciliation between our Portuguese friends  on the one hand  and our brothers in Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique  on the other.24.	It is with great emotion that I welcome here today the delegation of Guinea-Bissau  which thus assumes its governmental responsibilities on an equal footing with all countries of the world  while at the same time  of course  I pay homage to the martyrs  both African and Portuguese  who fell victim to the blindness of the preceding Portuguese regime  and its persistent refusal to heed the appeals of reason and conscience. We are also happy to welcome the admission of Bangladesh and Grenada to our Organization  and to address to the peoples of those two friendly countries our best wishes for progress and prosperity. We hope that Angola will not be long in joining the ranks of the independent African States  and will overcome the present temporary difficulties that can in no way block the path to freedom  the goal for which the Angolan people were the first  in that area  to make the greatest of sacrifices.25.	Thus  decisive blows have been dealt to colonial and racist rule in southern Africa  and we are convinced that the combined struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa will soon win a victory for the cause of freedom and justice over tyranny and colonialism. But  unfortunately  there are still some other colonial enclaves in Africa. In our own region  the so-called Spanish Sahara has not yet freed itself from colonial rule. We believe that the time has come to resolve this problem that has been poisoning relations between Morocco  Mauritania and Spain. We thus welcome with great satisfaction the agreement reached during this session  and announced from this very rostrum  between Morocco [2249th meeting  para. 204] and Mauritania [2251st meeting  para. 162] to refer this question to the International Court of Justice. Without prejudging the verdict of the Court  I should like to recall three principles that  in our view  constitute three fundamental imperatives.26.	First is the need for final  immediate and practical decolonization of those territories  for there can be raised question of allowing the colonial Power to continue to exercise any power  openly or covertly  after the emancipation of those territories.27.	Second is the search for a negotiated solution between Spain  Morocco £<id Mauritania  for the purpose of safeguarding the atmosphere of friendship and co-operation prevailing in that region.28.	And third is  if it should prove impossible to arrive at a negotiated solution  an appeal to the Government of Madrid to subscribe to the agreement between Morocco and Mauritania and agree in refer this matter to the Court.29.	I hope that the Spanish Government will agree to this proposal  and thus spare our Assembly the need to discuss and vote on this matter. In any case  if the Spanish Government should not consider it appropriate to agree to this proposal  I consider that the General Assembly should take full note of the gravity of this problem  and endorse the procedure suggested by Morocco and Mauritania  so that the Court may hand down an opinion in the light of which the United Nations can take a stand.30.	Many other subjects no less grave and important likewise demand the attention of the Assembly during this session. In a world where detente is supposed to prevail  a number of tensions and frictions persist in many fields in various areas.31.	In Cyprus  as in the Middle East  detente has not prevented a deterioration of the situation  and in both places the course of events has come close indeed to catastrophe. It may appear paradoxical that detente can thus go hand in hand with so many conflicts between smaller countries  but in practice we realize that it has its limitations. To be sure  it can be credited with some successes  such as the agreements on troop disengagement in the Middle East  and the continuation of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Detente has also made it possible to avoid confrontation between the Turkish and Greek forces in Cyprus. We can even give detente the credit for having played some part in the favorable developments in Portugal and in its former African colonies.32.	However  the reduction in tension between the two super-Powers remains a limited phenomenon that does not take in all the problems that beset the international community. What we hope for is a global detente that can and should be brought about within the framework of the United Nations and with its Members  a detente that must apply to all problems of the world  even though they may not seem to be direct and immediate threats to international peace and security as the great Powers conceive these to be  whether those problems concern disarmament  decolonization  or  above all  development.33.	If detente could lead us from the rather passive concept of peaceful coexistence to the more positive view of it as active international co-operation  in a world where the independence of all peoples  the sovereign equality of all States  and  more especially  balanced and stable -and thus more equitable- international economic relations prevailed  it could then command the enthusiastic support of all peoples  and mankind itself would be taking a considerable step forward towards happiness and prosperity. For ever since the war of October 1973  we have been living in an era in which we are finding how much  in the economic sphere  the interests of all nations  great and small  are bound together and interdependent.34.	Thus in today's world of crisis  there has been a change in the nature of tensions and in the antagonists involved. The developing countries are determined flatly to reject the state of affairs that prevailed until recently  which was both the legacy of the long period of colonialism  and a corollary of the principle that a minority of the human race could dominate the great majority of mankind.35.	The establishment of a new international economic order has become more than a necessary measure; it is an urgent one. We hope that the work of this session will contribute appreciably to the practical implementation of the Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)] designed to ensure the application of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-Vl)] and the initiation of co-operation between industrialized countries and developing countries which will make it possible to confront the problem of inflation which threatens us all and which stems not solely  as some people would have it  from the rise in the prices of petroleum and raw materials but essentially from the policy of economic expansion pursued by the industrialized countries and also from other causes which it would taKe too long to enumerate here.36.	In the meantime  good work can and must be done at the regional level  and  in this regard  the dialog between Europe and the Arab countries has made a promising beginning. Geographical  economic and technological complementarity between Europe and the Arab world has made a promising beginning and it must become a reality as part of an ambitious design which would go much further than mere trading in energy products. On both sides  there is a full realization of the interdependence of our two regions and the need to co-operate in all areas  whether they be political or economic  in order to overcome our respective difficulties.37.	Within the same context  we can consider that the work of the sixth special session on raw materials and development  held in New York  the World Population Conference held at Bucharest  and the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas  comprises positive contributions by the United Nations to the solution of the fundamental problems of the hour. Here  too  the gaps that separate the members of the international community separate the affluent from the developing countries. Here  again  a spirit of co-operation is necessary if we are to find realistic solutions that are both practical and just. We have great hopes of seeing this session yield more concrete results.38.	There is an impressive list of problems before the Assembly. And this is really the proper place to consider them  because if there is anything all these problems have in common  it is their universality. Whether it be the Mediterranean crisis or decolonization in Africa  or peace  disarmament  energy or the law of the sea  population growth  development or  a fortiori  detente  all countries of the world are affected. And whatever may be said  it is this Organization that must debate those subjects. In a shrinking world  where problems are becoming every day more interdependent  we can only achieve international peace with the support of all nations  we can only make progress towards a solution of the gigantic problems which confront humanity and threaten our common security if we act in common and through negotiations."
"119",6979,"TUR",29,1974,"Mr. President  first I should like to extend my warmest congratulations to you upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Your long experience as Foreign Minister of your country  your outstanding personality  recognized by everyone who knows you  your dynamism and indeed  there is no need to conceal it your youth  combined as it is with knowledge and ability  all these things are a guarantee to us of your success in the arduous task which you have just assumed and will give a new impetus to our deliberations. It is also a particular pleasure for me to recall here that the Turkish and Algerian peoples cherish mutual feelings of fraternity and esteem which go back very far into history. We would also like to greet you as the representative of a country which has become one of the symbols of the awakening of the African continent. I would add that the excellent relations between Turkey and the group of countries you represent here only serve to add to our satisfaction.103.	I would also like to express my warm gratitude to the outgoing President  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  Permanent Representative of Ecuador to the United Nations  who so diligently discharged his functions.104.	We would also like to thank the Secretary General  Mr. Kurt Waldheim  who has spared no effort to maintain peace in such a turbulent period in international life.105.	We are also glad to join in welcoming the new Members of the Organization  the Republics of Bangladesh  GuineaBissau and Grenada. Each of these countries belongs  to a great continent namely  Asia  Africa and Latin America  respectively. We are convinced that the entry of these new Members into the United Nations constitutes a further step towards the realization of universality in the Organization.106.	The presence here of GuineaBissau  as it emerges from a remarkable struggle of independence  is  in our view  the manifestation of a new order  whereas that of Bangladesh is a sign of the peaceful conditions that now obtain on the Asian subcontinent owing to the agreement reached with Pakistan after a fratricidal confrontation. Grenada has joined our family as the result of a process which for some time now has enriched the United Nations every year with a new contribution from the Caribbean region.107.	We have learned with great distress of the catastrophe that occurred in Honduras  and that has caused countless loss of human life and considerable material damage. On behalf of my Government  I would like here to state that we fully share their feelings of sorrow and we have the greatest and deepest sympathy with the people of Honduras.108.	It is almost a custom in this Assembly at each session to undertake a general survey of developments that have occurred in the world political arena since the previous session. I have no intention of breaking with this custom  but I shall try to be as brief as I can in this area so that I can subsequently go into further detail on some subjects which  in our view  are of a rather more special character.109.	Nevertheless  I do feel it useful at the outset to say a few words to define the particular position of my country  in order better to highlight its foreign policy and its attitude towards the major international problems. Situated on the. borders of both Asia and Europe  having more than half a century ago set the first example of a war of independence  enjoying cultural and historical relations with the countries of the Middle East  seeking to resolve our own problems within the framework of a democratic system  having been obliged  as a result of the circumstances of our time  to take its place within systems of collective defense  having no territorial claims  but requiring that this same attitude be adopted by others Turkey is pursuing a foreign policy that is the result of all these factors. In the pursuit of this policy  outlined already by Atatiirk on the basis of the fundamental rules of international law and confirmed once again when Turkey endorsed the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  our country has shown remarkable continuity and constancy  even through periods of tremendous international upheaval.110.	Having made this point  I would like now to turn to some current international problems. The international scene today encourages us neither to excessive optimism nor to despairing pessimism. This is the reason why I will opt for realism  a realism full of hope  goodwill and benevolence  as is prompted and indeed required by the policy pursued by my country for half a century.111.	The most marked development of the last decade has been  in our view  the detente between East and West. Much has been said by previous speakers from this rostrum about the origins and development  the advantages and risks of detente. The ideas that have been put forward  while not identical  have at least been similar. That is why I shall confine myself to stressing a few points which seem to me essential.112.	First  there is no denying the fact that in the East  as in the West  there seems now to be a full understanding that no discord  no situation  no matter how disastrous  can possibly be more so than a general conflagration.113.	Secondly  detente  which constitutes a stage on the way to the establishment  between East and West and particularly in Europe  of a more stable order that will be more humanitarian and freer from anxiety about war  should not be considered as anything but a means  and not as an end in itself. Its final objective should be true peace based upon understanding and conciliation. Detente should be merely a stage on the way to this goal.114.	Thirdly  it should be pointed out that for the first time in contemporary history  if I am not mistaken  three international negotiations have taken place simultaneously to strengthen detente in its broadest sense. This  in my view  is an event worth stressing.115.	On the subject of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  in which my country is playing a full part  we feel that this Conference constitutes an important stage in the process of detente  that it will contribute to the efforts of understanding and cooperation and that it will establish a climate of mutual security. On this occasion I would like to add that  in our view  European security cannot be considered in isolation from that of the Mediterranean and the surrounding countries.116.	With regard to the negotiations on the mutual reduction of forces and armaments in Central Europe  in which Turkey is participating with a special status  my country  on the basis of the idea that security  like detente  is one and indivisible  was particularly in favor of the view that the measures to be taken with regard to forces and armaments in Central Europe should in no way compromise the security of other countries.117.	With regard to the negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms which are taking place in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union  we can say that they are only bilateral and commit only those two countries. The fact none the less remains that the scope of these negotiations is not just of interest to the future of those two countries but is of concern also to the destiny of the entire international community. It is with this comment in mind and in this context that we view the new phase of these negotiations which have just begun a few days ago.118.	Disarmament is  without any doubt  one of the most important questions of the day. Turkey is convinced that it is one of the fundamental elements in the establishment of an equitable international peace and a system of common security. My country feels that  to ensure the establishment of this order  a disarmament program can be applied only under effective international control  embracing both nuclear weapons and conventional weapons. Within this framework Turkey also gives a favorable welcome to the various collateral measures designed to hasten general and complete disarmament  and it is within this framework that we are studying and will continue to study favorably and attentively all proposals put forward or which may be put forward in this field by various countries.119.	A conference on a world scale recently took place on the law of the sea. As my country is a peninsula three quarters of which is surrounded by sea and has more than 7 000 kilometers of coastline  it was quite natural for Turkey to take an active part in the deliberations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas throughout the past summer. Some progress was marked at that Conference  particularly with regard to the simplification and clarification of the most important problems before it.120.	In this area we should not lose sight of the fact that the geographical configuration of each part of the Earth is different from that of the others. Consequently  instead of tackling the problem from a uniform or  rather  abstract standpoint  it is indispensable to deal with this subject from a standpoint which  first  will take into account the needs of mankind and also will take full account of the special circumstances and the particular geographical  geological and other features of each region. Thus we sincerely hope that humanity will avoid repeating in the case of the seas and oceans the mistakes which were committed when attempts were being made to resolve the problems of the land.121.	The task awaiting the next meeting of the Conference is certainly a very difficult one  and it is to be hoped that the data submitted to it will be dealt with in such a way that new questions will not arise for certain regions as long as the old ones remain unresolved.122.	We have come a long way since the time when the man in the street  or even the man seated comfortably in his armchair  had no interest in what was happening at the other end of the world or even in a neighboring country. Happily things are quite different today. High speeds and considerably increased networks and diversified means of telecommunication  with the expanded possibilities of the mass media  certainly have played a large part in this. But what have been even more important  surely  are the feelings of responsibility and international solidarity which have entrenched themselves more and more deeply within the hearts of the most advanced and the most prosperous nations. This  however  leads me to the rather bitter observation that in spite of this development  there are still millions of human beings living under foreign domination who cannot find enough to eat. This ""foreign domination"" is not just a political and juridical notion  because at times it also has economic connotations  In a word  colonialism and poverty continue to exist in this world which is technically so advanced and which does have a few sufficiently rich nations in it.123.	On the subject of colonialism  the attitude of my country could not be clearer: the Republic of Turkey  itself being born of a war of independence and having thus set so successfully the first example of an anti-imperialist war  has defended and will always continue to defend the cause of peoples fighting for their independence. That is why the Turkish Government so warmly welcomed the change of policy which has occurred in Portugal with regard to its ""former Territories"" in Africa. We would like to congratulate the Portuguese Government on its decision concerning the independence of the Republic of GuineaBissau and also the Lusaka Agreement  which opens the way to the total independence of Mozambique. We have every reason to hope that the same process will be swiftly applied to Angola.124.	However  there has been hardly any change in the situation prevailing in Zimbabwe and in Namibia. Turkey is one of the active members of the United Nations Council for Namibia  and has been ever since its inception  and considers that the Council is surely going to become more effective as a result of the unanimous cooperation of the international community and the increase in the number of its members.125.	As for the minority regime still prevailing in Southern Rhodesia  its adoption of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony by Beethoven  who was one of humanity's 'great geniuses  as the national anthem  shows that that country is still hoping to lull others to sleep with this music by taking it as a kind of cradle song which will send no one to sleep except itself and will succeed in concealing nothing from mankind.126.	My country continues to condemn apartheid in all its forms  and particularly its inhumane application in South Africa. I would like to add  Mr. President  that your presence in the* presidential seat this year  a year when we have seen the last vestiges of colonialism crumble  is something which will surely add much weight and liveliness to debates on this question  since you belong to a country which has waged an exemplary struggle for independence.127.	On the subject of the so called underdeveloped countries and the aid which should be given to them  I shall be more laconic. My colleagues pointed out to me a few days ago the following sentence in a daily paper known for its objectivity and seriousness: ""One thousand billion French francs are spent each year on the arms race and 35 billion for public assistance to the underdeveloped countries"".128.	Yes  a thousand billion for armaments and 35 billion for poor people. These two figures say a great deal about what is being done without wisdom and about what could be done if people were a little wiser. In our view  no weapon is more dangerous than hunger and poverty  which threaten a large part of the peoples of the world; we feel that it is in this spirit that attention should be focused on a better utilization of resources.129.	Here I cannot but recall some words of the great founder of our Republic  Kemal Atatiirk  who said a long time ago: ""If we want a durable peace  we must take international steps to improve the situation of the masses. ""The prosperity of the whole of mankind must replace starvation and oppression.""130.	International economic questions  however  still loom large  casting a shadow on the work of this session of the General Assembly in spite of the special session on the subject held last April.131.	Developments in the economic area in recent years have become so complex that the classic  conventional economy cannot find any solutions for them. The indecision which continues to prevail concerning monetary problems and the rapid expansion of accelerated inflation pose enormous difficulties for all developing countries  whose resources and economic possibilities are limited. Even countries which are relatively little affected by these developments  or those which do not yet seem to be feeling their effects  cannot escape the consequences of a general economic collapse.132.	The famine which has afflicted the countries of the SudanoSahelian region and Ethiopia  and also the surrounding countries  as a result of the drought  is a serious warning that solutions to the problem of the general lack of food must be sought. In this context the shortage of chemical fertilizer and the price increases affecting production which have occurred this year show the need for a far reaching solution. Consequently  we await with hope the results of the World Food Conference to be held in Rome next November. We also note with satisfaction the results of the World Population Conference  held in Bucharest last August  given the very close link between the question of food and that of population.133.	The present situation is no longer a problem affecting only certain countries. It is manifesting itself in a form which requires global solutions. The slowing down in the rate of development of industrialized countries signals a dangerous trend for the world economy. The reduction in the rate of rehabilitation of the developing countries can only render even more difficult the efforts aimed at eliminating hunger and poverty. The problem is to ensure a redistribution of wealth and resources.134.	It is necessary to increase the share of the developing countries a group which includes Turkey in world economic activity and to contribute towards the establishment of an economic order which would give the people of these countries the opportunity to live as they should. We therefore welcome and support the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order  adopted at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  since it establishes the principles of a future economic order. In this spirit  we should also like to welcome the positive developments which have occurred with regard to the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. We also hope that the special session of the General Assembly to study the problems of development  envisaged for next year  will succeed in adopting concrete measures to establish this order.135.	The results of the sixth special session of the General Assembly  which met on the initiative of President Boumediene of Algeria  give us ground for hoping that under your aegis  Mr. President  the next special session will be successful.136.	I shall now turn to certain problems liable to have a much wider impact  indeed a global impact problems which at first sight   seem to be of direct interest to a small number of countries or to be regional in character but which  in fact  are still unresolved.137.	I should like to talk about the Middle East first. The conflict in the Middle East has long constituted one of the standing items on the agenda of the General Assembly. Turkey  a country of that region having abundant traditional  historic and spiritual ties with the nations of the area  has had a constantly growing interest in the development of this question. This conflict from time to time reaches culminating points which are liable to lead to a military confrontation between the great Powers and thus endanger world peace  as was the case with the 1973 October war.138.	At the present time we do feel relative satisfaction at the signing of the disengagement agreements on the two fronts. We should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the leaders of the countries directly involved on their wisdom and their spirit of conciliation. We should also like to congratulate the United States Secretary of State  Mr. Kissinger  who by his tireless efforts has contributed to such a large extent to the conclusion of these agreements. We also wish to welcome the spirit of conciliation shown in this respect by the two great Powers.139.	Nevertheless  in spite of these military disengagement agreements  major problems remain to be solved. Egyptian  Jordanian and Syrian territories are still under occupation.The Palestinian people  which has been suffering for a quarter of a century  still remains deprived of its legitimate rights and interests. My country has from the very beginning supported the Palestinian cause. We are gratified that this year the question is a special 'item of the agenda  and we have high hopes for the outcome of the debate to be held on this subject  and shall follow it with great attention.140.	The military disengagement agreements on the two fronts  Which have resulted in the partial withdrawal of Israeli troops  in our view do not constitute anything but a first step towards the evacuation of the occupied Arab territories and the recognition of the legitimate rights are interests of the Palestinian people. Furthermore  with regard to Jerusalem I should like to reaffirm here that Turkey  whose policy has always been opposed to faits accomplis  can accept no fait accompli with regard to the status of that city.141.	On the subject of the Middle East  I have just stressed that the foreign policy of Turkey is based above all on pacifism and is against faits accomplis. I should like to add that by its very nature  the Turkish nation not only does not support oppression but indeed is always on the side of the oppressed  as we have so often demonstrated in this very Organization. That inevitably leads me to talk about the grave problem of Cyprus.142.	I shall explain briefly to the Assembly Turkey's attitude towards this question by summarizing what I have already had occasion to say in various places and at various times. Turkey has spared no effort to And a peaceful solution to this problem by negotiations  interrupted from time to time  between the two national communities. These negotiations have lasted for more than 10 years without leading to any concrete results  indeed  to any results at all. In the meantime  Turkey has constantly had to face faits accomplis of increasingly serious scope  particularly since 1963. The most recent and the most serious of these faits accomplis was  as we all know  that of 15 July last: a foreign Power undertook a coup d'etat which it had long been fomenting and the purpose of which was to annex the island.143.	Now  Cyprus constitutes an essential element not only in the balance already established by the Treaty of Peace signed at Lausanne on 24 July 1923 by Turkey and Greece  but also  by the nature of its international status  of stability and peace in the Eastern Mediterranean and in the Middle East region. Any action or intervention jeopardizing the independence and territorial integrity of the island consequently is inevitably a breach of this balance and a danger to peace in the region . We are surrounded in this area by friendly and fraternal countries  for whose security we are as attentive as for our own  and we certainly do not want to change the balance there a balance which has been so difficult to preserve because we do not want to do any damage to that security. That is why my country has always attached vital importance to the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and international status of Cyprus. Respect for the international status of the island constitutes for us a fundamental element of our foreign policy and is an integral part of our own security. I therefore formally and solemnly deny all the lies that our detractors have spread in the corridors of diplomacy with regard to Turkish policy vis-a-vis theCypriot State.144.	One of the principal guarantees if hot the only guarantee of this status consists in the recognition of  and respect for  rights based upon the equality of the two national communities that constitute the State of Cyprus. Neither of those two national communities may impose its will on the internal structure of the State or claim to represent that State in international organizations.145.	If  following the coup d'etat of 15 July last  Turkey  after having sought put all opportunities for contact and consultation and having exhausted all means of negotiation  undertook an operation on the island  it was precisely for the purpose of restoring order  putting an end to chaos and averting any intervention aimed at annexing the island. The operation undertaken by Turkey thus in no way signifies and I wish to stress this point an occupation or annexation of a part of the island. It was not an occupation; quite the contrary  it was an operation designed to prevent an occupation.146.	I must emphasize once again that Turkey continues to believe  for its part  that the negotiations will be resumed within an appropriate framework  making it possible to achieve a speedy solution that will put an end to the sufferings of the two national communities in the island and relax the tensions that are hindering the maintenance of peace and security not only in the island but also in the entire area.147.	I should like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute also to the countries that have contributed to the efforts of the United Nations on the island in the field for the maintenance of peace and security.148.	The problem of Cyprus is too serious to be turned into a subject of polemics for domestic purposes. That is the reason why I did not want to go back  in my statement  to the past  or to speak about the piecemeal extermination to which for more than 10 years the Turkish community has been subjected. I intend to continue in this course and I shall refrain from replying to my colleague  Mr. Mavros  in the tone that he used yesterday evening [2239th meeting]. But I should be remiss in my duty to seek a peaceful and friendly outcome to the crisis that now disturbs us  were I to fail to correct certain allegations or to bring out into the open the intentions that some seek to conceal from world public opinion.149.	My colleague  Mr. Mavros  said in his statement yesterday that the coup d'etat of 15 July was not carried out against the TurkishCypriot community. Does he mean by this that the coup d'etat was quite harmless and disturbed no one  and that therefore it should not have called for any reaction from anyone at all? I am merely making a note of that.150.	The coup d'etat of 15 July was directed precisely against the Turkish community and was directly aimed at the annexation of the island to Greece. If Mr. Mavros wishes to see proof of this  I need only quote Archbishop Makarios. In an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on 18 September  he said  and I quote his exact words:""General Ioannides has had a personal grudge against me ever since 19631964  at the time when he was a member of the Greek contingent in Cyprus. Through Mr. Nikos Sampson  he requested and obtained a secret meeting with me. At the Archbishop's residence where the conversation took place  he submitted to me a plan involving a general attack against the Turkish community of the island  an attack that would have made it possible to bring about enosis. I indignantly rejected his plan.""That is what Mr. Makarios said 151.	My Greek colleague has not forgotten  surely  that his Government followed and this was to a certain extent due to the events then taking place  the Government that was in the hands of Ioannides  and that this coup d'etat in Greece brought ill famed Sampson to power.152.	I am therefore still wondering how Makarios could have indignantly rejected that proposal. After all  it was very much in keeping with his profoundest desires. What is more  he has never made a secret of it. In fact  on 20 September 1964  Makarios stated  in the Washington Post: ""For my part  I wish to be something more significant than the temporary President of Cyprus. My ambition is to have my name go down in history as that of the architect of enosis.""153.	More recently  in 1970  in interviews granted to Independent Television and the British Broadcasting Corporation  the * Archbishop repeated: ""If enosis cannot be achieved at the present time  its objective remains unchanged.""154.	And finally  last May the Archbishop reminded us  through the Frankfurter Rundschau  that: ""If he had a free choice between independence and enosis  he would support enosis.""155.	Was it the independence of the island that Makarios claimed he was safeguarding? Was it the policy of nonalignment of the State of Cyprus? Mr. Mavros said a great deal at the previous meeting about that policy of nonalignment. I should have liked to be able to congratulate him for the respect he shows for the policy of a large number of countries in this Assembly. But I very much fear that this was not his intention. The nonaligned countries are too numerous in this august Assembly  and my colleague intends rather to beg their support as he poses as the standard bearer of that policy  to conceal  for the time being  the policy of enosis.156.	The Republic of Cyprus as an independent State would long ago have disappeared if the resolute opposition of Turkey and the resistance of the Turkish community of the island had not prevented enosis  that is to say the annexation  pure and simple  of the island to Greece.157.	To safeguard the independence of the island and see that its policy is respected  there is only one thing to be done  and that is to condemn any attempt at enosis or at partition of the island any attempt that has been made in the past and any attempt that may be made in the future. On behalf of the Turkish Government  I condemn any idea of partition  whether in the past or in the future  and I look for the same condemnation of the idea of enosis from the Greek Government. Without that  we shall never be so simpleminded as to believe what we are told here. And I shall continue to wait for the answer to my proposal from the Greek leaders.158.	I have not  however  finished correcting all the false allegations and baseless charges made by my colleague. I reserve the right to do so when we speak on this matter before the General Assembly. My Greek colleague's speech  unfortunately  shows the nature of the atmosphere in which the debate will take place on the future of the two communities  Turkish and Greek  in the island. It is not by letting ourselves be carried away by his style  or with any thought of outbidding each other in national or international public opinion that we shall succeed in finding a solution that is just  equitable and realistic or that we shall assist the two communities to live in peace and why not say so? in brotherhood  side by side  in the same State  forgetting the painful past and looking only towards the future.159. Before concluding  I should like once again to say that Turkey  situated as it is by geography at the crossroads of civilizations and also of confrontations  is striving  for its part  to play its proper role in bringing peace among nations and groups of nations and happiness and wellbeing to mankind. It is a privilege and an honor to be able to reaffirm that in this Assembly  which is doing so much for the peace and prosperity of the world."
"120",7041,"TZA",29,1974,"Mr. President  your unanimous election to the office of President of the twenty-ninth session is a clear indication of the high esteem the international community has for your statesmanship and great qualities of leadership. Let me therefore join with other speakers before me in offering you my own sincere congratulations as well as the felicitations of the Tanzania delegation for the honor and confidence placed in you by the General Assembly. I should also wish to take this opportunity to extend to you and to the great people of Algeria fraternal greetings of good will and best wishes from the Government and people of Tanzania  not only because you come from Africa but also because your country's struggle for freedom has inspired many a gallant freedom fighter throughout the world.141.	It is also with great pleasure that I extend on behalf of the Tanzania delegation and myself my deep appreciation to Mr. Benites for the great services he rendered to the Organization in the exemplary manner he presided over the twenty-eighth and sixth special sessions of the General Assembly.142.	It is with a great sense of satisfaction that I join those who have preceded me in welcoming Guinea- Bissau  Grenada and Bangladesh as Members of the United Nations. To these new Members my delegation pledges its readiness to co-operate at all times in our common struggle to realize the noble objectives so eloquently enunciated in the Charter of the United Nations.143.	The independence of Guinea-Bissau came after many years of bitter fighting and among those who lost their lives is the great son of the revolution  brother Amilcar Cabral. It is terrible that he should have been assassinated on the eve of victory. But as his martyrdom propelled his people to greater victories  so will his memory for ever remain as a guiding torch in the reconstruction of Guinea-Bissau and the consolidation and protection of its hard-won independence  for which he dedicated his entire life. We equally pay homage to the memory of that great Mozambican  Mr. Eduardo Mondlane  who lost his life in similar circumstances and for a similar noble cause.144. In welcoming the new State of Guinea-Bissau to the United Nations  Tanzania  and indeed the entire international community  cannot but express its profound sense of relief that at long last the Portuguese colonial system that brought so much terror and suffering to the people in Guinea-Bissau  Mozambique  Angola and other colonies under Portuguese rule on the African continent is coming to an end.145.	It is naturally gratifying that the new leadership in Portugal has accepted the right to independence of the former Portuguese colonies. In this connexion the Tanzania Government is highly encouraged by the agreement between Portugal and the Frente de Libertaao de Mozambique [FRE LI MO] which will provide for the establishment of a transitional Government in Mozambique leading to the independence of that country on 25 June 1975. It is the fervent hope of the Government of Tanzania that an agreement will soon be reached for the total decolonization of Angola  enabling the people of that country to realize their long-cherished and legitimate aspirations.146.	Judging from the uncertainties that followed the change of government in Portugal on 25 April this year  it can be admitted that it was not an easy decision for the new Portuguese leadership to accept the principle of decolonization. But there could be no other alternative. For the inevitable collapse of the Caetano colonial tyranny was irreversibly guaranteed by the unflinching commitment of the gallant struggle of the oppressed masses in the colonial territories.147.	Tanzania takes particular note of the. declaration by Portugal that there will be no room for neo-colonialist relationships with the new emerging States. This is as it should be. There is no reason why the people of Portugal should feel any sense of loss or humiliation. On the contrary  there is every reason to be satisfied. For the new relationship now emerging between Portugal and its former colonial territories will certainly contribute to a climate of mutual trust and better co-operation not only between Portugal and the new States  but also between Portugal and the rest of the world. At any rate  we in Africa have always stated that the struggle for freedom and human dignity on the continent has never been based on racist concepts; rather it has been a struggle against oppressive political systems  a struggle which draws its inspiration from an uncompromising commitment to the defense of the sacred dignity and worth of the human person.148.	I wish to note with particular appreciation the important statement made by the Foreign Minister of Portugal  Mr. Mario Soares  in this Assembly at this session [2239th meeting]. That statement was a clear reaffirmation of the policies of the new Portugal in favor of decolonization. It is important that nothing be done to frustrate this commitment. For any nation or group of nations which endeavors in any manner to reverse the present trends in the colonies will stand for ever condemned in the eyes of the African peoples  and indeed of the entire world community  as a betrayer of the cause of freedom in Africa. I take this opportunity to wish the present Government of Portugal most sincerely every success in its efforts to eradicate the smoldering remnant forces of fascism  which have for over half a century oppressed the people of Portugal and for over 500 years caused untold human suffering on the African continent.149.	The progress towards freedom achieved in Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau stands in sharp contrast to the tragedy of Namibia  Rhodesia and the non-white population in South Africa. In recent months developments in Namibia have burst upon the outside world as a harsh reminder of the nature of South African colonial rule. For in Namibia the African people have resolutely rejected continuing to live under terror and have taken up arms under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO] to defend their dignity. Neither South Africa nor the apologists of apartheid can deny that  in spite of the overwhelming might of the South African armed police State  bitter fighting has been going on in Namibia against South African colonialism. Because of this struggle and its successes  the colonial authorities in Namibia have embarked on savage and brutal torture. Hundreds of thousands of people are being arrested  imprisoned  and sometimes shot on the spot. The brutal floggings of women  children and men in Namibia must shock every man and woman of conscience. The unfortunate faithful allies of South Africa -and we saw some of them yesterday -ought to hang their heads in shame  or else they must be completely devoid of compassion and human feelings.150.	The situation in the British colony of Rhodesia is no less tragic than that obtaining in Namibia and South Africa. Nearly 10 years after the racist minority settlers rebelled against the United Kingdom there seems to be no hope of an end to this problem. And as the years go by the settlers in Rhodesia  actively assisted in all fields by the South African racist regime  intensify their oppression of the black majority in that colony. The people of Zimbabwe  however  have taken up arms to fight to regain their freedom and human dignity. And they are doing so in spite of the great odds against them. That they have scored great victories is no longer a matter of doubt  for the panic and the fear now handing the settlers in Rhodesia are a clear indication of the great victories of the freedom struggle. It is incumbent upon every Member of the United Nations to ensure that no action is taken by its nationals or its institutions to frustrate the struggle for freedom in Rhodesia. It is in this respect that my Government  and indeed the entire African continent  have become distressed and angered by the behavior of many countries  and the companies operating under their jurisdiction  in breaking the economic sanctions against Rhodesia  these violations by companies   and certain States Members of the United Nations  in particular the United States  constitute open support of the evil oppressors of the people of Zimbabwe.151.	It must be pointed out again that the problem of Rhodesia is legally a matter within the competence of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. Since the rebellion in 1965 the United Kingdom has conducted numerous negotiations with the rebels to try to end the rebellion. The African majority have always regarded these negotiations with deep suspicion because for the most part they have been based on the assumption that the rebellion can be legalized by giving independence to the colony On the basis of a constitution which will leave the African majority at the mercy of the settlers. That is why the United Nations has insisted and must continue to insist that there should be no independence until majority rule has been achieved. The African people have rejected all other alternatives  as has been evident since the fate of the 1971 proposals for a settlement and the Pearce Commission. The African people in Zimbabwe will never participate in attempts to find solutions which in essence amount to asking them to legalize their state of subjugation. Therefore  any agreement that is not based on majority rule can only be regarded by the African people as a criminal betrayal. The responsibility of the United kingdom in this matter is therefore heavy. The United Kingdom must not commit a double betrayal. More specifically  there can be no meaningful negotiations without the full participation of the legitimate leaders of the African people in Zimbabwe  and in particular Joshua Nkomo and the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole. It should be pointed out that  in a joint communique issued in 1973 in Ottawa at the last meeting of Commonwealth Heads of State and Government  the Government of the United Kingdom gave an undertaking to work to secure the release of those two leaders. The Government of Tanzania is anxiously waiting for Her Majesty's Government to fulfill that undertaking.152.	In South Africa  the oppression and humiliation to which the African people have been subjected for decades become more intense. The millions of the non-while population in that country have suffered too long  and their agony must constitute an acute moral challenge of immense proportion to every member of this international community. For here is a situation in which millions of innocent victims remain perpetually condemned to a state of abject misery. They cry and weep  and their bitter tears are an indictment of the conspiracy of silence and neglect by those who have been largely responsible for encouraging South Africa in its unrelenting rule of terror. We in Tanzania have protested and will continue to protest against this criminal conspiracy.153.	My Government has viewed with distress  and has unequivocally condemned  all attempts to have any relations with South Africa. We have  for example  called for the total isolation of South Africa from all sporting events. That is why Tanzania condemned the recent tour of South Africa and Rhodesia by the rugby team from the United Kingdom. My Government has equally vehemently condemned the military collaboration that exists between some Western countries  especially France  and South Africa. The recent joint naval maneuvers by the United Kingdom and South Africa are also a case in point.154.	We call on the Security Council to examine  as a matter of urgency  the question of imposing economic sanctions against South Africa and of re- enforcing the arms embargo against that country. At the same time  a vigorous and more co-ordinated campaign should now be mounted by the United Nations and its specialized agencies to dissuade foreign companies from investing in the South African economy. Arguments that economic investments in South Africa by foreign companies bring anything other than increased misery to the majority of the African people are wholly fallacious. Such argumentation is definitely meant as a campaign to mislead the world. The fact is that  as the economy of South Africa has expanded  so has the misery of the non- white population in that country.155.	To make matters worse  the development of South Africa by foreign companies has enabled that country to embark on the manufacture of deadly weapons to be used not only for internal repression but also for external aggression. My Government has been seriously concerned at persistent reports that certain Western countries have now started to purchase South African arms. An example of this type of armament is the Crotale or Cactus air defense missile system made in South Africa with the help of a French electronics firm. It is the earnest hope of the people and Government of Tanzania that those countries will find it possible to desist from such purchases  for to do so simply amounts to a criminal collaboration with South Africa in its efforts to increase and refine its oppressive armaments industry. 156.	The Government of Tanzania is now convinced that the time has come for the United Nations to reconsider seriously its relationship with South Africa because of the racist policies of that country. South Africa and its supporters have* often claimed that the outside world has been unfair in its condemnation of the apartheid regime. But what is the truth? There is no place in the world  except in South Africa  where racism forms the basis of the philosophy of the State and is entrenched in the constitution of the country. Secondly  in South Africa we have the equivalent of a State church  the Dutch Reformed Church  whose faith includes as one of its fundamental doctrines the teaching of racial hatred. Because of this situation  the African people in South Africa cannot go to the State for redress as they could do if racial discrimination did not form part of the constitution of that country. South Africa has deliberately refused to heed the call by the international community to change its racist policies 157.	Those reasons alone sufficiently disqualify apartheid South Africa from being a Member of our Organization. For the principles of freedom  racial equality and human dignity enshrined in our Charter cannot and should not be allowed to coexist with the obnoxious policies of the perpetual humiliation and degradation of humanity so notoriously embodied in the doctrine of apartheid. But there are other factors equally powerful which make the continued presence of the apartheid delegation in our Organization both an anachronism and a serious liability to the United Nations. South Africa has chosen the path of consistent violation of the resolutions and decisions of the United Nations. It has shown nothing but utter and absolute contempt and disregard of this Organization.158.	The record of such violations is well known to all and needs no further elaboration. What  then  is the basis of apartheid South Africa's continued presence in our Organization? What sort of values are the racist authorities attaching to the principles of the Organization? Is it not obvious that  by allowing the Vorster representatives to continue ridiculing our Organization  we are only strengthening those forces wishing to erode the credibility  effectiveness and the prestige of the Organization? We submit that every single day that apartheid South Africa continues to enjoy the rights and privileges of a Member of this Organization  while completely ignoring and violating the corresponding obligations of membership  makes a mockery of the United Nations.159.	For those obvious reasons  Tanzania considers the continued participation in our Organization of the racists from Pretoria as a serious anomaly needing immediate rectification by the expulsion of apartheid South Africa from this Organization. We strongly believe that by such action the United Nations will be reaffirming the noble objectives and ideals of the Charter. There will be those who will ask us what cause will be served by that act. To them we say  What cause has been served  since the United Nations started  by South Africa's being a Member of this Organization for all those years?160.	There is no doubt that the developments in the Portuguese colonies have ushered in a new era of hope in southern Africa. The struggle for freedom and human dignity in that area has acquired new momentum. Is it not time for the racist regime in Zimbabwe to see the writing on the wall? Is it not time for the South African colonialists to pay heed to the demands of the international community and immediately to end their illegal occupation of Namibia? Those are not idle questions. Either the South African racist and the Smith regimes draw the necessary conclusions and thus avoid further bloodshed or they continue to behave like ostriches and in the process prolong a confrontation in which they will inevitably be the losers.161.	The economic and social conditions of the majority of the world's population have never been as grim and desperate as they are at the present moment. While a minority of the world's population seems to be faring better in material welfare and continues to enjoy incredible wealth furnished by unprecedented industrial development  the rest of mankind remains without the basic needs for survival. Admittedly  there are economic and social problems in those countries commonly referred to as the developed countries. But there is absolutely nothing comparable in the developed countries to the mass poverty and the utter destitution in the rest of the world.162.	For decades  many developing countries have tried hard—I repeat  have tried hard -to escape from their appalling economic and social condition. There can be no question that they have tried very hard. They are still trying and they will continue to do so as long as it is humanly possible. The records of their efforts  whether at the international or the national level  speak for themselves.163.	The international institutions  especially those working under the auspices of the United Nations  which have sprung up during the last decade or so bear testimony to the efforts by developing countries to try to obtain solutions to their economic ills. The setting up of UNDP  UN I DO and UNCTAD and the creation of development funds such as the United Nations Capital Development Fund are good cases in point. At the national level  our Governments and peoples have been trying desperately by various ways and means to break the chains of backwardness afflicting our nations; but  in spite of all these efforts  the economic and social conditions of developing countries have worsened164.	The fundamental cause of the present lack of development on the part of the developing countries can be found in the unjust relationship that governs the economic and technical co-operation between the minority rich and the majority poor of the world. The developing countries have been toiling to produce more but they have been deprived of the full worth of their products. With few exceptions  the sweat and labor of our people are utterly disproportionate to the price imposed on what they produce. Com-pounding this problem is the problem of currency instability and galloping inflation which are causing great havoc and extreme hardship  especially to many small developing countries. Tanzania believes that the time has come to reject the assumption that all some countries have to do is to act as pawns in the intricate game of international monetary and fiscal policies which are determined by a select group of countries. We completely reject as unacceptable to our people that they should endure misery and deprivation on account of currency upheavals  which in some cases are deliberately set in motion by greedy speculators  ruthless tycoons and capitalists whose major concern is simply to amass a fortune for the sake of a fortune. 165.	This brings me to the problem which is one of the central issues in the present discussion of the current world economic situation. I refer to the question of oil. There can be no doubt that the power to set fair prices of raw materials produced in a country is part of the logical consequence of the acceptance of the principle of sovereignty of the producing country over the raw material in question. But  I repeat  for a developing country like Tanzania to recognize and accept this principle and to express concern at the soaring prices of oil are not incompatible. To many of the developing countries the current high oil prices amount to near economic strangulation.166.	Tanzania appreciates some of the limited steps taken to try to alleviate this problem. We feel  however  that oil-producing countries have to consider very seriously how to co-operate much more effectively with many of the non-oil-producing countries to avoid grave economic instability and unnecessary hardship to millions of people throughout the third world. I may add that we hope the oil-producing countries will realize this as an item that could very well spell division in the third world.167.	Having said that  we in Tanzania must emphatically reject any tendency to distort the real economic issues facing the world by resorting to implicit threats or covert blackmail. Any solution to the present world economic crisis in which many developing countries are the greatest victims must be predicated on a system based on just  fair and equitable arrangements that should guarantee to all nations a fair return for the labor and the product of their people. A precondition to the achievement of this objective is the necessity on the part of all countries to stand ready and to be willing to adopt measures which will bring justice and equity to all international economic relations. But first there must be the political desire to be fair. Without this  our hope for a new international economic order will be a hopeless illusion.168.	The cease-fire in the Middle East of last October brought a sense of temporary relief and a hopeful expectation that at long last a way could be found to end years of bloodshed and confrontation which have inflicted untold sufferings on millions of inhabitants in that troubled area. The uneasy peace that now exists in the Middle East and the deceptive air of tranquility along the Suez Canal must not  however  lull all parties to the dispute and the entire international community into relaxing their efforts to find a just  durable and permanent peace in the Middle East. Indeed  the reports about war maneuvers and military preparedness now regularly coming from the area clearly demonstrate the urgent need to find a quick solution to this problem.169.	But my Government believes and is convinced that no peace can come to the area unless it is based on certain fundamental principles. These include acceptance by Israel of the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of Arab lands by force and the need to find a just  fair and lasting solution to the Palestinian problem. To ignore these two elements will be to run away from reality  and any arrangements made without proper cognizance of these principles will produce just another shaky peace. In this connexion  a number of countries  including my own  Tanzania  have requested the inclusion in the agenda of the twenty-ninth session of an item entitled the ""Question of Palestine"".170.	The gravest error that this Organization has made is to ignore the Palestinian people  as if they did not exist. Since 1948 we have discussed the question of the Middle East in a manner which ignored the original cause. It is our belief that it will be almost impossible  if not futile  to solve the Middle East problem without first settling the Palestinian problem. Unless the existence of the Palestinian people is recognized and their fundamental rights assured by this Organization  all the debates in the halls of the United Nations will be an exercise in futility. It is the hope of the Tanzanian delegation that the inclusion of this item will afford the General Assembly a greater opportunity to address itself to this question with a view to redressing the injustice done to the Palestinian people and  indeed  with a view to ending the Middle East crisis.171.	It is a matter of deep concern to my delegation that  while the great Powers issue declarations about detente  fierce rivalry in various forms continues for hegemony in many areas of the world. Thus in areas such as the Indian Ocean  ""which has been solemnly declared by the General Assembly as a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]  steps continue to be taken for the establishment of military bases with weapons of mass destruction.172.	Furthermore  the much publicized spirit of detente has meant very little to millions who have to endure the consequences of wars of aggression and are perpetually subjected to imperialist intervention. In Viet Nam  even though a peace agreement was signed two years ago  the United States and the puppet Thieu regime continue to frustrate effective progress towards an end of the fighting which has brought so much suffering to the peopEe of Viet Nam. In Cambodia  where the people have rejected the corrupt Lon Nol clique  the United States has committed itself to ensuring the permanent survival of that decadent regime. In Korea the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the total reunification of that country have been frustrated by the Park regime and foreign intervention.173.	All this confirms our fears that detente may after all be used as a camouflage for continuing aggression  intimidation  sabotage  the subversion of foreign. Governments and even the callous assassination of leaders whose only crime is their desire to defend the freedom and independence of their countries.174.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  preparations for which we taken a number of years  is in itself a recognition the necessity of changing the existing international maritime law in order to avoid the chaos which that law admittedly tends to promote. But change of law alone cannot guarantee peace  let alone justice. The emerging law must be equitable as well as precise. The so-called freedom of the sea must give way to precise rules of law which are designed to protect the interests of all nations  developed and developing  and to promote international co-operation for the benefit of all mankind in the exploitation and utilization of the resources and other benefits of ocean space.175.	Although we have noted the seriousness with which all States are approaching the matter  we wish to express our regret that antiquated attitudes favoring the chaos-oriented traditional maritime law continue to guide the policies of some States  in total disregard of the interests of the vast majority of States and peoples  and in spite of the dangers to international peace which those attitudes are promoting.176.	In this connexion  it is not enough to make repeated statements  in the name of negotiations  about a give-and-take spirit  as if all sides had something to give  when in fact it is only the few privileged nations that must pay a great debt to the rest of the world; for the transaction of the law of the sea is not between equally privileged States: it is largely a transaction between the ""haves"" and the ""ambitious- to-continue-to-have""  on one side  and the ""have-nots""  on the other. If peace rests on justice  as it should  and if all the parties share the goal of justice in their work  it cannot but be accepted that the bulk of responsibility for the success of the Conference lies with those who are enjoying privileged positions at the present moment  it is on them  rather than on the others  that the success of the Conference depends. It is they who have the choice between justice and injustice concerning the sea  and between peace and international conflicts. It is a question of good faith and political courage. The absence of these factors will inevitably spell a failure to .achieve a meaningful convention. Their acceptance is therefore a prerequisite for the success of the Conference and of a convention that will do justice to all mankind.177.	I cannot conclude my statement without referring to the recent tragic events in Cyprus. We do not see the need at this stage for apportioning blame. My delegation certainly joins those who have earnestly called for an end to the present sad and intolerable situation in Cyprus. Common sense demands that humanity and compassion prevail  and that the parties responsible for the suffering of the Cypriot people should immediately address themselves not only to the burning refugee question but to the more intractable problem of finding a permanent solution to the Cyprus issue. It is the view of the Tanzania delegation that any solution to this problem must entail the withdrawal  as a matter of urgency  of all foreign troops and the restoration of the full independence of that country. We believe that as an independent and sovereign nation the people of Cyprus will be able to find the way to solve their own problems in complete freedom.178.	The problems of colonialism and racism in southern Africa  the problems of the dispossessed people of Palestine  and the divided peoples of Korea and Viet Nam are all challenges that can easily break their geographic confines and engulf humanity in a hatred of unimaginable proportions. Thus if we are deaf to  or we evade  redressing the injustices visited upon the millions of people of those areas  the inevitable bloodshed and suffering will erode the very fabric of our civilization. If we fail to evolve just and equitable solutions to the grave economic situation facing the world  we shall be responsible for an economic disorder that will undoubtedly doom not only our present generation  but future generations as well. Our great and grave responsibility is firmly to ensure that human progress based on justice is achieved."
"121",7086,"UGA",29,1974,"Mr. President  allow me the privilege of associating my delegation with the hearty congratulations already expressed by many delegations on your election to the high and esteemed office of the presidency of the twenty ninth session of the General Assembly. As you are a distinguished son of Africa  your election is a tribute not only to your revolutionary country  Algeria  and to you personally but also to Africa as a whole. With your renowned statesmanship  there is no doubt that you will carry out your heavy responsibilities to the satisfaction of this Assembly.2.	I should like  by the same token  to hail the creative efforts and considerable results achieved by the General Assembly at its last session under the leadership of the outgoing President from Ecuador. I wish also to pay a tribute to the SecretaryGeneral  Mr. Waldheim  for the dynamism with which he has been executing his duties since his appointment as SecretaryGeneral.3.	I do not wish to take up the time of the Assembly by repeating themes which previous speakers have so ably expounded. I will only speak about matters relevant to this Assembly which have direct bearing on Uganda  and to which this world body should react with action rather than flowery oratory.4.	My delegation views with guarded delight the new developments in Portugal. The new Portuguese Government has recognized the futility of trying to hold down peoples in areas many times the size of Portugal. Portugal's announcement of its intention to give freedom to its African colonies  after a wasteful and negative war lasting over a decade  heralds the day  not far from now  when we shall be engaged in this forum in a friendly dialogue geared towards the economic development of theAfrican and Portuguese peoples. We in Uganda  and indeed all the members of the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  are satisfied that the material and moral support we have consistently been giving to the African liberation movements has paid dividends. We therefore welcome the admission of the sister State of GuineaBissau to this Assembly.5.	The presence of the representative of the heroic people of GuineaBissau among us is clear testimony to the success of the liberation struggle in Africa. We shall  both as a nation and as a continent  continue resolutely to support that struggle until all peoples under Portuguese domination are free.6.	My delegation noted with cautious optimism the speech delivered before this Assembly by the Foreign Minister of Portugal [2239th meeting] in regard to his country's determination to grant independence to the peoples of Mozambique  Angola and the Cape Verde Islands. My delegation believes that the independence of these Territories is long overdue. While we join all progressive countries in welcoming the intention of Portugal to grant independence to its Territories  the Uganda Government's stand remains clear and Arm: that is  that independence for Angola  Cape Verde and the Sao Tome islands should be granted immediately. We are strongly opposed to any program that stipulates any delay in granting immediate independence. We are consequently opposed to the Portuguese program of delaying the independence of Mozambique for a year.7.	In calling for immediate and unconditional independence for the peoples of Mozambique  Angola and Cape Verde  my delegation is fully aware of the progressive and well intentioned forces in Portugal. But  at the same time  we know of the existence of vicious and reactionary forces in Portugal and its Territories that are determined to frustrate the decolonization process  as exposed by recent events in Mozambique. We thus emphatically reject any program except one of immediate independence for our brothers and sisters in the Portuguese Territories.8.	We feel confident that the lesson Portugal has learned over the last 13 years should sound a clear warning to the racialist minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia. Clearly  the wave of freedom is steadily and inevitably heading southwards towards Cape Town. But we are not so naive as to assume that the path will be an easy one. The odds are many and formidable. In southern Africa we see a paradoxical triangle of Zionism  racism and economic exploitation. There are many evil forces that feel that apartheid is the sole protector of their economic interests in southern Africa. Because of economic considerations  the Americans have allowedtheir allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  in connivance with Zionist interests  to perpetuate the racist regimes of southern Africa.9.	The stand of my Government in regard to the chronic and shameful situation in southern Africa and Zimbabwe is and will always remain that there is no other way  nor is there any other method  than military intervention. I do not need to emphasize the real dangers to international security that are inherent in the situations prevailing in both South Africa and Zimbabwe. We further believe  indeed we are convinced  that the adamant attitude of the Pretoria regime in not heeding international appeals  and its flagrant breach of the Charter of the United Nations call for stern measures; and to us this should mean the expulsion of racist South Africa from this Organization. The world has been patient enough  and it will remain a great betrayal of the principles of the Charter and indeed a sad commentary on our generation if we continue to nurse and accommodate the representatives of a racist and inhuman regime. We must live up to the noble and sacred duty of defending the principles that are clearly enshrined in the Charter of this Organization. We must therefore not be deceived by diverted from our own obligations.10.	Uganda views with great concern the underhanded manoeuvres and machinations to which these inhuman forces have resorted in an attempt to divert world attention from their direct involvement in perpetuating apartheid. Soon after the new Government of Portugal announced it would consider giving freedom to its African Territories  a vicious and slanderous campaign was unleashed against my country in a desperate attempt by the agents of imperialism  Zionism  fascism and racialism to divert world attention from the frightening racial situation in southern Africa by trying to brand a black African State as racist. Those evil forces  led by the British and Israelis after Uganda has expelled their nationals who were exploiting the economy of Uganda  and after Uganda had nationalized their assets in the interest of the development of its own citizens  lost no time in financing a vicious campaign against Uganda. They gave graft to a few individuals in the International Commission of Jurists to produce haphazardly a report whose sole aim was to paint Uganda as a racist country so that the world community would exonerate the racist regimes of southern Africa from blame.11.	I wish to observe that Uganda is committed to freedom and human rights in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In Uganda today there exists freedom of the press: that is to say  there are also privately owned news media. There is also freedom of religion: the religious conflicts that were rampant throughout the colonial period and that were carried forward by the previous regime right up to 1971 have now been settled and there is no religious discrimination whatsoever in the State machinery. As a matter of fact  the Government has given financial and material support to all religious groups  Christian and Moslem alike. There is also freedom of association  and equality before the law; our judiciary system is functioning properly.12. Nationalization of property is subject to compensation  as guaranteed by the Uganda Constitution.13! There is no discrimination based on sex. I am glad to announce here that in Uganda women are fully emancipated and share the same responsibilities as their male counterparts in all fields of activity. They are now busy preparing for the celebration of the International Women's Year.14.	But for the freedoms I have just enumerated to be meaningful and practicable there must exist State machinery capable of guaranteeing law and order and punishing their infringement  since the absence of such machinery could only breed anarchy and the lack of such freedoms. Uganda has reached a stage of anarchy immediately before 1971. At that time there existed sections of the Uganda community which had been armed by the State machinery then existing for the purpose of committing depredations on the population. It was .this that led to the military takeover of the administration of the country in 1971  in order to restore freedom and human rights in Uganda.15.	It is clear  therefore  that the imperialists financed' the British and other mass media to carry false and concocted stories about Uganda in order to cover up their own atrocious crimes  such as the wEioiesale destruction of the VietNamese people  the indiscriminate slaughter of the innocent people of Northern. Ireland and the Zionist pogrom unleashed against the Palestinian people. Why has the International Commission of Jurists  for example  not produced studies on Northern Ireland? If the Commission wishes any credence to be given to its work it should seriously do something about the image it has so far given of itself  namely that of a bunch of graftcollectors in the employment of imperialists  Zionists and racialists. We hope the world community will not be taken in by this obvious debauchery on the part of the imperialists and their own agents.16.	The occasion of the vendetta against Uganda is not the first time that British imperialism has connived with Zionism to bring misery to a given group of people. Indeed  the Middle East problem would never have arisen if a similar vendetta had not been pursued by Britain and world Zionism to frustrate the just aspirations of the Arab nations. The problem was originally created by the British and the Zionists when they drove the Palestinians out of their homes and lands and created the State of Israel. Since then  the expansionist forces of Zionism have systematically killed and destroyed the * legitimate owners of Palestine. Uganda is very much concerned about this state Of affairs  considering that  before the Zionists took Palestine  the British had made them the alternative offer of Uganda. Therefore  Uganda is fully committed to supporting the aspirations of the Palestinian people because we realize that if the Zionists had selected Uganda it would have been the people of Uganda suffering the Zionist pogrom.17.	If is Uganda's policy to support all just causes wherever they may be. We have condemned and will continue to condemn Israel for its continued occupation of Arab land. In 1972 Uganda was the first African country to sever relations with Israel  thereby spearheading the move which successfully isolated the Zionist State from recognition by African countries.18.	As I mentioned earlier  Uganda supports all just causes in the world. That is why we have given unstinted support to the black people in America and elsewhere in their struggle for equality and human dignity. Unfortunately they still live in a situation amounting to slavery in their own countries. It is high time that black people were recognized as equal beings entitled to equal and dignified treatment. The myth that they are not equal has long been exploded by the fact that African countries have been able to run their own affairs. It is ironical that when the Western Powers come to Africa they treat Africans with respect. The question that Uganda would like to pose is  ""Why do they not extend this same  respect to the black people in their own countries?"" If the Western countries wish to give credibility to their professed concern for human rights they ought to pay serious attention to this problem with a view to rectifying the situation.19.	On economic issues  Uganda is confident that in spite of the difficulties and obstacles which beset the sixth special session of the General Assembly the session achieved the purpose for which it was called: namely  to lay the foundation or basis for a new (economic relationship between the developed and the developing countries. The recent energy crisis has made the whole world aware that the economic foundations of the socalled developed nations are not as solid as we have been led for many decades to believe. Uganda subscribes to the principles of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (SVI)]. We believe in the right of every country to exercise permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and all economic activities. We believe in the right of every country to exercise effective control over its resources and their exploitation by means appropriate to its own situation  including the right of nationalization or transfer of ownership to its own nationals.20.	It was in keeping with these principles  which are universally recognized  that Uganda's economic war was declared by President Idi Amin Dada. The aim of this war was to transfer the economy of Uganda to its rightful owners  the Ugandans. For many years  even after independence  more than 80 per cent of Uganda's economy was being managed  controlled and owned by foreigners  mainly from Britain  who did net have the interest of ?he country at heart. The rationale of the step taken by the President of Uganda was to ensure that the volume and pattern of economic activities in Uganda were determined by Ugandans. The fulfillment of this required that the bulk of productive activities be generated  managed and owned by Ugandans. This objective is thus an expression of faith in the doctrine of economic independence and selfreliance. Since he came to power  the Ugandan leader has devoted most of his economic efforts to giving practical effect to this doctrine. However  my Government does not consider economic selfreliance to imply complete isolation. Thus  foreign .enterprise  foreign' financial assistance and foreign personnel are always welcome to supplement Uganda's own resources for the development of key sectors of the economy. Also  the expansion of Uganda's trade with foreign countries remains a cardinal element in. the Government's development strategy.21.	Uganda was therefore startled that  when we nationalized British and Israeli assets for the benefit of our own nationals  those two countries  motivated by greed  started a smear   campaign against Uganda to the extent of persuading their imperialist allies to cease commercial transactions with it. Uganda is at the present time a victim of the belief  translated into practice  of certain countries that aid is an extension of foreign policy which must be utilized to wield undue influence. For the same reason  because of the legitimate steps we took to hand over the economy of Uganda to the indigenous Ugandans  certain countries have tried  and managed  to influence the blocking of aid to Uganda by such international financial institutions as the World Bank and IMF. We are contributors to these institutions and therefore have a right  like any member; to receive aid from them. To confuse bilateral differences between nations with international obligations and rights is a definite and familiar attempt to apply the bigstick policy to the small and weak nations.22.	It is a wellknown fact that these institutions are supposed to grant aid to all Member States without discrimination or bias  and they should therefore adhere to these principles. Unfortunately  experience has shown that the setup of these institutions is susceptible to the influence of the big developed countries  which tend to use them to put pressure on the weak developing countries. My delegation would like to see an urgent reform in these institutions to rectify this anomalous situation which has hitherto been detrimental to the interests of the small developing nations. We reject this ""Big Brother"" blackmail policy in aiding developing countries. It is a policy of economic strangulation.23.	As if that was not enough  the International Commission of Jurists  at the instigation of some imperialist countries  deposited a socalled study with the Commission on Human Rights  alleging  among other things  that  the transfer of the economic life of the country from foreign exploiters to the nationals of our country was a gross violation of human rights. The right of nationalization by a State  in the interest of its economy  of assets owned by foreigners is inherent in its sovereignty. That is a universally accepted principle. Uganda is neither the first  nor will it be the last  country to nationalize foreign assets. The British imperialists who instigated the accusation and had it placed before the Commission Human Rights are the very people who  barely a fortnight ago  were quietly sitting at a table in Kampala with the Uganda .Government to work out compensation arrangements for the assets nationalized. The imperialists certainly do have some original approaches to the practice of double standards. I wish again to reiterate that it is our first policy to pay compensation where nationalization of property has occurred. It is in keeping with that principle that the Uganda Government has set up a highpowered committee to appraise the assets left behind by those affected by the economic war.That is a practical demonstration of the seriousness of our intentions.24.	While on the economic question  I wish to stress that Uganda as a landlocked developing State keenly participated in the deliberations and outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. We shall continue to work for the equitable sharing of both the living and nonliving resources ofthe sea because we believe in the concept that the sea is the common heritage of all mankind.25.	On historical analysis  it is established that most of the ills of this world  and particularly of Africa  are the direct result of actions of the big imperialist and colonialist Powers that for centuries have convinced themselves that they have the divine right to interfere in any manner and at any time in the affairs of smaller and meek States on our continent. All the problems I have enumerated are the direct result of colonial and imperialistic policies of ensuring that the whole world shall be organized according to their whims and fancies. It is because the imperialist Powers regard small nations as pawns in their chess game that we have situations like the tragic case in Cyprus and the continued division of Korea and Viet Nam.26.	The main purpose of superPowers being permanent members of the Security Council is to see that there is peace in the world and to ensure that  wherever tension exists  there are peaceful ways of easing it. Uganda finds it deplorable that the United States of America  a superPower and a permanent member of the Security Council  has always been directly involved in the creation and perpetuation of world tension through unwarranted interference in the affairs of other countries. We are all aware of the problem of Viet Nam  where we witnessed the destruction of innocent lives by the massive bombings of the American B52  bombings unparalleled in human history. In Korea  Cambodia and in the whole region of SouthEast Asia  we see America unceasingly interfering in the affairs of these countries with a view to creating pliable States. In South Africa  the United States  through its investment  is propping up a regime that is suppressing the overwhelming majority simply because of the color of its skin. The people in these countries are peaceloving and have a right to determine their own destiny. Our appeal to the United States is that American influence and wealth should be used for peaceful purposes and should help to. raise the standards of living of the people in these areas rather than bring them untold misery. We have noted with satisfaction the declared intention of President Ford to pursue this line. Our hopes are that these peaceful intentions will be translated into deeds and not remain mere declarations.27.	The main purpose of the interference in the internal affairs of our countries by the imperialists is to create and maintain spheres of influence. Uganda  as is well known  used to belong to the British sphere of influence. That is no longer the case and I wish to inform the Assembly that Uganda is ready to cooperate with all countries  irrespective of their ideology or size  on the basis of equality.28.	I now come to consider the question of disarmament because it has a direct relevance to the foregoing issues I have raised. Uganda is happy to note the growing interest among Member States in the attempt not only to curb potential arsenals but also to limit or destroy the existing ones. Many representatives who have spoken before me have treated this question fairly comprehensively. I will  therefore  only make Uganda's stand on the question unequivocally clear. We neither support the proliferation of nuclear weapons nor wish to see the big Powers alone monopolizing nuclear weapons  We believe that disarmament should involve first and foremost the destruction of existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons.29.	We fear that if the big Powers are left to monopolize the nuclear club  the former colonial Powers will have the instruments to return and colonize us. The imperialist Powers built up their economies by exploiting the natural resources and cheap labor of the colonies. Even during post-independence days  the same colonial Powers continued exploiting developing countries by imposing their own conditions on trade. Now that the third world has  after the energy crisis  awakened to the fact that the so-called developed nations are vulnerable economically and that a new international economic order is inevitable  Uganda foresees the danger of leaving nuclear weapons in the hands of the imperialist countries. These Powers may one day use economic reasons as the excuse to threaten nuclear war in order to force developing nations into compromising their economic independence. Disarmament therefore becomes a crucial issue so far as developing countries are concerned.30.	My delegation feels that  even if present stockpiles of nuclear weapons are destroyed  technological knowledge should not be monopolized by the superPowers only. If the developing countries are ever to bridge the economic gap between them and the developed countries  then it is necessary that they have access to nuclear technology in order to use it for peaceful and developmental purposes.31.	I now wish to stress the role of the United Nations and its agencies in giving correct information  especially in regard to the developing countries. We feel that some of the problems we constantly debate here would have been avoided if it had not been for the deliberate distortion of information by the imperialist press aimed at checking the development of third world countries. The imperialist press has nothing good to say about the third world countries  and yet it was the colonialists who left us most of these problems; by deliberate design.32.	It is indeed a strange phenomenon that the imperialists do not want to deal with straightforward  honest  and down to earth leaders of the third world who truly represent their peoples. This explains the imperialist attack on the Ugandan leader. When the imperialists handed over power at independence  they made sure they handed it to very carefully selected puppets of their own choosing so that they would continue  through corruption  confusion and other means  to plunder the resources of those countries. It is not a coincidence that in the majority of casQs  when the masses cannot endure the situation any more  military coups have taken place to save such countries from total collapse. It was in this situation that the soldiers of Uganda who  together with the masses  had suffered under corrupt politicians  took a decision to lay a sound foundation for the economic progress of our country. Now  instead of praising the efforts of honest military leaders like the President of Uganda to put the interests of his people above the interests of foreigners  the imperialist press began waging a smear campaign against such leaders.33.	We would like to appeal to the developed nations  particularly the former colonial Powers who come to this forum and use lofty words like ""social justice"" and ""world order""  to come out seriously and help those honest leaders of the third world to build a better life for their peoples rather than wait for some corrupt political leaders to emerge so that they can resume their plundering.34.	The imperialist mass media seem preoccupied with distorting the correct image of the developing nations so as to dissuade other nations with good will from coming to the aid of such countries. The imperialists forget that at their own invitation they came and imposed their own foreign civilization on us  deprived us of our culture  uprooted our society through corruption and loose morals  and imposed their own languages on us  thus bringing us the complex problems that we face today. The imperialists came and destroyed our own traditional qualities of self-reliance  selflessness  cooperation and moral justice  and instead taught us materialism  selfishness and corruption.35.	But in outlining the desire for Uganda to be self-reliant economically  I do not wish to give the impression that Uganda is pursuing a policy of isolationism  as this is a very narrow anachronistic doctrine. We pursue a policy of cooperation with all peace-loving and well-intentioned people of the world including citizens of this great country  the United States of America  which is playing host to the entire world. We invite them to come and visit Uganda to receive the traditional warmth and welcome of the people of Uganda.36.	But I would be failing in my duty if I did not remind those who are so preoccupied with distorting the image of Uganda that they choose to close their eyes and forget the innumerable practical steps that the President of Uganda has personally undertaken towards the realization of world peace. Uganda's enemies do not wish the world to hear that President Amin was solely responsible for the fundamental transformation of AfroArab relations on the African continent  and yet the alliance between the African and Arab peoples has contributed much to the lessening of tension in the African and Middle East region. They ignore the Ugandan leader's personal efforts to mediate in person to ease tension between third-world countries like Iraq and Iran  Pakistan and Bangladesh and India  Somalia and Ethiopia  Guinea  Senegal and the Ivory Coast  and North and South Korea  to mention only a few. He has also championed the rights of such groups as the blacks in America  the Irish in Northern Ireland and the Palestinians in the Middle East. Unlike some other leaders  the Ugandan leader does not believe merely in paying lip service to world peace but in making practical contributions to it.37.	I conclude by stating that Uganda and others peace loving nations of the world will work towards making this Organization a truly international community  where the experiences  cultures  and contributions of the various communities represented here are mixed and balanced. We in Africa feel that for our contributions to make an impact we must be ourselves that is  truly African. The mission and challenge to us  therefore  is not to opt out of our responsibility to battle with the affairs of our countries as our enemies would have us do  just because of the immensity and complexity of our problems  but to contribute whatever we are capable of .contributing. After all  problems will continue to exist and even multiply so long as this world is not Utopia. I can do no better than end with a quotation from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar:""There is a tide in the affairs of men Which  taken at the flood  leads on to fortune;Omitted  all the voyage of their lifeIs bound in shallows and in miseries.On such a full sea are we now afloat;And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures."""
"122",7131,"UKR",29,1974,"28.	Mankind is approaching a memorable date the thirtieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The years that have passed since then have been filled with a persistent struggle for the prevention of a new military catastrophe  for the strengthening of international peace and security. We can say with satisfaction that much has been achieved. The international situation today is increasingly characterized by important processes connected with the consolidation and deepening of detente and the extension of its sphere of influence. These processes affect a growing number of countries and continents and are beginning to exert a favorable influence on the advance of peoples towards socio-economic progress.29.	The favorable changes in the world have led to increased trust between countries and contributed to the creation of an atmosphere of mutual under-standing of the interests of other countries and peoples. The adherents of dictatorial and coercive methods in international relations are becoming increasingly isolated. Changes are taking place in the very thinking of those whose lives and feelings have been inhibited for so long by the cold war.30.	For all these development; history will pay tribute to the Soviet Union  the States of the socialist community  the non-aligned and other peace-loving countries and realistic political circles  which are striving together to strengthen peace and security and embark on the high road of constructive discussion and the solution of outstanding problems.31.	An important role in the process of the relaxation of international tension is being played by the development of peaceful relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The important agreements concluded between them in the past two years represent a major contribution to the cause of peace  and their implementation will undoubtedly promote the solution of many controversial problems.32.	It can now be stated with the utmost certainty that the new climate which is emerging in international relations is contributing to the settlement of various situations of conflict and making it possible for people to resist aggressive actions more effectively and defend their interests more successfully.33.	The conclusion of the Paris agreements on Viet Nam  the first steps towards a Middle East settlement  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  the talks on the reduction of armaments and armed forces in Central Europe  the negotiations on the limitation of strategic arms between the United States and the Soviet Union -all these important historical events have been and are possible only as a result of positive changes in the international situation. It should also be emphasized that it was precisely as a result of these changes that it became possible to discuss the timely questions raised by the developing countries at the sixth special session of the General Assembly on the establishment of just economic relations among States.34.	Notwithstanding all the complications and difficulties on the road to peace  and the roughness of that road  it is still fair to say that it is the process of relaxation of tensions that determines the development of current international relations. As was stressed by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Ukraine  V. V. She her- bit sky  at a meeting with voters on 6 June this year in Kiev  ""Detente is standing the test of stability  making constant headway and becoming ever more irreversible"".35.	At the same time  it would be unforgivably naive and misguided to suppose that in these new conditions the contradictions of the present-day world will settle themselves or that the threat of war has become an illusion. We must not forget that influential enemies of detente -military-industrial complexes and monopolies growing rich on the arms race- are still at work. Political adventurers from imperialist military blocs which thrived in the favorable climate of the cold war think even now in terms of a policy from a position of strength  provocations  military revolts and coups d'etat. They try to use the tensions which still exist in relations among some States in order to poison the international atmosphere. A shameful contribution is made to this futile exercise by international zionism  the anti-Soviet emigre rubbish which has installed itself in the West and those bourgeois ideologists and journalists who have been so busy at the feeding trough of the cold war—a trough which for them remains to this day a source of sustenance.36.	In this unsavory company we find certain politicians -politicians rather than statesmen -who under the guise of pseudo-revolutionary phraseology are actually doing damage to the national liberation movements  the cause of peace and international co-operation. As at previous sessions of the General Assembly  the delegation of the Chinese People's Republic  headed by Mr. Chiao Kuan-hua  is repeating all kinds of malicious anti-Soviet fabrications. We still find in the arsenal of the utterances of this gentleman the trumped-up slanderous theory of the superPowers  the so-called regional super-Powers  and appeals to what he called revolutionary action  which  in fact  amounts to the fanning of the flames of military conflict. Doing everything he can to oppose detente  the Chinese representative still rejects all the constructive proposals of the Soviet Union  the socialist and other peace-loving States for the sake of the strengthening of international peace and security.37.	It is precisely the Maoists who are opposing proposals approved by the General Assembly  such as the convening of a world disarmament conference  a reduction of military budgets and the use of part of the funds so saved for assistance to developing countries  the non-use of force in international relations  the permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons  the calling of a halt to the testing of these weapons  and much else.38.	Now  what concrete proposals does Peking have for us for the solution of the questions of the strengthening of peace and disarmament which are so vitally important for the state of mankind? Nothing —apart from approving chaos in international relations  which is essentially the same as intensifying confrontation and stepping up the arms race.39.	In his statement yesterday [2252nd meeting] the Chinese representative once again attempted to cast the shadow of slander on the role of the Soviet Union in the granting of assistance tcf national liberation movements and the struggle of the Arab peoples for liberation from Israeli occupation of Arab territories. But we know that slanderous verbal outpourings cannot diminish the significance of the vast political  material and military assistance: being given by the Soviet Union to the fighting peoples.143o To paraphrase the Chinese proverb which we were offered by Mr. Chiao Kuan-hua  I could say that the flowers of slander wither  but the inexorable facts remain  and these facts are not in favour of the Chinese leadership.144.	To resist the forces of reaction and the opponents of the easing of tension is possible only through the adoption of concrete decisions and measures which would really lead to a consolidation of peace. Therefore  the United Nations must intensify its efforts in what is the key direction of all its activities—the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of international security. We must promote this at this session by discussing the question of the implementation of the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security [resolution 2734 (XXV)]. In recent years this document of fundamental importance has been reinforced by a number of new constructive proposals embodied in new decisions and resolutions of. the United Nations which are currently in force in interstate relations.145.	At the same time it should be pointed out that the effectiveness of the strengthening of international security has been decisively influenced by the consistent implementation of the Soviet program of peace mapped out by the Twenty-fourth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and by the practical initiatives of the States of the socialist community.146.	In this connexion  I would like once again to stress the importance of the declaration on the non- use of force in international relations and permanent prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons contained in General Assembly resolution 2936 (XXVII) adopted on the initiative of the Soviet Union. At the present time there are favorable conditions for further progress in settling the question of the renunciation of the use of force by means of all types of weapons  including nuclear weapons. In our opinion  the time has come to take practical steps for the complete implementation of this declaration and to make the most important principles contained in it binding on all Members of the United Nations. We express the hope that the Security Council  in accordance with the recommendation of this resolution  will take an appropriate decision.147.	Recent events in the eastern Mediterranean reaffirm the necessity to fight ever more energetically for the renunciation of the use of force in international relations. The dangerous course of events in Cyprus provoked by certain circles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] runs counter to the measures designed to strengthen international security and therefore affects the interests of all peoples. The vital interests of the people of Cyprus have been seriously threatened. The issue is nothing less than the very existence of this non-aligned State.148.	The Ukrainian SSR calls for a cessation of all outside interference in the affairs of Cyprus  a Member of the United Nations  for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory  for the restoration of constitutional order  and for granting the Cypriots themselves a real opportunity to settle their own domestic affairs.149.	The wrongfulness and the failure of the attempts to solve the Cyprus problem within a narrow circle and in the interests of NATO  without regard to the will of the Cypriots themselves  only reaffirm the importance and the timeliness of the proposal of the USSR to convene  within the framework of the United Nations  an international conference on Cyprus. Such a representative forum could prepare decisions which would really ensure the existence of Cyprus as an independent  sovereign and territorially integral State  something which corresponds to the interests of the entire people of Cyprus.150.	There must be no further delay  either  in a political settlement of the Middle East problem  which for decades now has been poisoning the international atmosphere. The key conditions of such a settlement were and remain as follows: the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied in 1967; the protection of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine in accordance with their national aspirations; the ensuring of the security  territorial integrity and sovereignty of all the States in this region. In the meantime  Israel continues its saber-rattling. It is making attacks on Lebanon  attempting to freeze the situation which arose following the agreements on troop disengagement on the Golan Heights and in Sinai  and is trying to replace radical political solutions by half-measures in order to entrench itself in the occupied territories.151.	But such a policy has no future. It can lead only to further exacerbation and conflict. The interests of peace  the interests of all the peoples of this region urgently require the immediate resumption of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East.152.	Recent events have made it ever more obvious that a Middle East settlement is impossible without a solution of the Palestinian problem and the ensuring of the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine. For this reason  the delegation of the Ukrainian SSR supported the inclusion of that item in the agenda of this session.153.	The draft resolution submitted by a group of countries aimed at the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in South Korea under the flag of the United Nations [Al9703lAdd.3] is also one of the measures aimed at strengthening international security. The presence of these troops is a major obstacle to the unification of Korea by peaceful means; it represents a source of constant military and political tension in this area and encourages the dictatorial regime of South Korea to carry out repression of democratic forces.154.	The Saigon rulers  who enjoy support from the outside  are continuing their bloodshed and their systematic violation of the Paris agreements. At the same time  it is absolutely clear that strict observance of these agreements is the major condition for the establishment of just and lasting peace in Viet Nam. The peoples of Asia are striving for peace  for the creation of a situation propitious for economic and social development  and conditions are becoming ever riper here for the establishment of a collective security system.155.	The memorable change which has taken place in the international situation from cold war to mutual understanding  from confrontation to negotiation  to the solution or the beginning of a solution of a number of the most important problems which only yesterday seemed insoluble  is creating real prospects for progress in the field of disarmament. The need to intensify efforts in this direction is dictated by the fact that in spite of the favorable changes in the world  the arms race continues. Swallowing up more than $250 000 million every year  it is not only having an adverse effect on the security of all States but also diverting vast amounts of material and human resources from peaceful creative work. Therefore  the task of supplementing political detente with military detente is extremely timely. The well-known initiatives of the USSR and other socialist countries are designed precisely to achieve this goal.156.	Another important and concrete measure in this field is that contained in the item entitled ""Prohibition of action to influence the environment and climate for military and other purposes incompatible with the maintenance of international security  human well-being and health"" [item 103]  which has been submitted at this session of the General Assembly by the Soviet Union [A/9702]. This proposal is based on due regard for the real situation in the world and the prospects opened up by science and technology for creating new means and methods of warfare so far little known but potentially catastrophic for all man-kind. The time has come to work out and conclude an appropriate international convention to outlaw action designed to influence the environment and climate for military purposes. Raising a new barrier to the arms race  such an agreement would also be an important contribution to the performance of the global task of protecting the human environment. The delegation of the Ukrainian SSR fully and wholeheartedly endorses this valuable initiative of the Soviet Union and calls upon the General Assembly to give it the necessary support.157.	We should like particularly to stress that constructive and positive participation of all States possessing important military potential and  above all  all the nuclear Powers  is extremely important for progress in the field of disarmament. The favorable trend in international development cannot of itself replace goodwill and the concrete contribution of each State to the cause of disarmament.158.	The purposes of uniting the efforts of all States in the world in this area would be served by the convening of a world disarmament conference  something which the General Assembly has repeatedly favored. Under present conditions  the timeliness and need for the earliest possible convening of such a conference are more than ever obvious  and the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference submitted to the General Assembly [AI9628] says precisely this.159.	The Ukrainian SSR is in favor of the convening of a world conference with the participation of all States of the world at the earliest possible time and calls upon all States to make a constructive contribution to its practical preparation and convening. All kinds of tricks aimed at slowing down and frustrating the preparations for such a conference can only be regarded as reluctance to participate in preparing measures of disarmament.160.	Consolidation of the multilateral agreements already attained and making them more universal is an extremely urgent task in the field of disarmament. Indeed  without the positive participation in these agreements of all militarily significant Powers  especially the nuclear Powers  it would be difficult to talk about ensuring complete and effective realization of the measures designed to limit the arms race and bring about disarmament contained therein or about further progress in this field. We have in mind such important agreements as the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  signed in Moscow on 5 August 1963 3 the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]; the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction [resolution 2826 (XXVI)  annex]  the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating  Poisonous or Other Gases  and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare  signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 4 and others.161.	The prohibition of chemical weapons and the comprehensive prohibition of nuclear-weapons testing  the reduction and freezing of military budgets and many other measures are urgent problems in the field of disarmament which could lead to the bringing about and achievement of the purposes of general and complete disarmament. There are really quite a few problems in the field of disarmament and all of them are important problems. But however difficult they may seem  they can be solved given the goodwill and the maximum exertions of States.162.	Each year is marked with new victories of the national liberation struggle of peoples. In this regard the delegation of the Ukrainian SSR welcomes with special satisfaction the new Members of the United Nations—the People's Republic of Bangladesh  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau and Grenada. We wish the peoples of these countries success in the strengthening of their national independence and in their economic and social development.163.	New prospects are now being opened up in the world for the complete and final liquidation of colonialism and racism. The successful liberation struggle of the peoples of Guinea-Bissau  Angola and Mozambique is further proof of the importance and effectiveness of the solidarity and unity of action  particularly in the United Nations  of the forces of national liberation  peace  democracy and socialism. The task of finally eradicating colonialism and racism requires further strengthening of this unity and cohesiveness. Attempts to undermine or split the united anti-imperialist  anti-colonial front by means of false slogans and theories of all kinds can only harm the cause of complete liberation of peoples from the shackles of colonialism and racism.164.	Indeed  it is precisely right now that favourable conditions are being created for the complete implementation of the historic Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples [resolution 1514 (XV)]. To this end  it is necessary to intensify the struggle against the racist regimes of Pretoria and Salisbury still remaining in Africa and against those who support. these regimes and help them keep the peoples in conditions of colonial slavery. We must implement the decisions of the United Nations on South Africa  Zimbabwe and Namibia. There must be no procrastination and no manoeuvres de-signed to perpetuate colonial domination if we want once and for all to settle the question of decolonization of the remaining colonial Territories both in Africa and elsewhere in the world. Racism  apartheid and colonialism must be destroyed once and for all as early as possible. Our country has always supported and is prepared to continue .providing comprehensive assistance and support to the peoples fighting for their freedom and independence  for the complete liquidation of colonialism  racism and apartheid.165.	A year has now passed since the bloody coup staged by the military junta in Chile. However  the anger of peoples who resolutely condemned the crimes of the Fascist junta has not subsided. The terrorist regime in Chile has been condemned by all peoples and constitutes a threat to the progressive achievements of Latin America. The hysterical demagoguery that the protege of the hangmen of the Chilean people has been constantly resorting to here  under the pretext of the right of reply  will not wash from the hands of the Fascist junta and its henchmen the blood of President Allende and dozens of thousands of the best sons and daughters of Chile.166.	It is our belief that the United Nations should raise the voice of protest against the suppression of democratic rights and freedoms  against the executions and the savage treatment meted out to the democrats and people of Chile  and demand that the Chilean junta immediately set free L. Corvalan and all other Chilean democrats and patriots languishing in the torture chambers of the junta.167.	With the support of the socialist community and all progressive forces of the world  the developing countries of Asia  Africa and Latin America are waging a struggle for genuine economic liberation  for the liquidation of neo-colonialism and the remnants of the colonial past to which the existing system of relations between developed capitalist States and the third world belongs.168.	A significant step forward towards the establishment of new  more equitable international economic relations was made at the sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations  convened on the initiative of the developing countries with the support and active participation of the socialist States. The session demonstrated that the developing countries no longer intend to remain the object of exploitation by foreign monopolistic capital or the so-called multinational corporations. It is of special significance that  despite resistance on the part of the States to which those corporations belong  the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order adopted at the special session embody the sovereign rights of each State to its own natural resources and to effective control over them and their exploitation  including the right of nationalization. In the course of the session the present system of plundering of the natural resources of the developing countries by imperialist monopolies was severely condemned. There are increasing demands for a consistent limitation to the intermediary role of international monopolies in world trade and the elimination from economic relations of all manifestations of neo-colonialist and imperialist exploitation.169.	We are firmly convinced that economic relations among States must be built on the basis of the new principles promulgated in the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order ""based on equity  sovereign equality  interdependence  common interest and co-operation among all States  irrespective of their economic and social systems"".170.	Putting those principles into effect will promote the democratization of international economic ties. The present session  we feel  should take measures to put into practice the decisions of the sixth special session of the General Assembly on the strengthening of the economic independence of the developing countries. At the same time it must be stressed that the conquest of the economic backwardness and the economic dependence of young States will be facilitated if they carry out far-reaching socio-economic reforms with the aim of eliminating the obstacles to the development of their productive forces.171.	The resources which could be released as a result of effective measures in the field of disarmament could make a substantial contribution to the acceleration of economic and social development in all countries  including developing countries. The economic progress of peoples would be facilitated by the practical implementation of the proposal  adopted on the initiative of the Soviet Union  to reduce by 10 per cent the military budgets of States permanent members of the Security Council [resolution 3093 (XXVIII)]  since such a measure would signify both a curbing of the arms race and the allocation of part of the considerable resources thus saved for additional assistance to developing countries.172.	The need to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations has been repeatedly stressed in the course of the general debate at this session. All the experience of the work of the Organization irrefutably shows that its effectiveness can be improved only on the basis of strict observance of the Charter and the implementation of decisions of the Security Council and other United Nations bodies.173.	The Charter of the United Nations enshrines the most important basic principles of contemporary 174.	international relations  principles which throughout the existence of the United Nations have been generally recognized in international law and further confirmed in relations among States. The Charter of the United Nations has stood the test of time and proved its viability under present conditions. At times  critics of the Charter question the principle of unanimity in the Security Council  but anyone who feels that way is either deliberately discarding the idea or in the heat of the debate is forgetting the fact that the United Nations itself is based on the principle of unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council and that the effectiveness of its actions depends precisely on that unanimity. The abolition of that fundamental principle could be used in the United Nations system to serve the narrow interests of individual major States or groups of such States  which would undermine the principles of peaceful coexistence of States with different social systems at the very time when those principles are becoming ever more firmly established in international practice. We therefore resolutely oppose preparing plans for the revision- or what is known as the ""correction"" -of the Charter of the United Nations  which is the most outstanding international document of modern times.175.	In these days of October  when the world  in accordance with tradition  will be celebrating United Nations Day  it seems appropriate to refer to the time when the foundations of the United Nations were laid. The very creation of the Organization became possible as a result of the historic victory of the United Nations over the dark forces of nazism and aggression. In the great battle for a happy future for mankind  enormous sacrifices were offered on the altar of victory by the peoples of the Soviet Union  including the people of the Ukraine  which is now celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the liberation of the Soviet Ukraine from the Fascist invaders. The heroic exploit of the Soviet people is of world-wide significance and will remain forever in the grateful memory of a mankind firmly resolved to prevent any recurrence of the horrors of the past.176.	In these days we are continuously addressing ourselves to what is clearly and unambiguously defined in the Charter as the main and critical direction of United Nations activities: ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"". Quite a lot has been done in this respect  and what has been done represents a powerful thrust forward towards an ever fuller use of the possibilities enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations towards truly effective and fruitful activities by the United Nations in strengthening international peace and security.177.	We look to the future with optimism  for we are convinced that the forces of peace and progress are irresistible. All peace-loving peoples stand for detente  for rational forms of international relations on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.178.	We are convinced that the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly will make a weighty contribution to the noble cause of strengthening international peace and security and to the cause of eliminating the threat of war and the creation of a world in which all peoples can live without war or the alarms of war  enjoying the benefits of social progress."
"123",7178,"URY",29,1974,"1.	Mr. President  first  it is my pleasure to welcome and to express my congratulations to Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria  whose unanimous election enables us to count upon his abilities and long experience  which  though certainly not consonant with his youth  have been demonstrated in the exercise of high office since his noble country began its independent life.2.	I should also like to welcome Mr. Leopoldo Benites  whose presidency has elicited widespread approval. During an especially difficult period he once again demonstrated his even-handedness and diplomacy in the effective guidance of our deliberations.3.	Departing from my text  I should like to express  on behalf of the Government and people of Uruguay  our profound condolences concerning the tragedy which has afflicted our sister republic of Honduras  a tragedy and a distress which we feel as our own. The support and solidarity of the whole international community  not only of the States of Latin America but of the whole of the membership of this Organization and of all its organs  are necessary in order to alleviate the damage and the distress from which the people of that country are suffering and will continue to suffer in the future.4.	Again departing from my text  I should also like to express the pleasure of my country at the admission to membership in this Organization of three new Member States: Guinea-Bissau  to which this membership represents the culmination of a long struggle for independence; Bangladesh  whichhas also been the scene of so much suffering; and Grenada  which is also joining this Assembly and  in this way  the family of Latin American countries.5.	At the beginning of this new session of the General Assembly as is usual we are offered a new opportunity for reflection. However  this time the required reflection is more urgent  more stern and at the same time more profound.6.	To the matters normally occupying our attention are added others which were not previously unknown to us  to be sure  but which emerge today with particular force  revealing deep maladjustments in the very essence of coexistence. So above and beyond the peculiar features of each specific problem we discover a close and increasingly acute inter-connexion with other problems  a kind of common substance in the economic and political life of the world today. Hence  our efforts to solve specific problems frequently seem to be overwhelmed by the paucity of global solutions. There are no isolated questions  all questions are varying manifestations of the same problem  and we are compelled to seek the core of the problem underlying the different manifestations.7.	Thus  while immediate and evident conflicts occur and more tangible needs and problems arise  the disruption of the international economic system is already making itself felt. Simultaneously  the contours of the great questions of the future emerge intertwined with day-to-day business.8.	Uruguay therefore wishes to focus attention in this supreme world forum on this new perspective  so that the consideration of each specific item on our agenda will still be consistent with matters which are neither merely a backdrop nor an anticipation of the remote future  but are germane to the present problems of the international community.9.	My country advocates  therefore  that integrated perspective in which States Members of the United Nations can jointly formulate rules and co-ordinate courses of action for a new system of coexistence among nations to meet the current needs of most of our peoples. Otherwise solutions will deviate from their essential human objectives and may become mere dialectic exercises veering farther and farther away and never penetrating the core of the truly crucial questions.10.	It is with this idea of renewal that I mention the structure of the international economy. There is no doubt that the grave deficiencies and tensions of recent years  disguised at first  are now becoming manifest and turning into a vast crisis affecting currencies  trade  and production  and thereby the whole economy. The shock of the petroleum crisis now is spreading like an expanding shock wave within the general disruption of the established economic order.11.	At the sixth special session of the General Assembly [2211th meeting] I had occasion to indicate  on behalf of my country  the need for far-reaching reform to get to the true root of the matter  taking it not simply as a technical problem to be solved by merely rearranging economic factors  but more importantly  as a political and social problem involving everyone. Hence  if this reform is not founded upon justice  only limited and unstable results will ensue and peace will be constantly endangered.12.	This leads me to refer to what my Government considers to be the crux of the matter. Indisputably  the recognition of the political equality of nations is a fundamental achievement of international law. It is equally undeniable that the same concept of equality cannot be projected into the economic sphere  where the degree of potential or development differs  without any doubt  with regard to each nation.13.	This reality must be contemplated in the building of new international economic structures and also in the simple readjustment of those that already exist. Any system that applies identical patterns to societies with differently developed economies will not be just  nor should the resources of the international community be channeled in disregard of existing differences.14.	Even when to a certain extent some of these concepts underlie rules now governing international co-operation for development  they are only marginal within the total context. The substance of economic relations remains intact  not corresponding to these realities. They must be acknowledged as guiding principles of the international economy as a whole  of its monetary  trade  finance and investment systems and in the conduct of large multinational corporations. The IMF  for example  must achieve the effective transfer of real resources to the developing countries. Until the rules treat societies which have already reached the post-industrial area and those which are struggling timidly to venture into the world of modern technology as equals  the international economy will be a source neither of development  nor of justice  nor of peace.15.	So true is this that today  although all countries are shaken by the same crisis  the strongest and most developed economies have within themselves the necessary reserves and resilience to respond to the threat  while the weaker nations suffer from the unabated onslaught of new events.16.	Energetic protest is called for when within the dramatic context of small and medium-sized countries such as Uruguay  the situation worsens because the more developed countries  in an attempt to safeguard their own prosperity  are imposing protectionist measures which drastically cut the exports of raw materials from the developing world  or use ""dumping"" to depress prices of these exports to intolerable levels.17.	It should be pointed out that such policies and practices  unjust and counter to recognized principles of international co-operation as they are  also run the risk of causing a dangerous trade confrontation which could bring the entire world economy to a state of collapse.18.	Unfortunately  the solutions urgently demanded of the international community at the sixth special session last April have not been applied  as immediate  practical and workable machinery has not yet been put into operation. The entire effort of the General Assembly at that time and the acknowledged consensus that effective action should be taken have apparently become merely pious utterances on the part of our Organization and its agencies  without that obvious political decision having been translated into reality. I do understand the difficulties inherent in such broad action  but the magnitude and urgency of the task require an unprecedented effort. Similarly  my Government today reiterates its statement that the surplus resources generated by new prices must be channeled to the developing countries most deeply affected by the petroleum crisis  thus avoiding the paradoxical situation where these resources would primarily strengthen the more developed economies. I think that in keeping with the spirit demonstrated at that meeting  it will be possible to agree upon multilateral channels to guide this process without prejudice to direct support through trade and investment.19.	But it is not only purely material factors that motivate Uruguay to postulate the reform of the international economy as a central topic. Recently  in Bucharest  the World Population Conference dealt with an essentially human question touching upon rights intrinsic to our nature and our life. My country cannot accept the restriction  not to say the mutilation  of these rights and the moral and spiritual values they enshrine through the application of economic rules ensuring the prosperity only of some. As the delegation of Uruguay stated in Bucharest: ""It is inadmissible that the possibility of population growth should be the exclusive right of those nations possessing a high degree of development"". Instead  we have held that the physical basis for cultural and spiritual development must be established so that the sacred mission of transmitting life may be responsively exercised everywhere.20.	Without any doubt  this objective cannot be achieved as long as considerations such as those which doom large segments of mankind to hunger and a marginal existence persist  and while existing conditions denote the simultaneous presence of a crisis of excess and one of scarcity.21.	There is one fact more than any other that constitutes a serious indictment of the existing international order and our lack of the will to reform it: in order to safeguard the well-being of the few  the prices of staples as well as of luxury items must be so high that they elude the grasp of the many  and  inversely  an over-supply of these goods can ruin those that produce them.22.	All of that conspires to impede a rational and human organization of trade and production. Some years ago my country proposed in FAO the creation of a system with a real ""food bank"" in which the need for stable and remunerative prices as a fair return for productive effort would be reconciled with the needs of those who cannot buy such goods because they are so expensive but desperately require them in order to survive. I consider that it is an inescapable responsibility of the world economy to work in that direction  and my country now pledges its best efforts to that end.23.	Since the historic United Nations Conference on the Human Environment  held at Stockholm in 1972  another topic has been attracting increasing attention: the environment and the fate of the biosphere  mankind's present and future home.24.	Apart from the undoubted need to safeguard and restore our environment and to use it in a rational and far-sighted way  surely the economic and financial burden that this entails cannot be shared equally among all nations. Rather  it should weigh more heavily on the most developed nations  which unwittingly have done the most to cause the environment to deteriorate.25.	Just as access to life cannot be limited in order to protect the status of some  so the use and enjoyment of nature cannot be regulated to the almost exclusive benefit of an already developed segment of mankind.26.	In the same spirit  my country would like to refer to the new riches that are becoming increasingly available to the peoples.27.	We are pleased to note that an initial success was achieved in the long struggle of the Latin American countries to assert their rights over the seas adjacent to their coasts when the universal recognition of the maximum limitation of 200 miles emerged from the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  recently held at Caracas.28.	We also cherish the hope that soon the necessary agreements will be achieved in order to adapt the law of the sea to the realities of the contemporary world and to satisfy the requirements of the peoples  particularly in the developing countries.29.	We also wish to express our firm conviction that effective formulas can be agreed upon to implement the historic resolution in which it was solemnly declared that the sea-bed and ocean floor  and the subsoil thereof  beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are the common heritage of mankind [resolution 2749 (XXV)].30.	My Government is well aware of the myriad difficulties to be overcome if far-reaching changes within such diverse fields are to be achieved  but we are also convinced that trying to effect these changes is the only way to deal with the very root of these problems. Only by such means can true solutions be found. Otherwise  we will be attacking only the superficial manifestations of the underlying problems. Therefore  although it seems mere speculation that  given the magnitude of the problem  it can be solved  this is the crucial task that faces us. If the challenge is to be met  imagination and daring must be mustered in this forum  whence political inspiration flows to others  and in all the other bodies of this great United Nations system.31.	One may well wonder if we will be able to devise -and even more important to implement- within a reasonably short period of time a new international economic order which will be both just and creative and which will have the basic features so well known to our peoples  and especially our youth: freedom from any attempt to destroy the basic tenets of the economy but  rather  a human and equitable use of those tenets; a pattern implying no holding back of the more advanced or regression to lower levels but  rather  promoting those who have been left behind by giving them a fair share of the benefits of the highest civilization; extension beyond material goods to reach horizons of culture and spirit; integration of problems of population  food  environment and culture within a comprehensive framework in which countries are treated in accordance with their particular degree of development so that the economy will render truly equivalent results for its participants.32.	In the world political arena  there is an atmosphere of detente and a universal desire for peace is spreading. My country  in accordance with a tradition it has unswervingly maintained since its very inception  adheres to that spirit  not only in the external conduct of international affairs but also as a reflection of the very deepest convictions of the nation.33.	Nevertheless  detente does not seem to be sufficient to clear the air entirely.34.	The IndoChina peninsula is still bitterly racked by varying degrees of open warfare. It is unfortunate that the Viet Nam peace agreement has not yet been fully complied with and that aggression in that Republic and in the Khmer Republic still persists. It is to be hoped that these circumstances will not be overlooked and that appropriate measures will be adopted to strengthen peace and bring an immediate end to the war which torments that region.35.	Cyprus has been shattered by a violent crisis  with painful consequences that my Government deplores. I believe that we the nations represented here without exception must unite solidly behind the people of the island and help to alleviate their suffering. We must also unite in support of the decisions of the Security Council and encourage international action to protect a Member State. The observance of United Nations agreements is essential for peace there and elsewhere  and Uruguay will always act in accordance with that principle.36.	Once again we have to refer to the tragic sufferings of the people of the Middle East. I should like to note with appreciation the bilateral action taken  the conversations initiated and the results achieved regarding extremely sensitive military and political aspects. None the less  I cannot pass over in silence the concern of my Government about the future of that long-suffering region. I think that the international community represented here could play a most important part if it were to create a world climate on the basis of principles widely acknowledged as workable. That is a way in which this complex question could be approached in all of its aspects.37.	It is clear that legally speaking military victory confers no rights  especially with regard to territory. Similarly  the community of nations recognizes the right of each nation in that region  and in all others  to live in peace within secure and recognized borders  enjoying sovereignty  integrity and independence.38.	All those directly concerned should  therefore  seek a way to ensure through negotiations and other peaceful means  the full observance and implementation of those fundamental concepts of international law  which my Government unreservedly supports. A comprehensive study of this topic in all of its dimensions must include an essential chapter  in view of both its political and its human significance. 1 am referring here to the fate of the Palestinian people. My Government has no doubt that until a just solution is found for what the Security Council in paragraph 2 of resolution 242 (1967) calls ""the refugee problem""  any settlements designed to ensure peace will be merely temporary. With due regard  of course  for the steps taken elsewhere towards peace and while supporting the immediate measures the United Nations is taking to alleviate this distressing situation  my Government advocates more deep-rooted solutions which should encompass the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people and squarely confront the problem in its real political  social and  finally  human significance all  of course  within the framework of comprehensive peace negotiations.39.	As an expression of our sincere concern for peace in the Middle East  1 should like to renew the commitment announced by my delegation at the twenty-third session [1686th meeting] to support  within the framework of the Charter  a negotiated solution to ensure lasting peace in this region in full accordance with international law and all the imperatives of the question 40.	Under the general topic of international peace  I should like to express Uruguay's appreciation of the success achieved by the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression. This represents a positive step towards the clarifying of an important concept and also demonstrates a promising of understanding which suggests that more progress may be made in this connexion.41.	1 am pleased to announce that my country supports with satisfaction the efforts made to establish a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. This attitude is consonant with our position in Latin America  where we are a party to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco).42.	For the same reason we deplore atomic weapon tests and explosions performed since last year by the various Powers in different parts of the world. The signature and ratification of Additional Protocol I to the Treaty of Tlatelolco will signify a positive step towards rectifying the situation. These explosions  which cause ecological damage and which continue  moreover  to cause tension  are contrary to detente and entail the continued spending of huge sums in an endeavor of no importance to mankind.43.	At the same time my country favors renewed efforts to achieve general disarmament. The negotiations to reduce the possibility of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union fall within this context. My country will also resolutely support the careful preparation of the World Disarmament Conference and any reaffirmation of already enunciated recommendations on nuclear testing and  most importantly  their speedy implementation  which is so long overdue.44.	As is Uruguay's custom  1 should like to refer exclusively to the topics of decolonization and racial discrimination. Recent events have sparked the hope that more African people will soon gain independence. The outlook now looks bright and we hope that the optimism will be consolidated into fact in the full exercise of self-determination and freedom from foreign influence  as in Latin America. With regard to racial discrimination I renew today the support of Uruguay for measures adopted within the framework of the Charter so that mankind may become truly united.45.	This brief examination of some of the items of the agenda clearly shows that the policy of detente must be expanded and deepened so that its positive influence may extend to matters which today remain outside its scope. Uruguay will do anything within its power to work resolutely in this direction.46.	However  together with geographically localized political problems  the significance of other less well-defined problems of international peace and security must be recognized. I refer to terrorist acts and subversive movements  which are frequently interconnected. The entire world has been the witness of this phenomenon  which now respects no borders. The moment has perhaps come for the international community to realize what risks such activities entail. This motive does not derive from the diverse ideas frequently posited in an attempt to justify these acts  as ideological differences are quite normal in a world as diverse as ours. The fact is that civilization itself is threatened when a constant undercover war being waged by interrelated movements operating outside international law is provoked and tolerated. Paradoxically  as the risk of nuclear catastrophe  or even large-scale conventional war  diminishes  unease  tension and casualties of this new kind of warfare are on the increase. Thus  an unexpected situation may arise in which peace  so fervently sought in more conspicuous areas  may yet disappear.47.	My Government also considers that other steps should be taken to consolidate and strengthen peace. The atmosphere of detente  so fortunately apparent among the great Powers  must also create an atmosphere of security for other nations. Improved relations among these Powers is indeed not enough. It is imperative finally to eliminate distortions of international coexistence caused by power politics and ideological penetration. Only when non-intervention and self-determination become rules of conduct observed by all nations can peace be said to be truly at hand.48.	Uruguay once again pledges its commitment to this conduct as an indissoluble part of its national identity and reaffirms its will to co-operate with all international courses of action to ensure full respect for such conduct within the community of nations. Only in this way can peace and co-operation exist in our interdependent and pluralistic world.49.	Throughout our work we review and discuss many topics which demonstrate the complex and multifaceted world of today. As each topic is examined separately because of its specific features we must all regard them as independent entities. Nevertheless  all pose essentially the same question. What will be the nature of international relations? Will law or force prevail? Will the world's economy serve justice or convenience? Will each nation freely develop its own identity or will this identity be imposed from without? Will the diversity of national solutions enhance international co-operation or hamper it? Will detente create a true respect for all? Once defenses have been reduced  will undercover warfare and penetration become the agent of power to penetrate the small nations? Will terrorism and subversive warfare be given free reign in the world or will the community of nations thwart violence?50.	Uruguay has chosen a clear-cut path in keeping with the character of its people and the nature of its history. We are resolutely in support of the principles of justice  law  liberty and independence  and the right of each country to choose and follow its own model. We are working for international coexistence  with peace and co-operation as its hallmark. We reject terrorism and subversive violence; we remain open to the other nations of the world.51.	This fundamental definition of principle in international order is consistent with the political process of my country  which  together with a strong sense of national pride  maintains its solidarity with other countries. It fully respects all nations and demands no less for itself  without foreign influence or interference  which it neither accepts nor tolerates nor practices. In this way its institutions have been substantially transformed in order to enshrine the values recognized by the Uruguayan community as its national and popular objectives: independence  development and peace for the benefit of the human being. It is a process aiming at peace  construction and justice  without hatred or violence. Imbued with the spirit of understanding and solidarity  Uruguay will work in world affairs to promote mutual understanding and conciliation and mutual respect.52.	The international community must bring these already recognized principles to life. Equally urgent is the task of devising new principles for new situations: population  the biosphere  the riches of the sea and other unexploited regions; outer space  energy  spiritual and cultural matters; man's place in the technological universe and a new economic order.53.	May our efforts now solve the problems of today. May they serve to build a better tomorrow. We bear this responsibility to youth throughout the world. By that shall we be assessed."
"124",7225,"USA",29,1974,"Last year  at the previous session [.2124th meeting]  in my first address as Secretary of State  I spoke to this Assembly about American purposes. I said that the United States seeks a comprehensive  institutionalized peace  not an armistice. I asked other nations to join us in moving the world from detente to cooperation  from coexistence to community.41.	In the year that has passed some progress has been made in dealing with particular crises. But many fundamental issues persist and new issues threaten the very structure of world stability.42.	Our deepest problem going far beyond the items on the agenda is whether our vision can keep pace with our challenges. Will history recall the twentieth century as a time of mounting global conflict or as the beginning of a global conception? Will our age of interdependence spur joint progress or common disaster?43.	The answer is not yet clear. New realities have not yet overcome old patterns of thought and action. Traditional concepts of national sovereignty  social struggle and the relation between the old and the new nations too often guide our course. And so we have managed but not advanced; we have endured but not prospered; and we have continued the luxury of political contention.44.	This condition has been dramatized in the brief period since the twenty-eighth session. War has ravaged the Middle East and Cyprus. The technology of nuclear explosives has resumed its dangerous spread. Inflation and the threat of global decline hang over the economies of rich and poor alike.45.	We cannot permit this trend to continue. Conflict between nations once devastated continents; the struggle between blocs may destroy humanity  ideologies and doctrines drawn from the last century do not even address  let alone solve  the unprecedented problems of today. As a result  events challenge habits; a gulf grows between rhetoric and reality.46.	The world has dealt with local conflicts as if they were perpetually manageable. We have permitted too many of the underlying causes to fester unattended  until the parties believed that their only recourse was war. And because each crisis ultimately has been contained we have remained complacent. But tolerance of local conflict tempts world holocaust. We have no guarantee that some local crisis perhaps the next will not explode beyond control.47.	The world has dealt with nuclear weapons as if restraint were automatic. Their very awesomeness has chained those weapons for almost three decades; their sophistication and expense have helped to keep constant for a decade the number of States which possess them. Now  as was quite foreseeable  political inhibitions are in danger of crumbling. Nuclear catastrophe looms more plausible  whether through design or miscalculation  accident  theft or blackmail.48.	The world has dealt with the economy as if its constant advance were inexorable. While postwar growth has been uneven and some parts of the world have lagged  our attention has been focused on how to increase participation in a general advance. We continue to deal with economic issues on a national  regional or bloc basis at the precise moment that our interdependence is multiplying. Strains on the fabric and institutions of the world economy threaten to engulf us all in a general depression.49.	The delicate structure of international cooperation  so laboriously constructed over the last quarter century  can hardly survive  and certainly cannot be strengthened  if it is continually subjected to the shocks of political conflict  war and economic crisis.50.	The time has come  then  for the nations assembled here to act together in the recognition that continued reliance on old slogans and traditional rivalries will lead us towards a world ever more torn between rich and poor. East and West  producer and consumer; a world where local crises threaten global confrontation and where the spreading atom threatens global peril; a world of rising costs and dwindling supplies  of growing populations and declining production.51.	There is another course. Last week before this Assembly [2234th meeting] President Ford dedicated our country to a cooperative   open approach to build a more secure and more prosperous world. The United States will assume the obligations that our values and strength impose upon us. But the building of a cooperative world is beyond the grasp of any one nation. An interdependent world requires not merely the resources but the vision and creativity of us all. Nations cannot simultaneously confront and cooperate with one another.52.	We must recognize that the common interest is the only valid test of the national interest. It is in the common interest  and thus in the interest of each nation  that local conflicts be resolved short of force and 'heir root causes be removed by political means; that the spread of nuclear technology be achieved without the spread of nuclear weapons; that growing economic interdependence lift all nations and not drag them down together.53.	We will not solve these problems during this session  or during any one session  of the General Assembly  but we must at least begin to remedy problems  not just manage them; to shape events  rather that endure them; to confront our challenges instead of one another.54.	The urgent political responsibility of our era is to resolve conflicts without war. History is replete with examples of the tragedy that sweeps nations when ancient enmities and the inertia of habit freeze the scope for decision. Equally  history is marked by brief moments when an old order is giving way to a pattern new and unforeseen. Those are times of potential disorder and danger but also of opportunity for fresh creation.55.	We face such a moment today. Together let us face its realities. First  a certain momentum towards peace has been created  in EastWest relations and in certain regional conflicts. It must be maintained. But we are only at the beginning of the process. If we do not continue to advance  we will slip back. Second  progress in the negotiation of difficult issues comes only through patience  perseverance and a recognition of the tolerable limits of the other side. Peace is a process  not a condition. It can be reached only in steps. Third  the failure to recognize and grasp the attainable will prevent the achievement of the ideal. Attempts to resolve all issues at one time are a certain prescription for stagnation. Progress towards peace can be thwarted by asking too much as surely as by asking too little. Fourth  the world community can help resolve chronic conflicts  but exaggerated expectations will prevent essential accommodation among the parties. This Assembly can help or hinder the negotiating process. It can seek a scapegoat or a solution. It can offer the parties an excuse to escape reality or sturdy support in search of a compromise. It can decide on propaganda or contribute to realistic approaches responsive to man's yearning for peace.56.	The Middle East starkly demonstrates those considerations. In the past year we have witnessed both the fourth ArabIsraeli war in a generation and the hopeful beginnings of a political process towards a lasting and just peace. We have achieved the respite of a ceasefire and two disengagement agreements  but the shadow of war remains. The legacy of hatred and suffering  the sense of irreconcilability have begun to yield however haltingly to the process of negotiation. But we still have a long road ahead.57.	One side seeks the recovery of territory and justice for a displaced people. The other side seeks security and recognition by its neighbors of its legitimacy as a nation. In the end  the common goal of peace surely is broad enough to embrace all these aspirations.58.	Let us be realistic about what must be done. The art of negotiation is to set goals that can be achieved at a given time and to reach them with determination. Each step forward modifies old perceptions and brings about a new situation that improves the chances of a comprehensive settlement.59.	Because these principles were followed in the Middle East  agreements have been reached in the past year which many thought impossible. They were achieved  above all  because of the wisdom of the leaders of the Middle East who decided that there had been enough stalemate and war  that more might be gained by testing each other in negotiation than by testing each other on the battlefield.60.	The Members of this body  both collectively and individually  have a solemn responsibility to encourage and support the parties in the Middle East on their present course. We have as well an obligation to give our support to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East and elsewhere. The United States applauds their indispensable role  as well as the outstanding contribution of SecretaryGeneral Waldheim in the cause of peace.61.	During the past year my country has made a major effort to promote peace in the Middle East. President Ford has asked me to reaffirm today that we are determined to press forward with these efforts. We will work closely with the parties and we will cooperate with all interested countries within the framework of the Geneve Conference.62.	The tormented island of Cyprus is another area where peace requires a spirit of compromise  accommodation and justice. The United States is convinced that the sovereignty  political independence  and territorial integrity of Cyprus must be maintained. It will be up to the parties to decide on the form of government they believe best suited to the particular conditions of Cyprus. They must reach accommodation on the areas to be administered by the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities as well as on the conditions under which refugees can return to their homes and reside in safety. Finally  no lasting peace is possible unless provisions are agreed upon which will lead to the timely and phased reduction of armed forces and armaments and other war material.63.	The United States is prepared to play an even more active role now than in the past in helping the parties find a solution to the centuries old problem of Cyprus. We will do all we can  but it is those most directly concerned whose effort is most crucial. Third parties should not be asked to produce miraculous outcomes not anchored in reality. Third parties can encourage those directly involved to perceive their broader interests; they can assist in the search for elements of agreement by interpreting each side's views and motives to the other. But no mediator can succeed unless the parties genuinely want mediation and are ready to make the difficult decisions needed for a settlement.64.	The United States is already making a major contribution to help relieve the human suffering of the people of Cyprus. We urge the international community to continue and  if possible  to increase its own humanitarian relief effort.65.	The United States notes with particular satisfaction the continuing process of change in Africa. We welcome the positive demonstration of cooperation between old rulers and the new free. The United States shares and pledges its support for the aspiration of Africans to participate in the fruits of freedom and human dignity.66.	The second new dimension on our agenda concerns the problem of nuclear proliferation.67.	The world has grown so accustomed to the existence of nuclear weapons that it assumes they will never be used. But today technology is rapidly expanding the number of nuclear weapons in the hands of major Powers and threatens to put nuclear explosive technology at the disposal of. an increasing number of other countries.68.	In a world where many nations possess nuclear weapons  dangers would be vastly compounded. It would be infinitely more difficult  if not impossible  to maintain stability among a large number of nuclear Powers. Local wars would take on a new dimension. Nuclear weapons would be introduced into regions where political conflict remains intense and the parties consider their vital interests overwhelmingly involved. There would  as well  be a vastly heightened risk of direct involvement by the major nuclear Powers.69.	This problem does not concern one country  one region  or one bloc alone. No nation can be indifferent to the spread of nuclear technology; every nation's security is directly affected.70.	The challenge before the world is to realize the peaceful benefits of nuclear technology without contributing to the growth of nuclear weapons or to the number of States possessing them.71.	As a major nuclear Power  the United States recognizes its special responsibility. We realize that we cannot expect others to show restraint if we do not ourselves practice restraint. Together with the Soviet Union we are seeking to negotiate new quantitative and qualitative limitations on strategic arms. Last week our delegations reconvened in Geneva  and we intend to pursue these negotiations with the seriousness of purpose they deserve. The United States has no higher priority than controlling and reducing the levels of nuclear arms.72.	Beyond the relations of the nuclear Powers to each other lies the need to curb the spread of nuclear explosives. We must take into account that plutonium is an essential ingredient of nuclear explosives and that in the immediate future the amount of plutonium generated by peaceful nuclear reactors will be multiplied many times. Heretofore the United States and a number of other countries have widely supplied nuclear fuels and other nuclear materials in order to promote the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This policy cannot continue if it leads to the proliferation of nuclear explosives. Sales of these materials can no longer be treated by anyone as a purely commercial competitive enterprise.73.	The world community  therefore  must work urgently towards a system of effective international safeguards against the diversion of plutonium or its byproducts. The United States is prepared to join with others in a comprehensive effort.74.	Let us together agree on the practical steps which must be taken to assure the benefits of nuclear energy free of its terrors. The United States will shortly offer specific proposals to strengthen safeguards to the other principal supplier countries. We shall intensify our efforts to gain the broadest possible acceptance of IAEA safeguards  to establish practical controls on the transfer of nuclear materials  and to ensure the effectiveness of these procedures. The United States will urge IAEA to draft an international convention for enhancing physical security against theft or diversion of nuclear material. Such a convention should set forth specific standards and techniques for protecting materials while in use  storage arid transfer. The Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)  annex]  which this Assembly has endorsed  warrants continuing support. The Treaty contains not only a broad commitment to limit the spread of nuclear explosives but specific obligations to accept and implement IAEA safeguards and to control the transfer of nuclear materials.75.	Whatever advantages seem to accrue from the acquisition of nuclear explosive technology will prove to be ephemeral. When Pandora's box has been opened  no country will be the beneficiary and all mankind will have lost. This is not inevitable.If we act decisively now  we can still control the future.76.	Let me now turn to our economic problems.77.	Lord Keynes wrote:""The power to become habituated to his surroundings is a marked characteristic of mankind. Very few of us realize with conviction the intensely unusual  unstable  complicated  unreliable  temporary nature of the economic organization.""78.	The economic history of the postwar period has been one of sustained growth  for developing as well as developed nations. The universal expectation of our peoples  the foundation of our political institutions and the assumption underlying the evolving structure of peace are all based on the belief that this growth will continue.79.	But will it? The increasingly open and cooperation global economic system that we have come to take tor granted is now under unprecedented attack. The world is poised on the brink of a return to the unrestrained economic nationalism which accompanied the collapse of economic order in the 1930s. And  should that occur  all would suffer: poor as well as rich  producer as well as consumer.80.	So let us so longer fear to confront in public the facts which have come to dominate bur private discussions and concerns.81.	The early warning signs of a major economic crisis are evident. Rates of inflation unprecedented in the past quarter century are sweeping developing and developed nations alike. The world's financial institutions are staggering under the most massive and rapid movements of reserves in history. And profound questions have arisen about meeting man's most fundamental needs for energy and food.82.	While the present situation threatens every individual and nation  it is the poor who suffer the most. While the wealthier adjust their living standards  the poor see the hopes of a lifetime collapse around them. While others tighten their belts  the poor starve. While others can hope for a better future  the poor see only despair ahead.83.	It can be in the interest of no country or group of countries to base policies on a test of strength  for a policy of confrontation would end in disaster for ail. Meeting man's basic needs for energy and food and assuring economic growth while mastering inflation require international cooperation to an unprecedented degree.84.	Let us apply these principles first to the energy situation. Oil producers seek a better life for their peoples and a just return for their diminishing resources. The developing nations less well endowed by nature face the disintegration of the results of decades of striving for development as the result of a price policy over which they have no control. The developed nations find the industrial civilization built over centuries in jeopardy.85.	Both producers and consumers have legitimate claims. The problem is to reconcile them for the common good. 86.	The United States is working closely with several oil producers to help diversify their economies. We have established commissions to facilitate the transfer of technology and to assist with industrialization. We are prepared to accept substantial investments in the United States and we welcome a greater role for the oil producers in the management of international economic institutions.87.	The investment of surplus oil revenues presents a great challenge. The countries which most need these revenues are generally the least likely to receive them. The world's financial institutions have coped thus far  but ways must be found to assure assistance for those countries most in need of it. And the full brunt of the surplus revenues is yet to come.88.	Despite our best efforts to meet the oil producers' legitimate needs and to channel their resources into constructive uses  the world cannot sustain even the present level of prices  much less continuing increases. The prices of other commodities will inevitably rise in a never-ending inflationary spiral. Nobody will benefit. The oil producers will be forced to spend more for their own imports. Many nations will not be able to withstand the pace  and the poorer could be overwhelmed. The complex  fragile structure of global economic cooperation required to sustain national economic growth stands in danger of being shattered.89.	The United States will work with other consumer nations on means of conservation and on ways to cushion the impact of massive investments from abroad. The preliminary agreement on a program of solidarity and cooperation signed a few days ago in Brussels by the major consumer countries is an encouraging first step.90.	But the long range solution requires a new understanding between consumers and producers. Unlike food prices  the high cost of oil is not the result of economic factors  of an actual shortage of capacity or of the free play of supply and demand. Rather it is caused by deliberate decisions to restrict production and maintain an artificial price level. We recognize that the producers should have a fair share; the fact remains that the present price level even threatens the economic wellbeing of producers. Ultimately they depend upon the vitality of the world economy for the security of their markets and their investments. And it cannot be in the interest of any nation to magnify the despair of the least developed  which are uniquely vulnerable to exorbitant prices and have no recourse .but to pay.91.	What has gone up by political decision can be reduced by political decision.92.	Last week President Ford called upon the oil producers to join with consumers in defining a strategy which will meet the world's longterm need for both energy and food at reasonable prices; he set forth the principles which should guide such a policy; and he announced to this Assembly America's determination to meet our responsibilities to help alleviate another grim reality world hunger. At a time of universal concern for justice and in an age of advanced technology  it is intolerable that millions are starving and hundreds of millions remain undernourished.93.	The magnitude of the longterm problem is clear. At present rates of population growth  world food production must double by the end of this century to maintain even the present inadequate dietary level and an adequate diet for all would require that we triple world production. If we are true to our principles  we have an obligation to strive for an adequate supply of food to every man  woman and child in the world. This is a technical possibility  a political necessity and a moral imperative.94.	The United States is prepared to join with all nations at the World Food Conference in Rome to launch the truly massive effort which is required. We will present a number of specific proposals: to help developing nations  which have the lowest yields and the largest amounts of unused land and water and whose potential in food production must be made to match their growing need; to increase substantially global fertilizer production  for we must end once and for all the world's chronic fertilizer shortage; to expand international  regional and national research programs because scientific and technical resources mus? hi mobilized now to meet the demands of the year 2030 and beyond; to rebuild the world's food reserves  as our capacity for dealing with famine must be freed from the vagaries of weather; and to provide a substantial level of concessionary food aid. The United States will in the coming year increase the value of our own food aid shipments to countries in need. We make this commitment despite great pressures on our economy and at a time when we are seeking to cut our own Government's budget  because we realize the dimensions of the tragedy with which we are faced. All of us here have a common obligation to prevent the poorest nations from being overwhelmed and to enable them to build the social  economic and political base for self-sufficiency.95.	The hopes of every nation for a life of peace and plenty rest on an effective international resolution of the crises of inflation  fuel and food. We must act now and we must act together.96.	Let us never forget that all of our political endeavors are ultimately judged by one standard to translate our actions into human concerns.97.	The United States will never be satisfied with a world where man's fears overshadow his hopes. We support the United Nations efforts in the fields of international law and human rights. We approve of the activities of the United Nations .in social  economic and humanitarian realms around the world. The United States considers the World Population Conference  held last month  the World Food Conference to be held a month from now and the continuing Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea of fundamental importance to our common future.98.	In the coming months the United States will make specific proposals for the United Nations to initiate a major international effort to prohibit torture; a concerted campaign to control the disease which afflicts and debilitates over 200 million people in 70 countries schistosomiasis; and a substantial strengthening of the world's capacity to deal with natural disaster  especially the improvement of the Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator.99.	We have long lived in a world where the consequences of our failures were manageable a world where local conflicts were contained  nuclear weapons threatened primarily those nations which possessed them  and the cycle of economic growth and decline seemed principally a national concern. But that is no longer the case. It is no longer possible to imagine that conflicts  weapons and recession will not spread.100.	We must now decide. The problems we face will be with .us the greater part of the century. But will they be with us as challenges to be overcome or as adversaries that have vanquished us?101.	It is easy to agree to yet another set of principles or to actions other nations should take. But the needs of the poor will not be met by slogans; the needs of an expanding global economy will not be met by new restrictions; the search for peace cannot be conducted on the basis of confrontation. So each nation must ask what it can do  what contribution it is finally prepared to make to the common good.102.	Beyond peace  beyond prosperity  lie man's deepest aspirations to a life of dignity and justice. And beyond our pride  beyond our concern for the national purpose we are called upon to serve  there must be a concern for the betterment of the human condition. White we cannot  in the brief span allowed to each of us  undo the accumulated problems of centuries  we dare not do less than try. So let us now get on with our tasks.103.	Let us act in the spirit of Thucydides that ""the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them  glory and danger alike  and yet notwithstanding go out to meet it""."
"125",7342,"VEN",29,1974,"Before beginning my statement may I express on behalf of Venezuela our condolences and our grief on hearing the sad news of the passing of Mr. Paul Hoffman. He was more than a United States citizen: he was a citizen of the world. His devotion and activity not only in the cause of freedom but also in that of helping the poor will be a lasting example to all Governments and peoples of the world.130.	I should like to begin with a most cordial and friendly message of solidarity from the people and Government of Venezuela for the noble efforts of co-operation which this great Organization is making for development  good understanding and peace among its Members. Despite the diversity of the economic systems and the degrees of development of its Members  the United Nations provides all of them with the most favorable atmosphere for the presentation  analysis and solution of their individual and collective problems  thus giving a clear example of what can and must be achieved through dialog for the benefit of mankind as a whole in all the diverse aspects of present day life  beset as we are by the most complex circumstances.131.	The United Nations undoubtedly represents the best effort that the mind and soul of man have been able to devise in this century for the realization and strengthening of man's oldest and most constant dream: freedom and peace. It was thus that our own liberator  Simon Bolivar  saw it  and to that end he struggled to the day of his death  he who was the Father of our Venezuelan homeland and of five other nations of the Western hemisphere. It was thus that he anticipated by more than a century the very conception of an organization for which he drew the guidelines and which is similar to this Organization to which we have the honor of belonging.132.	Venezuela shares in full solidarity the pain and anguish of its sister Republic of Honduras at the vast material damage and loss of life which it suffered as a result of the recent hurricane which devastated that country. The people and Government of Venezuela have been co-operating from the very first moments of the catastrophe  mobilizing available resources to assist the affected townships.133.	We wish also to extend to the Government and people of Peru our sympathy and sorrow in the natural calamities that have recently befallen that brother nation.134.	Without disguising my own personal pleasure at this first opportunity given to me to enjoy the honor of addressing this world parliament  it is with satisfaction and pride that I discharge the pleasant duty entrusted to me by the Government of Venezuela of paying public tribute to the eminent Latin American who preceded you  Mr. President  in your high office. Mr. Leopoldo Benites carried out with talent and skill the delicate tasks entrusted to him by the General Assembly  not only at the twenty-eighth session but also at the sixth special session and later on his visits of goodwill and understanding to a number of Member States of the Organization. Among them  my own country enjoyed the privilege of welcoming him as a distinguished guest  as befitted his high office. We Latin Americans in particular are justifiably proud at having been so ably represented by this experienced and invaluable statesman  who fulfilled the highest and noblest task that the Organization can require of any person.135.	Mr. President  I wish to extend to you the warmest and most sincere congratulations of the Government of Venezuela on your well-deserved election to preside over the present session of the General Assembly. I am sure that under your efficient guidance we shall successfully complete the delicate tasks entrusted to us. For Venezuela and the Venezuelan people it cannot but be a source of satisfaction to see a distinguished son of Algeria elevated to occupy such a high post  for Algeria is a country linked to our own by close ties of friendship which date back to the days when the valiant people of Algeria were struggling for their independence. Today  Algeria and Venezuela stand together in the just struggle which is being fought so that the peoples that are still oppressed may achieve the recognition of their inalienable right to both political and economic freedom and independence.136.	We stand together also in the effort to achieve an international society where a mere just social and economic order prevails  and therefore an order that will be more equitable. We stand together—Venezuela and Algeria  united as we are with all the peoples of Africa  Asia  Latin America and  in general  the third world in the constant and unremitting struggle to bring about an international society which will lead to a more equitable distribution of the wealth of our planet  in order to benefit all mankind and put an end to the odious differences between great and small countries  between weak and powerful nations  between rich and poor peoples. We in Venezuela believe the time has come to refine and combine our efforts to make a reality of the much advocated but as yet theoretical principle of the legal equality of States. For this to become an actual fact and be reflected in genuine conquests of contemporary mankind  we must put an end to the privileges enjoyed by the few to the detriment of the many. It is imperative that we at long last effectively assist the peoples who have up to now been dominated selfishly by the hegemony of certain countries in a system in which great masses of men  women and children have been kept in intolerable material and spiritual wretchedness. That reality has sometimes been covered over with the mask of apparent aid that in some cases has resulted in the creation of a new form of economic dependency.137.	I am particularly pleased  too  to express to the Secretary-General our gratitude and support for his constant dedication to the United Nations and for the invaluable services he has always rendered to the Organization  and for his political  economic and social endeavors.138.	On the occasion of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  we enjoyed the honor of a visit of the Secretary-General  to whom the Government and people of Venezuela extended the hospitality which is due to so exalted a personality.139.	We in Venezuela are convinced that the time has come to encourage and to carry out jointly among all States the adjustment and transformation required by the new international economic order that was proclaimed by the sixth special session of the General Assembly.140.	The United Nations has many accomplishments to its credit; but when decisions have to be made  hesitations arise and vested interests tend to take over and in many cases the pressure of the strong over the weak becomes manifest. This proves the need for a thorough and genuine restructuring of the Organization  which is rapidly progressing towards universality.141.	My country has always asserted the need to transform the Organization into a true international forum  a place where pressing problems of all kinds that beset the international community can be aired and studied freely and objectively. That is why it is a matter of particular gratification for my country to welcome the three new States that have just joined the United Nations  namely  Bangladesh  Grenada and Guinea-Bissau.142.	Two )f those new States emerge into independent life after a lengthy period of colonial domination  and  as far as Venezuela is concerned  we cannot hide the fact that in the specify case of Grenada we are especially pleased. Not only is Grenada our close neighbor  located in the Caribbean  but also  we are linked by ties of friendship and co-operation based on the search for a real and honest Latin American integration for the mutual benefit of our peoples  so closely linked by history and a promising common destiny.143.	The admission to the United Nations of each new State that emerges into independent life highlights once again the invaluable work done by the United Nations in this field.144.	The phenomenon of decolonization is an irreversible historical process. The latest events in Africa prove if proof is still necessary that no Power can hope to keep under the colonial yoke those peoples that aspire to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination  freedom and independence.145.	Regardless of whatever form colonial domination may adopt  it is a fallacy to perpetuate the subjection of a people that sooner or later must end by liberating itself  as had just been done by the former so-called Overseas Provinces of Portugal. I avail myself of this opportunity to offer to the Government of Portugal our most heartfelt congratulations on its change of stand regarding the colonial question  an action which ennobles Portugal in the eyes of the peoples of the entire world.146.	Along this same line of thinking  we are pleased to take note of the fact that Spain has clearly expressed its intention to comply with and implement General Assembly resolution 3162 (XXVIII)  so as to terminate the colonial regime in the Spanish Sahara. It will thus be implementing the principles contained in resolution 1514 (XV)  in defense of the interests of the population of that Territory. Also  by inviting the United Nations to be present during the process of self-determination  Spain is complying with the relevant United Nations decisions and reaffirming its support for the principles of decolonization that have been advocated and championed by the Organization.147.	In the twenty-ninth year of its existence  the United Nations will have to face the collapse of one system and direct its efforts to the creation of a new one  one more in keeping with the reality of a rapidly changing world.148.	Thus far  our system of coexistence has been characterized by the existence of independent and dependent States. The development  wealth and welfare of the former were nourished by the subordination and submission of the latter and the exploitation of their natural resources. At present  thanks largely to the work done by the United Nations  that relationship of dependency has changed and given way to a relationship of interdependence. The crisis threatens to display features more marked than those that are beginning to emerge in those countries that developed their industry according to their own exclusive needs and desires. The present period of transition and expectation is unprecedented in the history of mankind. For the first time mankind is becoming aware of the fact that it is  in fact  one and indivisible. Well-being and the benefits of culture and civilization  in general  must be shared more far more if they are to be genuinely lasting. All States should have access to markets and to technology. Each must contribute its share  but not for the excessive benefit of some and to the detriment of others.149.	The developing countries are now sovereign States  aware of their rights  of their duties and of their potential and ready at all times to defend their permanent sovereignty over their natural resources. The developed nations achieved their positions through the purchase of raw materials and sources of energy at unjustifiably low prices.150.	The well-being of one third of the world has hitherto been achieved at the expense of the other two thirds: a single industrialized country  with only 6 per cent of the world's population  uses for its own benefit more than half the mineral resources of the world. The emergency situation the world is experiencing calls for concentrated efforts to seek and apply corrective measures urgently and promptly. The need has become obvious for rational management of renewable and non-renewable resources that would take into account the interests of all countries.151.	A confrontation on a world scale to effect a redistribution of markets and raw materials will not have to happen if we  the States Members of the United Nations  as consumers and producers  are reasonable enough to hold an open dialog  with the aim of seeking equitable formulas for understanding on the basis of new definitions of the terms of trade that will redress the long-standing and unfair treatment by the developed countries of those on the road to development. To reconstruct the system along lines consonant with the new international dynamics and requirements will require bold and vigorous efforts that may at last make possible a world based on equality  justice and equity the only viable conditions for the achievement of that cooperation which is the basic source of well-being and peace.152.	As we see it  the Assembly is the appropriate forum for that purpose. It was created for that end and not as an arena for the uttering of threats by those who possess the dubious privilege of controlling the means of international intimidation and force. Here we can and must find new formulas for peace  cooperation and understanding.153.	We hope that during the present session the work in regard to the happy initiative of President Echeverria of Mexico will be crowned with success and that we may be able to adopt the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  a project to which Venezuela has at all times given its wholehearted backing.154.	The developing countries  aware of their responsibility  advocated the convening of the sixth special session of the Genera) Assembly in order to discuss openly and plainly the bases for new mechanisms for the harmonious conduct of international relations  in accordance with the present world situation.155.	The initiative of the developing countries has led to one of the most important steps ever taken by the United Nations. I am referring  of course  to the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-VI)] and the corresponding Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-VI)] which were adopted in May of this year. Thus the developing countries wished to anticipate the emergency situation which has arisen lately  to the real or potential detriment of the entire international community and particularly to the detriment of those countries whose economies are especially vulnerable.156.	We are bound to recognize that  despite the great efforts made by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  the emergency operation that the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to launch as part of the Special Program of the Program of Action has not got under way as successfully as it should have. The majority of the developed countries have adopted a ""wait and see"" attitude as though the onus of the financial burden of such an operation should fall on the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). These countries in defense of their common interests have after many years of effort managed to attain their rightful position in a world where their main  and at times only natural  resource is squandered a resource which is as vital for them as it is for the rest of the international community.157.	We believe it imperative to insist that neither Venezuela nor the other petroleum-exporting countries will in any way shirk their responsibilities in the present situation a situation that is undeniably financially favorable to them but certainly not one where there is real wealth and no grave problems. We  the petroleum-exporting countries  have tried to tackle the difficulties created by the new situation  in which  besides oil  many other factors of equal  if not greater  importance have had a powerful effect  factors such as the inflation that affects the whole world and that has been generated primarily by the industrialized States.158.	In keeping with this vie w  Venezuela has pledged contributions to help in facing the difficulties of the present situation that amount to a considerable sum  according to the financial structure and capacity of our country. I must of necessity draw attention to this matter  even if only in generic terms not immodestly  but as an objective demonstration of the position adopted by my country in this field of international economic co-operation.159.	The financial contributions made by Venezuela are equivalent to 1.2 per cent of its gross national product  and it is relevant to point out that the pledges made by the industrialized countries to assist the developing nations along these lines in most cases do not even reach one percent of their gross national product.160.	The financial contributions pledged by Venezuela include $100 million for the Special Program; $500 million for a trust fund to be operated by the Inter- American Development Bank  $150 million for the Trust Funds of the Andean Development Corporation  the Central American Development Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank; and for the latter we have set up a special fund of $10 million. We have also made a contribution of $450 million for Special Drawing Rights which are the equivalent of $540 million for the so-called oil facilities of IMF. Venezuela is also ready to contribute to the Fund of OPEC  and intends to help encourage agricultural and industrial development projects in the countries of the third world. We are thus ensuring the fulfillment of one of the targets of the recently created Venezuelan Investment Fund  which is to strengthen international co-operation.161.	The foregoing is simple  but I think appropriate and a clear demonstration of the stand of the President of Venezuela  Carlos Andres Perez  and his Government in this respect  but I feel that it is also appropriate to supplement the information by mentioning the position taken by my country in the preparatory session of the World Food Conference  that is  that there should be no acceptance of discussion that assessment of contributions to international organizations can be specifically based on oil income  for we contend that such contributions must be based on national per capita income with special consideration given to those developing nations which are going through difficult economic situations.162.	In line with this argument  let me refer to the Declaration and Program of Action that proclaimed the new international economic order. As might have been expected  the reasons that led the General Assembly to take such action at that time are still valid  so the process of implementation must be speeded up vigorously. If that holds true regarding the emergency situation  which continues to deteriorate with all its real or potential risks to the entire international community and particularly to those countries whose economies have been most severely affected  it is also true in regard to the medium- and long-range programs that are intended to set the new international economic order in motion. Both aspects are indissolubly linked. For all efforts to be tightly and coherently co-ordinated on a world-wide scale  the totality of measures making up the Program of Action must be fully implemented.163.	As an immediate step  as the Secretary-General has pointed out  it is necessary that the United Nations possess sufficient resources to be able to attend expeditiously to urgent needs and to ensure a certain balance in the distribution of the total resources of the emergency operation. Furthermore  the Government of Venezuela attaches special importance to the prompt beginning of the activities of the Special Fund  failing which the Special Program provided for in the Pro-gramme of Action will not be fully realized  as was so cogently pointed out by the outgoing President of the General Assembly  Leopoldo Benites  at the beginning of this session [2233rd meeting].164.	The present critical situation which the world is going through will not be resolved without a convergence of all efforts at the international level which will also take in the overall problem of raw materials. In the measure that correlation and balance is struck between the prices of raw materials and manufactures  we shall strengthen the possibility of putting a brake on the inflation which has been unleashed in the industrialized countries  the damaging effects of which no one has escaped and which might lead to a profound crisis with unforeseeable effects on all mankind.165.	Furthermore  the delegation of Venezuela considers it necessary to reaffirm before this great Assembly  where representatives of almost all the States of the present international community are represented  some of the ideas expressed by the President of Venezuela  Carlos Andres Perez to the President of the United States of America  Gerald Ford  a few days ago in an important document which is already on public record [see AI9784]. This defines the position of our head of State in the light of the address made to this very same General Assembly [2234th meeting] by the head of State of the most highly industrialized country of all the already developed nations. The President of Venezuela felt bound to define quite clearly and firmly w he and his Government feel regarding issues as vital and crucial for the present and future of our developing nations  as was the statement made by the Head of the Government of the United States  the host country to the United Nations.166.	The categorical statements made by our President not only have enjoyed unanimous support among all the political sectors which make up public opinion in our country  but have also received solid endorsement by highly authorized spokesmen and great personalities of many nations. We obviously consider this to be a signal honor  and it also proves how accurate are the ideas contained in that weighty document. In substance  it is clear and simple but it is also eloquent since as our Head of State has averred truth is always clear and simple:""The raw materials produced by our countries were purchased year after year at prices which were never in proportion to or in equilibrium with the prices of the manufactured goods which our countries require for their development and which have been purchased largely in the United States  not only for geographical reasons but also because of the credits tied to the United States economy that have traditionally been made available to us.""Particularly as regards Latin America  our President's letter adds:""For many decades  we in Latin America have persistently demanded just and equitable treatment by the developed countries and primarily  of course  by our neighbor and traditional friend  the United States of America. We have repeatedly pointed to the impoverishment of our countries .""Each year we  the countries which produce coffee  meat  tin  copper  iron or petroleum  have been handing over a larger amount of our products in order to obtain imports of machinery and other manufactured goods  and this has resulted in a constant and growing outflow of capital and impoverishment of our countries.""In Latin America  as in the other developing countries  we can assert that the developed countries have been taking advantage of the fundamental needs of the Latin American  Asian or African man. To cite the particular case of Venezuela  petroleum prices showed a steady decline for many years  while our country was obliged to purchase manufactured goods from the United States at ever- higher prices  which  day after day  restricted even further the possibilities of development and well- being for Venezuelans.""The establishment of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was a direct consequence of the developed countries' use of a policy of outrageously low prices for our raw materials . . .""The world food crisis is a consequence  inter alia  of the high prices at which the developed nations sell us agricultural and industrial machinery and other inputs essential to agriculture and the growth of our economies.""The President of Venezuela also maintains in his letter to the President of the United States of America that the Government of Venezuela agrees with the view expressed by him in the United Nations to the effect that ""a world of economic confrontation cannot be a world of political co-operation"" but our President goes on to say:""The economic Confrontation has been created by the major Powers  which refuse to allow the developing countries equal participation in the search for an indispensable balance in the terms of trade. Within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  Venezuela has not used no r will it use its energy resources as a political weapon because that is not and never has been the purpose for which that organization was established; rather  its purpose was to protect the basic wealth extracted from our subsoil at prices that have never compensated for the costs of our imports and of the technology needed for our development.""We see no other way to confront the economic totalitarianism that has been coming to the fore in business and world trade"" said our Head of State ""and portends as much evil for the world as was threatened by political totalitarianism in the form of Nazi fascism  against which your great country fought  rendering the world a heroic and splendid service that earned the gratitude of all mankind.""The World Food Conference which FAO is preparing to hold in November will not be able to achieve its lofty objectives if we in the developing countries do not succeed in guaranteeing remunerative prices for the raw materials we produce  prices that are in the necessary and fitting balance with the prices of the manufactured goods we import.""And President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela concludes with the following telling remarks:""In view of your important statement in the United Nations  I wish to place on public record this statement of Venezuela's position and the willingness of my Government to work in an international forum to establish a balanced relationship between the raw materials produced by our countries  on the one hand  and the manufactured goods and technology  on the other  which are possessed by the developed countries and are in essence the source of economic marginality and growing poverty in which over half of mankind continues to live. Venezuela perforce takes a sympathetic view of any attempt at finding solutions to the great problems of our time in global terms  but only if a global perspective does not mean that the large countries will prevail over the small countries. It would be dangerous  ineffective and harmful for global and universal solutions to lose sight of the fact that the world includes us as well. It cannot be supposed  Mr. President  that consumers are limited to one part of the world.""167.	The ideas quoted above are equally applicable or similarly apposite to the nature of bilateral or multilateral relations which  in the economic field  have been applied in terms of trade between the few industrialized countries of the world and the many that are painfully embarked on the road to their own economic and social development.168.	The phenomenon is not characteristic nor exclusively that of a few countries but is common to all  both developed and developing  the only differences being those of degree and form. But  as I pointed out at the beginning of my address  what is at the root of the matter and I want to emphasize this is that while political independence has slowly but progressively been achieved over the centuries by the members of the international community  their economic independence  as well as the economic interdependence among them  will brook no further delays. The political values of the international community have  almost perceived  been replaced by economic values; a skillful manipulation of incalculable magnitude has taken place whereby the clumsy hegemony of the powerful over the weak which was genetically referred to as ""colonialism"" has given way to an equally imperialistic but less obvious attitude that has been called "" neocolonialism"".169.	Permit me  without unduly prolonging this speech  to make a few remarks concerning some of the items on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly. We are all aware that the main problems in the Middle East still await solution. We believe that perhaps the best forum in which to seek such solutions is that provided by the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East if  that is  that Conference is given the determined support of the Organization and if  within the framework of the United Nations  the great Powers co-operate frankly and fully. Venezuela  as an eminently peace-loving nation  is mindful of the law and advocates international co-operation  and will always support any action aimed at achieving a truly just settlement which will respect the rights of ail the parties involved in the conflict.170.	Another case that must be settled within a wide political consensus of the parties involved is that of Cyprus. In that matter the United Nations must play the role assigned to it by the Charter. The interference of third parties in the evolution of domestic policies must be totally barred and the principles of self-determination and non-intervention enshrined in the Charter must be fully and effectively ensured. As the Secretary-General points out in the introduction to his report on the work of the Organization  it is obvious that the effectiveness of the United Nations in the solution of the Cyprus problem hinges basically on the support which the Member States may'.give to the decisions of its organs  as prescribed in the Charter.171.	In these situations of conflict  Venezuela fervently hopes that the decisions of the Security Council will be complied with and that the parties concerned will abide fully by the peace-keeping measures adopted.172.	With regard to general disarmament in all its aspects  I should like to stress the special interest of Venezuela in this matter. We adopt a practical approach to the subject from the point of view of international security  and therefore in the hope of achieving world peace  for peace that rests on fear is always precarious.173.	The total prohibition of the use of chemical weapons is the least that the Assembly should achieve at the current session. The manufacture and use of such weapons conflict with the elementary principles of humanity and the fundamental values of mankind  as well as the spirit of the texts and instruments which the international community has drafted and pledged itself to respect and ensure respect for. We would go so far as to say that  even if the Charter of the United Nations did not exist  we should still be justified in protesting against the use of weapons which represent scientific progress only in relation to mass destruction and which highlight the most primitive and bestial instincts of destruction. If world wars and their tragic lessons do not provide arguments capable of dissuading nations from procuring even greater powers of collective destruction and devastation  we can hardly be optimistic about the achievement of harmonious progress for mankind.174.	In speaking of this tragic and negative aspect of weapons of mass destruction  the peace-loving nations hope that a total ban on nuclear-weapon tests  including underground tests  will soon be implemented. Venezuela is especially gratified to note that on 31 March 1976 a test ban will come into force.175.	It might seem that we  the smaller nations  can adopt this attitude because we do not have the ""commitments"" of the nuclear Powers  but we believe that nothing could be further from the truth. It is those ""commitments"" that may make victims of the weak because they amount to admitting as a yardstick of the greatness of a State its power to destroy  including even the danger of annihilating all mankind.176.	There can be no doubt and herein lies the root of the problem that disarmament will be broad  complete and viable only when the moral values of our civilization change. It would seem at times that most of the leaders of the great Powers are themselves possessed by a series of doubts  suspicions and reservations which do not reflect the grandeur of their nations. We have no doubt that everybody will agree that it is precisely the great Powers which must set the example  since on them depend the manufacture  distribution and use of nuclear weapons. It is they which in some cases solve their balance-of- payments problem by the sale of weapons; they stimulate conflicts  sponsor wars  dismember nations and withhold vast resources from the solution of the great economic and social problems which confront mankind.177.	Venezuela is by tradition among those States which support the total prohibition of chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons and nuclear tests. We also support negotiations aimed at creating nuclear-free zones all over the world  as has been done already in Latin America. In this connexion  Venezuela is also in favor of holding a world disarmament conference at the earliest possible moment.178.	As was rightly stated in this same forum in 1962 by the then Foreign Minister of Venezuela  Marc Falcon Briceno:""Nations which have no powerful army and which use no language other than that of principle"" as in the case of Venezuela ""firmly maintain that the problems plaguing this world in crisis can be solved by peaceful means"" recognized by international law. "" ... In keeping with the ideal of peace which is the very basis of our world Organization the Charter of the United Nations tells us 'to practice tolerance* and 'to live together in peace'. That is an ideal which cannot be achieved overnight. The history of mankind has been different  but its long and dramatic past has given rise to the conviction that war is not a solution  that it is always better to negotiate than to fight. It is in order to negotiate that we who constitute the United Nations have come together here. If only the great Powers  too  might be guided in their deliberations here by that spirit of understanding and faith in principles. If only those great Powers might forget that they possessed the most destructive weapons hitherto known  and might  like the small Powers  the unarmed Powers  rely on a surer and more human arsenal in their international disputes: on international law and the procedures laid down in our Charter  which are the only civilized means of solving any kind of problem between the States Members of our Organization.""179.	In matters of human rights  our position is  has been  and will be consistent and unchanging. We shall defend them wherever they may be in jeopardy. We advocate their strengthening wherever they are not practiced with sufficient determination  we support the institutions that protect them  and will raise our voice to call for their full implementation. Many of the subjects to be discussed by the Assembly are  in one way or another  connected with human rights. Injustice  inequality  discrimination  breaches of the peace all these are violations of human rights  and these very violations are a contradiction of the very essence of our nation.180.	I wish to repeat that Venezuela is ready as always to support any proposal  any measure  calling for an investigation of the facts whenever there may exist a presumption that human rights have been violated  whether directly or indirectly. We advocate that jointly we should draw up a realistic balance-sheet of the social and economic situation of the world  as we are convinced that the inevitable relationship between underdevelopment and respect for human rights will be made manifest by us. The United Nations must continue its struggle to bring us ever closer to the ideal of social justice  the goal to which we all so earnestly aspire.181.	The policy of detente which  as has been said  is indivisible and is being applied among the great Powers with' promising results  should be extended to the countries of the third world for the solution of their problems. Venezuela has advocated and will continue to support ways and means that will also bring about detente in our hemisphere. In this connexion  I wish to thank the Minister for External Relations of Cuba for his expression of support for Venezuela and its Government during his statement in the general debate [2258th meeting] when referring to the stand taken by President Carlos Andres Perez in defense of the interests of the Venezuelan people and of the developing nations. Those expressions reflect the desire of our Governments to normalize relations between two Caribbean neighbors  whose past history has more than once found them united in the defense of the interests of Latin America.182.	Furthermore  and still speaking specifically of Latin America  including all the nations of the Caribbean  of which mine is one  President Carlos Andres Perez has  since he assumed office  been encouraging the holding in Caracas of a meeting of Latin American Heads of State or Government. The purpose of such a meeting would be to adopt practical measures to help solve our common concerns and meet our joint needs  thus taking advantage of the singular historic opportunity presented to our peoples. This initiative has been warmly welcomed by the majority of the Governments consulted.183.	Venezuela is always ready to contribute  to the extent of its abilities  to building a new international order  and in this task it offers its co-operation as a country which  though small  has profound democratic and liberal convictions  is a convinced lover of peace and freedom  and a conscientious observer of the principles of non-intervention and self-determination of peoples.184.	In the present picture in the main discouraging and sombre there is nevertheless one positive and encouraging aspect in that we can meet here  with our different points of view  and at times our conflicting interests  and still leave no doubt as to our firm determination to avoid the kind of confrontations in the world that have thus far proved ineffective as a means of solving problems.185.	Those of us whose responsibility it is to govern must strive with all our strength and intelligence to combat the state of fear and of constant uncertainty facing the common man of today. We must not forget that partly because of that very state of fear and concern over a future that threatens us not only with wars  but also with misery and want  there can be no other possible alternative but that of a constructive dialog for peace  for security  and for economic and social justice.186.	In closing  may I be allowed to make a firm declaration. Venezuela is fully aware of and accepts its responsibilities within the unstable scenario of our time. We will fulfill them  and we will do so with the unshaken determination to contribute to a fruitful and united co-operation among all the peoples of the world."
"126",7490,"YEM",29,1974,"My delegation was very much moved by the sad news  which we heard a short time ago from the Secretary-General  of the loss to humanity in the death of Paul Hoffman. It is a loss to science  technology and experience. Mr. Hoffman  with his unrivaled knowledge  his keen interest in humanity  his zeal in the service of mankind and for the acceleration of the development of the developing countries  was an example to all. To his wife and family  to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to the United States delegation we express our condolences.214.	Mr. Hassan Makki  our Deputy Premier and the head of our delegation  has been unable to be here in time and I have been entrusted with the reading of the text of the statement of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic on his behalf.215.	Mr. President  I should like to offer you our warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. Your unique personality  your wide knowledge  your great experience and your successful and sustained struggle for liberty and development were and will remain the motives that led the international community to entrust you with that important duty. If our sister Republic of Algeria is rightly proud of you it is because you represent also the  noble continent of Africa  that vigorous continent which looks forward to a better future and which is trying to take its proper place in the world community  thanks to its successful struggle to eliminate colonialism and repugnant and condemned racial concepts. We reaffirm that our delegation will do its utmost to co-operate with you in the successful fulfillment of the great task which you are now undertaking.216.	Our unreserved faith in the Charter of the United Nations and our unconditional support for the principles on which this world Organization is based reaffirm our trust in the choice of yourself to occupy your high post and express the conviction of the international community regarding the great role which is being played by the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria in the field of international cooperation and In the restructuring of world  international and economic relations on a just and democratic basis.217.	My delegation would like to pay tribute on this occasion to the President of the previous session of the General Assembly  Mr. Leopoldo Benites  who in his presidency combined prudence and ability.218.	My delegation would also like to welcome and express its warmest congratulations to the Republic of Bangladesh  to Grenada and to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on their admission to membership in the United Nations.219.	I am very pleased to inform the General Assembly about developments in modern Yemen  which is trying strenuously to emerge from the era of isolationism and underdevelopment  an era in which it was deprived of the benefits of modern civilization  science and technology.220.	Two weeks ago Yemen celebrated its national day. Thanks to our victories over underdevelopment  reaction and stagnation  we are now harvesting all our potentialities and resources and moving forward in great strides towards a better and more promising future that will restore to this Arab State its ancient glories that were described by the world of the time in terms of the wealth of Saba and Arabia Felix. We have opened wide the doors of Yemen to all that is useful  so that we may take advantage of  and bring to our country and to our sons  the blessings of knowledge and development and all that can lead us to prosperity  while adhering fully to our moral principles and religious precepts. For this reason  we have drawn from modern concepts provisions for the latest type of democratic institutions and progressive constitutions that are in keeping with our religion and faith and our traditions  which are based on consultation and justice. We are now applying the best administrative system that can ensure the attainment of our ideal objectives.221.	In the field of education  we have built and are building hundreds of schools and institutes in order completely to wipe out ignorance and illiteracy  and we have established a young and ambitious university. We have sent out missions to our sister countries and to other friendly countries in order for them to learn as much as they can  in collaboration with UNESCO  in their particular fields of specialization.222.	In the field of public health  we have built and are building hospitals and clinics. We are recruiting our own doctors and all doctors coming to our country from our sister countries. In this area we are cooperating with WHO to the extent that we can  with a view to eradicating epidemics and disease.223.	In the field of social affairs and labor  we have established a special ministry and enacted modern laws for the purpose of developing our society and ensuring social justice in its highest concepts. In this area we are co-operating with the ILO.224.	Also in the field of labor  for purposes of ensuring communication in all its forms  we have built many roads. Strenuously and indefatigably  we are completing a vast  country-wide network of roads that will link the coast with the hinterland  passing through very lofty mountains exceeding 3 000 meters in altitude  connecting the cities with each' other  on the one hand  and with the countryside on the other. We have also built a modern port on the Red Sea and are engaged in building two other ports. Through telecommunications  we have connected Yemen with the whole world: by telephone and telex and with modern airports and international airlines. In collaboration with ITU  we have built a network that can be considered among the most modern.225.	In order to develop agriculture and our country is  first and foremost  an agricultural one  cultivating a variety of crops in different areas we have created modern farms and are trying to improve irrigation by both surface and underground water. In this field we are collaborating with FAO.226.	We are also working in other fields of activity  seriously and arduously  with the aim of ridding ourselves as rapidly as possible of the heritage of underdevelopment by advancing along the road to development and growth  in order to guarantee a dignified life to the 8 million people of our country. I wish to take this occasion to thank our sister countries and the other friendly countries that have extended their assistance to us in generous fashion and with no strings attached.227.	After a period of stagnation  our co-operation with the technical agencies and various bodies of the United Nations and the international financial institutions has grown  and every year witnesses an increased understanding of the needs of Yemen on the part of these important agencies. This increase in their understanding results in an increase in the credit that can be extended to our country  thus assisting us greatly along the path of growth and development. Yemen also is thankful for the assistance that is being extended to it by UNDP and by other financial institutions that have provided us with assistance.228.	We all know very well that the object of including the name of Yemen among the 25 developing States is to implement all the resolutions adopted by the international community with a view to pushing forward this group of nations as quickly as possible; and we are sure that the assistance of our friends and the help of the international community will fail in reaching that objective unless we  the peoples and Governments  work hard and exploit all our resources  as we are now indefatigably engaged in doing. We also believe that the inclusion of our country's name in the list of the 25 developing countries is an additional incentive for us to step up our goal of development. We have learned from our own experience and from that of others in positions similar to ours that the development of our economy merits all our care and understanding and an open mind.229.	There have been developed some limited industrial and economic enterprises that could be successfully undertaken by government. The other enterprises  however  need capital  initiative  experience  expertise and personal effort  and for that reason my Government has enacted the most liberal laws for the purpose of encouraging investment on the part of both national and foreign capital with a view to bringing about a renaissance that will provide prosperity for the country and an honest and dignified living for the increasing numbers of our ambitious youth.230.	We have recently signed two agreements for investment in  and prospecting for  oil off our shores  and we sincerely hope that this economic co-operation will succeed  so that we can dedicate all the income and revenue from this valuable resource to raising the standard of living of our people and developing our country.231.	Together with our brothers in the southern part of Yemen  we look forward with great hope to the happy day when the total and natural unification of Yemen  within its historic boundaries  which is the ambition of every Yemeni  can be achieved  so that the Yemeni people as one can fulfill its ambitions and aspirations for development  prosperity and happiness  thanks to the historic unity long cherished by all the people.232.	Permit me to turn  particularly on the occasion of the mention of oil  to the position of Yemen regarding all the problems and questions which have been referred by the Organization to its Economic and Social Council.233.	Ir. this Hall the President of the United States dealt with the question of energy and food all over the world. While my delegation shares the United States President's concern about energy and food  I would draw attention to the fact that oil and gas are limited in quantity and are not renewable. For this reason it is the duty of all humanity to do its best to economize and cut down on its consumption of this resource  so that mankind will not soon be deprived of it; and this particularly as oil not only can be used as energy but also  as a raw material  has thousands of derivatives that can benefit mankind  in the form of medicines and other things.234.	Every scarce non-renewable resource that is of benefit to all must be the concern of all people and they must fix its price in relation to its scarcity  its importance and its value. However  as there are a number of developing States still in need of oil to help them to ensure the quick pace of their development  it has become necessary to help those developing countries facing oil shortages to acquire oil at reasonable prices. This can be achieved through assistance in kind or. by other practical steps which the oil-producing countries are taking now  and for which we thank them. We heard evidence of that a few moments ago from the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates.235.	As for food and the vital need for it and the fears resulting from the decrease in food production  I can say that the Preparatory Committee of the World Food Conference has paved the way for holding the Conference this November in Rome in order to deal with this vital question. The Conference may reach practical solutions  such as the establishment of special funds to finance the increase of crops  to facilitate the acquisition of fertilizers at reasonable prices and to supply high-quality seed and other practical measures. My delegation also shares the views expressed on this question by the Foreign Minister of our sister Republic of Kuwait  Mr. Al-Sabah [2249th meeting]  regarding the agricultural policy followed by some developed countries which give financial subventions to farmers in return for which they refrain from cultivating large tracts of land  in order to ensure a decrease in food production and a considerable rise in prices. It is worth mentioning that the present corrective change in the price of oil is not the reason for the rise in the prices of foodstuffs and other goods. That has been substantiated by the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom himself in his address before the General Assembly  when he said that ""the unprecedented world-wide economic boom of recent years led to higher commodity prices prior to the recent increases in world oil prices"". [2240th meeting  para. 219.]236.	The international community has witnessed during the past nine months that is  since the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly many events and developments which have given proof of the effective role played by the international Organization in developing international relations and have revealed the growing strength of the non-aligned movement and the new positions gained by this movement along the path taken by the developing countries in reaffirming their political independence and national sovereignty over their natural resources.237.	The initiative of President Houari Boumediene of Algeria that led to the holding of a special session of the General Assembly to discuss raw materials and development was a true indication of the readiness of the third world countries and their seriousness in assuming historic responsibilities for development  on the one hand  and on the other  in reasserting their independence and their true desire to establish a serious dialog with the industrialized countries on a basis of equality in order to discuss the serious defect in the international economic and monetary system.238.	Here I must refer to the continued monopoly by a few States of the resources of the sea. We hope that the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Caracas  which dealt with this problem in a practical and realistic manner  will reach at its forthcoming session in March an agreement that will ensure an equitable and just distribution of the tremendous resources of the sea  so that the developing countries  which have been deprived in the past of justice in that distribution  will have a share commensurate with their needs.239.	We also hope that the eminent personalities of this world will accept the principle of respect for the sovereignty of all States over their territorial waters  including islands and straits  because it is inconceivable and not in the interest of world peace that the fleets of big naval Powers should continue roving the seas of the world without observing or respecting the sovereignty of the small States. In particular those States feel pain when they see the fleets of those Powers approaching their coasts carrying the most lethal weapons of destruction and devastation  including horrendous atomic weapons. We also hope that the seas  including the Indian Ocean  will become zones of peace and security and not zones for dangerous military rivalry. We sincerely hope on this occasion that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean  of which Yemen has the honor to be a member  would arrive at proposals that would lead to avoiding this continued military rivalry between the big Powers in this part of the world whose importance is growing as a result of the growing importance of oil along its shores.240.	After having reviewed recent problems and their positive and negative impact on international relations  we would put on record here the viewpoint of my delegation and the view of my country towards some questions which are before the General Assembly.241.	The problem of colonialism and foreign occupation remains a factor which causes anguish for humanity's conscience and which hinders the progress of peoples  who have been the victims of the crimes of colonization  towards liberty  independence and prosperity. Depriving more than 20 million people of their inalienable right to live free on their own soil and to take part in building a prosperous society  in which justice prevails  runs counter to the spirit of the modern age and is not in keeping with the great developments that have been achieved by twentieth-century man.242.	It is to be regretted that colonialism and the colonization of Sakiet El Hamra and Rio de Oro  of the African Arab Sahara  which is erroneously called ""Spanish Sahara""  has not ended. My delegation would denounce the continued colonization of the Arab land and finds it necessary that Spain and the international community should take the necessary steps to end this anomalous situation at this late stage of decolonization. The international community should not accept any measures which would ensure the perpetuation of domination or colonization  whether overtly or covertly. For this reason we support totally the moderate and prudent step which has been taken to place the case of this African-Arab territory before the International Court of Justice as a measure to put an end to colonization in all its forms.243.	Although we welcome the spirit of realism shown by the new regime in Portugal and its pragmatic stand on the question of some colonies in Africa  we would appeal to them to end all colonial regimes in all parts of Africa which are still under Portuguese domination  particularly in Angola  by granting it  without delay  its legitimate right to self-determination and independence. What we have heard from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal enhances our optimism and our hope.244.	The cause of liberty and decolonization in Africa has not come to an end. Namibia is still groaning under the yoke of oppression and barbarism practiced by the racist regime of South Africa. Despite the world's appeals which have been addressed by the United Nations to the minority regime in Johannesburg the intransigence of this minority racist regime and its slighting of world opinion remain unchanged. We have reached the point of no return at which it is useless and futile to issue further resolutions and appeals. In the face of this situation it is the duty of the United Nations  with all its 138 Member States  to take drastic action which would ensure the compliance of South Africa with the resolutions of the General Assembly. We stress the responsibility of Member States to respect and observe their obligations and implement the resolutions on embargoes adopted by the United Nations.245.	The problem of Southern Rhodesia reflects a particular situation which is identical with what had taken place in occupied Palestine. In both cases  British colonialism had given foreign adventurers and terrorists the opportunity to occupy the two countries and  by encouraging them  to impose their domination over the indigenous peoples of those countries through terrorism and slaughter. We all remember how Great Britain withdrew from Palestine and abdicated its responsibilities as a mandatory Authority. It repeated the same operation in Southern Rhodesia  neglecting its international obligations towards the League of Nations and then towards the United Nations.246.	The bloody events which have taken place on the island of Cyprus since 15 July last and the regrettable developments which have taken place after the military coup that overthrew the constitutional Government headed by Archbishop Makarios is one of the dangerous negative points in international relationships  Though we do not want to dwell on this problem in detail  we would strongly support the resolutions adopted by the Security Council. We also reaffirm our special concern for and strong awareness of the territorial integrity of the island and the independence of the Republic of Cyprus and its position as a distinguished State among the non-aligned countries.247.	The world as a whole will not rest until racial discrimination and apartheid as practiced in southern Africa and Rhodesia are completely eradicated. My Government would support all resolutions and measures adopted with a view to ending apartheid and racial or ideological discrimination. How could a man  or a thinker  or an institution  or any Government condemn colonialism and the flouting of people's rights and racial discrimination  without mentioning the noble Palestinian people and their sad fate  and without welcoming the most recent resolution adopted by the United Nations  which has duly recognized this basic and important problem of the world by deciding to deal with it for the first time after a great many years of neglect.248.	Here in the General Assembly Hall the Palestinian problem will be dealt with. Is the world entitled to continue to remain silent before the oppression and tyranny practiced against an entire people  exceeding three and a half million in number  of sons of Palestine? This Holy Land was chosen by God to be a place of peace and tolerance and not to be a place of tyranny  oppression and injustice. We are sure that the historians of the United Nations will consider this session to be one of the most important sessions ever held by the Organization and that they will call it the session which reinforced the basic rights of the Palestinian people.249.	Everyone engaged in politics all over the world is now convinced that the noble people of Palestine is worthy of all care and appreciation because this heroic struggling people has proved without doubt and very clearly its genuineness and resolute determination to recover its legitimate rights with unprecedented courage. It has faced and is now facing challenges resolutely and with faith  a fact which has compelled the whole world to admire this people which has risen to its historical responsibilities and has proved its ability to shoulder the heavy burden which has been thrown on its shoulders very recently by the failure of the world community to recognize its basic legitimate rights and the continued injustices of the aggressor. Everybody shares our certainty that there can be no solution to the problem of the Middle East before the Palestinian people has recovered its inalienable and legitimate rights and any sustained neglect of those sacred rights will inevitably result in the further deterioration of the situation in the whole area  a fact which would endanger the whole world.250.	How can what is called the ""Middle East problem"" be resolved completely and radically unless a solution is found first to the problem of the Palestinian people whose rights have been denied and who has been expelled from its homeland and has been under the rule of a foreign invader? It is now high time that the world should come to its senses and deal with the cause of the disease  and not be content to avoid its complications and extend its symptoms. For this reason  my Government warmly welcomes the sensible resolution adopted by the United Nations to deal with the Palestinian problem within the proper context and with due care  that is to say  in the General Assembly  and gives the representatives of this noble Palestinian people every chance to explain its cause  to defend it and to put forward practical solutions for it. The bitter experience through which this people has passed has taught it how to contain and deal with the cause of the tragedy facing it  how to defend its legitimate rights and to abide by the concepts and democratic and human principles which have been voiced by it on all occasions.251.	We are sure that the international community which knows what Zionism is and which fully realizes its dangers  and knows who the Palestinian people is and what are its rights  will listen to the explanations of the Palestinian delegation from this rostrum and will support that delegation as it has done so far in all the various political and non-political conferences and meetings whether held within the United Nations or outside it.252.	My delegation expects the United Nations to abide by the provisions of its Charter  that is to say  to give the Palestinian people its full untrammeled right to return to its fatherland and to restore to the whole people  regardless of whether they return to their fatherland or not  the right to practice sovereignty and full and immediate independence.253.	I reaffirm that my Government has unshakable faith in the fact that unless this people is restored to its rights and unless it is given the right to sovereignty and independence in its fatherland  there will never be any lasting peace in the Middle East  and the world's conscience will never be at rest because of the continuation of this tragedy. That is why we call for its radical solution on a just basis. If that is not done the whole area will be engulfed in a destructive war which  in turn  may become a world calamity."
"127",7537,"YUG",29,1974,"Sir  I have the honor to congratulate you on your election to the high and responsible position of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. This gives me particular pleasure since you represent friendly  non-aligned Algeria  which  like my own country  through a national liberation war and revolution won independence and created the conditions for social progress and equal participation in international relations. Your election symbolizes the growing role in the world of the peoples and countries of Africa and their successful struggle for freedom  independence and equality  as well as the in-creasing role of the non-aligned countries and the policy of non-alignment in the contemporary development of international relations.1Q8. The untiring efforts and the competence with which Mr. Leopoldo Benites conducted the twenty- eighth session of the General Assembly  last year  as well as the sixth special session of the General Assembly  merit our most profound thanks and recognition.109.	My delegation has already had the opportunity to welcome the admission of the three new Members in the Organization and  in that connexion  to express our great pleasure. Permit me to congratulate once more the delegations of the People's Republic of Bangladesh  the Republic of Guinea- Bissau and Grenada on their admission  which is one more important victory on the road to achieving the universality of the United Nations.110.	On behalf of my delegation  I should like to express to Secretary-General Mr. Kurt Waldheim our recognition of his great personal commitment to finding solutions to the crises in the Middle East and Cyprus  and of his efforts in that connexion  as well as in connexion with the carrying out of the program of emergency measures to mitigate the difficulties of the most seriously affected developing countries.111.	In the period between least year's General Assembly session and this one  many turbulent and important changes have occurred which have not by-passed a single area of international relations  and from which no region of the world has been exempt. Almost never before have so many problems  in so short & time and with such intensity  engaged the attention of the international community.112.	The basic characteristics of these changes are a profound social-economic ferment in many countries  and ever stronger and more organized demands for fundamental changes in international political and economic relations. The achievement of domestic progress is becoming increasingly tied to the struggle for complete political and economic independence and equality and for the elimination of the causes of tension and hotbeds of crisis.113.	The process of relaxation of tension between the big Powers and in Europe has led to certain achievements important to peace and security. This is reflected in the initial results obtained in the field of the limitation of strategic nuclear arms and the removal of the danger of a general nuclear war  as well as in the convening of the Conference on Security . and Co-operation in Europe. The successful conclusion of that Conference would be a new  important contribution to consolidating the process of relaxation of tension and the strengthening of peace  security and equal international co-operation in Europe and the world. Yugoslavia decisive favors and  together with other participating countries  is making a constructive contribution to the successful outcome of the Conference  There is no doubt that the continuation of the process of relaxation of tension is of the greatest importance for the preservation of peace in the world and the solution of international problems.114.	The relaxation of tension in the world is in the interests of all countries. It should become a world process and encompass the solution of the most serious international problems with the equal participation of all countries  especially those most directly interested. If such general relaxation is not achieved  or if it should remain limited in scope  content and participants  we would have no guarantee that we had really moved away from the danger to the peace and security of many countries  and not even from a confrontation of global proportions. The role of the United Nations is of the greatest significance in the further development of the relaxation of tension. The non-aligned countries particularly contribute to the development of this process  in which they see the expansion of active peaceful coexistence in the world and conditions for attaining their jointly established aims.115.	In the complex and uncertain development of the world situation  the policy of non-alignment  which at the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  held at Algiers in September 1973  gained new strength and established the basic directions for common action by the non-aligned countries  has been  further confirmed as the lasting political orientation of an ever-increasing number of States and as a world policy. The non-aligned countries have become not only a powerful moral and political factor but a real material force  which has shown that it can influence international relations and make a real contribution to the solution of the most important international problems. It should be stressed in this connexion that the non-aligned countries have always been inspired by a desire for equitable and broad co-operation with other countries  and that confrontation has been imposed on them by the positions and conduct of certain Powers.116.	The challenge to the international community and the United Nations  and especially to the non- aligned Countries  is all the greater and more bold because of the frequency of cases of direct and indirect foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries* often with the aim of overthrowing the legal government and changing the political orientation of a country. Furthermore  the internal social and economic difficulties?- encountered by certain developing countries are frequently used to the same end  whereas solidarity should be expressed and assistance extended to them in overcoming such difficulties. There is no hesitation even about attempting to legalize such interference as the right of the stronger. The United Nations must not permit any country  on whatever grounds  to secure the right to interference and intervention  for this would be the gravest blow to efforts for the relaxation of tension in the world and the establishment of equitable international relations; it would be a dangerous threat to peace and security  and even to the very existence of the United Nations.117.	Why do we have these and similar dangerous phenomena in international relations? We find the answer in the reality of the existing profound differences and contradictions in the development of international relations in our era. Acting contrary to the process of relaxation of tension  to the struggles of peoples for full political and economic emancipation  equal international co-operation and peace and security in the world  are the forces of imperialism  colonialism and other kinds of foreign domination  hegemony and exploitation  which often resort to interference in the internal affairs of other countries and to various forms of pressure and do not even shrink from the use of force. As a direct consequence of this practice there is today a whole chain of crises and tensions  from Viet Nam and Cambodia  through the Indian Ocean and the Middle East  to Cyprus and southern Africa  which directly threaten the freedom and independence of many countries and peoples as well as world peace and security. In other parts of the world  too  there are many latent crises and conflicts which could lead to new and dangerous tensions in international relations.118.	Following the significant changes resulting from the successful liberation struggle of the Arab countries and copies in the October war against Israeli aggression  which we view as only the first step towards an overall solution of the Middle East crisis  I must express concern over the lack of further progress and the return to the state of ""no peace  no war"". Moreover  the trends towards a heightening of this dangerous international crisis are becoming stronger. Obviously  the responsibility for this situation lies with Israel  which continues to show reluctance to comply with the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly  resorts to aggressive conduct and is threatening a new armed attach. It is a dangerous illusion to believe that the crisis can be kept under control or that it can be localized while the settlement of the problem is postponed.119.	Yugoslavia calls for the prompt and complete withdrawal of Israel from all the Arab territories occupied in 1967 and subsequently. This is an essential prerequisite for achieving a comprehensive and just solution which would enable all the countries and peoples of the Middle East to live in peace and independence.120.	We have always believed that a settlement of the Middle East crisis is impossible without a solution at the same time of the Palestinian problem. Therefore my country is among those that have wholeheartedly supported the initiative to include this item in the agenda of the General. Assembly [AI9742 and Add.I-4]. This comes at a particularly timely moment in view of the frequent attempts to push this problem into the background and by various maneuvers make it impossible for the legitimate representatives of the Arab people of Palestine to take part  on an equal footing  in its solution.121.	Yugoslavia firmly supports the recognition and realization of the national rights of the Arab people of Palestine  and primarily its right to self- determination and free development  and considers the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] to be its sole legitimate representative. We are convinced that at this session appropriate decisions will be adopted in this direction and that the Palestinian representatives will be granted equal participation in all efforts to overcome the Middle East crisis and all phases of the negotiations.122.	The crisis in the Middle East and the new Cyprus crisis are interconnected  intensifying tensions and increasing the danger to peace and security in that part of the world and generally. It is therefore essential that these crises be settled without delay. It has again been confirmed that peace and security in Europe  in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East  which are of fundamental importance for peace and security in the world  are interlinked and that they cannot for long be strengthened or consolidated apart from each other. 123.	Without going into the history of the Cyprus crisis I should like to set forth our views on its essence and the basic elements on which a settlement can be achieved. My Government believes that it is now most important to begin the process of settling this acute and dangerous situation. Provoked by interference on the part of imperialistic and reactionary forces in harness with the former Government of the Greek military junta  by means of the well-known putsch against the Government of the Republic of Cyprus headed by President Makarios  and in view of the unsettled relations between the two national communities in Cyprus  the crisis flared into an armed conflict and foreign military intervention  which despite the present cease-fire continues to entail great sacrifices and suffering of the population of the Republic of Cyprus.124.	The independent and non-aligned Republic of Cyprus is  after Chile  the second non-aligned country within a year to fall victim to inadmissible foreign interference in internal affairs and to the policy of force. We view these events as dangerous attacks on the policy of non-alignment as a whole following the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Algiers which all non-aligned and other peace-loving countries must most resolutely resist.125.	My country  as a neighboring and non-aligned nation having friendly relations with the Republic of Cyprus  with Greece and with Turkey  has endeavored from the beginning  within the limits of its capacity  to contribute to overcoming the crisis. The President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  Josip Broz Tito  sent messages to the leading statesmen o.f the Republic of Cyprus  of Greece and of Turkey. Believing this to be a crisis of the broadest international significance  President Tito then sent messages also to the chiefs of State of the permanent members of the Security Council and to a number of non-aligned and other countries  as well as to the Secretary-General.126.	In these messages  and on many other occasions  my Government pointed out the principles which it considers to be the basis for a just and lasting solution. These are: full respect for the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non- alignment of the Republic of Cyprus; the withdrawal of foreign armed forces and bases from Cyprus; and the establishment of relations of equality between the Greek and Turkish national communities within the framework Of a State organization which they themselves will work out together. Not only must the legitimate representatives of the Republic of Cyprus  in the person of representatives of both national communities  participate in finding a just and lasting solution  but their role in the search for such a solution is of primary importance. Along these lines  the contacts between the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus  which have produced initial positive results  are encouraging.127.	Yugoslavia regards as indispensable the full commitment of the United Nations to the finding of ways and means for a political settlement of the Cyprus crisis. In this connexion  we think that the presence and activities of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus are important and my Government extends its recognition to that Force. We deeply regret the casualties it has suffered.128.	On the basis of these positions  Yugoslavia along with other non-aligned countries  especially those in the group established by the co-ordinating bureau of the non-aligned countries to follow the development of the Cyprus crisis and to offer good offices to the parties to the dispute is ready to continue to do everything in its power to open up prospects for a just and permanent solution of this crisis  in the interest of peace and security and in the spirit of the United Nations Charter  that is  the universally accepted principles upon which international relations should be based. Yugoslavia also supports all further initiatives and efforts for a peaceful solution of the Cyprus crisis that is acceptable to the parties to the depute.129.	We note with pleasure that the successful struggles of the liberation movements in Africa and the positive changes in Portugal have made possible progress towards the final liberation of the peoples from Portuguese colonial domination. The independence of Guinea-Bissau and the agreement on the attainment of independence by Mozambique are very significant achievements which we believe will soon be followed by the liberation of Angola  the Cape Verde Islands and other colonies.130.	By consistently supporting and assisting from the very beginning liberation and anti-colonial movements  Yugoslavia has actively endeavored to contribute to this development. Guided by that consideration  we resumed diplomatic relations with Portugal immediately following the removal of the Portuguese Fascist  colonialist regime. We approached this in the conviction that the democratic forces of the Portuguese people will consistently carry out the historic task of decolonization and with a profound belief in the unity of interests of the struggle of the democratic forces of Portugal  and the national liberation movements in the Portuguese colonies. We are happy to see that the democratic forces of Portugal are successfully carrying out this task in co-operation and agreement with the liberation movements. At the same time  we consider it essential that the United Nations engage in preventing any attempt by colonialist and racist regimes to restrict or halt this process.131.	South Africa  however  remains a bastion of imperialism  neo-colonialism and foreign exploitation. Not only does the racist regime oppress the African majority of its population but it is also a constant source of threat and danger to the independence of its African neighbors. Without assistance from South Africa and international capital  the white racists in Southern Rhodesia would be unable to maintain their illegal minority regime  which defies all the sanctions of the United Nations. The people of Namibia are still exposed to cruel exploitation by the South African racists. We believe that the time has come for the United Nations to consider in more concrete terms what should be done to put an end to South Africa's constant violation of the fundamental principles and decisions of the United Nations.132.	In our opinion  there are now favorable conditions for accelerating the liberation of all the remaining colonial strongholds or enclaves in various parts of the world and we should. therefore come closer to the complete realization of decolonization one of the most important goals of the United Nations and of the entire international community.133.	In South Viet Nam the Saigon regime  with support from abroad  is brazenly violating the Paris Agreement and  by resuming military operations  endangering the freedom  independence and right to self-determination of the people of Viet Nam. The people and Government of Yugoslavia fully support the right of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Viet Nam - the only legitimate representative of the people of South Viet Nam to observer status and the right to participate in the work of our Organization.134.	As we know  through procedural maneuvers  last year a discussion of the question of establishing in the United Nations the legitimate rights of the Royal Government of National Union of Cambodia  led by Prince Sihanouk  was postponed  but the acuteness of this problem has not diminished. In fact  the postponement has proved to be completely unjustified. The Lon Nol regime is  as it always has been  an instrument of foreign intervention and interference. The liberation struggle of the people of Cambodia has registered new successes  while their legitimate Government actually controls most of the national territory. It is therefore essential for this session of the General Assembly to adopt a resolution in favor of recognizing the legitimate Government of Prince Sihanouk to represent Cambodia in the United Nations.135.	The problem of Korea continues to occupy our attention. Important steps have been taken to overcome this heritage of the cold war. The duty of the United Nations  as we conceive it  is to induce the peaceful reunification of the Korean people. We therefore  together with a group of non-aligned and socialist countries  requested the inclusion of an item on the withdrawal of foreign military forces from South Korea under the United Nations flag [AI9703 and Add.1-3] and we favor the adoption of a resolution by the General Assembly in this regard  which is also in the spirit of the consensus achieved at the twenty-eighth session. 136.	The efforts and struggles of the peoples of Latin America to change the existing inequitable relations  for sovereignty over their natural resources and for political and economic independence enjoy the support of a wide circle of non-aligned countries  including my own. The adoption by an ever greater number of Latin American and Caribbean countries of the policy of non-alignment is of tremendous international importance  because it strengthens the power and role of the non-aligned countries  in international relations and in solving acute and' long-term international problems  while at the same time it is a further guarantee of the success of their struggle for emancipation and equality.137.	In recent months we have witnessed the further deepening of theT crisis Of the world economy. The world trade and monetary systems are in a state of profound crisis. Inflation is rampant and  like a relentless tidal wave  is sweeping from one country to another  and the greatest sufferers from this are the broad working classes of the population and the countries at the lowest level of economic and social development.138.	The so-called energy crisis and the crisis of the system of international economic relations  which most directly affect the development of political relations  have again confirmed that in today's world of increasing interdependence of countries and peoples no area can be isolated in either prosperity or crisis.139.	The sixth special session of the General Assembly  on raw materials and development  provided a comprehensive analysis of contemporary economic problems. On the initiative of the non-aligned and other developing countries it reached a historic decision on the establishment of a new international economic order and adopted a Program of Action [resolution 3202 (S-Vl)]. This offers a basis and framework which make it possible  by common effort and respect for the interests of both the developing and the developed countries  to seek solutions to the most serious economic problems confronting us. For that reason  in our opinion  our actions should be directed towards the most rapid and complete implementation of the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order [resolution 3201 (S-F/)] and the Program of Action. We are convinced that a search for some other solutions and resistance to the inevitable process of establishing a new economic order could only worsen the already critical situation in which we find ourselves today.140.	I should especially like to stress the importance of the most urgent and complete implementation of the Special Program contained in the Program of Action. Despite the fact that the General Assembly at the special session achieved a high degree of agreement on the need to extend urgent and adequate assistance to developing countries which are most seriously affected by the current economic trends in the world  the implementation of the Special Program as a whole is going slowly  so that there is a danger of its losing its basic purpose. The extremely difficult position of the most seriously affected developing countries places a great obligation on all countries to heed the appeal launched at the special session  in the name of solidarity  interdependence and common progress. We feel that at this session the General Assembly should give decisive support to the implementation of the Special Program.141.	In this connexion  I particularly wish to emphasize the extraordinarily difficult position of thePeople's Republic of Bangladesh  which is fighting the terrible consequences of inherited backwardness  war destruction  natural catastrophes and extremely unfavorable world economic trends. In addition  a matter occupying our close attention is the grave consequences of famine affecting many African countries  particularly in the Sudano-Sahelian region  and in some other countries in other parts of the world. It is of vital necessity for the international community and our Organization to approach more decisively the solving of these acute problems.142.	Aware of the situation in the most seriously affected developing countries  the Government of Yugoslavia has decided  within the confines of its capacities  to contribute to the emergency measures provided for in the Special Program  despite the fact that my country  also  seriously feels the results of these unfavorable trends in the world economy that include restrictions imposed on its traditional export markets.143.	The developing countries will continue to rely on their own capabilities and to utilize their own resources. They are determined to speed up their economic development by joining forces and through mutual co-operation and assistance. We feel sure that the meeting of representatives of the co-ordinating countries  which has just ended in Belgrade  and which prepared a number of proposals for the implementation of the Action Program for Economic Co-operation among Non-Aligned Countries  will contribute to this.144.	In achieving the aims and performing the tasks laid down at the sixth special session of the General Assembly  the role of the United Nations is irreplaceable. We have often witnessed a lack of orientation on the part of certain organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations towards carrying out the resolutions and recommendations of the General Assembly  while today there is a growing tendency to bypass the system of the United Nations  and to seek solutions to outstanding economic problems in closed  privileged circles. What is essential today is to have ever more concentrated actions by the organs and agencies of the United Nations.145.	The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  and the World Population Conference  contributed to the solution of the problem of development  and thus also to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations. To those same goals should contribute such important actions in the coming period as the adoption of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  the World Food Conference  the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and  as the climax of a period of exceptional all-round activity by the United Nations  the special session of the General Assembly to be held in September of next year  in the preparation of which we should even now begin to pay the greatest care. 146.	Present developments in the world are accompanied  and to a great extent conditioned  by the strengthening of the influence of the military factor on the policy and actions of some Governments. This also leads to an acceleration of the arms race which is acquiring disturbing proportions  and to an increase in the role of the military-industrial complex in certain developed countries.147.	The greatest danger threatening humanity is the possible use of weapons of mass destruction. For this reason  Yugoslavia  together with other non-aligned countries  and in the spirit of the resolutions adopted at their conferences  has always most resolutely favored the undertaking of urgent measures for the complete prohibition of the use  development  production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons  and for the destruction of existing stockpiles. In this context  we also support the prohibition of all nuclear and thermonuclear weapons tests for military purposes  in all areas and by all countries. For the same reason  we firmly support the efforts for the earliest possible prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of all chemical weapons and the destruction of existing supplies.148.	While the development and production of nuclear weapons continues  we cannot refrain from pointing out that very modest results have been achieved so far in the field of the transfer of nuclear technology to the developing countries. This leads the developing countries to rely on their own resources and  by uniting their capabilities  to seek solutions in this area  also  which would enable them to emerge more quickly from the economic difficulties confronting them. It is high time for the world Organization to find a proper answer to this problem too.149.	Negotiations on disarmament being held bilaterally or within broader frameworks  have yielded some results  which my country supports  but we feel it is essential to give a new powerful stimulus to these efforts. We believe that a world conference on disarmament could open new paths and perspectives for the abandonment of the armaments race  and for disarmament  in conditions of a strengthening of trust among peoples and States.150.	We welcome with satisfaction the success of the Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression  of which Yugoslavia is a member  in submitting to the Assembly at this session an agreed draft definition [fee A19619 and Corr.l]. Although the draft definition is a result of compromise  it defines the most important characteristics of the act of aggression  a definition that can assist the United Nations in identifying an aggressor  preventing and arresting aggression  or checking a potential aggressor. To this end  my delegation is in favor of the General Assembly's adopting  by consensus  the proposed definition of aggression.151.	This decisive turning-point in international relations  makes it essential for us to combine our efforts on the broadest possible basis so that the search may continue for the solution of outstanding questions by peaceful means and in the spirit of the principles to which we  so often  as Members of the Organization  have declared our attachment."
"128",7603,"ZMB",29,1974,"Mr. President  on behalf of my delegation  I wish to begin by congratulating you most sincerely upon your election to the high office of President of the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly. My delegation is particularly gratified by your election not only because you represent that dynamic country  Algeria  but also because of your own personal talents and skill which are attested to by your distinguished record both as a revolutionary and as one of Africa's longest serving Foreign Ministers.161.	My delegation has every confidence that under your guidance  the noble goals of freedom and justice  peace and progress  will be further advanced  for after all  these are the lofty objectives of Algeria's foreign policy  which  as in the case of my own country Zambia finds expression in the policy of non alignment. In this connexion  I hardly need to refer to your country's role as current coordinator of the activities of the nonaligned countries. My delegation is confident that the group of nonaligned countries will  as in the past  make a positive contribution to the success of the work of this session of the General Assembly .162.	It is also my pleasant duty to pay a tribute to. your predecessor  Mr. Leopoldo Benites of Ecuador  for the efficient and judicious manner in which he guided the work of the twenty-eighth session and the historic sixth special session of the General Assembly.163.	On behalf of the party  Government and people of Zambia  I should like to reiterate the expression of our deep sense of sorrow at the tragic death of President Juan Peron of Argentina  whose contribution to the wellbeing of his people and to international peace and security will be long remembered by all  and in particular by the nonaligned countries.164.	May I also reiterate the profound shock and grief felt by the party  Government* and people of Zambia at the tragic death of Prime Minister Norman Kirk of New Zealand. The new policy of the Labor Government of New Zealand in relation to the situation in southern Africa which was initiated under' his leadership will continue to be regarded as a positive contribution to international peace and security.165.	I wish  on behalf of my delegation  to congratulate and extend a warm welcome to the delegations of Bangladesh  Grenada and GuineaBissau on the admission of these States to membership in the United Nations. Their admission is a further step towards the realization of the principle of universality of membership of the United Nations. My delegation is confident that these new Members will play their full part in the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations in accordance with its Charter.166.	During the past year there have been a number of significant developments in various spheres of international relations. It is my delegation's wish to address itself to some of these developments.167.	In keeping with our well-known policy  Zambia continues to attach great importance to developments in the field of decolonization. In this connexion  my delegation welcomes developments in the Portuguese  colonies. We should like to commend the liberation movements in Angola  GuineaBissau  Mozambique and the Cape Verde Islands  for the recent victories which have crowned their heroic liberation struggle for self-determination and independence. The overthrow of the Caetano regime on 25 April 1974  was a direct consequence of the dynamic struggle waged by the African nationalists. It heralded new and welcome prospects for peace and democracy in Portugal and self-determination and independence for the colonies.168.	We welcome the recognition by the new Portuguese Government of the Republic of Guinea Bissau as an independent State. We equally welcome the agreement for the granting of independence to Mozambique recently signed by the Portuguese Government and the Frente de Libertaeao de Mozambique [FRELIMO]. In the light of the good faith which has so far been demonstrated by the Portuguese Government  we look forward to an early commencement of negotiations for the independence of Angola between that Government and the African nationalists. In this connexion  we are gratified to learn that the nationalist movements of Angola  namely the Movimento Popular de Libertagao [MPLA] and the Frente Nacional para la Libertagao de Angola [FNLA ] have realized the need to unite in order not only to facilitate their negotiations with Portugal  but also to guarantee thereafter a peaceful  stable and prosperous Angola; As is well known  the Organization of African Unity [OAU]  acting through a committee comprising my own country Zambia  together with the Congo  the United Republic of Tanzania and Zaire  has spared no effort to assist the Angolan people in this respect.169.	We are aware of the maneuvers made by certain reactionary forces whatever their motives  calculated to undermine recent progressive changes tending towards the attainment of independence in Angola and Mozambique. We view with dismay  for example  the ill-fated attempts by a band of white reactionary settlers in Mozambique who resorted to disorder and violence in order to frustrate the popular course of events towards independence. However  we are at the same time confident that these shameful maneuvers by a band Of settler desperadoes will be completely quashed.170.	In this regard  we condemn the massing of troops by the racist and minority regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia along the border with Mozambique. This is a flagrant act of provocation and aggression against the territorial integrity of Mozambique. We equally condemn the malicious intention Of mercenaries to perpetrate criminal acts against the people of the emerging State of Mozambique. We urge all countries  in particular South Africa and the Western countries  to prevent the mobilization of their nationals for such deplorable acts.171.	As the people of Mozambique attain a new status of nationhood  they face real and acute problems in the economic and social fields  the effective solution of which necessitates urgent and generous assistance from the rest of the international community. To this end  Zambia  for its part  pledges the fullest assistance.172.	Zambia has had a long and beneficial association with the nationalist movements in southern Africa. We have profound admiration and respect for the leadership of these movements. Like us in Zambia  these movements are committed to the establishment of a nonracial society in their respective countries. They desire development  peace and security for all their people  regardless of race  color  religion or ethnic grouping.173.	Notwithstanding the positive developments in African territories occupied by Portugal  the situation in the remaining territories under white racist regimes  in Zimbabwe  Namibia and South Africa  continues to deteriorate.174.	We are aware that the illegal regime in Salisbury has intensified its oppression of the majority African population in the face of even more numerous victories by nationalist movements and the growing political consciousness among the oppressed masses. In utter desperation  the rebel regime in Zimbabwe has intensified its oppression. There has been an intensification of such absurdities as collective fines  the closure of African schools and businesses  the creation of prohibited areas along the border with Mozambique  the forced removal of thousands of Africans into concentration camps  the introduction of passes for Africans in the northeastern region and forced labor for Africans between the ages of 12 and 60 years. The panic stricken regime has even resorted to widespread detention and torture of the Africans including the destruction of their food crops.175.	The people of Zimbabwe will settle for nothing less than majority rule. That is the minimum guarantee for peace  security and stability in Zimbabwe. Continued intransigence by the illegal rebel regime would only cause untold loss of life and human sufferings and would only lead to a more resolute armed struggle by the liberation movements. That would be the inevitable consequence of the continued denial of a negotiated peace settlement. The liberation movements and other peace-loving forces have always preferred settlement by peaceful change  but that should not be mistaken for weakness. The liberation movements are not tired of war  and we are not tired of supporting the armed struggle  either.176.	We would therefore urge Ian Smith and his racist rebel clique to have the courage to talk to the authentic leaders of the indigenous people of Zimbabwe. In that connexion  it is the inescapable duty pf the United Kingdom Government to live up to its responsibilities in respect of its rebel colony of Souths era Rhodesia  The United Kingdom should therefore create conditions propitious for the peaceful resolution of the Southern Rhodesian crisis on the basis of majority rule. My Government deplores the continued detention of Messrs. Joshua Nkomo and Ndabaningi Si thole  leaders of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union [ZAPU] and the Zimbabwe African National Union [ZANU]  respectively  who are the authentic representatives of the people of Zimbabwe. In that regard  we deeply regret the professed inability of the United Kingdom Government to secure their release. It is essential that the leaders of the authentic liberation movements be released from detention in order that they may participate in any negotiations  including the constitutional conference we have repeatedly urged the Government of the United Kingdom to convene.177.	Numerous decisions and resolutions have been adopted by the various bodies of the United Nations on the. important question of Southern Rhodesia. One of the significant actions taken by the United Nations was the imposition of economic sanctions against the Smith regime by the Security Council [resolution 253 (1968)]. It is  however  disheartening to note that there are still many Members of the United Nations which do not carry out their obligations in that respect. It is even more disappointing to note that States violating those economic sanctions are the ones best able to implement them. In that connexion  as the Assembly is aware  Zambia continues to make tremendous economic and other sacrifices in. the implementation of relevant resolutions in order to uphold the principles of justice  self-determination and independence.178.	We are gratified that there are  however  a number of States which uphold those principles in accordance with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations. We should like to reiterate our firm conviction that an isolated Southern Rhodesia without external assistance would not have survived an effective and sustained implementation of the sanctions policy . We call upon those States which have continued to violate the United Nations sanctions against Southern Rhodesia faithfully to live up to their obligations under the Charter.179.	As in Zimbabwe  the situation in Namibia continues to deteriorate. The racist and minority regime in South Africa persists in its illegal and repressive occupation of the international Territory of Namibia and thus remains a challenge to the will and authority of the United Nations. Over the past year the people of Namibia have seen an intensification of the reign of terror.180.	In pursuit of its policy of the Balkanization of Namibia  South Africa has resorted to the public flogging of men  women and children alike  arbitrary detention without charge or trial  and banishment. Clergymen and pressmen have been refused entry into the Bantustans in a desperate bid to conceal the extent of the bestiality of the South African regime. As an outward manifestation of the unbridled reign of terror  there has been a mass exodus of thousands of people who have had to flee as a consequence.181.	At this juncture  I should like to pay a tribute to the people of Namibia  who  under the gallant leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]  continue to wage a determined armed struggle against the occupation of their country by the racist  Fascist and minority regime in Pretoria. My delegation wishes to reaffirm its conviction that their unrelenting struggle  coupled with the United Nations efforts to enforce its resolutions  will in no time culminate in South Africa's total withdrawal from that United Nations Territory. We hope that South Africa will take advantage of the present circumstances in southern Africa to announce a definite short term timetable to terminate the illegal occupation of Namibia and allow the United Nations to hand over the administration of that international Territory to the people of Namibia.182.	My statement to this Assembly in regard to the situation in southern Africa would be incomplete if I did not refer to the repugnant policy of apartheid pursued by the Fascist  racist and minority regime in South Africa. It is a matter of indomitable disgust to us that  despite numerous condemnations by the United Nations and the international community as a whole  South Africa  apart from intensifying this policy internally  has even dared to export it to such countries as Namibia  Southern Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa.183.	South Africa has long been aware that its policy of apartheid is doomed to failure. Conscious of that fact  it has resorted to militarism  the creation of buffer States and acts of downright blackmail. The South African regime is collaborating with the illegal rebel regime in Southern Rhodesia and pouring troops into Namibia  and has conspired with subversive elements to reverse positive developments in the Portuguese colonies.184.	My delegation has noted that for the first time individuals other than whites have been included in the South African delegation to the General Assembly. Needless to say  those persons are victims of circumstance. They are puppets of the regime and their presence here is intended to hoodwink the United Nations and the international community into believing that South Africa is changing its policy of apartheid. My delegation condemns that bluff  for it indicates only that South Africa does not take seriously the demands of the international community to bring about genuine change in its policy.185.	My Government urges the South African regime to abandon forthwith its evil policy of apartheid in the interests of peace and security in southern Africa. South Africa should emulate the example set by Portugal and accept the inevitability of majority rule. That is the only way it can end its international isolation. That is the only way it can cease being treated as a truly international outcast.186.	The situation in Cyprus is a matter of grave concern to us in Zambia. It was with shock and indignation that we received the news of the overthrow of President Makarios by a group of Greek officers. We immediately condemned the coup  for not knowing was it carried out against the legitimate Government of Cyprus  it was also outrageously dangerous in every respect. Our fears that such a disruption of the hitherto delicate status quo would open a new chapter of misery for the people of Cyprus have indeed been vindicated by subsequent events in that country. Today  what is also at stake is the very sovereignty and territorial integrity and  indeed  the independence of Cyprus.187.	The crisis in Cyprus has therefore reached dangerous proportions. It glaringly calls for urgent international action to reverse the trend. The sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of Cyprus must be preserved at all costs. In that connexion  it is imperative that both Greece and Turkey immediately withdraw their military forces from the island. The presence of the forces of both those countries  in our view  only further complicates the search for a just and lasting peace in Cyprus. Moreover  those forces constitute a danger to the lives of the people of Cyprus. Genuine constitutional order must be restored  and that should  naturally  include the return to Cyprus of the elected President of that country  Archbishop Makarios.188.	We followed with interest the ill-fated Geneva negotiations among Greece  Turkey and the United Kingdom  the three guarantors of the independence of Cyprus. Quite frankly  we were uncomfortable with the thought of that forum deciding on the destiny of the people of Cyprus without the full  direct and equal participation of the Government of that country. It is inadmissible  in our view  that even an attempt should be made to settle the problem of Cyprus behind the backs of its people.189.	We therefore wish to urge that the legitimate Government of Cyprus be invited as a full and active participant in any future negotiations concerning that country. In this connexion  we take note of the proposal of the Soviet Union for an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations in which Cyprus  Greece  Turkey  all the members of the Security Council and other countries  particularly the nonaligned countries  would participate. In the light of the failure of the Geneva negotiations  we feel that this proposal deserves serious consideration. We therefore support it in principle. We are nevertheless open-minded with regard.to other initiatives or indeed improvements on the Soviet proposal.190.	There can be no doubt that the nonaligned countries have an important role to play in the search for a just solution to the crisis in Cyprus. The situation must not be allowed to degenerate into a hotbed of bigPower rivalries. In this regard  we are painfully aware of the sensitivity of the Eastern Mediterranean region.191.	In the Middle East  genuine peace and security are still but a dream. The last war served to change certain attitudes which had hitherto impeded the search for a just and lasting solution of the problem of the Middle East. A more serious and realistic approach on the part of the big Powers has now led to some progress in this direction. Much  however  remains to be done. We look forward to the forthcoming Middle East peace talks at Geneva with great interest. We remain convinced that only  complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territory and the full restoration of the lawful rights of the Palestinian people can guarantee permanent peace in the Middle East. In this connexion  it is our view that the Palestinian people have a right  indeed a duty  to be represented at the Geneva talks.192.	Recent reports from SouthEast Asia are far from encouraging. Many innocent lives continue to be lost in Viet Nam in spite of the Paris peace Agreement  which is constantly being violated. The situation therefore remains dangerous. The international community can ill afford to divert its attention from Viet Nam. A genuine political settlement must be found.193.	With regard to Cambodia  we note that the puppet regime of Lon Nol is still desperately struggling to cling to power. Foreign interference in Cambodia is still rampant. The continuing war in that country has caused tremendous loss of life and destruction of property. We shall continue to support the Royal Government of the National Union of Cambodia  headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. We shall also continue to support the efforts aimed at the restoration of the lawful rights of that Government in the United Nations.194.	We note with concern that no progress has been made in the dialog between North and South Korea sanctioned by this Assembly at the 2181st meeting of its twenty eighth session. The foreign forces stationed in South Korea have continued to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean people. Sadly  these foreign forces are in South Korea under the United Nations flag. Their presence in South Korea is inimical to the interests and aspirations of the Korean people and to international peace and security. It is an impediment to all efforts aimed at the peaceful reunification of Korea. Those forces cannot but be an embarrassment to the United Nations  under whose flag they operate  as they act contrary to the wishes of the Korean people and seek to promote the interests of a foreign Power. The General Assembly therefore has a duty to decide that they should be immediately withdrawn from South Korea so that the dialog we encouraged last year can go forward unimpeded. The United Nations must protect the interests of the Korean people and help to create an atmosphere conducive to the realization of their cherished goal of reunification.195.	My delegation also wishes to make it clear that we are strongly opposed to the preposterous suggestion  made in these halls last year  that North and South Korea be admitted into the United Nations as separate entities. We view this as a maneuver calculated to perpetuate the division of Korea. We therefore reject in advance any similar suggestions this year.196.	We in Zambia  along with other nonaligned countries  have always maintained that detente can become a permanent feature of international relations only if it does not remain limited in scope and if it does not ignore the legitimate interests of other countries. We have stressed the imperative and urgent need for solutions to all problems confronting mankind as a whole and for the establishment of an international order truly based on justice  security and progress for all.197.	Who can deny that the process of detente has in recent months been put to a severe test? Contrary to the expectations and hopes of the international community  hardly any progress has been made in strengthening detente and making it irreversible. Because of its limited character  it Remains as precarious today as it was yesterday. It is no exaggeration to say that this whole process has in fact suffered stagnation.198.	The last war in the Middle East brought the world close to the brink of a direct superPower military confrontation. The crisis in Cyprus has more than demonstrated the vulnerability of small countries when the interests of more powerful countries and military blocs are involved.199.	For detente to be viable it must mean a new commitment to the principles of the United Nations. It should be recognized ^that genuine international peace and security cannot coexist with the concepts of spheres of influence and hegemony. It is such tendencies which provoke aggression  interference in internal affairs and acts of subversion against other countries. Consequently they are responsible for world crises. They therefore constitute the most serious threat to international peace and security.200.	The year 1974 has been a particularly bad one since .the inception of detente. No progress has been made in limiting bigPower rivalries  whether in the arms race or in the pursuit of so called strategic interests. The arms race continues with even greater ferocity. Nuclear weapon tests have continued to be conducted both in the atmosphere and underground. The Conference of the Committee on Disarmament and the Strategic Arms Lintion Talks have not yet yielded any positive results in the field of disarmament. Yet the proposal for a world disarmament conference remains but a dream.201.	It is the opinion of my Government that the recent nuclear weapon tests  both in the atmosphere and underground  have once again highlighted the urgent need for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. They are also a grim reminder that halfhearted and even discriminatory measures on disarmament  such as the partial test ban and nonproliferation Treaties  cannot work. What the international community needs is not making nuclear weapons the preserve of a few countries but rather the total elimination of such weapons.202.	That a world disarmament conference should be convened as soon as possible is  in our opinion  all the more imperative in the light of the lack of progress in the existing disarmament forums. Our position in this regard remains that the conference should allow for the participation of all States on an equal basis. We deem the participation of all nuclear States in the conference to be particularly essential. In this connexion  nuclear disarmament cannot but be our number one priority. In our opinion  the Ad Hoc Committee on the World Disarmament Conference has served a useful purpose. Guided by its report [A19628]  we hope that the General Assembly will make another positive move aimed at reconciling the differences among. Member States concerning this proposal.203.	It has been three years since the General Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)]. Yet hardly any progress has been made in the implementation of the provisions of that Declaration. There have been a number of disturbing reports about the intensification of bigPower rivalries in the IndianOcean. We are particularly concerned at the agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom to expand the United States military base at Diego Garcia. We condemn this project and urge its immediate abandonment  for not only does it flagrantly disregard the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  but also it is likely to encourage eves greater bigPower rivalries in the Indian Ocean.204.	In our view  there is absolutely no justification for the intensification of the bigPower rivalries in the Indian Ocean in this so-called era of detente. We believe that  instead of promoting such rivalries under the label of so-called containment of one another  the big Powers should exercise mutual restraint at a conference table. We would hope that the big Powers would respect the wishes of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean and cooperate fully with the efforts of the international community to preserve the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace.205.	The current session of the General Assembly is meeting in the aftermath of the historic sixth special session of the General Assembly  which was convened to consider exclusively and for the first time the vital subject relating to the problems of raw materials and development. The special session  as we are all aware  was a most significant event which culminated in the consensus adoption of two important documents  namely  the Declaration and Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order.206.	The special session served to highlight the fact that  since the sordid and sad chapter of slavery came to a close and foundations were laid for a community of free nations  economic relations among nations have undergone only a cosmetic change. Instead  there has been a remarkable change in the sharpening and sophistication of instruments of exploitation of the weak and poor nations by their more powerful and privileged counterparts. This has contributed in no small measure and  not unexpectedly  to the widening and deepening of the present gulf between the poor and the rich. This sad state of affairs has been aggravated by the recent deterioration of the world economic situation  and constitutes a threat to the security and survival of many economies.207.	Profound economic events over the past year have dramatically demonstrated the interdependence of the international community. One of the important results of the special session is the universal recognition of interdependence among nations and the interdependence of problems of trade  development  finance and the international monetary system.208.	Global inflation has continued unabated  particularly in the industrialized world  resulting in increased costs of essential capital goods  fertilizers  food and other manufactured products imported by developing countries. We are equally familiar with the emergence of scarcities  particularly the acute problems of food  which is the most basic commodity. In addition  although the recent increase in petroleum prices has served to emphasize the need for equitable and fair returns for the export products of the developing countries  it is also a fact that serious adverse consequences continue to be experienced by the developing countries. A combination of these factors now poses the danger of imminent collapse and even disaster for a number of economies.209.	The current turbulent economic situation facing the international community presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities. All of us represented at this session know the exact limits of our capability to contribute to the necessary immediate and longterm measures to alleviate and forestall those problems which have befallen or might affect various countries  particularly those developing countries most adversely affected by the current world economic situation.210.	It is now  more than ever before  readily recognized that coordinated action  on the national and international level  is essential in order to resolve the closely interrelated problems confronting the international community. The series of important world conferences on such issues as population  food and industrial development  culminating in the special session on world development and international economic cooperation to be convened next year  clearly demonstrates the essential need for concrete action.211.	In this connexion  my delegation welcomed the timely adoption by the special session of the Special Program to provide emergency relief and development assistance to those developing countries most seriously affected by the recent economic events [see resolution 3202 (SVl)  sect. A)]. We are confident that all countries in a position to contribute will respond favorably in order to meet the target set for the United Nations emergency operation as a matter of urgency. Urgent and positive action is essential  on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis. It is encouraging that a number of countries have indicated their willingness to contribute to the Special Program.212.	Although we recognize and appreciate the significance of emergency relief and assistance  it is the view of my delegation that our preoccupation with emergency relief should not detract from the urgent solution of basic longterm commodity and payments problems as called for in the Program of Action adopted by the special session. Indeed  we hope that the solemn concern in the emergency field will create conditions conducive to the solution of basic problems  which would in the long run serve to lessen the need for emergency debt and similar relief.213.	There is already evidence of a downward trend in prices of those products that have gained in recent commodity increases. Urgent international action is therefore necessary to arrest any further decline in the price levels of those products  and to institute  as well as to encourage  appropriate programs  where necessary  designed to achieve and maintain just  stable and remunerative prices for the exports of developing countries. To this end my delegation looks forward to the possible uses of indexation  currently under study  as a means of dealing with the terms of trade situation of developing primary exporting countries. 214.	My delegation believes that from the recent economic events there should have resulted a greater understanding of the mutual needs and interests of producers and consumers  both countries and companies. The time is now ripe for a dispassionate appreciation of the legitimate needs of consumers for assured supplies at reasonable prices  and of producers for greater real earnings  increased exports  stable markets and favorable terms of trade  particularly for the developing countries. It is also in the interests of both consumers and producers to ensure the rational exploitation and utilization of resources. We consider these to be the most important motives behind the formation of such producer associations as the Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries  of which Zambia is a member together with Zaire  Peru and Chile.215.	In the vital area of commodities  every possible encouragement should be given to the promotion and strengthening of economic cooperation among developing countries. The need for such closer cooperation  especially among developing producers  acquires an important dimension in the light of the recent invaluable work by the Group of Eminent Persons appointed by the SecretaryGeneral in accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1721 (LIII) to study the impact of transnational corporations on the development process and on international relations.216.	It is Zambia's earnest hope that the successful implementation of the acceptable recommendations of the Group of Eminent Persons will result in the maintenance and strengthening of cooperation between the host countries and their respective transnationals  with due regard for the exercise by the host countries of effective control in the management and operation of the various branches of their economies. In this connexion  we look forward to the work of the Special Inter-sessional Committee on transnational corporations.to be convened shortly.217.	In the field of commercial policy  justice could only be achieved by the implementation of the cardinal principles of non-reciprocity and preferential treatment in favor of developing countries.218.	The operation of the generalized system of preferences for approximately three years now has been of some benefit to developing countries. However  we are familiar with the limited character of the benefits that have so far accrued from the system and its need of improvements. Zambia also welcomed the Tokyo Declaration adopted last September  and it is my delegation's cherished hope that the multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of GATT will soon get under way.219.	Concerning the international monetary system it is disheartening to observe the limited progress  if any  towards its reform. The hopes that were generated at fast year's Ministerial Meeting of the Committee on Reform of the International Monetary System and Related Issues  of IMF  held in Nairobi  Kenya  have not yet been fulfilled.220.	Other issues facing the international community relate to the recycling of surplus funds of the oil exporting countries accruing from their recent increases in petroleum prices. These are  undoubtedly  issues with important ramifications in the trade  financial  investment and other fields. My delegation would like to express the hope and there are already grounds for expressing confidence  that oil exporting Member States will genuinely play their part in the measures necessary for both the current and longterm situation.221.	The international community is now familiar with and agreed on the key problems confronting man and his environment. We have before us  for example  such important initiatives as the International Development Strategy for the United Nations Second Development Decade [resolution 2626 (XXV)]  the draft Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  still under discussion  the concept of collective economic security also under consideration and  most recently  the Program of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order. In all these complementary initiatives the vital elements of equality and equity in international relations are at the center.222.	We therefore have before us instruments designed to achieve an equal and equitable partnership among all nations  rich and poor  big and small. For us to achieve a lasting and honorable partnership  we must fully recognize the pivotal role of justice and fair play in our relations. And  in the final analysis  the attainment of equality and equity in international relations is contingent upon the deliberate exercise of political will in degrees commensurate with the present requirements and future priorities.223.	The fact that the United Nations has convened three conferences on the law of the sea within a relatively short space of time demonstrates without question the importance that humanity attaches to an equitable solution to the problems that States experience in relation to the sea  the seabed and the subsoil thereof  and the resources of the area. The task before the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is a momentous one. There are many issues before it. Most of those issues reflect possible conflicts between the national interests of different States. Yet in all these  the Conference must surely strive to arrive at just solutions and to do so speedily.224.	The position of my delegation has clearly been stated on various occasions before  that is  at sessions of the now dissolved Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and the Ocean Floor Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction  at the first substantive session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and at previous sessions of this General Assembly. Apart from the subject of the right of access to and from the sea of landlocked States and that of adverse effects of seabed mining on the economies of developing States producers of similar minerals  my delegation attaches great importance to the need for a satisfactory solution to the problems of limits of national jurisdiction.225.	That being the central issue for the Conference  it does not only merit very careful consideration  but also needs to be examined with particular attention to the principle of the common heritage of mankind. Lack of suitable solutions to the foreseeable problems may lead  in the future  to boundary disputes such as the international community has through the years experienced with respect to landlocked countries. By convening the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea  the United Nations has provided an opportunity for exercising foresight and for finding lasting solutions.226.	My delegation is of the view that the recognition of the common heritage of mankind as defined in General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) goes a long way towards reducing the likelihood of such disputes. Consequently  it is regretted that the Conference is still being asked by some States to recognize national claims of extraterritorial coastal jurisdiction which  if adopted  would significantly undermine the common heritage of mankind. Besides  the common heritage exists for the benefit of all States  whether they be landlocked or coastal.227.	It is the opinion of my delegation that it is necessary for the Conference to take fully into account the study of the SecretaryGeneral on the economic significance  in terms of seabed mineral resources  of the various limits proposed for national jurisdiction and contained in the records of the now dissolved Committee on the Peaceful Uses of the Seabed and the Ocean Floor Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction.228.	In order  to arrive at a just and equitable solution to the problems raised by the question of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the adjacent seabed  ocean floor and subsoil thereof  the Conference might very well consider the possibility of establishing rights to resources of the area for all States belonging to a region or a subregion jointly. In our view  this would be one of the best ways of ensuring that all States  whether landlocked or coastal  derive benefits from ocean space resources which are rightly the common heritage of mankind.229.	It is generally gratifying to note that the Third Conference on the Law of the Sea has proceeded with dispatch to respond to its global responsibilities. It is noted  for instance  that it has invited representatives of liberation movements to participate as observers and has agreed to reach its decisions on matters of substance by way of consensus.230.	Finally  and not least  my delegation would like to express our profound gratitude to the Government and people of Venezuela for their overwhelming hospitality and satisfactory facilities offered to the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea during its second session held in their beautiful capital  Caracas  for 10 weeks during the months of June  July and August this year.231.	In this address my delegation has referred to a few of the many and complex issues facing the international community and of which the current session is seized  and to which it will no doubt pay the fullest attention. We are mindful of the fact that  under the auspices of the United Nations  Member States have individually and collectively achieved some  albeit limited  progress in finding solutions to a number of contemporary problems. This limited progress must be maintained and consolidated. The momentum generated by the process of negotiation  as  for example  in various world conferences intended to promote a peaceful  just and equitable settlement of international issues  should be maintained.232.	A great deal  however  remains to be done. In view of the universal recognition of the interdependence of States  we should utilize the numerous opportunities available to face outstanding global challenges to international peace and security  and to the economic and social advancement of all peoples. In this and other areas  it has become obvious that the responsibilities devolving on the United Nations and its membership have acquired unprecedented dimensions.233.	It goes without saying that the quest for peace in international relations has acquired a broad appeal for a world whose history has been replete with violence  poverty and insecurity of increasing scope and magnitude. We have consistently advocated the restructuring of the United Nations system to allow it to cope better with the rapidly changing circumstances. In this regard  we have repeatedly pointed to the imperative need for  inter alia  the revision of the Charter of the United Nations  with particular regard to the democratization of the Security Council.234.	Despite its shortcomings  we would like to reaffirm our confidence in the United Nations and to express our earnest hope that the Organization will soon undertake appropriate changes in both its structure and orientation in order to enhance its ability to carry out its responsibilities with unprecedented vigor and determination. Zambia  for its part  will continue to render its modest but positive contribution to the Organization  in the fulfillment of the purposes and the principles enshrined in the Charter.235.	I believe that all of us assembled here have the opportunity of a lifetime to change the face of the world for the better  given the political will to do so. Let us  therefore  recognize the imperative need to abandon old myths in the face of new realities. Let us not seek to adapt the solutions of yesterday to the problems of today. Let us not live in the past. Let us live in the present and look forward to a bright future for all with confidence and determination."
