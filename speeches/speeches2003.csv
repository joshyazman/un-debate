"1",33,"AFG",58,2003,"﻿There is no reality moreoppressive than the silence of a nation. For too long Afghanistan was a silenced nation  a country without avoice. After decades of being suppressed into silence our nation is beginning to have a voice of its own.Recovering from the tragedy of war and destruction Afghanistan is determined to reverse the effects of thesuffering it has long endured.A lot has changed in Afghanistan over the lasttwo years. But no change is so critical and pervasive asthe animated response of the people of Afghanistan tothe recent developments in our country. I find no sightmore rewarding than that of our young girls and boysflocking to schools every morning. I find few thingsmore engaging than the company of elderlyrepresentatives who come to Kabul from far-flung partsof the country to discuss their priorities forreconstruction. And  in the same order  there is nothingmore enthusing than the active participation of Afghanmen and women in the process of public consultationfor the new constitution.From the public consultations conducted inconnection with the constitution drafting process  weknow that the people of Afghanistan want a modern unitary State that is committed to Islamic values andthe preservation of peace and national unity  a Statethat ensures security for all its citizens  enforces justiceand the rule of law and promotes prosperity. As in anypost-war society  the need for security and forremoving the threat of arms and armed factions is acompelling issue for all Afghans. Our people demandthe establishment of truly national and competentinstitutions  notably the army and the police. Afghanswant State institutions that are professional andrepresentative and an administration that is efficientand free of corruption. The Afghan people wanttolerance for other religions  protection of human rightsand affirmative action to promote the rights of women.Since I addressed the Assembly in September oflast year  Afghanistan has taken significant strides inthe path of post-war reconstruction. While totalstability may not have been achieved yet  todayAfghanistan is more stable and peaceful than in anyother period in its recent history. The InternationalSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF)  to the credit of theparticipating countries  has done a tremendous job ofsecuring the nation’s capital. That is partly the reasonthat people from other parts of the country havedemanded that ISAF be expanded to their areas  too.We see NATO’s decision to take over the command ofISAF in Kabul as a positive development. The Afghanpeople have also welcomed the provincialreconstruction teams that are supported by the coalitionmember States. Reconstruction and security are tied toone another  and we are absolutely certain that nomatter what flag they fly  forces that ensure stabilitywill be welcomed throughout Afghanistan.However  we recognize that providing security tothe people of Afghanistan is ultimately our ownresponsibility. We are grateful to the internationalcommunity  the United States and Germany inparticular  for making a determined effort to help usembark on a process of reforming and rebuilding oursecurity institutions  namely the Afghan National Armyand the national police.After an arduous process of restructuring  wehave just completed the reform of the Ministry ofDefence. That step is now paving the way for theimplementation of the nation-wide programme ondisarmament  demobilization and reintegration  whichwill begin in earnest in mid-October with assistancefrom Japan.A Constitution is the bedrock of the modernState. Under the Bonn Agreement  my Governmentwas assigned the historic task of giving Afghanistan itsnew Constitution. The commission assigned that taskhas just finished the draft Constitution. The draft willbe submitted in December for approval to aconstitutional grand council of the Afghan people which in our language is called a Loya Jirga. Work onthe reform of the judicial system and on drafting newsecondary laws has also continued  with notableoutcomes achieved in recent months. The laws onpolitical parties and banking have now been officiallyadopted.Having started from a below-zero baseline  the 30per cent economic growth rate that Afghanistanenjoyed last year is a promising start. Committed as weare to an open-market economy  and seeing the privatesector as the true engine for growth  we have movedaggressively to create the legal and financial7frameworks needed for a positive environment for theprivate sector. Our newly adopted laws governinginvestment  banking and property rights  the new stablecurrency and the bureaucratic reforms we have enactedprovide a liberal and conducive underpinning for rapideconomic growth. Like never before  Afghanistan isopen to business.Once  in the past  Afghanistan was at the centreof a global threat  that of terrorism. Our vision for thefuture is that Afghanistan should be a centre foreconomic opportunity. We do not call ourselves a land-locked country; rather  we are a land-bridging country.Afghanistan connects South Asia  Central Asia and theMiddle East  a fact to which geo-strategists have longbeen attracted. But it is time that Afghanistan’s vastpotential for facilitating trade and economic activity isexploited.Through such nationwide programmes as theNational Solidarity Programme  the Government aimsto take reconstruction to the villages and households ofAfghanistan. Perhaps no other priority features morewidely in the demands of the Afghan people than theprovision of education. Today  fortunately  almost 40per cent of the students and teachers in primary andsecondary education are female. That is a huge increasefrom the close to zero percentage that we inheritedfrom the Taliban. Millions of textbooks have beenpublished  and schools are being built at a higher ratethan ever. However  in other areas of service-provisionthe need is much greater than our capacity to deliver.The struggle against the production of  andtrafficking in  narcotics continues. We see a directconnection between narcotics and terrorism  and it is inour absolute national interest to fight both. Both aretransnational challenges. We in the region and in theinternational community must take the strategicdecision  in the spirit of true partnership  to fightagainst both menaces.As we acknowledge that the road ahead forAfghanistan is long and tortuous  we appreciate thefact that significant achievements have been made overthe last two years. The people of Afghanistan aregrateful to the international community for its crucialsupport. While countries that have extended a friendlyhand to Afghanistan are far too many to thankindividually  it would be unfair not to single out theUnited States  the European Union and Japan forspecial thanks. The United States of America has ledthe international community by example in offeringsupport for Afghanistan. The additional assistanceprovided to us under the Accelerated Success Initiativewill go a long way towards rebuilding our country. Theneighbours of Afghanistan also have a special place inour hearts. Our people will always remember the warmwelcome they received from their brothers and sistersin Pakistan and Iran. In addition  Afghans holdSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his SpecialRepresentative Lakhdar Brahimi in very high esteem.Their kind-hearted attention to Afghanistan is highlyappreciated.Cognizant of our new situation and the emergingopportunities that exist today  we are determined tobuild friendly  civil and constructive relationships withcountries of the world. We continue to extend a sincerehand of friendship to Pakistan and all our otherneighbours on the basis of the requirements of acivilized relationship. We will never permit ourterritory to be used against any other country  andexpect the same in return.We are deeply concerned about the loss ofinnocent lives in Palestine and Israel. We support therealization of the right to self-determination for ourPalestinian brothers and sisters.We are fully committed to remaining a resilientpartner with the international community in the fightagainst terrorism.All the achievements I have just noted amountonly to a good beginning. Our challenge is to stay thecourse. That will depend not only on the resolutedetermination of the Afghan people  but also on thecontinued engagement of the international community.While the achievements are significant  andalthough challenges are inevitable  today  in this forum I wish to point to what can potentially amount to acritical threat  namely  the ongoing threat of terrorism.The crisis in Afghanistan may well be over  but theforces of violence continue to threaten. Embodied invarious manifestations  from militant infiltrations tohateful teachings at places disguised as madrassas terrorism continues to make inroads into the space ofpeace and prosperity that we want to secure for ournation.Islam  our universalist religion  has absolutely noplace for terrorism. The apostles of hatred who preachmurder in the name of religion and who abuse the name8of Islam and the sanctity of madrassas are the enemiesof Islam. They act against all that Islam teaches namely  peace  tolerance  compassion  social justiceand the good of humanity.Terrorists aim to harm the nation of Afghanistan a deeply believing Muslim nation that is averse toextremism. They pose a threat to the process ofreconstruction in Afghanistan. Terrorists see theirlasting defeat in the success of reconstruction. They aretherefore maliciously intent on derailing the process ofreconstruction in Afghanistan. That must stop. Wemust defeat the forces and ideas of violence in theregion. Today terrorism is a liability to theGovernments in the region. Governments must stopusing extremism as an instrument of policy. As long asterrorism survives in this part of the world  neitherAfghanistan nor our neighbours  nor indeed the rest ofthe world  can be safe."
"2",72,"AGO",58,2003,"﻿I would liketo start by congratulating Mr. Julian Hunte on his33election to the presidency of the General Assembly atits fifty-eight session. We wish him great success in thefulfilment of this difficult and lofty task.The current session is taking place at one of themost troubled times in our era. The recent events in theGulf region were a severe test of the capacity andreadiness of the United Nations to provide appropriateresponses to the challenges presently faced by theinternational community. The impact of these eventssomehow diminished the cohesion of our worldOrganization and weakened trust among its Members.There was a failure in the international security system which puts us in the position of needing immediately tomake it more effective.In fact  the present international security system created after the last great war — despite having todate prevented the outbreak of a new world conflict —has shown signs of an incompatibility in the globalcollective security interests of the Members of theUnited Nations in relation to the new challenges of thismillennium.We are in urgent need of an integrated systemcapable of dealing effectively with the major threats tointernational stability at the outset of this twenty-firstcentury  specifically terrorism and internationalorganized crime; weapons of mass destruction; internalconflicts  which  unfortunately  continue to plague theAfrican continent in particular; generalized poverty;and HIV/AIDS.Terrorism is today the most direct threat to thesecurity of our countries  as can be seen from the attacksthat in the past two years have killed thousands ofcivilians in the United States  Russia  Africa and Asia.With regard to armed conflicts  the situationcontinues to require urgent attention. During the lastdecade  approximately one third of African States wereeither directly or indirectly affected by internal conflicts which resulted in costs as high as $15 billion a year  andcaused hundreds of thousands of deaths  massivedisplacements of people  famine and malnutrition  andthe spread of diseases such as HIV/AIDS.The prevalence of conflicts in Africa is not onlythe result of the divisions inherited from the post-colonial period and the cold war and of ethnic andreligious differences. It is also a consequence of factorssuch as the fragility of national institutions  themarginalization of the African continent from theworld economy  the illegal exploitation of naturalresources and the resulting arms proliferation  and theweak monitoring of national borders. This situationmust be swiftly reversed  since it can endanger thefuture of millions of Africans and increase the risk ofcertain areas of the continent’s becoming truesanctuaries for terrorist organizations.Improving United Nations political institutionsand security systems constitutes the most effectivemethod of addressing the threats facing humankind. Itis therefore necessary to establish new mechanismsoutside of the traditional strategic doctrines. Theinternational legal documents created by the UnitedNations  and the current alliances between States  haveproved insufficient to respond adequately and in aconsensual manner to such threats  particularly when theyare posed by entities that are not themselves States.Because of its universal nature  the UnitedNations plays a central role in the management ofcurrent and future challenges. But that is not enough. Itis crucial that that role be performed within a moredemocratic and participative framework  particularlywith regard to major decisions on international peaceand security.Iraq and other parts of the Middle East are themain hotbeds of tension in the world today  and thecombined efforts of the United Nations are beingfocused on that region. The continued loss of life inIraq — with most of those killed being innocentcivilians  including United Nations officials  amongthem the late Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Sergio Vieira de Mello — is a reminder of theneed for increased support by the internationalcommunity to ensure the security of the Iraqi people the building of new institutions and the beginning ofthe reconstruction of the country.The will of the international community  andcertainly that of the Iraqi people  is for Iraq to become as soon as possible  a viable  democratic State withinstitutions validated by its people  and a country livingin peace with its neighbours.The achievement of this goal implies theestablishment of a political and institutional frameworkin which the United Nations plays an active role specifically in the pacification and unification of thecountry; in the internal political dialogue; in theprocess of national reconciliation; and in theestablishment of new democratic institutions.34Angola hopes that the present convergence ofpositions among the members of the Security Councilon the role of the United Nations in Iraq will facilitatean understanding relative to the transitional process ingeneral and to the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqipeople.Angola deplores the loss of civilian life and thematerial damage caused by the escalation of theconflict in the Middle East. The rekindling of violencebetween Palestinians and Israelis represents thegreatest danger to the implementation of the road mapfor peace  whose ultimate objective is the signing of anagreement for the creation of an independent  viablePalestinian State  living side by side and in peace withIsrael and its other neighbours. In our view  that is theonly solution capable of putting a definite end to thecycle of violence.The end  last year  of the armed conflict inAngola  and the success of the peace process  areamong the most extraordinary political achievementsseen in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. With theattainment of peace in Angola  the Southern Africanregion became  for the first time in several decades  azone free from conflict  and it can now focus its humanand material resources on reconstruction anddevelopment efforts.Angola today is a country in its post-conflictstage. It is committed to the tasks of overcoming theheavy burden of a 40-year conflict  focusing on thestrengthening of its democratic process — which evenduring the difficult war period was never abandoned bythe Government — and fully resuming its legitimaterole within the regional and international context.As a result of the impact of the conflict on thehuman  economic  social and financial structures of thecountry  and given the inequities inherited from ourcolonial past  the current post-conflict stage — whichwill lead to the building of a new society in Angola —is a difficult and painful one  and this has been anobvious impediment to an immediate response to thelegitimate aspirations of Angolan citizens.The challenges that confront Angola are enormous— perhaps immeasurable. The main challenges includethe resettlement of more than 4 million displacedpersons and 450 000 refugees; the social reintegrationof more than 80 000 former military personnel andtheir respective families; the resolution of the problemof absolute poverty  which now afflicts more than halfof the Angolan population; and the reconstruction ofthe social and economic infrastructure.At the same time  in spite of the scarcity ofavailable resources  we are creating the necessaryconditions to hold elections in the near future. Despiteour numerous problems and challenges  there is hardlyany assistance from the international community forAngola  as compared with other countries in similarcircumstances  some of which received an immediateresponse to their appeals  even though they lacked dejure institutions. We would like to believe that suchtreatment is not the result of any form of discriminationagainst our country.There is no example in modern history of a State rich or poor  that  in the aftermath of a devastating anddestructive war such as that which afflicted Angola has managed to overcome the burden left by such a warand rise again without outside assistance. In Angola this reconstruction effort has  up to now  been bornesolely by the Angolans themselves  in spite of thereiterated promises that the only factor that hinderedthe supply of aid to our reconstruction was thepacification of our country.We hereby renew  therefore  our appeal to theinternational community to help Angola in its domesticreconstruction effort. To this end  my delegation willsubmit a draft resolution on international assistanceand the reconstruction and economic development ofAngola  which proposes that an international donorconference be convened. We are counting on thesupport of the Assembly.Angola also welcomes the progress made in thearea of peace and security in other regions of thecontinent  especially the Democratic Republic ofCongo. The role of Angola  as well as that of itspartners  was crucial in preventing a situation of chaosand disintegration in the territory of that brotherlycountry  with which we share a long border  and inconvincing the parties to give up war and chooseinstead a negotiated political solution.The Congolese patriots have shown signs of greatmaturity in guaranteeing the success of the peace processand the transformation of the Democratic Republic of theCongo into a viable country that does not constitute athreat to the stability of its border regions.Angola will continue to be open to strengtheningthe traditional relations of friendship and cooperation it35has maintained with the authorities of the interimGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as with future authorities that are legitimatelyelected by popular vote.There is still a stalemate with regard to thesituation in the Western Sahara. Difficulties regardingthe holding of a referendum on the self-determinationof the territory are a hindrance to the search for adefinitive solution to this question. Angola urges theparties involved to show flexibility and seek a politicalsolution that enables the people of that territory todecide freely about their own destiny.Today  as one part of the world  particularly theindustrialized countries  enjoys considerable wealth  40per cent of the 600 million Africans continue to surviveon less than one dollar a day. In fact  Africa continuesto show the lowest social and economic developmentindicators  and those levels are becoming even worse  dueto the marginalization of the African countries in theprogress of globalization and within the world economy where trade and capital share are only 1 per cent.Africa is also the continent that benefits the leastin terms of foreign direct investment  receiving only 7per cent of the investment targeted at the developingcountries. External debt has been a huge obstacle to thedevelopment process because repayment of the debtservice alone has depleted the already-limited nationalresources of the African States. Angola supports thecancellation of the external debt service of the leastdeveloped countries  particularly those in the Africancontinent.The macroeconomic measures imposed by theBretton Woods institutions within the framework of thestructural adjustment programme have not always beenable to help the African continent overcome itsinternational economic problems. In many cases  thathas led to controversial results. Based on such results experience has shown that  in fact  the financialinstitutions very often do not take into account theidiosyncrasies of each country and frequently put theGovernments in the position of choosing betweenmeeting the conditions imposed by the financialinstitutions or meeting the real needs of their people.Angola hopes that  with the establishment of theAfrican Union and the launching of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development  the tragicsituation in which the African continent finds itselftoday can be alleviated by setting priorities and givingspecial attention to immediate economic developmentissues."
"3",119,"ALB",58,2003,"﻿At the outset  allowme to congratulate you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession. I am fully convinced that  under yourleadership  the proceedings of this session will becrowned with success.It is only right that  in addressing the presentaudience  my first thought should go to Mr. SergioVieira de Mello  the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General to Iraq. Fromthis rostrum  I wish to pay homage to his activity andcontribution and to express profound sadness over theloss of his and other human lives in the cruel terroristattack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad.This session is convening at the end of a year fullof challenges and achievements for the internationalcommunity  and certainly for the United Nations. Webelieve that the United Nations has identified themaintenance of peace  security and international stabilityand the protection of human rights as the fundamentalobjectives of its activity. This is best reflected in theMillennium Declaration  which outlines the commonvision for building a better world without conflict orpoverty. We share the opinion of Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan that the major changes that occurred acrossthe world following the events of 11 September 2003 the phenomenon of international terrorism and the warsin Afghanistan and Iraq have emphasized the need toaddress the major challenges of our times from a newperspective and  in this context  to further improve theperformance of the United Nations structures.In this spirit  Albania did not hesitate to join theUnited States-led coalition against international terrorism.Albania has signed 12 international conventions andprotocols in the war against terrorism. It is workingclosely with its neighbours  other countries at large andinternational bodies with a view to eradicating thepotential sources of various forms of terrorism.We underscore the need for vigilance coordination and reaction in the face of the threatscurrently posed by weapons of mass destruction. Theseweapons   be they chemical  biological or nuclear  are even more dangerous in the hands of terrorists. Atthe same time  we are actively participating in thepeacekeeping missions in Afghanistan and Iraq  as well2 as in Bosnia and Georgia  as a demonstration of ourwill and commitment to the war on terror and to effortsto secure peace and security. We consider that deep-rooted democratic changes are important for bothAfghanistan and Iraq. It is our conviction that theability to live in freedom  despite the difficulties oftransition  marks a point of no return on the journeyaway from dictatorship and from the terror thatthreatens others as well.Albanian politics and society have adopted aunified approach towards Euro-Atlantic integration which is one of our major priorities. Consistent withour vital interests  the integration process has allpopular support. We regard this not merely as amechanical affiliation to the European Union and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  but asadherence to the standards and values of freedom democracy and the free market. Given the brief periodsince the onset of these changes and the negative heritageof the past  we must recognize that Albania has madeimportant and substantial achievements on the road ofdemocracy  but this is no reason for complacency.We are aware that it will take far greater effort tomove the initiated reforms forward  especially in therealm of the judiciary  the economy and the fightagainst crime and corruption  the latter having afflictedpost-communist societies in general. We are already inthe process of negotiation on the Stabilization andAssociation Agreement with the European Union. TheThessaloniki summit once again confirmed the open-door policy to be pursued towards Albania and theother four countries of the Western Balkans.Significant positive steps have also been takenconcerning the NATO membership process  specificallyfollowing the Prague summit. The commitment ofAlbania  Croatia and Macedonia under the Adriatic 3Charter will bring them closer to membershipstandards. We maintain that our convergence towardsthe standards of NATO and the European Union todayand our full-fledged membership tomorrow will benefitthe countries of our region  just as it will benefitEurope itself and overall peace and security.Albania considers regional cooperation to be aprerequisite and encouragement for Euro-Atlanticintegration. We believe that the pursuit of dialogue  aswell as enhanced cooperation and understandingamong the Balkan countries  deeply reflect theaspirations of our citizens and impart a fresh impulse tothe integrating processes. The Balkans  which not longago were known as a source of conflicts and crises now reveal a different picture that has changed in apositive way  with a significantly moderated politicalclimate prevailing in the area. The region of formernationalistic clashes has turned into an area in whichthe culture of dialogue and good understanding isputting down roots. Although the supporters of thedivisive and tragic past are still active in politics overall the new political class in the Balkans is lookingforward to the future and cooperation.Albania and the Albanians are playing an activerole in building and strengthening this new spirit. Wewant and are working to ensure that we establishfriendly relations of cooperation with all the countriesin the region  so that we can move ahead towards ourcommon European future. The investment our countriesare making in a Euro-Atlantic future is one of theprincipal guarantees that the region will free itself fromthe bitter past and join the democratic flow of our times.Albania and the Balkans attach specialimportance to the enhancement of stability and thereinforcement of democracy in the areas formerlyknown as hotbeds. We appreciate the democratic andintegrating developments in Kosovo  which do credit tothe contribution of the United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo and the formerSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General Mr. Steiner. We support the new mission under theleadership of Mr. Holkeri and admire the performanceof society and institutions in Kosovo towards buildinga democratic model of coexistence among its citizens.Stability in Kosovo is very important for stabilityin the region. That is why we have consistentlybolstered the reforms and the achievements made withregard to the establishment and strengthening of thedemocratic institutions there. We have denounced actsof violence and have encouraged every initiative thathelps to ensure respect for the norms of a democraticsociety  enforce the rule of law  promote a sustainedand developed market economy  build democraticinstitutions  maintain inter-ethnic harmony andfacilitate the return of displaced persons.Albania has urged and supported the efforts tostart a dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade onmutually beneficial technical issues. We claim that thepursuit of dialogue is the best way to address problemsand to create the necessary trust. Albania is of theopinion that the future of Kosovo  and hence its final3 status  is an issue that ought to be decided at a laterstage  which should not be postponed indefinitely.It is already widely recognized that this statuswill be determined through the will of the citizens ofKosovo in cooperation with the internationalcommunity. Compliance with the required standardsand determination of status are closely related andinterdependent issues. The standards ensure the normalfunctioning of the local institutions  while the statusbrings about stability  peace and development inKosovo and the region.The positive developments in Macedonia alsogive rise to hope for the achievement of lastingstability. We maintain  however  that the integralimplementation of the Ohrid Agreement without delayis of crucial importance to the future of Macedonia.Albania denounces the extremists on all sides andabides by the spirit of tolerance and inter-ethniccoexistence.The Republic of Albania supports the plans andinitiatives aimed at providing a comprehensive andlasting solution to the situation in the Middle East. Inthat context  we consider the road map to be the waytowards the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinianconflict. Before reaching that settlement  however violence and terrorist acts should be renounced forever.Dialogue and the spirit of agreement should bepromoted until an enforceable final solution is found.We believe that peace in the Middle East is animportant pillar for peace and security the world over.The settlement of the Palestinian issue is essential forthe resolution of the crisis in the Middle East and acore element for success in the fight against terrorism.The Albanian State values and believes in aneven greater role of the United Nations in thestrengthening of peace  security and economic andsocial development throughout the world. Albaniasupports reform to make the United Nations an everstronger organization  capable of coping with thechallenges of the present and providing timelysolutions to issues of concern to all its Members. Inthat respect  we welcome the objectives the Secretary-General has set for the reform of the Organization as awhole and for its specific organs  including the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council.In conclusion  allow me to reaffirm Albania'scommitment to fulfilling its obligations stemming fromthe decisions to be taken during the present session ofthe General Assembly of the United Nations."
"4",142,"AND",58,2003,"﻿During thepast two years  the attacks of 11 September 2001 andthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  as well as in Africa have brought turmoil to the world.The United Nations has never been morenecessary  yet perhaps never has its efficacy been soquestioned nor  until the bombings last month inBaghdad  have its people been the object of suchmassive direct attack.In the Principality of Andorra  encircled by thehigh mountains of the Pyrenees  we have livedpeacefully and democratically between our neighboursfor over 700 years. Since 1419  our Parliament has metto debate the problems of our people. It was not onlyour small size and isolation that kept us apart from thewars that ravaged Europe; rather  our desire forindependence  the unity of our people  and also our abilityto get along with our powerful neighbours made Andorraone of the oldest democratic States in the world.In the past half-century  since the founding of theUnited Nations  the world has changed  and Andorrawith it. Less than a century ago it was only possible toreach Andorra by horse. Now roads bring us 12 milliontourists each year. Telephones  computers  satellitesand airplanes bring the world to Andorra and we inturn have reached out to the world. In the time of mygrandparents  Andorrans never travelled far from theirmountains. Now we are world travellers.One of the proud moments in the long history ofour country was the day in 1993 — ten years ago —when we became a Member State of the UnitedNations. We joined with great hopes and all these yearswe have believed in its crucial role  despite the crisesthat may have cooled that belief.The terrorist attack on the United States ofAmerica marked the beginning of a very complex stagein relations among nations and of a difficultequilibrium among different areas of our planet. Theinvasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were both set inmotion by this attack; one had the support of theUnited Nations while the other did not. While there isno point in returning to that debate  two questions mustbe addressed.First  can the United Nations effectively respondto threats to world stability? Secondly  to what degreewill its Member States be willing to work within theframework of the United Nations? Perhaps a cooling ofpassions will enable us to address these difficult issuesclearly.We are all too aware of the difficulties anddangers that beset both the citizens of these countriesand the troops of Member States who are working tobring stability to these places. We hope for a rapidsolution to the myriad difficulties involved in endingthe series of sad and painful events that have takenplace within these countries over the past few years.The United Nations has a critical responsibility infostering a constructive outcome for the Afghan andIraqi people and also in resolving tension throughoutthe Middle East. In this regard I wish to express ourconfidence in the United Nations to bring an end to thiscomplex and cruel conflict  a crucial step for thestability of the region and an important matter for thefuture of mankind. The United Nations will know howto find new ways and adequate solutions and will playa leading role in the establishment of new paths.As politicians  we pride ourselves on ourknowledge of the needs of our citizens. We are studentsat the university of the national will. The mostsuccessful among us have cultivated a keen sense ofthe everyday desires  frustrations  and goals that areimportant to our citizens. If we live in a democraticState  and ignore those needs  the voters will quicklylook for others who do not.The United Nations is a different kind ofuniversity. Here the lessons of national self-interestmust give way to an international understanding. Inthis university of the world  our previous studies  bywhich I mean our own political careers  can only helpus in the short term. But what we study together hereare long-term lessons that can ensure the long-termsurvival of the world we share.Although Andorra is small in scale  like manypartners in the United Nations  what we smaller nationshave to contribute is larger than our proportionategeographic scale or the relative size of our population.Indeed  our small size has made us by necessity carefulobservers of the needs of others and our centuries ofindependence have taught us responsibility to our citizensand our neighbours. We have never forgotten the bondsthat link us to the world. Our history has taught us this.Legend has it that Andorra was founded byCharlemagne  who  let us recall  was one of the key18 historical players in the battles between Islam andChristianity. In the thirteenth century  however  it wasthe religious tension between the Count of Foix  whowas a Cathar sympathizer  and the Catholic bishop ofUrgell that led to a balanced agreement resulting in theindependence of Andorra. Andorra came into existencepartly as a buffer State between two powerful lords andbetween two approaches to Christianity: the orthodoxand the Cathar.The Cathars are only a distant memory now  but Iraise this issue here because it points to thebattleground of belief. Whereas the Church oncesummoned councils to struggle over the problems ofheresy  we now gather at the United Nations not toinsist on one form of belief  but to recognize andsustain the common ethical base that unites all beliefs all ideologies  under the unshakeable canopy of the1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.We are now in the twenty-first century and not inthe Middle Ages  but those who then werefundamentalist Christians and who resolved everythingwith anathemas  crusades and exiles have given placeto those who practice other forms of religiousintolerance of different persuasions. It is shameful tosee that  even today  people are being killed or kill inthe name of their God.The work that the United Nations accomplishes therefore  does not simply pay lip service to diversity.We need to advance  in all moral seriousness  an ethicof diversity that goes beyond recognizing the value oftolerance and multiculturalism and strives toimplement shared ethical values in the service of worldunderstanding.In 1278  the strategic importance of Andorra layin its proximity to the border between Catholic Europeand al-Andalus  Islamic Spain. The road that led to thegreat city of Cordoba — where the philosophy ofAristotle was retranslated from Greek and Arabic intoLatin and re-entered the thought of the Christian Westin the renaissance of the twelfth century — passedclose by our country.In the centre of that city  the Muslim rulers builtan astonishing mosque with a forest of columns  madeall the more beautiful by the presence within it of asynagogue. Such was its beauty that it was not destroyedwhen the Christians captured the city  but converted into aCathedral  just as the great basilicas of Constantinoplebecame the great mosques of Istanbul when that cityfell to the Ottoman empire a century later.What if we could learn from the events that havemarked history  making use of the lessons of peacefulcoexistence  avoiding past mistakes and appreciatingthe moments of openness between cultures in previouscenturies?We live in a world of vast contrasts wheretechnological progress  used dangerously or simplywithout precaution  has made life more perilous on aglobal scale. Where once the great plague took years tomake its way across Europe  modern plagues — bethey biological viruses or computer viruses — travelacross the globe in a matter of hours.Pollution and global warming concern us all. Thestrange climactic shifts of recent years  the pollution ofour great oceans and lakes  threaten our environment.Perhaps most dangerously  nuclear weapons threatenthe life of everyone on the planet. All of thesecalamities  present or looming  demand internationalcooperation if we are to survive.It is most sad that some of those who could domost to prevent the degradation of life on Earthcontinue to look in another direction — at the balancesheets of the big companies that contaminate the Earthmost egregiously — and continue to apply an energypolicy based on the uncontrolled exploitation and lowcost of limited resources.We have become a little world. We have becomelike a small country  rather like Andorra  whereeverybody knows everybody else’s business. As webecome smaller  the need to combat poverty andsuffering has become all the more important. Wecannot forget that images from more fortunatecountries are beamed into the lives of people existingin difficult or even life-threatening circumstancesacross the world. No matter that these images may bepropaganda and distortions of the truth — our moderntechnology  the source of so many comforts andadvantages  is also demonstrating the full scale of ourdifferences.We must learn to treat all members of the worldas we would like to see our own citizens treated. Weneed to insist on a decent life for everyone  for allmankind.19 Andorra is committed to aiding developmentaround the world. Since 1995  we have regularlyincreased our budgetary contributions and hope todevote 0.7 per cent of our budget to third-world aidwithin two years. Our philosophy of developmentsupports the institutions of the United Nations  lookingto small-scale solutions that foster self-reliance andlocal initiative. We are particularly enthusiastic aboutprojects aimed at children  education and those whohelp women to establish their own businesses. We arealso committed to encouraging sustainable farmingbecause we recognize that proper farming practicesprovide the best defence against catastrophic cropfailures. To that end  Andorra also proposes within thenext year to become a member of the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations.The insignificant part of the Andorran budgetdevoted to the purchase of weapons resulted in thecomposer and singer Pete Seeger dedicating a song tous in the 1960s. His verses still echo today  just as theydid when he made a whole generation sing “We shallovercome. We shall live in peace”. Many things havehappened since those days and Andorra no longerallocates so much as $4.50 towards its defence budget.We do not spend a penny.In this diverse and contradictory world  with allthat is squandered on new weapons and old  the wholeof mankind could live decently. We could eliminate alldiseases. Education and culture would be madeavailable to all. Thus  we could end fanaticism and allthose who abuse the ignorance of the people would endup without victims or lackeys.Let us try and make some use of these longdebates and speeches which we applaud withdiplomatic courtesy  often without even hearing them.Too much is at stake for all of us."
"5",187,"ARE",58,2003,"﻿On behalf of the United Arab Emirates  I havethe honour to extend to Mr. Hunte and to his friendlycountry  Saint Lucia  our sincerest congratulations onhis election to the presidency of the General assemblyat its fifty-eighth session.I should also like to thank his predecessor  Mr.Jan Kavan  for his valuable efforts and effectiveleadership of the previous session.On this occasion  I would also like to express ourappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for hiswise leadership and perseverance in his efforts toenhance the role of the United Nations in maintainingpeace  security and sustainable development.Despite our hopes and the great humanitarianexpectations that we entertained with the dawn of thenew millennium  there remain many regional andinternational issues that have not been resolved and area major concern to us all. They represent a seriousthreat to international peace and security  as well as tothe stability  development and prosperity of peoples  allof which depend on respect for and implementation ofthe norms of international laws  and conventions.The regrettable events that our world iswitnessing today are but the natural aftermath of theprevious political era  which was characterized byconflicts  occupation  oppression  injustice  the violationof human rights and wars that led to a wide range ofarm races at the expense of human  economic andenvironmental development. If we are to confront andcontain these challenges and their repercussions  it is17important to reform the United Nations and all its mainbodies — especially the Security Council  the GeneralAssembly and the Economic and Social Council — aswell as to enhance cooperation and coordinationbetween these international organizations and regionalorganizations.Maintaining stability and security in the ArabGulf area is an essential priority  not only for the peoplesof the region  but also for the entire world. Accordingly within the framework of the Gulf Cooperation Counciland of bilateral  regional and international relations  theUnited Arab Emirates has adopted a foreign policybased on peaceful coexistence  confidence-building good-neighbourliness  mutual respect  non-interference inthe internal affairs of others  the settlement of disputesand the ending of occupation by peaceful means.On the basis of its commitment to these doctrinesand the principles of the Charter of the United Nations the United Arab Emirates believes that the way to end theoccupation of its three islands — Greater Tumb  LesserTumb and Abu Moussa — by the Islamic Republic ofIran is by peaceful means that would spare the regionfrom the atrocities of warfare from which its peoplehave suffered for the past three decades. Therefore  theUnited Arab Emirates reiterates its call on the IslamicRepublic of Iran to reconsider its position and torespond to the peaceful initiative that we announced afew years ago  which calls on both countries to engagein serious bilateral negotiations or to resort to theInternational Court of Justice  as has been done in otherbilateral issues that have been settled in accordancewith the principles of the Charter of the United Nationsand the provisions of international law.The question of the three occupied islands  whichbelong to the United Arab Emirates  has been on theagenda of the Security Council since their occupationby Iran in 1971. In this regard  we reaffirm thecomplete sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates overGreater Tumb  Lesser Tumb and Abu Moussa and ontheir regional air space and waters  the continentalshelf and the economic zone of the three islands  whichare considered an indivisible part of the regionalsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates. The UnitedArab Emirates calls on the Iranian Government toaddress this sensitive and important issue in a positivespirit in order to end the occupation. We hope that thecurrent bilateral communications and meetingsbetween the United Arab Emirates and the IslamicRepublic of Iran will lead to a solution that will cementtheir good-neighbourly relations  enhance cooperationand mutual interests between the two countries  andstrengthen the foundations of security  stability andprosperity in this important region.Since the last session of the General Assembly the world has witnessed many changes in the politicaland security fields that have had a strong impact on ourinternational relations  especially those related to peaceand security in the Arab Gulf region. This has hadconsequences and repercussions that may underminethe foundations of peace  stability and development inthe area and the world.The United Arab Emirates  which is deeplyconcerned about the continued suffering of thebrotherly Iraqi people and the deterioration of theirhumanitarian  security  social  economic andenvironmental conditions  reaffirms that the restorationof security and stability in Iraq and the country’s returnto the international community will not be achievedwithout the collective efforts of the regional andinternational community to help the Iraqi peoplereform their constitutional and developmentalinstitutions and to enable them to manage their internalaffairs and external relations with their neighbours andother countries so that they can play their responsibleand historic role in the region.We therefore reiterate our expression of welcomeand support for the efforts made by the provisionalIraqi Governing Council and the interim IraqiAdministration. We hope that the United Nations willplay an increasingly important role in resolving thesituation in Iraq; in its reconstruction; in maintainingits territorial integrity  unity and the right of its peopleto self-determination; in the election of itsGovernment; in its political future; and in theexploitation of its natural resources.The United Arab Emirates has been closelyfollowing the dangerous developments in the occupiedPalestinian territories. We condemn the policies oftargeted killings and closure being carried out by Israel  inviolation of all relevant international and humanitarianlaws. We therefore call upon the Quartet and on otherinfluential countries to revitalize the peace process andto compel Israel to implement the road map  whichstipulates an end to the Israeli occupation and theestablishment of a Palestinian State by 2005. The roadmap also calls on Israel to refrain from building illegalsettlements and to ensure the return of the refugees.18We demand that Israel cease placing obstacles inthe way of the implementation of the road map —obstacles such as the killing and destructionperpetrated by Israeli occupying forces againstPalestinians and their property in the West Bank andthe Gaza Strip. We also demand that Israel lift theunjust siege on President Yasser Arafat and thePalestinian people  dismantle the separation fence andrelease Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.A fair  lasting and comprehensive settlement ofthe Middle East conflict requires a commitment byIsrael to adhere to international resolutions  which arebased on the principle of land for peace; the Arabpeace initiative  endorsed by the Beirut Summit including the Syrian and Lebanese tracks; and Israeliwithdrawal from all Palestinian and Arab landsoccupied since 1967  including Al-Quds Al-Sharif  theSyrian Golan and the Lebanese Shaba’a Farms area.The Middle East region  including the Arab Gulf must be freed of all weapons of mass destruction  andIsrael must join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and subject its nuclear facilities tothe safeguards of the International Atomic EnergyAgency  pursuant to relevant United Nations resolutions.The United Arab Emirates condemns all formsand manifestations of terrorism. We call for themustering of national  regional and international effortsto combat and eradicate such a dangerous phenomenon because it is exploited by radicals and outlaws asmeans to achieve their destructive goals.In this respect  we express our deepest sorrowfollowing the criminal attack perpetrated against theUnited Nations headquarters  as well as against theJordanian Embassy in Baghdad and against the ImamAli mosque in Najaf  which resulted in the killing ofImam Mohammed Baqer Alhakeem and a number ofinnocent victims. We stand shoulder to shoulder withthose countries that have been the targets of terroristcriminal attacks  in particular our brothers in theKingdom of Saudi Arabia. We express our support forall the measures taken by Saudi Arabia to eradicatethese terrorist activities.In the meantime  we call on the internationalcommunity to convene an international conference totackle terrorism and eradicate its causes and tools. Wealso reaffirm the importance of respect for humanrights  transparency and openness based on mutualrespect of the cultural heritage and the beliefs ofpeoples  so as to avoid creating a fertile breeding groundfor frustration and hatred from which the terrorists derivetheir raison d’être and their motivation.Despite the numerous international conferences particularly the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment and the International Conference onFinancing for Development  aimed at tackling theimbalance in international economic relations and itseffect on international economic development  themajority of the world’s people continue to live inunstable and inhuman conditions  characterized byincreased poverty  the spread of disease and illiteracy because of the increasing economic gap betweendeveloped and developing countries. Developedcountries must commit to implementing the pledgesthey made according to international resolutions.From this perspective  the United Arab Emiratescalls on the international community to fulfil itscommitment to providing development assistance to poorcountries  in particular the least developed countries.International financial and development institutions aswell as the private sector should plan strategies gearedtowards providing financial and development resources inorder to implement economic development programmesin developing and poor countries  all within anenvironmentally friendly framework  ensuring access bysuch countries to new technologies  in order toalleviate the external debt burden and remove tariffs oninternational trade  which would benefit all countries ofthe world.On this occasion  I cannot fail to point out theconfidence placed in the United Arab Emirates by theinternational community through its hosting of theannual meeting of the heads of the InternationalMonetary Fund and of the World Bank in the Emirateof Dubai  a meeting that concluded its work on 24September. We are very satisfied with the outcome ofthat meeting  particularly the special attention itfocused on the question of development andcooperation for the purpose of alleviating the impact ofpoverty and debt burdens around the world.In conclusion  the grave challenges facing theinternational community today bolster our convictionmore than ever of the importance of adhering to theprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and ofinternational law  as our point of reference in resolvingregional and international disputes and differences.19We express the hope that the meetings anddebates held during this session of the GeneralAssembly will succeed in strengthening the role of theUnited Nations as a multilateral Organization and inthe maintenance of international peace and security."
"6",234,"ARG",58,2003,"﻿At theoutset  allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to preside over the Assembly at this session. Iwould also like to congratulate the outgoing President Mr. Jan Kavan  for his work at the head of thisAssembly at the previous session.On behalf of my Government  we would also liketo reiterate our gratitude for the efforts of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  to promote peaceand multilateralism  and to express our solidarity inwake of the criminal attack that claimed the lives ofseveral staff members of this Organization.We have come from the world’s South to theGeneral Assembly with a firm belief that revitalizingthis global representative forum is essential forinternational law to become once again a rationalinstrument for resolving conflicts and facing threats.Restoring the major political role that the Assemblyplayed in the early days of the United Nations is key tostrengthening security for all citizens of the world.Indeed  multilateralism is the cornerstone of thisOrganization. But the cold war and bipolarity thatcharacterized the world after the Yalta Conference untilthe fall of the Berlin Wall undoubtedly shaped theinstruments and legislation that were adopted withinthat framework.Any objective look at the international situationthat that goes beyond the particular biases of individualMembers of the Organization will reveal anotherhallmark of the world today: the technological  militaryand economic supremacy of one country over all therest. We therefore consider it necessary to reaffirm ourdetermined support for the purposes and principles thatunderpin the United Nations  so that it can activelywork to promote peace and the social and economicdevelopment of humanity.But  it bears repeating  we must not limit ourcommitment to multilateralism to words alone.Promoting multilateralism requires a dual strategy.First  an open mind is needed to objectively grasp thefull extent of the new state of affairs. Secondly  weneed to reconsider the instruments and rules so to copewith this new reality just as was done during the era ofbipolar politics in order to save the world fromdestruction. Multilateralism and security are inseparablebut are not the only factors in this new equation.The world is changing against the backdrop of aglobalization that is creating unprecedentedopportunities and risks. The greatest risk is thewidening gap between the rich and poor. To divide theworld into central and marginal countries is not merelyan academic exercise or a matter of ideology. Quite thecontrary  such definitions reflect a grim reality ofunprecedented poverty and social exclusion. Ourpriority must be to ensure that globalization works forall  and not just for the few. Promoting thedevelopment of the marginalized countries is no longersimply a matter of social conscience on the part of thecentral countries. It has an impact on their situation andsecurity. Hunger  illiteracy  exclusion and ignorance aresome of the basic elements that fuel the spread ofinternational terrorism and cause violent and massivenational migration flows  which have cultural  socialand economic consequences. They also inevitablythreaten the security of the central countries.Economic integration and politicalmultilateralism hold the key to safer future world. Weneed to build global institutions and effectivepartnerships within the framework of fair and opentrade and to bolster support for the development ofthose most in need. If we are to promote collectivesecurity intelligently  we must understand that securityis not just a military issue; it depends on political economic  social and cultural factors as well. These arethe key challenges on the current international agendathat the main actors must meet.In this framework  the relations betweencountries like ours and others in the international8 community are affected by a huge and crushing burdenof debt owed to multilateral financial institutions andprivate creditors. We accept our share of responsibilityfor having adopted policies that caused thisindebtedness. But we also call on the internationalfinancial institutions — which contributed to encouraged and promoted the growth of that debt bydictating their terms — to accept their own share ofresponsibility. It goes without saying that when debtgrows to such an extent  not only the debtor but alsothe creditor bears responsibility. It is thereforenecessary to acknowledge the tangible  verifiable andrather obvious fact that repaying such a debt entailsgreat hardships.Without specific international assistance toenable indebted countries to restore economic solvencyand thereby their ability to repay debts and withoutmeasures to foster their growth and their sustainabledevelopment by taking concrete steps to promote theirmarket access and growth of exports  debt repaymentremains a pipedream. Promoting exports of finishedproducts based on the natural resources that mostindebted countries have can lay the foundations forsustainable development  without which creditors willhave to face their losses without any other realisticoptions.No one is known to have succeeded in gettingtheir money back from the dead. To reach the objectiveof making a country viable so it can pay its debts intensified multilateral negotiations are greatly neededto eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers that hinderaccess of our exports to the markets of the developedcountries  which have the largest purchasing capacity.Indeed  there continue to be export and productionsubsidies in the international trade in food products —Argentina’s main export item — as well as tariffs unjustified sanitary measures and trade restrictions thatdistort the terms of trade in commodities and seriouslyhamper market access for finished products.The failure of the World Trade Organizationnegotiations in Cancún should serve as a wake-up callto us in this regard and should be remedied by makingthe greatly sought-after link between businessopportunities in international trade and the growth ofindebted countries and their debt-repayment capacity. Itis paradoxical and even ridiculous that we should becalled upon to repay our debt while we are beingprevented from trading and selling our products.On the other hand  although it is true that theobjectives of the multilateral institutions  such as theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)  include shorteningthe duration and lessening the imbalance of paymentsof member countries and instilling confidence bygiving them opportunities for readjustment  withouttaking measures that undermine national orinternational prosperity  it is also necessary to redesignthose multilateral institutions. Redesigning multilaterallending agencies should include changing the modelsso that the success or failure of economic policies ismeasured in terms of success or failure in the fight fordevelopment  equitable distribution  the fight againstpoverty and maintaining adequate levels of employment.This new millennium should banish adjustmentmodels in which the prosperity of some is based on thepoverty of others. The dawn of the twenty-first centuryshould mean the end of an age and the beginning of anew collaboration among creditors and debtors.In a nutshell  it is essential to take note of theclose connection that exists between security multilateralism and economics.The defence of human rights occupies a centralplace in the new agenda of the Argentine Republic. Weare the children of the mothers and grandmothers of thePlaza de Mayo  and we therefore insist on permanentlysupporting the strengthening of the system for theprotection of human rights and the trial and convictionof those who violate them. All of this is based on theoverarching view that respect for persons and theirdignity arises out of principles preceding thedevelopment of law  whose origins can be traced to thebeginnings of human history. Respecting diversity andpluralism and relentlessly fighting impunity have beenunwavering principles of our country ever since thetragedy of recent decades.We strongly advocate a peaceful settlement ofinternational disputes  particularly in a matter as dearto our feelings and interests as our sovereignty disputewith regard to the Malvinas  South Georgia and the SouthSandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.The United Nations has recognized that this is acolonial situation maintained by the United Kingdomand that it must be settled through bilateralnegotiations between the Argentine Republic and the9 United Kingdom. We value the role of the UnitedNations Special Committee on Decolonization andexpress our fullest willingness to negotiate in order toconclusively settle this longstanding dispute  a steadyobjective of the Argentina Republic. We urge theUnited Kingdom to agree to resume bilateralnegotiations to resolve this major issue.Also with reference to the Southern regions  weundertake to protect the interests of the internationalcommunity in Antarctica  ensuring that the activitiescarried out there are consistent with the AntarcticTreaty and its 1991 Madrid Protocol on EnvironmentalProtection. We shall take steps at the relevant forumsfor the installation of the authorities and the operationof the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat at its designatedseat  Buenos Aires.We express our support and wish for a stable andlasting peace in the Middle East based on theinalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and an independent and viable State while at the same time recognizing the right of Israel tolive at peace with its neighbours within safe andinternationally recognized borders.We have spoken of progress and collectivesecurity as the global challenges of today. We havehighlighted the close link that exists between economicproblems and security. We firmly condemn all terroristactions. We know what we are talking about. In 1992and 1994 we suffered  first hand  our own TwinTowers. The attacks on the Israeli Embassy and theAMIA Jewish Community Center took the lives of over100 of our compatriots. We can bear witness to theneed to fight effectively against the new threats posedby international terrorism.The vulnerability of all countries in theinternational community to this scourge can be reducedonly through intelligent  concerted and multilateralaction sustained over time. The fight against terrorismrequires a new rationality. We face an enemy whoselogic is to trigger reactions symmetrical to its actions.The worse  the better  is the favoured scenario  and thatlogic partly accounts for the increasingly spectacular— almost cinematographic — nature of its operations.Legitimate responses and the support of internationalpublic opinion are both fundamental to confrontingthose new forms of violence.This view places the problem of internationalterrorism in a dimension that goes beyond a unilateralor military solution. On the contrary  merelyresponding through the use of force  howeverimpressive such force may be or appear to be  in manycases ends with the perpetrators being presented asvictims. This closes in a perfect circle the perverselogic to which we have been referring.As we see  in view of the complexity of thesituation  it is no longer useful to take shelter in oldalignments  anachronistic ways of thinking or outdatedstructures. The new challenges call for different andcreative solutions so as not to be left behind by changesin the world in the technological  economic  social andundoubtedly even cultural fields.Let us rise to the challenge of thinking anew for anew world. To combine different ideas and createpractical means to put them into practice in the serviceof the people we represent is our duty."
"7",259,"ARM",58,2003,"﻿We thank Jan Kavanfor his work  and we welcome Mr. Julian Hunte in thedifficult year that awaits him.At the beginning of this millennium  a summit ofthe world's leaders produced a set of developmentgoals aimed at protecting life and promoting dignity forall peoples. This seemed an appropriate way to beginthe third millennium of our modern era.Each year since then  however  we have beenreminded that this millennium started very differentlyand has forced us to address profound challenges to ourassumptions  our relationships and our way of life.Beginning with 11 September and continuing with theviolence and political crises around the world  each ofour societies  nations and regions has been transformedby the intensity of these threats to our way of life andto our security.These crises are forcing a transformation of thisOrganization as well. Today  reform has becomeessential not just in the way we decide  act and operate but in the way we think. Reforms cannot be delayed ifthis General Assembly and this Organization are to betruly relevant as facilitators of world peace. If theUnited Nations is for the peaceful  prosperous anddemocratic development of today's world  then it mustundergo its own democratization  so that it will havethe increased moral authority to direct others throughreform and democratic transition.An organization that espouses dialogue andnegotiation as alternatives to violence and conflictought to find ways through dialogue and negotiation toarrive at a consensus on how to resolve the critical universal issues facing us today.This General Assembly has the chance to godown in history  not as an undermined  inadequate butwell-meaning giant  but as a viable instrument of worldpeace. The Secretary-General's goals  from UnitedNations budget and financing reform to reconstitutingand enlarging the Security Council  are the buildingblocks of the relevant  responsive  comprehending world forum for international cooperation that theUnited Nations can be. We applaud his decision toempower a commission to give concrete form to thewishes of many.Each year we speak of the need for acomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East never believing that next year  the region can becomeeven more volatile and explosive. We believe theUnited Nations and all Member States must continue tosupport the renewal of the full-scale peace process. InIsrael and Palestine  Armenia hails the Quartet'sefforts  recognizing that the endangered road mapremains the only viable option for peace in a long-suffering region.The situation in Iraq makes the debate about thehows and whys of this conflict irrelevant. The world'ssmall countries are accustomed to making politicalcompromises to join the international flow. In Iraq  theprincipal Powers  too  must compromise so that a moreengaged and empowered United Nations can rally abroad range of countries from the immediate region  aswell as the rest of the world  to take on responsibilityin bringing democracy and stability to a critical part ofthe Middle East.It is ironic and in many ways lamentable that theevil of terrorism is what has caused us to rally together.We are fully aware that no single Government caneffectively fight this danger alone. Unfortunately  thenecessity for coherent measures and cooperation atnational  regional and international levels is oftenstalled  as for example in our region  where a commonthreat that knows no borders is not only beingaddressed individually and in isolation  but alsoexploited for political reasons.In our region  there is much political exploitation.The new Prime Minister of Azerbaijan made plain fromthis podium yesterday that in his Government'selection year  they are willing  at their peril  to ignorethe realities which are self-evident. Nearly a decade ofnegotiations brought us  two years ago  to Key West Florida  where  hosted by the United States31 Government and under the watchful eyes of the MinskGroup Co-Chairmen  the President of Armenia and  whether the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan likes it or not  the President of Azerbaijan did in fact reach anunderstanding which reflected those realities.There are two myths in Azerbaijan today   bothof them faulty  miscalculated and risky. Since 1992 Azerbaijan has convinced itself that if they just holdout long enough  Armenia's economy will capitulate and leave Nagorny Karabakh unprotected anddefenceless. Their calculations that a blockade ofArmenia would mean that our economic and socialconditions will plummet while their oil-based economygrows have proven misguided and misinformed. Notonly has Armenia's economy not succumbed topolitical pressures  but our rate of growth is greaterthan Azerbaijan's   and not only Azerbaijan's.Nevertheless  they continue to cling to a secondand related myth. Dreaming of future oil sales whoserevenues will be used to buy armaments  Azerbaijan isanticipating the day when it will again have theresources to pursue a military solution. This is self-deception  as well. Azerbaijan has forgotten thatsimilar fantasies led them to respond militarily to thepeaceful demands of Nagorny Karabakh's populationfor self-determination in 1992. The military balancewas hugely in their favour then  in proportions fargreater than what they might hope for in the future.Still  the moral  historical  legal and psychologicalbalance favoured the people of Nagorny Karabakh who were fighting for their homes  their families  theirsecurity  their lives and their futures. The armaments ofAzerbaijan did not then   and cannot ever   breakthe will of the people of Nagorny Karabakh to livefreely on their own land.Indeed  Azerbaijanis are victims  but of their ownaggression. They started the war  one-sidedly. They beganmassacring Armenians  citizens of the Azerbaijani citiesof Sumgait  Baku and Ganja   the most irresponsiblereaction that a Government can undertake  using themost inhuman methods associated with pogroms.The war that followed changed the world for twogenerations of Armenians  who have never lived underAzerbaijani rule. Azerbaijan's leadership  old and new rather than remaining prisoners to the Soviet era   whichthey themselves rejected as historically illegitimate   canlook to a future of compromise  peace  regionalcooperation and prosperous  stable development.Armenia intends to go forward. Indeed  wealready have. The year 2003 has been a very good yearfor Armenia. On the economic front  our steady double-digit growth rate is the fastest in theCommonwealth of Independent States and in Europe.This has led some to call Armenia the Caucasian tiger.We are pleased with the name and the challenge. Weknow that with economic growth comes an evengreater responsibility: to confront the social gaps whichcan lead to social inequality and domestic instability.The shortest path to the eradication of transitional illssuch as the polarization of society  the urban-rural gapand uneven access to higher education is to sustain thathigh level of economic growth.That is why  with the help of the United NationsDevelopment Programme  we embarked on thesustainable economic development programme. That iswhy the Government has approved and launched apoverty reduction strategy. It is also why achieving theMillennium Development Goals for poverty eradication the awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS and theempowerment of women is an important part ofArmenia's development strategy.In Armenia  the United Nations plays a key rolein promoting synergies directed at expanding thedevelopment impact of information andcommunications technologies. As we prepare for theWorld Summit on the Information Society in Decemberin Geneva  Armenia is living a hopeful paradox. On theone hand  less than half of our more than one thousandschools are connected to the Internet; on the otherhand  information and communications technologies(ICTs) comprise a significant proportion of Armenia'sexports today. Still  too many in our country   justlike the majority of the world population   still remainuntouched by the ICT revolution and its potential.We recognize  of course  that ICTs can be centralin economies like ours  especially given the continuingblockade. Our economic growth has continued despitethe blockade  which goes against the spirit and theconclusions of the recent United Nations sponsoredInternational Ministerial Conference on TransitTransport Cooperation  which reaffirmed the right ofaccess by landlocked countries to and from the sea andtheir freedom of transit through the territory of theirneighbours by all means of transport  in accordancewith the applicable rules of international law. For us that means a condemnation of the practice of unilateral32 coercive economic measures intended as politicalpressure.This was also a good year for our legislativereform process. The Armenian parliament has ratifiedthe Sixth Protocol of the European Convention for theProtection of Human Rights and FundamentalFreedoms  thus unconditionally abolishing the deathpenalty. We also adopted the draft law on theombudsman  thus empowering our citizens andinvesting them with the faith necessary to govern withjustice and to be governed with dignity.Another matter that is important for us and for allhumanity: Armenia continues to engage countries andGovernments around the world to recognize andcondemn the first genocide of the twentieth century.The survivors of the genocide and their descendants arehelping to build a democratic Armenia  committed tothe future without forgetting the past.When Sergio Vieira de Mello visited Armeniaseveral years ago  he came looking for ways tominimize the pain and suffering of Armenian refugeesforced to flee their homes in Baku and Sumgait inAzerbaijan. This year  as he worked to minimize thepain and suffering of the people of Iraq  to help themrebuild their country and their Government  he and toomany of his colleagues lost their lives. His death andthat of Anna Lindh of Sweden remind us that ideas more than people  scare and threaten. Those two brutalmurders also suggest to us louder than anydemonstration that the leadership of the world still hasmuch to do in engaging the rejectionists  the extremistsand the cynical. Our positive  forward-looking determined steps here in the General Assembly will goa long way towards convincing them."
"8",292,"ATG",58,2003,"﻿It gives meprofound pleasure to welcome and congratulateMr. Julian Hunte in regard to the lofty position that henow holds. It was not long ago that he was fightingalongside the ambassadors of the Latin American andCaribbean Group. He represents the smallest countrythat has ever ascended to the presidency  and  for hisCaribbean colleagues  there will be additional rejoicingwhen his photograph appears on the Wall of Presidents.It is my hope that our younger diplomats willendeavour to emulate him and continue to demonstratethe mettle of small island developing States. But let mealso pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  forthe able and skilful manner in which he conducted ourdeliberations during the fifty-seventh session. TheSecretary-General and his staff must also receiveacclaim for their diligence and steadfast work. Wemourn and grieve for the United Nations staff memberskilled and wounded in Baghdad  and  indeed  for allmembers of the staff who have made the ultimatesacrifice in upholding the ideals of the United Nations.We have often repeated statistics on human livingconditions  but it seems to be just a recitation.Nonetheless  in the hope that this year figures maymove those in control to make a meaningful attempt at25remedies  let me join the list of other colleagues whohave recalled the fact that almost half of the world’spopulation subsists on less than $2 a day  and a fifthlives on less than $1 a day. The point to be stressed isthat global inequality has increased. The digital divideis widening  the number of refugees and displacedpersons has grown  and the AIDS crisis is devastatingnumerous societies.What tends to be ignored is what developingcountries have been doing for themselves. In theCaribbean  the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)countries have come to each other’s assistance in timesof crisis  whether there be natural devastation by wayof earthquakes  volcanic eruption  drought or floods.We have used our military forces positively  to rescue to stabilize and to rehabilitate  when suffering thevicissitudes of nature. Strapped as we are in regard tofinances  we have assisted one another in regard to theseverest of economic constraints. If an unbiasedevaluation is made  it will be clear that average gains inhuman development in low- and middle-incomecountries have been substantial and higher than gainsin income. Life expectancy has increased by 59 percent  and illiteracy has been reduced from 39 per centin 1970 to 25 per cent at the turn of the century.Nevertheless  current development trends are notsustainable and are placing extreme pressure on theenvironment and on the impoverished  who bear theoverwhelming brunt of environmental degradation. Ourcoastal systems are threatened  dominant countries arefishing indiscriminately within our exclusive economiczones  and our coral reefs have not only been damagedbut are disappearing. Yet aid has declined as a share ofgross national product  and World Bank researchindicates that  without a doubling of developmentassistance  the endorsed Millennium Goals are unlikelyto be achieved.Development experts appear to have a singlefocus. We fully accept the necessity for marketreforms  but they are insufficient in themselves. Thereis a need for broad social reforms. Equitable incomedistribution and secondary school enrolment have beenfound to be insensitive to growth  while air quality hasbeen negatively correlated to growth. The globalinstitutions continue to listen to their identified expertsand to disregard local experience  whether from theaged and wise or from the young and brilliant.Sustained development requires a significantpercentage of domestic or local ownership.Our religious literature states that continuing alifestyle demands the depositing or planting of seeds from which  in a relatively short period of time  comesnew life and the continuance of organic existence. Withthat in mind  it is imperative that developmentstrategies clearly take into consideration those who willsucceed us  and Antigua and Barbuda  which devotesmuch attention and planning to the advancement of itsyouth  is advocating continued global focus on thisissue in order to ensure a more harmoniousinternational atmosphere than the one in which wecarry out our activities.With that in mind  Caribbean heads of State andGovernment have met with representatives of theWorld Bank and are jointly in the process of  first identifying the risk and protective factors anddeterminants of youth behaviours and development;secondly  demonstrating that the negative behaviours ofyoung people are costly not only to themselves but alsoto society as a whole; and  thirdly  identifying keyintervention points for youth development underscoring identified risk and protective factors.Presently  as a result of this joint thrust  we aretargeting sexual and physical abuse  HIV/AIDS aslinked to misguided values about sexuality  theincidence of rage  youth unemployment  and socialmisconceptions as to the use of alcohol and marijuana.Moving forward requires modernizing the educationalsystem and maximizing the protective effect of schools upgrading public health-care systems  making familiesa top policy issue  and strengthening community andneighbourhood support to adolescents.Antigua and Barbuda believes that  whereas aid issorely needed  its effectiveness will be limited unless alevel playing field is provided in regard to trade andinvestment in developing societies. There cannot bemeaningful progress by talking about the relativesignificance and importance of free trade. We listenand see the dominant countries employ various anddiverse forms of agricultural protectionism  whiletaking away from former colonies of exploitation vitalpreferences needed to keep their products on themarket. Why should globalization be oppressive to thepusillanimous? We have been listening to themodifications of the philosophies of Cobden andBright  but are feeling the yoke of global practices knowing that never in modern history has there everbeen free trade.26The fears of developing countries in regard to thepractices and realities of globalization  as opposed toits often-vaunted philosophy  were manifested atCancún in September of this year. Cancún  we havebeen made to understand  means snake pit in the localMayan language  and our hope is that there will besome meaningful effort to overcome the drawbacks.Developing countries will be hindered from developingthemselves if lip service alone continues to be paid topoverty. The first step in the elimination of poverty isto adequately recognize the multifunctional role ofagriculture. This multifunctional role incorporates foodsafety  animal welfare and the preservation of land.Unfortunately  Cancún proved once again that thedominant countries would continue to exemptthemselves from the rules governing free trade and todomestically provide substantive subsidies to theirfarmers  while denying the former colonies ofexploitation the right to preferences.The year 2004 will mark the tenth anniversary ofthe first United Nations Global Conference on theSustainable Development of Small Island DevelopingStates  which was held in Barbados in 1994. In lookingback at the almost 10 years since that Conference  wehold these following truths to be self evident: In theBarbados Programme’s attention on the uniquecircumstances of small island developing States  thecorresponding actions to address these circumstancesby the international community  has been lacking. Thisis the opportunity presented by the internationalmeeting  to review the implementation of theProgramme of Action that will be held in Mauritius inAugust 2004. It presents us with a second chance toidentify a set of concrete actions which will be neededto further the implementation of the BarbadosProgramme of Action and thereby regain themomentum lost by small island developing States intheir quest for sustainable development. So far we havenot been satisfied that problems relating to the trans-shipment of nuclear waste through our waters  bilgingand fishing indiscriminately in our Exclusive EconomicZones have been given any meaningful consideration.My Government welcomes the entry into force ofthe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Conventionon Biological Diversity  having recently deposited ourinstruments of ratification for both the Protocol and theStockholm Convention on Persistent OrganicPollutants. As a Party to the Kyoto Protocol to theUnited Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange  we wish to lend our support to the call madeby the Foreign Minister of Japan for parties to theClimate Change Convention to maintain theinternational momentum for climate changenegotiations  for the early entry into force of the KyotoProtocol and for the formulation of common rules thatwill facilitate participation by all countries.The Millennium Development Goals constitute anambitious agenda for reducing poverty and improvinglives. The challenge to implement them is enormous. Acase in point is the target of halving by 2015 theproportion of people without access to safe drinkingwater and proper sanitation. To meet this target  theworld will need to connect approximately 200 000people to clean water and 400 000 people to improvedsanitation each day.That will require three things: first  innovativefinancing mechanisms to assure the necessary doublingin financial flows to developing countries for water andsanitation  from current spending of $10 billion eachyear  to about $20 billion a year; secondly  greatlyimproved governance of scarce water resources  builtaround holistic  integrated water resources managementstrategies that encompass priorities from drinking toagriculture and industrial development; and thirdly  aclear focus on building capacity where it is neededmost: working directly with local communities especially women  to help craft and implement theirown solutions. And this is just for water.We see  as the dominant Powers repeat their callfor universal democracy  that the former colonies ofexploitation must remind them that democracy is mostdifficult to achieve among those witnessing the tearsand the conditions of hungry children. Democracystruggles to maintain itself among those who areracked with illnesses and weak from the lack ofadequate nutrition. Democracy is practically a utopianideal  in which there are defined class divisions andinsurmountable social barriers. For democracy to thriveand prosper  all sectors of the society have toparticipate fully with regard to economic growth andan adequate distribution of income. It is  therefore incumbent that society work toward integral  equitableand sustainable social and economic development. InAntigua and Barbuda  in the midst of our trials andtribulations  we have maintained democracy  and it is ahallmark of our existence.27The products of science  technology andinnovation have to be harnessed and designed to addvalue to the real components of development. Wealthmust be generated in order to raise the dignity and theesteem of mankind  and to garner respect for theinternationally recognized fundamental rights andprinciples of labour. Without such  socio-economicdevelopment and  consequently  the full enjoyment ofdemocracy will be held in abeyance.My country is at a loss to fully comprehend whysome of the major countries of this world oppose theInternational Criminal Court (ICC). It is vital to oursecurity and development. The Court represents arevolution in legal and moral attitudes toward some ofthe worst crimes on Earth. Whereas many developingStates have suffered under the yoke of globalization the ICC represents a plus for the globalization process its principles of justice and the rule of law ininternational affairs. The Rome Statute has sufficientchecks and balances to allay all fears  and we remainconvinced that the ICC will be a legitimate judicialinstitution to adequately judge individuals for warcrimes  genocide and crimes against humanity. Wereiterate that this can be done while guaranteeing Statestheir rights  as they are protected from any interferenceby the Court if they pursue the given crimes at thenational level  and that the prosecutor’s autonomouspower is accompanied by guarantees against using theCourt for specious or politically motivated endeavours.The Non-Self-Governing Territories of theCaribbean look to Caribbean members of the SpecialCommittee on Decolonization  more commonly knownas the Special Committee of 24  to give guidance inregard to their constitutional evolution. This year therewas a breakthrough in Anguilla  as the UnitedKingdom agreed to have the regional seminar held inone of the Non-Self-Governing Territories  and for thefirst time the United Nations Secretariat agreed to writedirectly to the local representatives  rather than throughthe representatives of the administering Powers. Butmore importantly  the United Kingdom sent a seniorofficial from the Commonwealth and Overseas Office who was to gain the respect of the seminar participants.The Non-Self-Governing Territories greeted thisdevelopment  and all sent delegations that were vocaland explained that their options had never beenexplained to them. They were eager to remain in touchwith the United Nations Secretariat  and sought to takeadvantage of whatever experiences  educational andotherwise  the United Nations could provide. In anatmosphere of cordiality  the administrating Power andthe non-self-governing territories expressed ways andmeans of promoting development and advancement forthe territories. Quite significantly the non-self-governing territories hailed the new policy of theUnited Kingdom for consultation with the electedofficials of its territories on the appointment ofgovernors.My country would not like to give the impressionthat we are only concerned with development  as thiswould be far from the truth. We are cognizant of otherglobal issues  particularly with reference to peace andsecurity. The images that are constantly before us withreference to Iraq and the Middle East leave usquestioning the brotherhood of mankind. The UnitedNations has to be unified with reference to therehabilitation of Iraq  and the transition of itsadministrative structures into the hands of its nationals.We subsequently give our support for the peaceprocess in the Middle East  based on the respectiveresolutions of both the General Assembly and theSecurity Council. Likewise  we give wholeheartedsupport to the preservation of the role of the UnitedNations and other organizations in working toward thestabilization and security of Afghanistan.In the same vein  we support and encourage theefforts made to resolve the conflicts in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  and the stabilization of peace inparts of West Africa and the Balkans.We continue to press for the revitalization of thedisarmament process  non-proliferation of nuclearweapons and general arms control.These are indeed perilous times  and  when anevent occurs in a distant part of the globe that candrastically affect us domestically  total disregard of theneed for tolerance will not only produce resentment butalso the dangerous practice of intolerance. For suchtimes it is far better to remember the words of ThomasPaine  who stated that “The world is my country  allmankind are my brethren  and to do good is myreligion.”"
"9",339,"AUS",58,2003,"﻿To stand again at thispodium today  representing Australia as its ForeignMinister  entering into the great conversation ofnations  is an unsettling experience. Seldom has this31forum been confronted with so many dimensions ofuncertainty  so many challenges to global peace security and orderly economic reform. Seldom has itsown capacity for regeneration to deal with them beenso insistently put to the test.Conor Cruise O’Brien  one of Ireland’s finestwriters  an official and later ambassador here  famouslyremarked:“The cynicism necessary in the approach tothe United Nations must at some point be made toyield to reverence: the reverence which isappropriate to ... an institution which ishumanity’s prayer to itself to be saved fromitself.”Recently one of Australia’s foremost novelists Frank Moorhouse  wrote a meditative essay on thistheme. In it he discerned a new pair of parallel worldorders:“For the first time in our lives  there are twovery powerful agents in world affairs … theUnited Nations Security Council … and theUnited States.”He noted that “for all the cynicism about thefutility of international intervention  pragmatically people are being helped daily by the United Nations”and that “visionary and innovative internationalmissions” continue to be conceived and achievedwithin it.Moorhouse’s estimation of the significance of theUnited Nations is debatable. But a combination ofpragmatism  vision and reforming innovation isnecessary if  as I have already warned  thisOrganization is to avoid frittering away its credibilityand influence by failing to exercise its powereffectively.In the words of Secretary-General Annan  weshould not shy away from the need to improve and where necessary  change the structure and function ofthe United Nations and other international institutionsto make sure they remain effective in promotingsecurity and peace.I alluded to the global challenges which confrontus. First among them is the emergence of the “age ofterror”. Where once it was possible to view terrorismas the lamentable legacy of a few unsafe regions  todayalmost no country has been left untouched. Despite thewar on terror — a war we are winning — terrorismcontinues to be a scourge to which neither age nationality  religion or political affiliation providesimmunity. It takes a considerable act of imaginativeengagement to see these new forms of nihilism forwhat they really are. They are a negation of civilizationand of the discourse that sustains it.I referred earlier to the visionary and innovativework which sometimes only the United Nations can do.In that context  I want to pause to pay tribute to theSecretary-General’s senior representative in Baghdad Sergio Vieira de Mello  well known to many of youhere. That such a man  engaged in such vital tasks —along with so many of his colleagues — should havebeen swept by a terrorist bomb into the silentdemocracy of death epitomizes the struggle betweencivilization and the unthinkable alternative.We cannot allow terrorists to succeed indetermining the course of world events. We mustoverwhelm their efforts to disrupt global security andprosperity  to undermine democratic countries ordestabilize nation-building.Terrorism has also created a new urgency insolving a more familiar problem — the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. Efforts by rogue States todevelop and traffic in weapons of mass destructionmaterials underpin the priority we give to non-proliferation. The possibility that weapons of massdestruction might fall into the hands of terrorists makesit an absolute imperative. Terrorism and proliferationdo not occur in a vacuum — except  of course  a moralvacuum. It is no longer open to us to ignore the failedStates which have become their incubators or thetransnational crime on which they depend. Thepromotion of good governance and democratization areimperatives both morally and pragmatically. They havebecome preconditions for international security.Good governance serves both global and nationalinterests  as improved governance will fortify theUnited Nations itself. Without it  developing States willnever be able fully to realize the opportunities thatglobalization presents: chiefly  the potential to erasedivisions between themselves and the developed world.That can occur only if we are all prepared to accept thedisciplines that global trade liberalization imposes.While the prospects  post-Cancún  do not seemparticularly favourable  pursuing the Doha objectives32remains the best way to alleviate poverty and itsattendant ills in the developing world.In confronting these challenges — such assecurity  governance  poverty  terrorism andpandemics — collective action is likely to yield thebest results  since not even the most powerful amongus can bear the burden alone. Effective regional actionalso remains important. Australia has built  with itsneighbours  a network of bilateral counter-terrorismarrangements. These enhance practical  operational-level liaison among regional security  intelligence andlaw enforcement agencies that have seen terror attacksprevented  networks disrupted and terrorists arrested.Similarly  we are developing regional approachesto confront the dangers of State failure. Together withour Pacific Island Forum partners  we are restoringhope for a better future to the people of SolomonIslands. This Regional Assistance Mission has alreadymade excellent progress in its efforts to restore law andorder and to rebuild the institutions of governance.Requested by the Government of Solomon Islands andsupported and implemented by Pacific island nations the Mission is consistent with the United NationsCharter’s original vision of strong regional efforts tomaintain international peace and security. Indeed  wewill continue to concentrate on improved standards ofgovernance  which are central to our assistance in ourown region. The Pacific Island Forum leaders recentlyendorsed efforts to promote more effective regionalinstitutions and  where appropriate  the pooling ofresources to ensure that services are both deliverableand sustainable.The virtues of collective action are self-evident.But collectivity ought not serve as a mantra which is anobstacle to effective action. Sometimes the mosteffective means of preserving security — and indeedinternational law — occur alongside the traditionalmechanisms of multilateral diplomacy. Australia is astrong supporter of multilateral institutions andprocesses  but only insofar as they are a means to aneffective end.The major global disarmament and non-proliferation treaties remain critical to setting norms ofinternational order. But ultimately  those instrumentsmust be enforced. States are not merely entitled  butobliged  to take action to uphold those norms especially when the transfer of weapons of massdestruction outside internationally agreed frameworksis involved. The conviction that States must upholdinternational norms — particularly in relation toweapons of mass destruction — led Australia to jointhe coalition to disarm Iraq  and  in the same way  werecently joined with others in what is known as theProliferation Security Initiative.Australia believes the United Nations has acritical role in promoting international peace andsecurity. First-hand experience in East Timor remindsus of that fact  and we look to the United Nations forcontinuing contributions to ensuring its stability.Australia also appreciates the work of the UnitedNations in rebuilding civil society in Iraq. Of the $100million Australia has committed to humanitarian andreconstruction assistance in Iraq  much has beendirected through United Nations agencies. Those aretwo examples in which the United Nations is playing apositive role.Nevertheless  the role of the United Nations ininternational affairs is under critical scrutiny  and withgood reason. The United Nations  through its MemberStates  needs to do much more to adapt to the evolvingglobal environment. Australia has long been anadvocate of a more focused  efficient United Nationssystem. The Secretary-General’s reforms to date — inparticular the Brahimi peacekeeping changes — havebeen a valuable start.Radical and fundamental change is now needed.The Secretary-General rightly states that the GeneralAssembly is bogged down with an unwieldy agendaand repetitive and sterile debates. We need to askourselves  if much of the activity of the GeneralAssembly — or indeed of the Economic and SocialCouncil — did not occur  what practical differencewould it make  and would anyone notice?Again  as Australia has long argued  thecomposition of the Security Council is out of step withgeopolitical realities. The permanent membership ofthe Security Council should be expanded to reflect thecurrent realities — with the addition of countries suchas Japan  India  Brazil  Indonesia and an Africannation.We support an overhaul of the United Nationsarchitecture  particularly in the light of new securitythreats. The functioning of all the major UnitedNations organs needs to be re-examined  as does theinter-relationship among them. Old shibboleths — suchas the excessive homage to sovereignty  even at the33expense of the preservation of humanity and humanvalues — should not constrain us. We must end absurdduplication of effort. We should refocus the UnitedNations on areas where it can and should make a veryreal difference. But we must be imaginative and bold.The group system  for example  needsmodernization. Australia could become part of an EastAsia and Pacific grouping  and the old divide ofEastern and Western Europe should be dispensed withto reflect the new  converging European reality. Thatwould form the basis for greater regional cooperationwithin the United Nations system  for greaterengagement and problem-solving on a regional scale.In short  we must work urgently on a boldblueprint for revitalization  which we should considerby the summer of next year. That is why we welcomethe Secretary-General’s proposal for a high-levelreview panel. Real commitment to change — whichcan be endorsed at a second San FranciscoConference — will be necessary if the United Nationsis to rediscover its credibility and its promise."
"10",386,"AUT",58,2003,"﻿A few daysago  the United Nations was again attacked in Baghdad  just one month after the United NationsHeadquarters was targeted in a devastating terroristattack. My heartfelt sympathies   not only as theForeign Minister of Austria  but also as a former staffmember working here at the Headquarters of theUnited Nations   go to the victims  their loved onesand all colleagues in the United Nations family. SergioVieira de Mello and his colleagues died as heroes. As ahost country to the United Nations  Austria firmlysupports the Secretary-General's call to provide theutmost security for United Nations personnel onmissions everywhere in the world. Those UnitedNations staff members had dedicated their lives tohelping the most vulnerable. Today  we are called uponto live up to their cause.This has also been a year of lethal attacks onpoliticians who courageously stood for a human facefor politics. We remember  with sadness  the outstandingleadership qualities and invaluable contributions of ZoranDjindjic and Anna Lindh. We are equally saddened tolearn that Ms. Aquila al-Hashimi  member of the IraqiGoverning Council  has succumbed to the wounds shesuffered in the recent terrorist attack.What is at stake today is the way in which theUnited Nations can best shoulder its responsibility forglobal security and peace and how we as MemberStates can support the United Nations in this task.Austria  as one of the host countries of the UnitedNations  feels a sense of responsibility for the futurefunctioning of the Organization.The intense public scrutiny of the SecurityCouncil's actions over the past 12 months has opened awindow of opportunity for re-launching our efforts tofind unity of purpose based on a common securityagenda between all nations. In this context  I greatlywelcome the report of the Secretary-General on theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration  whichmakes one thing crystal clear: we face nothing lessthan the need for a far-reaching overhaul of the UnitedNations system in order to enhance efficiency andlegitimacy.We must respond to this challenge andenergetically revive the reform debate. The urgency weare faced with today should render a new attempt moresuccessful.First of all  a priority issue should be the reformof the procedures of the United Nations system. Thecomposition of the Security Council is at odds with thegeopolitical reality of the twenty-first century. It doesnot reflect the growing number of United NationsMembers or the necessary regional balance. Decision-making is therefore perceived by many as lackinglegitimacy. In my view  this discussion is not onlyabout who should be represented in the SecurityCouncil  but   and this is at least as important  about ensuring that the decision-making is in theinterests of world peace and global security. In thiscontext the regional groups have to accept theirresponsibility by coming forward with solutions.As a member of the European Union  which isabout to give itself a constitution for the twenty-firstcentury  it is important to note that we are movinggradually towards a genuine common foreign andsecurity policy. To this end  a security doctrine is beingelaborated by High Representative and SecretaryGeneral Solana for the European Council. Speakingwith one voice also means more common positions inSecurity Council matters. This logic might one dayeven lead to the European Union having a seat on theSecurity Council.Austria sees its national interest best served bythe multilateral approach of a strong United Nationssystem  with the Security Council living up to itsresponsibility for world peace and with the primacy ofinternational law and the universality of human rightsmaintained by all.International terrorism is a direct and lethal threatto global and collective security. The terror attacks of11 September 2001  and those against the UnitedNations Headquarters in Baghdad  have one thing incommon: they were targeted against civilization as awhole. United Nations leadership is needed more thanever to prevent and combat terrorism globally. In theUnited Nations system-wide division of labour  theVienna-based Terrorism Prevention Branch of theOffice on Drugs and Crime contributes to counter-terrorism efforts and offers valuable technicalassistance to States with regard to signing  ratifyingand implementing international conventions andprotocols related to terrorism.36 Another hard threat to international security is theproliferation of arms  in particular the spread ofweapons of mass destruction. What is needed isobvious: the strengthening and universalization ofexisting disarmament  non-proliferation and exportcontrol regimes. As a practical contribution to thiscause  Austria has agreed to serve as an immediatecentral contact for the 109 subscriber States of theHague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic MissileProliferation.Furthermore  the Conference on Facilitating theEntry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  which I had the honour to open on 3September  appealed  in its Final Declaration  to allStates to sign and ratify that Treaty  in particular tothose 12 countries whose ratification is required for theTreaty's entry into force. Let me repeat and supportthat appeal.In the field of non-proliferation  the work of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under theleadership of Director General Mohamed ElBaradei isessential. Last week's General Conference of IAEAunanimously endorsed the necessity of strengtheningthe international nuclear safeguards system. Recentissues of compliance concerning Iran and theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea have againshown the central role of IAEA.One of the most important immediate tasks is thestabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. We areconvinced that success in the aim of restoring thesovereignty of Iraq as quickly as possible will hardlybe feasible without the United Nations playing its parton the basis of a sound  viable and coherent policy.In line with the human security approach  Austriawas among the first to offer humanitarian aid. InAustrian hospitals we provided urgent medicalassistance for children in critical condition.Furthermore  Austria participates in the Adopt aHospital' programme and is about to equip twohospitals in Nazariyah. Together with Slovenia andJordan  we are preparing the establishment  south ofBaghdad  of a centre for war-traumatized children.These are efforts aimed at providing relief for theweakest and most vulnerable members of Iraqi society.In spite of renewed efforts by the internationalcommunity to revive the Middle East peace process the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians hasagain tragically deteriorated. But current setbacks mustnot stall the implementation of the road map. Austriacontinues to strongly support the role and theresponsibility of the Quartet. The concept of two Statesremains the only viable solution. The promise of land forpeace must be reactivated to create a basis of trust andrespect on which to build. Terrorism destroys such hope.I turn now to what the Secretary-General calledsoft threats. Here  his report coincides with the goals ofmy recently concluded presidency of the HumanSecurity Network to strengthen the universal system byforging interregional consensus on issues pertaining tohuman security. That places the individual humanbeing and his or her protection at the centre of ourpolicies. As a concrete result of my presidency  theministers of the Network adopted a manual on humanrights education. That unique training tool  based onthe universality of human rights  is designed for globaluse and adaptable to target groups. The Network alsoadopted a strategy for supporting children affected byarmed conflict  along with a training curriculum forchild rights experts and a compendium of the relevantinternational child protection standards   an effort inwhich we cooperated closely with the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  Olara Otunnu.The Millennium Development Goals havebecome fundamental benchmarks in our efforts toachieve more inclusive and equitable globalization  andwe   both developing and developed countries  need to strive for their implementation at the global regional and national levels. In that context  as part ofthe partnership effort agreed to in Monterrey  I amhappy to announce that Austrian official developmentassistance will be increased by 35 per cent in 2004.The Johannesburg World Summit on SustainableDevelopment recognized the importance of energy forthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.Austria welcomes the additional impetus created by theRenewables 2004 Conference. I am also glad that theRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnershipwill establish its secretariat in Vienna. Meanwhile Austria will use the synergies created by theseactivities to continue its endeavours to build up thecapacity of the Global Forum on Sustainable Energy which I launched in 1999.At this point  let me express Austria'sdisappointment that the Ministerial Meeting in Cancuncould not sustain the momentum towards achievingacceptable solutions for fair trade. Such a setback must37 not repeat itself  not least because trade is an engine fordevelopment. I support the notion that we also need tobegin a reform of the decision-making process withinthe World Trade Organization. We must avoid atendency towards ending multilateralism and towardsrelying exclusively on bilateralism or regionalism intrade.This year  we commemorate the tenth anniversaryof the 1993 Vienna World Conference on HumanRights  which confirmed the universality  indivisibilityand interrelatedness of human rights as well as theimportant nexus among human rights  democracy anddevelopment. Human rights disasters that we havewitnessed since   such as those in Rwanda andSrebrenica   must not be allowed to recur. Oneessential step in that regard is the Optional Protocol tothe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which I signed this morning.Human rights must protect in particular the weak women and children. As a woman and as ForeignMinister of my country  I have always spoken out infavour of the rights of women and against thefrequently terrible infringements of those rights  suchas genital mutilation  the stoning of women and theenslaving and trading of women and girls on the sexmarkets. Those horrendous practices must stop. Andthere is reason for hope: today is a good day forwomen's rights. News has reached us that Ms. ArminaLawal was acquitted by the Nigerian court. I am veryhappy about that outcome. Let us remind ourselves thatthe all-important fight against terrorism must not entaila lessening of hard-fought-for human rights standards.Over the years and under the guidance of theSecretary-General  Austria has placed great importanceon a comprehensive dialogue of cultures andcivilizations. This November  I will host a secondmedia seminar on the topic of Cultural diversity: thequest for common moral ground and the public role ofthe media'  exploring how the free media cancontribute to cultural understanding and respect. Aseminal event in the context of that dialogue was thefirst-ever conference of European Islamic leaders inAustria  held in June of this year  which adopted astrongly worded declaration in support of tolerance.How can we contribute to stability in the regionsof the world? Europe has its own experience withcreating a zone of stability and welfare. The signing ofthe European Union (EU) accession treaty with 10 newprospective members in April of this year is animportant contribution to security on our continent.The strategy of EU is also geared towards exportingthat peace dividend to new neighbours of the enlargedEU further to the east and to the south-east and in theMediterranean region. Let me highlight oneencouraging event from that region  which I was ableto witness from a close vantage point when I visitedBelgrade less than two weeks ago. I am talking aboutthe important gesture of President Marović of Serbiaand Montenegro and of President Mesić of Croatia apologizing on behalf of those of their countries'citizens  who had committed acts of violence againstone another in recent history.The vision of global solidarity  collective securityand a global culture of human rights are rooted in thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Charterand of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Iam grateful to the Secretary-General for his courageand leadership to engage us in an honest  future-oriented debate. The time to act is now. I can againassure the Secretary-General that Austria supports himin that important endeavour."
"11",411,"AZE",58,2003,"﻿First of all  I would liketo congratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession and to express gratitude to Mr. Jan Kavan forhis work as the President during the fifty-seventhsession.This year has been hard for the United Nations.The events surrounding Iraq have revealed weak linksin the system of international security. Not for the firsttime  the Security Council  owing to disagreementsamong its members  was unable to ensure theimplementation of its resolutions and to reactadequately to the situation.Those disagreements continue to have a criticalinfluence on the activity of the Security Council withregard to both Iraq and other crises and conflicts. It isclear that existing United Nations mechanisms do notmeet the requirements of our time  and it is necessary28to reform the United Nations  including the SecurityCouncil  which reflects the reality of half a centuryago.Azerbaijan supports the well-known reformproposals of Secretary-General Kofi Annan  inparticular with regard to the expansion of themembership of the Security Council  and counts on thegoodwill of the permanent members of the Councilwith regard to the revision of its mechanisms  inparticular the right of veto.We hope that the international community willnow be able to consolidate its efforts to restore andstrengthen a united and indivisible Iraq and to establishdemocracy based on the free will of all of the Iraqipeople. Our country  which is ready to take part in thisprocess  has begun to contribute to the strengthening ofsecurity and stability in Iraq.The terrorist act against the United NationsHeadquarters in Baghdad shocked the entireinternational community. The death of Sergio Vieira deMello and his colleagues was a tragic loss for theOrganization and all of us. What happened in Baghdadonce again showed how vulnerable we are in the faceof terror and convinced us that terrorists are capable ofcommitting any crime. The only response should be anuncompromising commitment to fight against anyonewho resorts to terrorism  no matter what goals are usedas a cover. Selectivity and double standards have noplace in this respect.Our country  which has fallen victim to theaggression  occupation and terror unleashed byArmenia  has for years been fighting terrorism on itsown. Our appeals to the international community tounite its efforts in combating terrorism went unheeded.The alarm went off only after 11 September 2001.Success in the fight against terrorism cannot beachieved without eradicating the underlying roots andeliminating the factors that create a favourableenvironment for its dissemination. On the other hand  itis not possible to resolve conflicts throughout theworld  including in the southern Caucasus  underconditions of continuing terrorism or of support for itat the State level.We have to keep in mind that terrorist groups created and developed by separatist and extremistforces  are usually based in illegally controlledterritories  in the so-called grey zones that emerge as aresult of acts of armed separatism and externalaggression. One such uncontrolled grey zone isNagorny Karabakh and other regions of the Republic ofAzerbaijan  occupied by Armenian military forces.While carrying out the comprehensive struggleagainst terror and resolving conflicts on the basis ofprinciples and norms of international law  theinternational community should decisively resort toforce. That is the only effective way of restoring justiceand ensuring the rule of law.The delegation of Azerbaijan has repeatedlydrawn the attention of the international communityfrom this high rostrum to the ongoing conflict betweenArmenia and Azerbaijan. Ten years have elapsed sincethe Security Council adopted four resolutionsdemanding the immediate  complete and unconditionalwithdrawal of the Armenian occupying forces from theAzerbaijani territories. However  Armenia continues tochallenge the international community by ignoringthose decisions  whereas the Security Council and theMinsk Group of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE) do not undertake anyadequate measures in that regard.Azerbaijan has on many occasions declared itscommitment to the peaceful settlement of the conflicton the basis of norms and principles of internationallaw. We are determined to continue with our efforts inthis direction  and we count on the active participationof the international community. Azerbaijan will neveraccept a settlement on the basis of the so-calledexisting realities and will not cede a single inch of itsland. Azerbaijan's patience is not limitless  and no oneshould try to take advantage of it. Responsibility forthe deadlock in the settlement lies with the aggressorArmenia  and not with the victim of aggression Azerbaijan. The passive position of an observer takenby the international community can only aggravate thatdeadlock.Only after Armenia evacuates all the Azerbaijaniterritories and thus creates a basis for the peacefulsettlement of the conflict can Armenia count on normalinter-State relations and cooperation with Azerbaijan.By rejecting our constructive proposals  based on theobservance of international law  Armenia isdemonstrating its genuine intention to seize and annexAzerbaijani territories.Armenia's authorities continue to profess theideology of aggressive nationalism  militarism 29separatism and terrorism and to doom their people tothe deepest crisis. In a society where territorialexpansion and the search for external enemies areinstilled as a national idea  democracy and pluralismcannot take root. It should be realized in Armenia thatthe present situation of its conflict with Azerbaijan willnot only fail to resolve but will also certainly aggravateits own serious internal social and economic problems.It is with a sense of regret that one has toacknowledge that inaction by the internationalcommunity leads to the strengthened self-confidence ofArmenia in pursuing its destructive policy. Both theOSCE Minsk Group and the Security Council havebacked off in the face of illegitimate force  thus callinginto question the seriousness of their intentions andcontinuity of their actions.Appeasement of the aggressor seriouslyundermines the whole system of international security which is based on the inviolability of principles andnorms of international law. That attitude has on manyoccasions taken a heavy toll on the internationalcommunity.We appeal to the Security Council to carry out thenecessary measures in order to ensure theimplementation of the above-mentioned fourresolutions  and we expect that decisive steps will betaken to stop criminal and aggressive actions in theoccupied territories and on the line of engagement  aswell as to push the occupying forces to unconditionally immediately and completely evacuate the seizedAzerbaijani territories.The conflict has deprived almost one millionAzerbaijanis of roofs over their heads. It is clear thatthe forthcoming winter will again become another hardtest for the refugees and the internally displacedpersons  hundreds of thousand of whom continue tolive in tent camps. The Government of Azerbaijan using its limited resources  spares no effort to mitigatetheir suffering. Recently  the President of the Republicof Azerbaijan by decree allocated more than $70million to the construction of housing for refugees.While we highly appreciate the assistance of theinternational community  we nevertheless are worriedby its decreasing scale. We urge the relevant UnitedNations agencies and donor countries  as well as non-governmental organizations  to boost their attention tothe problems of the forcefully displaced Azerbaijanipopulation and to respond adequately to their needs. Asfor the long-term resolution of this problem  it lies  ofcourse  in the settlement of the conflict betweenArmenia and Azerbaijan and in the return of therefugees and internally displaced persons to theirhomes.The conflict has also severely damaged theeconomy of Azerbaijan. However  having mobilizedour domestic resources  we managed to overcomeserious social-economic crises and to move towardsstabilization and development. Economic reformpolicies and the oil strategy elaborated and beingimplemented under the leadership of the President ofAzerbaijan  His Excellency Mr. Heydar Aliyev  havealready yielded concrete results. These reforms haveled to macroeconomic stability and high economicgrowth rates.The promotion of the market economy andentrepreneurship increased the share of the privatesector of the economy to 73 per cent. Figures onforeign direct investment per capita show thatAzerbaijan is one of the leaders among the countrieswith economies in transition. On average  the annualeconomic growth rate is between 8 per cent and 10 percent.The implementation of large-scale transregionalprojects on development and transportation ofhydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea to the worldmarket and the diversification of transport corridors initiated by Azerbaijan  have opened new prospects forthe social and economic development of countriesalong the East-West corridor  aimed at the restorationof the historic Silk Road.This progress would be impossible withoutinternal political stability  which has created theprerequisites and conditions for implementing radicalpolitical reforms and the development of democraticsociety. Today  Azerbaijani democracy stands at theedge of its next test of maturity and firmness. OnOctober 15  the elections for President of the Republicwill be held in Azerbaijan. The legislative basis forconducting genuinely free and fair elections has beenestablished in the country. The recently adoptedElection Code was widely discussed at the local andinternational levels  and it meets the highestinternational standards. Numerous internationalobservers of the OSCE  the Council of Europe andother international organizations  as well as localobservers  will follow the presidential elections.30The triumph of democracy  social progress andsustainable development on a global scale areimpossible unless the problems of poverty and sharpdisproportion in economic performance across differentcountries and regions are resolved. In that regard  theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goalsis extremely important. Combating povertypresupposes close interaction between developed anddeveloping countries.Regrettably  there is still no breakthrough in thatregard. Developed States should pay more attention tothe problems of the countries with economies intransition. Experience proves that narrow-mindedinterests frequently prevail  and thus deadlocks emergein the negotiation process. Azerbaijan believes thatenlargement of parties to the multilateral trade system as well as granting the provisions of special anddifferential treatment in the World Trade Organization(WTO) to both developing countries and countries witheconomies in transition  will contribute to thesuccessful global integration of the latter.We are firmly convinced of the need to develop adialogue among civilizations and cultures. Onlythrough dialogue and good will shall we defeat mistrustand confrontation  and unify our forces in addressingcommon threats and challenges.In conclusion  allow me once again to reiterateAzerbaijan's strong adherence to its political course aimed at building a strong democratic State with amarket economy  and our genuine willingness anddesire to effectively contribute to peace andinternational security."
"12",457,"BDI",58,2003,"﻿Allowme at the outset  on behalf of my delegation and in mypersonal capacity  to extend my warmestcongratulations to Mr. Julian Robert Hunte on hiselection to preside over our work. My country'sdelegation and I wish him every success and assurehim of our full cooperation in bringing his noblemission to fruition.I should also like to pay a tribute to hispredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for the skill andcompetence with which he guided the work of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session.I take this opportunity to congratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the skill and dynamism withwhich he has led our Organization and on hisunflagging attention to the people of Burundi inhelping them to emerge from the serious crisis theyhave experienced for the past 10 years.I should also like to voice our profound gratitudeto the Security Council for its ongoing readiness andmanifest determination to assist the Government andpeople of Burundi in the quest for a lasting solutionleading to peace and national reconciliation. Theregular visits of the Security Council to my countryhave encouraged the inter-Burundian peace process andsent a message of hope to a people severely battered bywar.Since the signing of the Arusha Peace andReconciliation Agreement for Burundi on 28 August2000  the peace process under way in my country hasmade significant progress. Since 1 November 2001  wehave had transitional institutions uniting all thepolitical factions of the country. Since then  effectiveadministrative reforms have been undertaken andreforms planned for the judiciary are gradually beingmade as funding becomes available.Furthermore  the people of Burundi and theinternational community were gratified by the transferof power at the highest level of State  which proceededsmoothly on 30 April 2003  guaranteeing the2institutional framework of the Arusha Agreement. TheTransitional Government of Burundi is now involved innegotiations with the armed groups in order to achievea permanent ceasefire agreement and to ensure itseffective implementation.Thus  on 7 October 2002  we signed a ceasefireagreement with the factions of the Forces nationales delibÈration-Parti LibÈration du Peuple Hutu (FNL-PALIPEHUTU) and the Conseil national pour ladÈfense de la dÈmocratie-Front pour la dÈfense de ladÈmocratie (CNDD-FDD)  led respectively by AlainMugabarabona and Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye. On2 December 2002  we signed a similar agreement withthe principal armed movement of CNDD-FDD led byPierre Nkurunziza. Today  the Transitional Governmentis pursuing negotiations with the latter with a view tointegrating that group into the Republic's transitionalinstitutions  including the Defence and Security Corps the National Assembly  the Senate  the Governmentand the Administration. The most recent negotiationswere those organized in Dar es Salaam on15 September.Dar es Salaam served as the context andopportunity for the presentation and consideration ofthe strong and effective positions of all concerned.Above all  it provided an opportunity to exchangeviews and to understand and reaffirm the importance ofthe central focus of the Arusha Peace andReconciliation Agreement for Burundi and for takinginto consideration the national realities that will ensurethe maintenance of stability. We refer in particular torespect for the allocations agreed in Arusha; thegranting of visibility to CNDD-FDD in the institutions while avoiding a raising of the stakes and the exclusionof others; the equitable sharing of power; respect forthe rights of citizens; and so on.A summit of heads of State was then planned onvery short notice to arrive at the conclusions andcompromises necessary to the signing of the protocolfor the implementation of the ceasefire agreement of2 December 2002 and for the entry of CNDD-FDD intothe transitional institutions. We take this opportunitywarmly to thank the heads of State of the region anddelegations at that summit for their work leading to thesteps already undertaken.These fairly positive results should not blind us toa number of difficulties facing Burundi today. Indeed the continuation of war is a major obstacle toimplementing planned reform  even though theGovernment is sparing no efforts to meet this greatchallenge  and its commitment to implement theArusha Agreement and ceasefire agreement for peaceand reconciliation in Burundi speaks for itself.Therefore  we continue to urge leaders of theregional initiative for Burundi  mediators and theinternational community to step up their pressure onPierre Nkurunziza's FDD for a ceasefire andintegration in institutions  and on Agathon Rwasa'sParti pour la libÈration du peuple Hutu(PALIPEHUTU) to rejoin without further delay thetransitional Government of Burundi at the negotiatingtable  the only appropriate forum to voice its claims.We also urge the international community tomake a substantial financial contribution to the AfricanMission in Burundi  which is crucial to the monitoringof the ceasefire.Finally  the Government of Burundi is impatientlyawaiting the establishment of an international judicialcommission of inquiry in Burundi  whose work willclearly contribute to helping Burundi to objectivelyconfront the crucial issue of the campaign againstimpunity.Another major challenge confronting us iseconomic growth and efforts to combat poverty amongour people. Indeed  the people of Burundi are nowliving in unspeakable poverty. Ten years have soseverely devastated the national economy that we nolonger have the bare minimum required to sustainsocial harmony. More than 68 per cent of thepopulation of Burundi is living beneath the povertylevel.Of course  we approve of efforts already made bythe international community to ensure the survival ofmy country. But we also ask it to make further effortsto quickly fulfil the promises made in Paris andGeneva.I am pleased to say that the peace process in mycountry is now developing in a propitious subregionalenvironment recently characterized by significantprogress in the peace process in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo and a democratic breakthroughin Rwanda.That positive change should lead to the definitiveend to conflicts and also make possible theinternational conference on the Great Lakes region 3which the Government of Burundi so ardently hopeswill take place.We wish to see the peace that we seek forBurundi and its neighbours spread to the entire world.During the Millennium Assembly in September 2000 heads of State and Government agreed  inter alia  tospare no effort to save our peoples from the scourge ofwar  whether it be civil war or war between States. Adecision was also made to increase the effectiveness ofthe United Nations in the maintenance of peace andsecurity and to take concerted steps to combatinternational terrorism.On the one hand  we can justly welcome thecommitment made by the leaders of the entire world towork for a better planet  and we commend thesomewhat positive results in restoring internationalpeace and security. On the other hand  our collectiveconscience places obligations on us all and requiressustained vigilance and efforts in the face of persistentand serious setbacks endured here and there on the pathto international peace and security. Indeed  the world ofthe twenty-first century has not been spared from thedangers of war  poverty  terrorism  disease and naturaldisasters.The efforts to combat terrorism that were steppedup by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) havehad mixed results thus far  in view of the frequency andviciousness of terrorist acts throughout the world  fromwhich even our outstanding Organization is not spared.These terrorist attacks have done much to contribute tomaintaining a general trend towards over-reliance onthe military and the strengthening of doctrines based onpreventive attacks  a concept that continues to fuelpolitical and diplomatic debate.Despite the ever-increasing commitment of theUnited Nations and regional and subregionalorganizations  hotbeds of tension among or withinStates have not yet been extinguished and calls for warare enduring and threatening  like the sword ofDamocles. Mercenaries are increasingly being used astools to destabilize sovereign and independent States.The threat of nuclear war continues to loom over usand poison international relations.Trafficking in human beings  a true form ofslavery in the twenty-first century  particularly withrespect to the child labour market  child prostitution the use of children as cannon fodder in conflicts andillegal migration continue to be a reality to this day.All these abuses have as a common denominatoran attack on human rights and internationalhumanitarian law that the Member States of the UnitedNations are duty-bound to champion side by sidewithin the framework of multilateralism  one of themost cherished principles of our Organization.In light of the impression that we areexperiencing a genuine crisis in the architecture ofpeace-building and international security  intelligentreform of institutions entrusted with the maintenanceof international peace and security is urgently neededto better enable them to meet the security needs of ourtime.Above all  the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly  the most representative organ of the UnitedNations  must be tirelessly pursued. Carefulconsideration should make the General Assembly muchmore operational and streamlined with respect to itsworking methods and  in particular  to impartialfollow-up and implementation of its resolutions anddecisions.Reform of the Security Council in all its aspectsalso continues to be a top priority for us  as theMillennium Declaration stressed  to meet the concernsabout the regional balance of its membership. Thecredibility of the Council and our Organization are atstake here.Moreover  multilateralism must remain a commonpillar for us all  as one of the fundamental values thatshould underpin international relations in theframework of active solidarity and sharedresponsibilities  under the aegis of our Organization.We also appeal for regular voluntary financing ofUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and supportfor mechanisms of regional and subregional conflict-prevention and promotion of political stability  withparticular attention given to Africa.There is no need to recall that our world isincreasingly characterized by growinginterdependence  conflicts  pandemics and naturaldisasters that have repercussions that know no bordersbetween States. Economic and social imbalances thatresult from the unfair and non-inclusive internationalfinancial structure prevent us from efficiently tacklingtoday's very complex challenges. The needs andinterests of developing countries have not beensufficiently taken into account. The gulf between rich4and poor is widening. We therefore have a commonduty to establish an environment that will benefit allpoor peoples.With respect to cooperation for development  thefight against poverty remains a priority. Attaining thegoals set at the international level during majorconferences and summits involves the elimination ofpoverty and hunger  in particular in rural areas.This implies  among other things  significantinvestment in the agricultural and rural sectors gearedtowards increasing production and protecting theenvironment. We are all aware that  in order to besuccessful  the development efforts of poor countriesrequire multifaceted international support. To that end the commitments undertaken at the Monterreyconference regarding aid to development areencouraging  but we must promptly move from goodintentions to specific deeds.The least developed countries have weak andmarginalized economies within the internationalfinancial system. They therefore require particularattention in terms of official development assistance direct foreign investment  debt relief  the strengtheningof capacities and access to international markets. Wealso urge the international community to advance theintegral implementation of the Almaty plan of action asa response to the specific difficulties linked to thedistance to the sea and to high costs of transportationthat seriously handicap the economic development oflandlocked countries.Africa is the continent where the ills ofdestitution have attained an alarming level. In a sharedimpetus  Africans have created the New Partnership forAfrica's Development (NEPAD). The warm welcomethe international community gave to NEPAD must bebacked by concrete gestures of solidarity. Thus  thespirit of partnership  which also entails the activeparticipation of local authorities and associations ofcivil society  can  in fact  become a reality and allowour continent to benefit from its immense riches downto a grassroots level.The rules of the World Trade Organization needto be made more flexible to allow developing countriesto benefit from the liberalization of world trade. Theinitiatives already undertaken along these lines in Dohadeserve to be further intensified. There is a need to endall forms of subsidies for products exported from richcountries  which lead to distorted exchange rates  aswell as various non-tariff obstacles. The internationalcommunity must also work to remedy the instability ofthe prices of commodities  which are the major sourceof revenue for poor countries.Another major challenge is overcoming theHIV/AIDS pandemic and halting malaria andtuberculosis in tropical countries. AIDS is a threat tomankind. It is devastating entire populations  makingmillions of children defenceless orphans andswallowing up all development efforts. Faced with thiscommon danger  urgent action is necessary. We heraldthe establishment in January 2002 of the Global Fundto combat these three scourges  and we urge thosecountries that have the financial and scientific means todo so to step up their efforts to limit and ultimatelystamp out those disasters.I would not like to end without emphasizingagain the critical role that the United Nations Charterbestows on our Organization in its sacred mission ofhumanizing international relations each day andcontributing to building a better world. The obstaclesin the path of the United Nations are not inevitable;rather  they are an opportunity to meet new challengesand adapt the Organization to achieve the objectives ofthe Charter and those of the Millennium Declaration."
"13",504,"BEL",58,2003,"﻿I wouldlike at the outset to extend my sincerest congratulationsto you  Sir  on your accession to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly. It comes at a particularly difficulttime  which I might even describe as painful  in thehistory of our Organization.Indeed  the past year has gravely challenged thecapacities of the United Nations to manage the crisis inIraq to its conclusion  a country to which it wasaccountable. It saw the pre-eminent role for themaintenance of international peace and security of thisinstitution  symbol of multilateralism and stability called into question.Yet  it is not our institution’s intrinsic capacitythat is the cause of its powerlessness. It is essentiallyits Members’ lack of political determination. Wecannot elude this vital debate for a peaceful  moreharmonious and more just future indefinitely. Sooner orlater  we must answer the essential question: How canwe ensure that all Member States of the United Nationswill be prepared to accept the binding nature ofSecurity Council endorsements of military action priorto engaging in it?To make myself perfectly clear  and to avoid anymisunderstanding  the question that I ask is as follows:What reforms need to be made to the Organization’soperations to placate the often-understandableapprehension or reticence of those who  because theyassume specific political responsibilities  refuse tosubmit their geostrategic options to the rules of ourOrganization? As long as we remain unable to answerthat question  we will continue to live in doubt anduncertainty  if not in helplessness. It is not a questionof advocating an institutional shake-up of theOrganization; rather debate should enable us toovercome the all-too-many misunderstandings thatundermine the credibility of our shared instrument  andfrom which we can draw conclusions that will help usto make the Organization’s mechanisms more credibleand up to date. The Security Council was founded onthe recognition of the particular responsibility and roleof some of our Members  and I fully subscribe to it.But should we not integrate new perspectives into thisstate of affairs  such as the regional dimension  presentgeopolitical facts and also new threats?This is in no way meant to contest the specificinfluence of some of those involved in internationalpeace and security management. Rather  our concertedsupport could help accompany  legitimize andstrengthen their approach and their effectiveness thanks to the indisputably added value of multilateraldynamics. In many cases  this would avoid takingunnecessary risks and misunderstandings. In thatregard  I think that  given its role as a global actor  theEuropean Union greatly deserves a permanent seat onthe Security Council on its own behalf.It is this conviction that has inspired my country’sposition on the Iraq crisis. But now is not the time todetermine who was right or who was wrong. All sidesclearly had their reasons. One can only respect themfor it.But it is now necessary to contribute to the re-establishment of stability and ensure Iraq’sreconstruction. That is the responsibility of us all  for itconcerns a region neighbouring Europe  and we cannottolerate  if only for the sake of our own security increased instability or the persistence of anuncontrolled spiral of violence that feeds resentmenttowards the international community  which  as historyhas taught us  constitutes the principal breeding groundfor terrorism.It is thus necessary to stop the violence as quicklyas possible. To this end  I share the opinion of theSecretary-General and of many among us. It isnecessary to restore as quickly as possibleresponsibility for governing Iraq to the people of Iraq.The return to sovereignty  under the watchful eye of theUnited Nations and of the international community as awhole  is capable of providing the salutary shockneeded to reverse the current trend. We must convincethe Iraqi people that national union  there-establishment of State authority and economicrecovery are accessible and at hand. This of coursedoes not imply that the international community shoulddemobilize. A strong military force in Iraq will still benecessary for some time to guarantee stability. It is ofcourse up to the United States to assume itsmanagement. But from now on this presence must notbe regarded as designed to occupy the country  butrather as a way to assist in the reconstruction process34for the sake of the Iraqi people. The Security Councilresolution that is currently under discussion mustcreate this prospect so as to insure broad participationby the international community.The United Nations has a central role to play inaccompanying the political reconstruction process inIraq  even if the tragic events of August have shownhow risky and vulnerable that process is. However such a role requires a clear mandate and sufficientmeans.I wish to renew my sincerest condolences to theSecretary-General  to the bereaved families and tocolleagues  and express my high regard and admirationfor all the United Nations staff members for theirinvolvement  their selflessness and the sacrifices thatthey accept so steadfastly.The principal security threat is the uncontrollableproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and theirpotential use by some States in breach of minimalethical standards or by certain terrorist movements.That threat is serious. We must each confront the threattogether  by shouldering our fair share of the actionsundertaken.The European Union and its member Statescurrently possess an essential document which dealswith the European security strategy. It should enableus  as Javier Solana quite recently reminded us inBrussels  to plot a European chart of the challengesfacing this world to better guarantee the effectivenessof our collective security system. Belgium will activelyparticipate in this endeavour.Furthermore  we fully share the internationalcommunity’s concerns about the nuclear programme ofNorth Korea. We strongly call upon North Korea toabide by its previous international commitments. Weare grateful to China for having offered a useful formatfor discussion in this respect.As for Iran  I trust that through a sustained andconstructive dialogue it will meet the expectations ofthe international community and respond to therequests of the International Atomic Energy Agency.Belgium will continue to participate in adetermined and proactive way in the internationalefforts that were initiated two years ago to track downterrorism. In Belgium  there is no sanctuary forterrorism  nor will there ever be. Nevertheless  the fightagainst terrorism should not be used as an abusivejustification for actions that would undermine thedemocratic quality and the sacred principles of the ruleof law.Furthermore  I am not one of those who believethat the military option is the exclusive answer although obviously it should not be excluded. Muchmore fundamentally  we need to systematically attackthe root causes of a phenomenon that is often rooted inthe feeling of powerlessness or in feelings of real orperceived injustice.For this reason  Belgium will also continue tosupport  together with its European partners  the actionof the Quartet for the re-establishment of peacebetween Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Toachieve that goal  it is necessary that Palestiniansdecide unambiguously to renounce the toleration ofblind violence and that Israel  in the same spirit  stopfavouring the use of force.One has the impression that  as difficulties pileup  we have fallen back into the traps of Oslo: agradualism of small steps and a too-pronouncedreliance on sequencing. The road map prescribesparallel advances on the security  political andeconomic paths. From each side  we need to obtainbolder measures and the acceptance of the risks theseimply. There is no alternative to the road map. It hasnot yet been implemented seriously. We believe it isparticularly urgent to create a credible  on-siteverification mechanism.It is in Africa  particularly in Central Africa  thatmy country commits itself in the most determined wayto the restoration of peace and stability. We areencouraged by the successful installation of atransitional Government in Kinshasa that now bringstogether all the parties. Now  State structures have tobe restored and good governance has to be introducedin order to allow for the return of foreign aid andinvestment. The persisting violence in the east of thecountry must end.In this context  I wish to mention the remarkableefforts by the United Nations Organization Mission inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). Iam particularly happy about the success of OperationArtemis. Apart from restoring security in Bunia  thisoperation has given MONUC the thrust it needed to beable to face up to the challenges of its new mandate.35Now  priority must be given to the preparation ofelections in order to grant the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo a new start on a solid basis and toconsolidate its restored territorial integrity. Belgiumwill be present at all levels and in every phase of thisprocess. But I wish to insist on the fact that theDemocratic Republic of the Congo needs thedetermined commitment of all the instruments of ourcommunity. It would be unforgivable not to forge  hereand now  the conditions for a complete stabilization ofthe entire region.We also need to help Rwanda to continue itsnational reconciliation efforts  which are indispensablein order to guarantee sustainable stability in that fragilecountry. I am convinced the recent elections willcontribute to this goal.As for Burundi  the implementation of the ArushaAgreements must continue  and the rebels have to beconvinced that they should join this process. Mycountry looks forward to participating actively in thenew action on Burundi decided by the Economic andSocial Council. We hope that will help Burundi tobreak through its isolation within the internationalcommunity.Finally  my country closely follows the efforts bythe United Nations to reactivate the project for a GreatLakes conference  which should seal the re-establishment of peaceful relations and thedevelopment of cross-border cooperation among thecountries of the region.The credibility of the United Nations does notdepend only on its willingness and capacity to managecrises. It also depends on its capacity to respond to theexpectations of men  women and children all over theworld  who are directly or indirectly confronted withimbalances and injustice whose causes and solutionsboth are found only at the global level. It is essential tomaster globalization  develop the promises it offers andcorrect its excesses.It is clear that  in accordance with the analysis ofthe Secretary-General  this challenge requiresfundamental reflection on the architecture of the majorinstruments of development. That demands openness ofmind and should not exclude any option from the start.Has not the time come to reinforce the capacity of theUnited Nations to act effectively in this field? I wish torepeat a question that I raised at the World TradeOrganization Ministerial Conference in Cancún.Should we not  for example  create a real Economicand Social Security Council  which would derive itslegitimacy and efficiency from law and which wouldhave the same power in the management of economic social and environmental policies as the SecurityCouncil has on issues of peace? That is my conviction especially since those fields form the requisitebackdrop to achieving stability and security.The Economic and Social Council needs to bereformed to give it a more decisive operational role inthe control of a world organization based on universalprinciples of equity. This goal should lead to broad andbalanced synergies between international organizationssuch as the World Bank  the International MonetaryFund  the World Trade Organization and theInternational Labour Organization  which should reallybecome instruments of the same project.The founding principles of such a concept existalready and are being applied in certain countries  suchas in mine. I am referring more specifically tofundamental labour standards such as the freedom ofunions  the prohibition of child labour and forcedlabour and the right to quality employment  as well asenvironmental obligations  which are vital forsustainable development. I am also thinking of the needto exclude services of general interest from the marketsphere.To conclude  it seems to me that such an ambitionwould opportunely translate the tremendous hopegenerated by the Millennium Summit. The MillenniumDeclaration clearly defined the goals at our level. I ampleased with the decision of the General Assembly tomake the five-year review of the Millennium Summitin 2005 into an important event  which I think shouldbe a summit of heads of State and Government. Thatsummit should assess the implementation not only ofthe Millennium Goals  but also of the goals of all themajor United Nations conferences.But the success of that summit implies goingfurther. It should at last boldly lay the foundation for aworld in which inequalities between poor and richcountries can be filled in a sustainable way. It shouldnourish  in an irreversible way  the indispensableconfidence the world needs to be safer  more humanand more brotherly."
"14",549,"BEN",58,2003,"﻿Mr.President  you have the honour and privilege of guidingthe work of the General Assembly at a time when theUnited Nations is at a crossroads. The internationalsituation is marked today by doubt  anguish anddisillusionment. Faced with the many conflicts and actsof terrorism that beset our world  and with the constantdisquieting increase in poverty  we must acknowledgethat the end of ideological confrontation did not bringthe world either peace or the development so hoped forby the founding fathers of this Organization. Therefore in conveying my heartfelt and warm congratulations toyou on your election to the presidency of the fifty-eighth regular session  I would like in particular toconvey my wishes for courage and success indischarging this noble mission and assure you of thesupport of my country  Benin.My delegation would also like to convey a well-deserved tribute  to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan and to congratulate him on the results obtained duringhis presidency in defining modalities for implementingthe outcomes of the major conferences held under theaegis of the United Nations.Allow me also to congratulate  in particular  theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on the courage skill and resolve with which he is guiding ourOrganization  an irreplaceable instrument for thepromotion and maintenance of world peace.My delegation is grateful to him for his constancyin dealing with events that shook our universalOrganization during this year. He understood how tobring the necessary clear-sightedness  with hisunshakeable faith in the ability of the internationalcommunity  to provide a concerted response to urgentproblems of our time while rejecting any confusion ofroles. In so doing he saved our Organization from scornand collapse.Whenever the United Nations has been called intoquestion  faced with a challenge to its very existence  ithas stood up and reaffirmed its usefulness in managingsituations as the guarantor of international law.The terrorist attacks against the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad  which caused manycasualties  profoundly shocked and enraged the peopleand Government of Benin. The United Nations doesnot deserve this kind of gratuitous barbarity perpetratedagainst its staff  who are devoted to the cause ofrebuilding Iraq.Benin reiterates its sincere condolences to thefamily of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello as well as to the14families of all the other victims of the explosion. Weonce again convey to them our solidarity and support.My country reiterates to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  and his associates our admiration forthe courage and conviction with which  every day  theydo their jobs. This act should not shake their firmdetermination to defend the cause of humanity  andshould be a new source of commitment to attain thegoals of the United Nations.Our support for the United Nations and theSecretary-General is based on Benin’s commitment tomultilateralism  which is and must remain the linchpinfor the new order that the international community isstriving to build.If there is one area in which our Organization hasmade some progress in strengthening its effectiveness it is in the prevention  management and settlement ofarmed conflicts. It has given real meaning to its actionin this area by clearly defining modalities forimplementing peacekeeping operations.My country endorses the conclusions andrecommendations of the Secretary-General on conflictprevention  particularly in the areas of povertyeradication  transparency in the area of arms  the fightagainst the proliferation of small arms and lightweapons and weapons of mass destruction and thepeaceful settlement of disputes.The gravity of the situation prevailing in Africamakes the continent a central concern of theinternational community. Given the seriousness ofAfrica’s problems  the United Nations and its MemberStates owe it to themselves to step up their support forAfrican initiatives to reverse negative tendencies and toavoid any prolonged destabilization of the continent.At its recent summit held in Maputo Mozambique  the African Union gave a forcefuldemonstration of its resolve to acquire the means totackle its problems. The conference elected all thesenior officials of the African Union Commission. Thenew team should strive to develop and maintainrelations of partnership with the world  based onAfrica’s priorities. Benin hopes that this new team willenjoy the trust and support of the internationalcommunity in order to restore peace on the continentby eliminating various pockets of tension and throughthe promotion and implementation of developmentprogrammes.We also commend the work done in theframework of the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment (NEPAD)  which embodies the hope forthe revitalization of the continent through combinedsynergies produced by implementation of the mainpoints of this programme  which is based uponconsensus.The importance accorded by the G-8 to thepromotion of peace and stability in Africa is animportant step forward. This new commitment willgive Africa the means to contain the many conflictsand latent crises that are fraught with serious dangerand unimaginable consequences. Benin is prepared tocooperate to establish this work plan so that by 2010Africa will have an inter-African peacekeeping force an essential instrument for political stability  withoutwhich Africa would be unable to tackle urgent tasks ofeconomic and social development. The SecurityCouncil missions to Central Africa and West Africa inJune and July this year highlighted the crucial need tohave this mechanism as a permanent presence.Developments in Africa since our fifty-seventhsession  and the facts gathered on the ground by theCouncil missions reaffirm one unavoidable fact  thatthe effective mobilization and rapid deployment oftroops to the field is decisive in managing armedconflicts in Africa  as indeed it is everywhere else onour planet.The speedy reaction of the internationalcommunity was crucial in the case of Côte d’Ivoire where Operation Licorne and the deployment of thecontingent of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) and the United NationsMission in Côte d’Ivoire (MINUCI)  made it possibleto help warring brothers to silence their arms andembark on a dialogue in order to preserve the territorialintegrity of Côte d’Ivoire.The restoration of calm should not lead us tounderestimate the seriousness of the situation in Côted’Ivoire  where the political crisis is far from over.Major problems remain to be resolved  and it isimportant that an international military presence bemaintained in Côte d’Ivoire in order to maintainconditions conducive to dialogue regardingimplementation of the Linas-Marcoussis agreementsfor a return to normality.Furthermore  the rapid reaction by the CentralAfrican States and Nigeria made it possible to put an15end to the coup d’état in Sao Tome and Principe and toreturn to power the democratically elected President.Likewise  just a few weeks ago in Guinea-Bissau immediate action and initiatives taken by ECOWASprompted the perpetrators of the coup d’état to enterinto a negotiating process aimed at a short transitionleading up to the organization of presidential andlegislative elections.The authorization to send a multinational forceand a United Nations stabilization force to Liberia under Chapter VII of the Charter  gave a clear signal ofthe international community’s determination to end theconflict there. The impact of these steps is veryencouraging  and we welcome the signing  in Accra on18 August this year  of the Comprehensive PeaceAgreement.Recent political developments in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo have continuously highlightedthe importance of the need to hold an internationalconference on the situation in the Great Lakes region.The complexity of phenomena in Africa requiresthe Secretary-General to maintain an ongoing dialoguewith African leaders and to adopt common approachesto relevant issues. That is why Benin welcomes theestablishment of the Office and the appointment of anUnder-Secretary-General as the Special Adviser onAfrica.The implementation of the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD)  a genuinely Africaninitiative  has made significant progress this year. It hasbecome increasingly detailed in programme design andin its specific projects for agriculture  the environment energy and information and communicationstechnologies. The involvement of civil society has beeneffective in expanding the social basis of NEPAD andas a way of involving peoples in its implementation.Benin urgently appeals to the international communityto enhance its support for NEPAD  as it did in Tokyo inthe context of the Third Tokyo InternationalConference on African Development.In this regard  it is important that the UnitedNations operational activities be buttressed bystrategies based on effective partnership with allstakeholders in the development process. They musthelp implement concrete projects that have a realimpact on the living and working conditions of peopleswith a view to poverty eradication. Indeed  the annualrise in the number of poor people in the world hasbecome increasingly distressing. It makes us questionever more deeply the current world order and thesincerity of the determination of the internationalcommunity — in particular  that of the developmentinstitutions and the rich countries — to combat povertyand to promote genuine sustainable development.It is true that the absence of democracy corruption and poor governance are tragic scourges inthat they exacerbate poverty and impede development.There is no doubt  however  that the least developedcountries have undertaken extremely courageouseconomic and political reforms at the cost of enormoussacrifices made by their populations. That is why weremain concerned by the low rate of implementation ofthe Brussels Programme of Action for the LeastDeveloped Countries and call on the internationalcommunity and our bilateral and multilateral partnersto demonstrate greater solidarity and responsibility. MyGovernment strongly favours a substantial increase inresources made available to the various assistancefunds  in particular the United Nations CapitalDevelopment Fund  which is working to eliminatepoverty.The Fifth Ministerial Conference of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) ended less than a monthago in Cancún. My country  Benin  which is theChairman of the Coordination Bureau for the LeastDeveloped Countries  attended with the firmdetermination to establish a candid and constructivedialogue with the developed countries. The goal was tofind a solution to the dysfunctional free trade system which prevents the developing countries  particularlythe least developed among them  from enjoying theircomparative advantages in the agricultural sector. Thesectoral initiative on cotton introduced by Benin Burkina Faso  Mali and Chad targeted that specificissue.History will record the Conference as a failure.My delegation nevertheless believes that  despite thedifficulties  Cancún moved the negotiations forward. Itwas an opportunity for the least developed countries tostate some of their concerns  in particular those relatedto the practice of subsidizing non-competitiveagricultural producers. This practice is literallystrangling the cotton growers of the underdevelopedcountries  particularly in West Africa.16Benin should like to reopen discussions so thatthe trade negotiations begun in Doha can effectivelyoffer new prospects for the development of the leastdeveloped countries. We must establish transparentpricing on the world market and open up markets inorder to allow competitive countries to produce andsell their products at remunerative prices. This is oftremendous importance to African cotton-producingcountries  because the future of a sector that has beendeveloped at great cost  with the assistance of theinternational community  is at stake. Our Organizationwould gain in credibility if it could find a way toguarantee our peoples their right to subsistence.Indeed  who on this Earth has never worn acotton shirt  dress or loincloth? Who among us here hasnever used cotton to clean or bind a wound? Theprogressive disappearance of the cotton sector willhave unimaginable implications and consequences forour comfort in clothing and other needs of allhumankind. The time has come  therefore  for thedeveloped countries to hear the voice of the poorpeasants labouring under the sun and rain in Africa.While globalization may require considerable structuraladjustments  it is increasingly necessary that itsconcomitant sacrifices be parcelled out fairly. This willrequire the rich countries to assume their responsibilityto give the peoples of the least developed countries achance at survival.In 2004  the international community willcommemorate the tenth anniversary of the InternationalYear of the Family. That will be an important event  towhich my delegation should like to draw the attentionof the international community in order to spotlight therole of the family in our society and the part it can playin meeting contemporary challenges. To that end Benin proposes the convening of a regional Africanconference in 2004 and calls for the support of theSecretariat for such an event.At the national level  since our last session Beninhas met two significant challenges in the entrenchmentof our democratic process launched in February 1990.The decentralization of our territorial administrationwas achieved following our municipal and communalelections of December 2002. Those elections markedthe conclusion of a fundamental reform of Stateadministration in Benin  which is now structuredaround decentralized  financially autonomouscommunes led by elected mayors who are accountableto the people. This reform has created the optimalconditions for grass-roots democracy and has allowedthe people to participate actively in publicadministration and thus to become real stakeholders inlocal community development. Elections for deputiesto the fourth legislature were also held in March 2003.These two elections were free  transparent anddemocratic. They took place calmly and peacefully.They made a further contribution to strengthening thedemocratic rebirth of Benin.These concrete achievements attest to the vitalityand stability of our national institutions and to theireffective contribution to the ongoing strengthening ofthe constitutional order in Benin. This historicopportunity for Benin to enjoy peace and stability in asubregion beset by recurring internal armed conflictsimplies a certain responsibility with regard to ourcontribution to the international community’s efforts topromote democracy throughout the world and torestore peace in countries in conflict  particularly inAfrica.It was in recognition of this firm commitment ofBenin’s that the General Assembly entrusted us withthe organization  from 4 to 6 December 2000  of theFourth International Conference of New or RestoredDemocracies. For nearly three years  Benin chaired thefollow-up mechanism to that Conference; it recentlytransferred that chairmanship to Mongolia  whichorganized the Fifth Conference from 10 to 12September 2003. My country welcomes the outcome ofthe Ulan Bator Conference. We remain committed tothe principle of periodic assessment of democraticpractices. We will spare no effort in implementing theUlam Bator Declaration and Plan of Action.The active and effective participation of Benin inpeacekeeping operations decided upon or authorized bythe Security Council also makes clear my country’sresolute commitment to democracy  the maintenance ofpeace and security in the world and internationalsolidarity. It is in that context that Benin’s candidacyfor a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for2004 and 2005 should be seen. In that context  Beninwill resolutely strive to strengthen the crucialpartnership that the Security Council is endeavouringto establish with regional and subregionalorganizations in the area of peacekeeping. Benin iscounting on the support of the entire internationalcommunity so that we can have the privilege ofserving  at such a high level  the cause of peace andinternational security.17"
"15",595,"BFA",58,2003,"﻿Theserious events currently threatening international peaceand security   armed conflict  terrorism  poverty disease and unfair trading practices   call urgentlyand firmly to mankind's conscience and  above all  tothat of the world's leaders. Guided by thisconsideration  I come before this Assembly to shareour common concerns with the other leaders of theworld and to seek appropriate answers that will restoreconfidence and hope to humankind.Given the importance of this gathering  theelection of Mr. Hunte to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session in every wayrepresents a tribute and a symbol of the honour beingpaid to a young and small nation  Saint Lucia. Thathonour is ours as well   the honour of small States which see this consecration as a demonstration of theUnited Nations awareness of the concept of thesovereign equality of States.We extend the same sentiments to Mr. Hunte'spredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan.We must recognize  however  that all of ourexpectations of this session will be chimerical if we donot fully support the activities of the Secretary-General. I therefore wish solemnly to congratulate Mr.Kofi Annan on his active commitment to the cause ofpeace and justice and to reaffirm our complete trust inhim and our sincere encouragement. That is particularlytrue this year because our Organization was brutallytested and unfairly harmed by the heinous attack of 19August on the United Nations office in Baghdad  whichtook the lives of a number of staff members  includingthat of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq  Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. BurkinaFaso once again pays tribute to their memory.The convulsions of our times   reflected in theincreased hotbeds of crisis  the radicalization ofinternational terrorism and organized crime  growingpoverty and the proliferation of disease   convince usfully that international solidarity must remain active ifwe are to guarantee our world the stability and security itso desires. Indeed  despite the undeniable involvementand efforts of the United Nations; regional organizations such as the African Union; and subregionalorganizations  such as the Economic Community ofWest African States  the Southern Africa DevelopmentCommunity  the Economic and Monetary Communityof Central Africa and the Community of Sahel andSaharan States  to name but a few  in the managementand settlement of many conflicts; and despite a certainnumber of success stories  such as the restoration ofpeace in Angola  Sierra Leone and more generally inthe Great Lakes region  the rolling wave of armedconflict  tension and instability threatens to become anongoing phenomenon.In Iraq  given the tragic turn of events  we feelthat the Organization must once again be placed at theheart of the key responsibilities both in order to definea transitional political process free of any taint ofcolonialism and to rebuild the country.In the Middle East  where the escalation ofviolence and the intransigence of the belligerents makeus fear the worst every day  we believe that the roadmap offers an opportunity to emerge from this crisis.However  without an international body on the ground to follow up and monitor events  no agreement on thismajor conflict can work.We cannot fail to mention the situations in theCÙte d'Ivoire  Burundi  Sudan and the Horn of Africa.The very least that can be said about these conflicts isthat they remain of concern  despite all the efforts thathave been made to settle them. Clearly  given itshistory and geography  the political crisis in the CÙted'Ivoire is a major source of anxiety to us  particularlysince the events of 19 September 2002. Above andbeyond its incalculable consequences in terms ofhuman lives lost  human rights violations and economicand financial damage  that serious crisis hasdemonstrated the extent to which we are so heavilyinterdependent in our subregion. This is yet anotherreason to hasten integration. We therefore deeply hopethat the CÙte d'Ivoire will return to lasting peace assoon as possible through the implementation of theLinas-Marcoussis Agreement.Just as worrisome is the tenacity with whichterrorism harries and defies the internationalcommunity  while using its own protean manifestationsto evade the most impressive and sophisticated arsenalsset up to contain it. Given the complexity of thephenomenon and the enormous obstacles to beovercome  the only valid activity is to make acollective response to what has become a threat toeveryone. In this titanic struggle  it goes without sayingthat Burkina Faso is on the side of civilization againstbarbarism. It is pledged to this position  subscribingwithout hesitation to the anti-terror measures of theUnited Nations  particularly the relevant resolutions ofthe Security Council.However  while anathematizing terrorists of allstripes  we must recognize that one of the sources ofsuch tragedy is the despair of certain peoples  thevictims of intolerable frustration and injustice that arenot being addressed quickly enough. That is why wemust welcome the rejection by most countries inCancun of the unfair trading practices that subsidizethousands of farmers of the North while preparing thecertain deaths of millions of peasants of the South. It isalso why our claims on behalf of African cottongrowers will intensify as the market becomes evermore distorted. Considering that cotton production which represents a tiny fraction of the economicactivity of the industrialized countries  is a key elementof the poverty reduction policies and a basic factor ofthe political and social stability of the States ofWestern and Central Africa  it is easy to take the fullmeasure of the bias to which we are subject. What istrue for cotton is just as true for most of theagricultural products of the developing countries. Wemust therefore work to redress such injustices.The duty of solidarity in favour of development isa moral duty for the countries of the North. Suchsolidarity is an urgently-needed response to thedestitution of our populations  especially since itaddresses peoples more than Governments. Thisimplies in no way that developing countries should betaken in charge  but that they should be helped toassume responsibility for their own futures. As forAfrica  it has come to see that its salvation lies inendogenous development and has therefore decided totake its own destiny in hand. That is the raison d''treof the New Partnership for Africa's Development  towhich the General Assembly is to devote a high-leveldebate in the near future.It will be noted that I have a personal stake in theproblems of development. I deeply believe thatdevelopment through expanded job opportunities andthe progressive elimination of poverty is a sine qua nonof peace and thus of the very survival of humankind.This conviction led me to propose that  together withthe International Labour Organization  theOrganization of African Unity   and later the AfricanUnion   begin considering the issue of employmentand the fight against poverty in Africa. A ministerialmeeting was held in Ouagadougou in April 2002 on theissue in its many manifestations with respect to jobgrowth as a means of defeating poverty in Africa.Convinced that such thinking must be carried outat the highest level  the African Union at its Maputosummit decided to convene in Ouagadougou next yearin 2004 a special summit of heads of State andGovernment on that very theme. For African leadersthis will mean turning into specific and realisticprogrammes and strategies their commitments to createemployment as a good way to combat poverty inAfrica.That meeting will be preceded by a civil societyforum  through which employers and employees  non-governmental organizations  the African diaspora institutions and development partners will make theircontributions to our collective thinking.Progress  independence and peace are intrinsicvalues of democracy. All nations and peoples are12 working to meet that undeniable need. For more than adecade  Burkina Faso has been firmly rooted in the ruleof law  oriented by political pluralism  goodgovernance and the strength of institutions thatguarantee human rights. We are pursuing this anchor ofdemocracy  convinced that there is nothing moreimportant at stake. This requirement should be true foreveryone   peoples  nations and internationalorganizations.Thus  the long-sought reform of the UnitedNations  with the democratization of the institution  itsstructures and operations  the main goal  is becomingan imperative. It must give greater and betterresponsibilities to all nations  small and large  andavoid exclusion  such as those that have been againstthe Republic of China on Taiwan for 30 years. Nothingjustifies keeping that country of 23 million inhabitantssidelined at the United Nations.We are fully aware of the immensity and thecomplexity of the trials that disturb international life but they are not insurmountable. Who could doubt that despite such trials and pitfalls  the world could renewitself  if we were to agree to order our ambitions andefforts under the auspices of the United Nations? Inthat connection  Burkina Faso  a Sahelian country aware of the continuing deterioration of the worldecological situation and its devastating affect ondevelopment  supports the idea of creating aspecialized United Nations body for the environmentpresented by President Jacques Chirac at the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.In conclusion  the clear awareness of what is atstake for the international community and  above all the commitment we have undertaken to protect futuregenerations from the scourge of war  hunger andilliteracy  are also factors that auger a more peacefuland equitable society. We believe that  in that sign ofhope and perseverance  we should always andeverywhere direct our action."
"16",638,"BGD",58,2003,"﻿I bring a message ofpeace from Bangladesh.Please allow me to congratulate the President onhis election. I wish him every success in the formidabletask of leading the United Nations to continuedrelevance and credibility in these stormy times. I amconfident that he will build upon the legacy left by hispredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan.We commend the Secretary-General for hisstewardship in these difficult times. The UnitedNations has been faced with extremely challengingsituations over the past year. We have lost one of ourmost outstanding men of peace —Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and many of his colleagues.Such senseless and despicable acts must not berepeated.The new millennium  which we all heralded withso much hope  has been plunged into turmoil.Intervening events in the last three years have changedour world forever. They have left us groping forsolutions. The events of 11 September 2001  theAfghan and the Iraq war  the open confrontationbetween Israel and Hamas and the African civil warsshape some of the dimensions of this world of disorder.Driving these crises are new realities — an all-outoffensive against terrorism  arguments for pre-emptionand unilateral action as an option for security  thetargeting of Islamic radicalism and its fall-out asreligious profiling. Somewhere  the coin of globalcooperation has been debased.Each year we come to this Assembly to reaffirmour faith in the United Nations and our commitment tothe purposes and principles of the Charter. Today  wepause to grapple with doubts that have arisen about therelevance of the world body. I hasten to add that forBangladesh  this pause is very short-lived. The cardinalquestion is not what is wrong with the United Nations but what is right with it and how we can make it serveour purposes despite seeming setbacks.Three compelling factors stand out. The first isuniversality. All 191 States of the world wish to bewithin the fold of the international community. Secondis the flip side of globalization. The bottom line is thatno one State alone can deal with the intricate problemsfacing our world — be it the dysfunction of thecollective security system  an interlocking economic monetary  financial and trade grid  the challenges ofglobalization  international terrorism  environmentaldegradation  new diseases  trans-border organizedcrime  and so on. The conclusion is clear. The UnitedNations is indispensable as the central organ for thecollective management of world affairs.The third factor is legitimacy. As has beenunderlined  the greatest strength of the United Nationsremains its legitimacy  founded on the bedrockprinciples of international law. There is no substitutefor that legitimacy. It is by this measure that we look tothe United Nations.But as the Secretary-General notes in his reporton the implementation of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals  “The war exposed deep divisions in theinternational community  with accusations of doubleagendas”. He goes on to observe that “The war in Iraqbrought to the fore a host of questions of principle andpractice that challenge the United Nations and theinternational community as a whole”. This is a sadcommentary on the state of the world body today.In contrast  we have noted that wherever theUnited Nations was allowed to take up its rightful roleand responsibility  and where it was provided withnecessary support  it has achieved success  durablepeace and stability. The experience of East Timor Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of theCongo  to name only a few  have vindicated thelegitimacy  role and relevance of the United Nations.War can be won by military might; the challenge lies inwinning peace. That is what the United Nations  withover half a century of experience in peacemaking peacekeeping and peace-building  is best placed to do.We in Bangladesh place our full trust — and havetotal confidence — in the capacity of the UnitedNations to address matters of international and globalconcern  including peace and security. We see theUnited Nations as a source of inspiration  initiative andsupport in our national  regional and internationalendeavours. It is in this forum that we establishcommon standards  universal values and sharedprogrammes. In a globalizing world  no nation is anisland; none can prosper alone. We therefore believethat today  more than ever before  the Organizationdeserves the support of all of our nations in a moreactive and demonstrable way.The Secretary-General deserves our appreciationfor bringing the focus of the Organization back to itssocio-economic agenda. We welcome his report on theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.His assessment of the progress in achieving theMillennium Development Goals is sobering. Whilesigns of progress for a given region are noted  the roadto 2015 is long for many of our nations. The report ofthe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and thePacific and the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme concerning the Millennium DevelopmentGoals  for instance  draws attention to the worryingdeclines in the flow of official development assistanceto the least developed areas and countries; it describedthat as “unacceptable and unconscionable”. The reporthas also called for reforms in the international tradesystem to help the poorest countries.Against that backdrop  the setback at the WorldTrade Organization Ministerial Conference  held atCancún  warrants an early resumption of the12negotiations. A breakthrough will require courageousdecisions and significant compromises. Ourcommitment to the Millennium Development Goalsalso requires that the negotiations be concludedsuccessfully. The global economic situation todaydictates equitable trade policies and fair trade practices which were sought in the Doha round. The economicsurvival and the socio-economic stability of manynations depend on how we handle post-Cancunchallenges. The stakes are very high for all of us  inboth the short and the long term.The development policies and programmes of ourGovernment  led by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Begum Khaleda Zia  are based on the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Our resource allocation in thesocial sector remains high  and we have prepared athree-year economic growth  poverty reduction andsocial development strategy. That is a major initialpolicy framework. We look forward to working closelytogether with our development partners in ourimplementation of those policies.The governance paradigm in recent decades hashappily embraced the fundamental tenets of democracy.In Bangladesh  we have the necessary institutions inplace. We are reforming  modernizing and expandingthem. As a thriving democracy ourselves  we supportUnited Nations efforts aimed at promoting the rule oflaw  good governance and human rights. We believethat all human rights — including the right todevelopment — should be pursued in a comprehensivemanner and with a holistic approach.The past year has seen serious developments inthe international peace and security situation especially in Africa and the Middle East. Bangladeshhas taken a positive and constructive approach to allthese issues. We have consistently supported the effortsof the United Nations in that regard. We have done thatas a matter of our commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations and its Charter.In practical terms  Bangladesh has remained amajor partner of the United Nations in its peace andsecurity mission. Over the past two decades Bangladesh has participated in United Nationspeacekeeping operations in four continents  includingthe most perilous ones. We are currently among thelargest contributors of troops and other personnel toUnited Nations peacekeeping operations  withthousands of our troops in eight Missions  in Côted’Ivoire  Western Sahara  the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  Sierra Leone  Ethiopia and Eritrea  Kosovo Timor-Leste and Georgia. Recently  we are alsocommitted to taking part in the proposed UnitedNations mission in Liberia.The people of Iraq have inherited a civilizationthat is ancient and one of the most glorious. Thepresent situation in Iraq should be resolved whilepreserving the interests of the people of Iraq andensuring long-term peace  security and stability in theregion. Bangladesh reiterates its support for thesovereignty  territorial integrity and politicalindependence of the country. We stand ready to takepart in the reconstruction and rebuilding of Iraq in thetrue spirit of brotherhood that characterizes therelationship between our two nations and peoples. Wereiterate our call for ensuring a clear  effective andcredible role for the United Nations in Iraq’s transitionto democracy and in the country’s reconstruction.Bangladesh supports the forthcoming internationalconference on Iraq’s reconstruction to be convened bythe United Nations  and we look forward to asuccessful outcome.The recent developments in the Middle East areextremely worrying. It is clear that the progress madefrom Oslo to Madrid and the present is now seriouslythreatened. The road map that the Palestinian sideaccepted with great courage has not been seriouslyaccepted or implemented by the other side.Preconditions have been imposed  making peacedifficult. The Israeli practices that are well known tothe Assembly continue to be applied in occupiedPalestine. There are gross and systematic violations ofinternational humanitarian law and fundamental humanrights. The vicious and criminal announcement of theintention to expel and even assassinate PresidentYasser Arafat calls for global condemnation in thestrongest possible terms. All of that runs counter to theglobal demand for the peaceful settlement andestablishment of a Palestinian State to live as a goodneighbour in peace and security.Bangladesh reiterates its support for the earlyestablishment of a sovereign  independent State ofPalestine in accordance with the relevant UnitedNations resolutions. We call for a more active role onthe part of the United Nations  and we ask the SecurityCouncil to assume its responsibilities towards thepeople of Palestine. We urge the diplomatic Quartet tointensify its efforts to prevent further escalation and to13address the threats against President Arafat  a NobelPeace laureate and the undisputed leader of thePalestinian people. We urge that the peace process beplaced back on track. We call for renewed effortsaimed at a comprehensive solution of the Middle Eastissues within a given time frame.International terrorism remains a scourge. In thepost-11 September 2001 context  it has taken centrestage in our global concerns. We reiterate ourunequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its formsand manifestations. Bangladesh is party to severalinternational conventions on combating terrorism  andwe are in the process of acceding to the remainingones. We are actively involved in the elaboration of anadditional protocol to the South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation’s Regional Convention onSuppression of Terrorism. The protocol will strengthenthe Convention by incorporating provisions thatinclude those contained in recent Security Councilresolutions  in particular resolution 1373 (2001).Bangladesh attaches great emphasis on disarmament.We believe that it is closely related to internationalpeace and security and has a direct relationship withdevelopment. Bangladesh is party to all internationaldisarmament treaties covering nuclear  biological chemical and conventional weapons. Seeking generaland complete disarmament is our constitutionalcommitment. International peace and security  humansecurity and the security of our planet have been theprime considerations in making our policy choices.We have supported all efforts at disarmament. Wecontinue to believe in the value of all measures  evenpartial efforts at arms control and disarmament. Ourconviction has been vindicated by our progress in thecontrol and ban of a number of weapons. Themultilateral track  including the Conference onDisarmament  needs to be revived.Bangladesh has renounced all weapons of massdestruction — biological  chemical and nuclear. Thesituation along the borders of the two nuclear-armedSouth Asian countries has been a matter of globalconcern. As a close neighbour  we too have alegitimate cause for concern. In this context  weapplaud the Secretary-General for his recent call for theelimination of all nuclear weapons. The imperatives  inview also of the threats to the existing regimes andtheir implications  do not require elaboration in thisHouse. We would thus urge a renewed consideration ofthe International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinion and thereport of the Canberra Commission on the Eliminationof Nuclear Weapons.In our region  as elsewhere  particularly since weare challenged by abject poverty  hunger  illiteracy lack of safe drinking water and disease  our prioritiesshould be socio-economic development  notnuclearization. We need to foster cooperation  notprepare for confrontation.It is with this thought that our latePresident Shaheed Ziaur Rahman conceived ofinstitutionalized regional cooperation leading to theemergence of the South Asian Association for RegionalCooperation (SAARC). We firmly believe in the valueand indeed the imperative of cooperation in our region.We hope that together we shall also be able to establisha peaceful  friendly and prosperous South Asia. Wewould draw inspiration from other parts of the worldwhere such regional economic integration has workedwell for the people of those regions.In today’s world  perhaps the most potentialsources of conflict of interest within countries andamong them would centre on natural resources  inparticular  fresh water. We call for management ofshared resources without depriving or causing damageto the economy or ecology of any of the countriesconcerned or the region.For example  any unilateral withdrawal of waterfrom international rivers should be prohibited  as suchaction would cause great damage to the environment agriculture  industry and the overall economy andecology of other countries. All actions in such areasshould conform to international law and the norms ofequity  justice and  of course  fair play. Any decisionwith regard to shared natural wealth should be throughconsultation among all concerned countries.Bangladesh identifies itself closely with theproblems of Africa. We believe in the efficacy ofSouth-South cooperation as a mutually beneficialpractice among societies at comparable stages ofdevelopment. The launching of the African Union hasbeen inspiring and that of the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD)  encouraging. We areconfident that the leadership of Africa and its peoplewill succeed in transforming the continent into apeaceful and prosperous one.We have developed greater knowledge  specialbonds and closer friendship with many African nations14through our participation in their democracy andnation-building efforts and through peacekeeping anddevelopment activities. Bangladesh will continue towork together with them in addressing the challengesof building durable peace and sustainable development.The specific problems facing the landlocked andsmall island developing countries require specialattention. We hope the Almaty Conference has createda fresh impetus to address their needs. We must alsoaccord support to countries that are in the process oftransition in their economies.The 1990s have seen a series of major UnitedNations conferences. Each has adopted an elaborateimplementable programme of action with clear andspecific responsibilities at national  regional andinternational levels. The International Conference onFinancing for Development  held in Monterrey Mexico  the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  held at Johannesburg  and the ThirdUnited Nations Conference on the Least DevelopedCountries  which met in Brussels  have reinforced theearlier commitments. Now is the time to focus ourefforts — individual and collective — to implementingthe programmes of action emanating from thoseConferences.The United Nations has  in recent years madesignificant progress in reforming itself inorganizational and substantive terms. Further progressremains to be achieved in various areas  including theSecurity Council  where reforms are essential to makethe Council more representative  democratic andeffective.Also in need for further reform are the GeneralAssembly and other major organs  including theTrusteeship Council  which could be revived. We needcertainly to go further. Bangladesh welcomes theproposal of the Secretary-General to establish a high-level panel of eminent persons for examining thechallenges to peace and security. We look forward totheir report. In this regard  we would underline theimportance of preserving multilateralism andconsensus.Decisions on budget cuts must not compromisethe functioning of the Organization and budgetaryexercises must not adversely affect the interests of thedeveloping countries  in particular the least developedones. There should be adequate provision for mandatedactivities in the developing countries.It will remain our goal to bring the UnitedNations to the centre of global development efforts.The Economic and Social Council can play a crucialrole in this regard. It must examine innovative andcreative methods in its work. Bangladesh has soughtelection to the Economic and Social Council during thecurrent session. As we have done in the past Bangladesh seeks to contribute  as a member of theCouncil  to the pursuit of the United Nations social andeconomic agenda. We hope we shall receive valuablesupport from all Members of the Assembly.The Millennium Development Goals set a numberof achievable targets in the most pressing areas.Bangladesh is committed to achieving them for ourpeople. We shall also work closely with all othernations so that these objectives are realized equally forall of us. But we aspire to go beyond. We urgecontinued focus on the implementation of the outcomeof the 1990s cycle of international conferences. Theyrepresent a comprehensive agenda for humanity for ourcentury. We must follow up on them for our presentand future generations and for the progress ofhumankind. Let us all try to create a better world for allgenerations."
"17",684,"BGR",58,2003,"﻿Allow me  at the outset  to congratulate youon your election to the presidency of the fifty-eighthsession of the General Assembly. This session will beone of the most decisive ones for the United Nations.In that spirit  I welcomed the call of the Secretary-General to heads of State and Government to activelyparticipate in the work of this session.I have come to New York to solemnly reiterateBulgaria’s steadfast support for the United Nations. Itsprinciples  objectives and the spirit of solidarity thatinspires it are at the very core of my country’s foreignpolicy. I should like to pay sincere tribute to theremarkable efforts of the men and women who workfor the Organization in every corner of the world. Theterrorist attack against the United Nations in Baghdadon 19 August reminded us that nothing that we wish todo through the United Nations would be possiblewithout the self-sacrifice of those people. I take thisopportunity to honour the memory of Sergio Vieira deMello and his colleagues  and I express once again themost sincere condolences of the people of Bulgaria totheir families.The barbaric act of 19 August sounded the alarm:terrorism is far from being vanquished; the vigilance ofall United Nations Member States must be redoubledand the effectiveness of their efforts tripled. Indeed  thevery function of the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee cannot truly be effective unless itis supported by regional and subregional organizations.It is a question of creating a genuine global anti-terrorist action network in which a high-priority rolenaturally devolves to the European Union  to the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and to theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE). In my view  it is important that all UnitedNations Member States sign and ratify as soon aspossible the 12 Conventions related to the fight againstterrorism  as the Republic of Bulgaria has done without  however  forgetting to address the origin —indeed  the root causes — of these desperate acts.At the end of this year  Bulgaria will conclude itstwo-year mandate as a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council. The conjunction of circumstancescaused our Council membership to coincide with aparticularly dynamic — indeed  dramatic — phase ininternational life  during which the very credibility ofthe United Nations was put to the test. It is obviouslytoo early to draw all the possible conclusions from thatexperience  but one thing is clear: peace and stability inthe world need the United Nations now more than everbefore. In other words  there is no alternative to theUnited Nations.We note that the credibility of the United Nations and particularly of the Security Council  have beencalled into question each time Member States haveseen their unity shaken. It is in that spirit that Bulgariais doing its best to avoid the pitfalls of discord.We fervently hope that the Council’s unity will berestored on the thorny Iraqi issue. The stability andprosperity of Iraq — which is emerging from aferocious dictatorship — are in the interest of the entireinternational community. Contributing to the country’sstabilization in a concrete way  Bulgaria is working atthe diplomatic level to find a formula that will enablethe Iraqis to recover their sovereignty as swiftly aspossible through a central and important UnitedNations role in the political process under way in thecountry.It is essential that the Council be able to providethe United Nations a clear and realistic mandate thatwould facilitate the mission of the Secretary-Generaland his associates in Iraq — a mission that is alreadyextremely complex and perilous. I believe that theprovisional Governing Council represents theinternational community’s best partner for helping theIraqis to rebuild their country. In that context  Bulgaria7hopes to resume its traditional friendly relations withIraq.My Government is very concerned as a result ofevents in the Middle East. The road map elaborated bythe Quartet remains valid and must be implemented bythe parties concerned. The Government of Bulgariareiterates its appeal to the Palestinian Authority to fullymeet its obligations under the road map to stop suicideattacks against civilians. We call on the IsraeliGovernment to stop extrajudicial executions and torenounce its plans to expel President Yasser Arafat.Although South-Eastern Europe is experiencing aperiod of peace  accelerated development and betterprospects for integration into European and Euro-Atlantic institutions  there are still points of tensionthat cannot be ignored. Obviously  I am thinking of thesituation in Kosovo  where the United Nations isplaying an irreplaceable role. Bulgaria hopes for amulti-ethnic  democratic and prosperous Kosovo  asenvisaged by Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).The recent acts of violence make us think that theenemies of that particular Kosovo have not given up. Ishould like to take this opportunity to emphasize theimportance that my country attaches to respect for andprotection of religious monuments in Kosovo. I canaffirm that the solution to the Kosovo problem can befound in dialogue — particularly dialogue betweenPristina and Belgrade — that respects the right of allthe province’s inhabitants to live in peace  whatevertheir ethnic affiliation.Two years after having had the opportunity tospeak before the General Assembly  I have theprivilege to share with Members Bulgaria’s significantprogress in attaining its principal foreign policyobjective: joining the European Union and NATO. In2004  Bulgaria will become a member of the AtlanticAlliance. We are about to conclude negotiations withthe European Union with a view to acceding to it on 1January 2007. Such progress will enable my country tobe even more effective in the implementation of theprinciples and ideals of the Charter of the UnitedNations.Beginning 1 January 2004  Bulgaria will assumethe chairmanship of the OSCE for one year. TheBulgarian chairmanship of that important regional bodywill devote priority attention to cooperation with theUnited Nations. In our view  the experienceaccumulated by the OSCE with regard to organizingand observing free and democratic elections could beas useful to the United Nations as to other regionalforums. The defence and consolidation of human rightsare naturally part of our priorities.It is difficult for me to conclude withoutmentioning what I believe to be the main threadrunning through the discourse in this Hall — the futureof the United Nations. One thing is certain: at a time ofglobalization  the sole institution of multilateralismthat is universal in nature is in fact irreplaceable. Thegreat issues of the modern world - international peaceand security  the fight against poverty and fordevelopment  the defence and promotion of humanrights  and protection of the environment and of humanhealth — cannot find lasting solutions except throughthe efforts of  and within the framework of  the UnitedNations.It goes without saying that the United Nations canmeet these formidable challenges only if it undergoes aprofound process of reform. Reform must beundertaken without violating the principles or spirit ofthe Charter. It must be carried out with determination but not in haste.The Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  hasidentified the genuine problems that we  the MemberStates  must tackle. As always  he has asked the rightquestions. My Government supports his efforts to assistMember countries in crafting a clear and far-sightedvision of the future of the United Nations  in particularby means of his idea of appointing a group of eminentpersonalities to provide ideas for such reforms.Bulgaria is ready to participate in that act of collectivereflection  which will require both courage andwisdom."
"18",729,"BHR",58,2003,"﻿It is my pleasure toexpress congratulations and best wishes to Mr. JulianHunte on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session  and to express myconfidence in his ability to ensure a productive andsuccessful session as a representative of his friendlycountry  Saint Lucia. It is also my pleasure to expressappreciation for the efforts of Mr. Jan Kavan  formerMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic  inpresiding over the fifty-seventh session and for thetireless efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  in reaffirming the contributions and the role of theUnited Nations in addressing regional and internationalissues to fulfil the will of the international community particularly by carrying out its principal responsibilityfor maintaining peace and security in the world.Today  the United Nations is nearing the end ofthe sixth decade since its establishment after theSecond World War as part of a world order accepted byall humanity to avoid the catastrophic consequences ofwar. Also today  the world is witnessing unprecedentedthreats  conflicts and crises  and it faces challenges thatthreaten the noble purposes and principles enshrined inthe Charter of the Organization  a body to which theworld's peoples look to avoid the perils of war  to freethemselves from the fear of force and oppression  andto seek justice  prosperity and stability.Since its inception  the United Nations has carriedout the responsibilities set out in its Charter in a widerange of fields that are relevant both to people's dailylives and to the international community. Thoseresponsibilities have included peacekeeping operations development programmes  conferences on theenvironment  enhancing and expanding the role ofwomen  protecting human rights  the resettlement ofrefugees  combating disease and epidemics  dealingwith national disasters  spreading a culture of peace and reaffirming international legality and the rule oflaw. However  those great achievements in people'slives and in Member States of the Organization willcount for nothing in the face of regional conflicts  civilwars and ethnic strife in many parts of the world.Many resolutions crucial to the maintenance ofpeace and stability continue to be ignored and thereforefail to serve the will of the international community.Therefore  all of us   leaders  peoples and Governments  have the moral responsibility to reactivate andimplement those resolutions. We must reflect on thereasons that they have not been implemented; we mustobjectively consider why that has taken place; and wemust study the Organization's successes and failures inthat regard. In order to overcome these shortcomings inthe current world order  we must muster the necessarypolitical will and mobilize the efforts of the States andpeoples that the Organization has comprised since itsinception. Only thus will we be able to bridge thechasm between hopes and realities and to correct themisalignment between texts and ambitions and betweenresolutions and their implementation.The Kingdom of Bahrain  under the leadership ofHis Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa  hasreaffirmed its strong belief in upholding the principlesand purposes of the Charter of the United Nations andits confidence in the Organization's ability to shoulder itshistoric and legal responsibilities to build and maintainpeace and to strengthen the foundations of peace.Bahrain's leading regional and international rolein comprehensive human development   both economicand political   has over the years been consistentlysupported by United Nations statistics and reports. Thelatest of those reports   the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme (UNDP) Human Development Report of 8July 2003   demonstrates that fact. At the politicallevel  Bahrain has moved quickly forward with theconsolidation of constitutional democracy and the ruleof law after the overwhelming popular approval of theNational Action Charter  promulgating its Constitutionof February 2002 and establishing the two Chambers ofthe National Assembly in October of that year. At thelevel of civil society and human rights and in order toincrease the pace of reform and development  Bahraintook significant steps to enhance constitutionalguarantees of civil and political freedoms and rightsthrough a royal decree establishing the ConstitutionalCourt in 2002 and through the Workers Trade Unionlaw of the same year.Reaffirming their status and role in society women in Bahrain are constitutionally entitled to voteand to run as candidates in elections  and to holdimportant positions in both the public and privatesectors. In addition to that  women participate in the18broad social activities of the Supreme Council forWomen  part of a coordinated and integrated system ofdevelopment efforts that include mother and child care achieving equality between men and women in asociety that believes in the unity of the family  valuesgender equality and respects the rights of the family.The Kingdom of Bahrain  a regional centre fortrade  with well-established social and economicfoundations based on a historic tradition of openness  istoday a hub for trade in goods and capital  in alegislative and social environment in which Bahrainis non-Bahrainis and visitors alike enjoy the stabilityrequired for investment and the movement of capital.These laws guarantee that the country remain anattractive and successful location for residence andmovement for individuals and investors. Bahrain isalso a fine example of successful economicliberalization  which has made it an attractive point inthe Gulf area for regional projects and investment.Achieving economic integration and regionalcooperation between the Gulf and Middle East regionsand other major and free trading blocs depends upon thestrong foundation of a political and strategic environmentconducive to achieving peace and cooperation.In that context  the achievement of a just andcomprehensive peace in the Middle East can be broughtabout only through a recognition of the inalienable legalrights of the Palestinian people to self-determination andthe establishment of their independent State  a return ofsovereignty over territory occupied since 1967 andcontrol over their economic resources  in accordancewith resolutions of international legality and theprinciples and aims of Middle East initiatives  and onthe basis of agreements between the two sides  whichmust be fully respected and implemented.The road map  which has gained consensus amongthe international community  supports the establishmentof an independent Palestinian State living in peace andsecurity  side by side with Israel  as envisaged byUnited States President George W. Bush in his peaceinitiative of June 2002  as reaffirmed by theinternational Quartet comprising United Nations  theUnited States  the European Union and the RussianFederation  and as agreed upon by the PalestinianAuthority. This provides a unique  historic opportunityto achieve a balanced settlement that will restore thelegitimate rights of the people and achieve a delicatebalance between the obligations of the parties and theirrights to security and peace.The recent Israeli decision to remove in principleChairman Yasser Arafat  the elected PalestinianPresident  and its threats to eliminate him  are verydangerous matters that contravenes the principles ofdemocracy and the rules of international law. This wasreaffirmed by the adoption of resolution 10/12 at thetenth emergency special session of the GeneralAssembly on 19 September 2003.Bahrain  which expresses its concern at thisdangerous Israeli decision  calls upon the Quartet andthe international community to pressure Israel to preventthe implementation of this decision  whose repercussionswould weaken current peace opportunities.Peace in the Middle East must be comprehensive;it requires the full implementation of resolutions ofinternational legality  particularly Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which call forIsraeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories including the Golan Heights  and Security Councilresolution 425 (1978)  regarding the Lebaneseterritories remaining under occupation. The MiddleEast today faces great challenges as well as uniqueopportunities and crucial moments that will determinethe future of the region for generations to come.This peace must be a single and indivisible unit.That applies both to the Middle East and to the Gulfregion. It is a fundamental and vital request by Bahrainand the Arab world that steps be taken by theinternational community  the United Nations andinfluential parties  in particular the United States  tonormalize political  economic and civilian life in Iraq so that the country can regain its Arab  regional andinternational role.In order for the Iraqis to determine their destiny within a constitutional framework that provides for therule of law and guarantees political freedom  peace andsecurity for all Iraq's citizens and ethnic groups   avital legal requirement   the Iraqis themselves mustbe allowed to rebuild economic  political and socialfoundations  as well as civil society  within an Iraqinational Government.The Kingdom of Bahrain believes that theformation of a new national Government in Iraq is animportant step for the brotherly Iraqi people towards19taking over their own affairs for a better life and for anincreased regional and international role.With regard to the Islands of the Greater andLesser Tunb and Abu Moussa  which belong to thebrotherly United Arab Emirates  we hope that thecurrent important dialogue between the United ArabEmirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran will lead to apeaceful settlement of this issue and contribute tosecurity and stability in the Gulf region.The international commitment to fightingterrorism  political violence and extremism has becomeboth an international and a national responsibility particularly since the events of 11 September 2001 which claimed the lives of many innocent people.Combating terrorism has become an internationalobligation  in keeping with the United Nationscommitment to respect human rights  foremost ofwhich are the rights to life and security.Accordingly  the Kingdom of Bahrain has backedall international and regional efforts to combat thisdangerous scourge  which threatens us all and whoseeffects can be felt around the world. Most recently  wehave witnessed the evil attack on the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad  in which Mr. Sergio Vieira deMello  Special Representative of the Secretary-General and a number of other innocent people lost their liveswhile serving the cause of international legality.In that regard  Bahrain condemns the viciousorchestrated campaign waged against a sister State  theKingdom of Saudi Arabia  by some Western media. Wewish to commend Saudi Arabia for its tangible andimportant contribution to the global campaign againstterrorism  to which it itself was exposed. Bahrain fullysupports and endorses all the measures taken by SaudiArabia in its attempts to eliminate terrorism and toconsolidate regional security and stability.The challenges of today's world order represented by the United Nations  are greater than anyparticular region or State  and encompass all areas oflife and society: the economy  education  health technology and information  particularly following theinformation and communications technology revolution in the context of the comprehensive globalization ofthought  trade  politics  war and peace.Today  it is neither possible nor acceptable within the globalization of international relations atvarious levels  for one region to have full prosperityand abundance while others suffer from poverty andwant  drought and desertification  and from incurablediseases which science and medicines cannot yet tackleand to which countries and Governments are unable toeffectively respond or provide medicine or care formillions of victims.Against the backdrop of globalization  theinternational community cannot ignore these trends.The summits  conferences and United Nations specialsessions that have been held over the years to deal withissues such as human rights  the environment development  women's rights  habitat  motherhood children  culture and civilization reflect the degree towhich those issues are connected to humanitarian cultural  social and peace and security issues. Bahrain'sactive role and contributions and effective participationin summits and General Assembly special sessions  andits involvement in the International Year of Dialogueamong Civilizations in particular  clearly show thatBahrain's national policies and programmes dovetailwith the priorities of the international community. Anexample of that was Bahrain's hosting of high-leveldialogues among religions and cultures in autumn2002. In the same vein  the Kingdom of Bahrain hosteda meeting on Islamic-Christian dialogue in October2002  at which a number of valuable recommendationswere put forward that we hope will contribute to effortsmade in this area. Bahrain also recently hosted anIslamic forum  in which a number of Islamic scholarsand clerics took part  to promote harmony amongvarious Islamic schools of thought. Bahrain willcontinue to play the role of a haven for brotherhoodand dialogue and a meeting place where variousreligions and cultures live side by side in peace.The Kingdom of Bahrain believes on the basis ofconscientious and free national will that the worldtoday urgently needs a strong and revitalized UnitedNations  as was the case in the wake of the SecondWorld War  to maintain international peace and securityand effectively contribute to enhancing the dignity andwelfare of humanity. In its quest for peace  theKingdom of Bahrain is pursuing national policies ofdevelopment and democracy to raise hope for a betterfuture that will free the individual from fear anddespair  oppression  famine  poverty and ignorance provide him with a dignified life and protect him fromnatural disasters. Our national and international policiesare closely inspired by the work of the United Nations particularly in the development  social  economic and20humanitarian fields. Those policies are based onconstitutional legality  democracy  transparency andgood governance and guarantee the respect ofindividual rights and freedoms. Bahrain aspires topeace and security within the country  the region andthe world as a whole."
"19",767,"BHS",58,2003,"﻿It is my distinct honour on behalf of the Prime Minister  the Government andthe people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas  tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this  its fifty-eighth session. We share in the celebration of theelection of a distinguished son of the Caribbean to steerthe course of this body for the next year. My delegationpledges its full support to you and to the othermembers of the Bureau in the performance of thatchallenging task. I also take this opportunity tocongratulate your predecessor  from the CzechRepublic  for his outstanding leadership of the fifty-seventh session. In addition  I should like to greet andpay tribute to the Secretary-General  who continues toserve with great distinction  honour and exceptionalcourage. My delegation salutes the Secretary-Generalfor the tremendous amount of work he has undertakensince we last convened this body.I also wish to pause at this time to pay tribute toMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  the late SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq  and toall other United Nations staff members who were killedor wounded in the deadly bombings of the UnitedNations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August and 22September 2003. We feel that loss most deeply. For us the United Nations is paramount in ensuring the rule oflaw and justice in an increasingly complex world. Anattack on the United Nations is an attack on theprinciples that bind us together as an internationalcommunity. We must stand firm against efforts toundermine those principles. There is no finer tribute tothose who lost their lives than to say today: Now  morethan ever before  we need the United Nations.Such events remind us that the world is changingdramatically. It is imperative that we  as anOrganization  be able to respond to those changesquickly and appropriately. The Bahamas welcomes theongoing efforts to revitalize the General Assembly andto reform the Security Council. It is essential that thoseprincipal bodies be able to function effectively if weare to have any credibility and if we are to attain ourgoals of maintaining international peace  security justice and development.As we are all too well aware  the process ofreform of the Security Council has stalled  as we6remain deadlocked over critical issues. The time hascome for us to take hard decisions and to agree to apractical programme of reform that takes fully intoaccount the need for more representative membershipas well as the need for a more democratic andtransparent Council. My delegation has raised thoseissues in a number of bilateral discussions with otherconcerned States  and we look forward to working withthe presidency and with other delegations as we striveto rationalize the work of the entire Organization while making it more transparent and accountable.While the problems in our own part of the worldmay not have received as much international attentionas have conflicts in other parts of the world  theirresolution is of paramount importance to us. TheCaribbean is our home  and we will spare no effort toprotect it against those who seek to destabilize theregion. The illegal transit of drugs  of weapons and ofhuman beings is an affront to us and a seriouschallenge to our national and regional security.The Bahamas is grateful for the support that theregion has obtained from the international communityin addressing these areas  but reminds Members thatwe need to continue to be vigilant. We urge theAssembly to enhance its cooperation with theOrganization of American States (OAS)  as thatregional body strives to find solutions to difficultproblems involving territorial disputes between itsmember States and as it seeks to promote human rightsand to consolidate the foundations of democracy in anumber of those States. In that context  we welcomethe OAS Special Mission for Strengthening Democracyin Haiti as a demonstration of the region’s commitmentto this field.The Bahamas is strongly committed to the furtherstrengthening of international efforts to prevent combat and eliminate terrorism in all its ugly forms and supports the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on theelaboration of a draft comprehensive convention oninternational terrorism. We are continuously reviewingour national legislation in order to strengthen it inthose areas  with particular emphasis on cracking downon the financing of terrorism. Even now  a terrorismbill is before our Parliament. It will further strengthenthe laws that limit the ability of those who wouldcommit such acts to obtain monies to fund theiractivities. The commitment of the Bahamas in this fightis unyielding.The fight against the forces that would seek toundermine the rule of law in order to achieve politicalobjectives has forced each country to review itscommitment to freedom within and outside its bordersand to determine how to protect the freedom that ourcitizens so dearly cherish.Last year  in our address to the Assembly  theBahamas reminded this body that  in our quest forsecurity  we must not undermine the very values wewant to protect  preserve and defend. But it is clear thatour conventions and established and respectedtraditions are being challenged before our very eyes and we must be careful to guard against this whileensuring that all of us are safe.The Caribbean as a whole is perhaps moresensitive than any other region to these issues ofchange and the implications for the way of life that weenjoy  characterized as it is by an abiding respect forthe privacy of the individual. It should be rememberedthat most of us in the region are small islanddeveloping States  which are especially vulnerable insecurity and economic issues. But  at the same time our peoples are fiercely proud of our independence andthe traditions of freedom connected therewith.Nowhere is the paradox of the pressure on ournow independent status more sensitive and apparentthan in the exercise of a presumptive legal authority bya body of powerful  but faceless  un-electedbureaucrats  being advanced from some of thedeveloped world’s multilateral bodies  which  in theview of many  threaten to re-impose the status ofdependence  without calling it so by name  and therebyundermining our economies.In that connection  the Bahamas is particularlyconcerned  along with its regional neighbours  aboutthe threats to its way of life  in particular as it isunderpinned by the legitimate wealth creation in itsfinancial services sector. There are those who arguethat the financial services sectors in our regionundermine economic development and wealth creationin developed States  but we maintain that the evidenceshows that the wealth accumulation facilitated by thefinancial services sectors in the region assists in thefurther development and economic growth of thedeveloped world. Our country is committed to fair andequitable trade in services on a level playing field withestablished rules  without ever-changing goal posts.7Over the next year  we shall endeavour to bringthis matter more clearly into focus by calling  in thisand other assemblies  for the convening of a globalforum on the pressures being applied to small andvulnerable States in ways that threaten theindependence of these countries and  which someargue  is unlawful interference in the internal affairs ofa nation-State. It is imperative that any rule-makingforum on these issues be open to all Member States ofthis body. Similarly  all rules emanating therefrom mustbe equitably applied.And so  as we bring these matters to the attentionof the world  we repeat the obvious. The fight againstinternational terrorism must be a major focal point ofthe Assembly  as should other matters such as the fightagainst HIV/AIDS  the protection of the environmentand the sustainable development of our fragileecosystems.The Bahamas is committed to fighting on all ofthese fronts. It is especially concerned about the futureof the world’s children and young people  asHIV/AIDS threatens to undermine decades andcenturies of progress in healthcare and in developinghealthy populations that facilitate economic growththroughout the world. The Bahamas is a leader in thefight against HIV/AIDS in the region. We urge thecontinued and unrelenting fight against the disease  torescue the world’s developing nations from the clutchesof this most recent scourge. It must take all of thepolitical will and financial power of the world’s nationsto ensure that the scourge is brought under control andthen eliminated.The Bahamas welcomes the outcome of thespecial session of the General Assembly on children held from 8 to 10 May 2002. We look forward toparticipating in the consideration of the follow-up to itsoutcome at this session. It is of critical importance thatwe reaffirm our commitment to implementing theprovisions of the outcome document  “Building a worldfit for children”  in the four priority areas of health education  protection of children from abuse exploitation and violence  and combating HIV/AIDS.Our country and its people are especially concerned even as I speak  about the safety and security  bothphysical and economic  of children everywhere  but inparticular children in the Bahamas today  and about theneed to foster an atmosphere of love and care so thatthey may grow into their rightful places in the adultworld.The Bahamas  as do many of the small islanddeveloping States  depends heavily on the environment which is the natural beauty of the land  the sea andmarine life. Tourism is our lifeblood. For the region the natural environment is the primary source ofsustenance and  therefore  we cannot allow ourenvironment to be destroyed. Doing so threatens ourvery survival. We are  therefore  acutely aware of thechallenges small island developing States face withinthe context of achieving sustainable development. Thesustainable development of our country thereforeremains of critical importance to the Government andthus  we  as a matter of the highest priority  continue totake steps to preserve and protect our environment.We are also committed to working with all theother small island developing States and the othermembers of this Organization  civil society and allother concerned stakeholders  including non-governmental organizations  to ensure that theBarbados Programme of Action is fully implemented.In that regard  the Bahamas welcomes the convening ofthe international meeting to review the BarbadosProgramme of Action  which is to take place inMauritius in 2004  and we are proud to host theinterregional preparatory meeting in Nassau  whichwill be held prior to that  from 26 to 30 January 2004.It is our hope that the renewed commitment to thisinternational meeting by all Member States will take usa step closer to honouring our commitment to theJohannesburg Plan of Implementation.It is an inescapable fact that there can be nosocial or economic development without security. Formany of us in the Caribbean in particular  this securityis being undermined by the activities of thosetrafficking in illegal drugs and weapons. By virtue ofits geographical position  the Bahamas continues to bean unwitting transit point for illegal activities including the illicit trade in narcotic drugs andpsychotropic substances. What is often overlooked bythose who are the consuming countries is that theBahamas neither produces these substances  nor does itproduce guns  nor is it the final destination for them.However  as a trans-shipment point  the Bahamasis suffering from a plethora of illegal activitiesassociated with this trade  including the deadly nexusbetween illicit drugs and the illicit trade in small armsand light weapons. These weapons  which are illegal inthe Bahamas  are contributing to an increase in violent8crime in my country and they are undermining theeconomic and social fabric of our nation.We  therefore  welcome the convening of the firstBiennial Meeting of States to consider theImplementation of the 2001 Programme of Action onSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  heldin July of this year. At the same time  we call ondeveloped countries to take the same extraordinarymeasures they use in seeking to stop drug traffickinginto their countries  to stop illegal small arms fromreaching our shores from their countries.We believe that the Charter constitutes a viableand firm foundation on which the Organization canbalance and achieve its objectives — to maintaininternational peace and security and promote economicand social progress. I wish to reaffirm the Bahamas’commitment to the principles enshrined in thatuniversal document  which will stand as a guidingbeacon as we continue to chart a rocky  yet crucial course towards peace  security and sustainabledevelopment for all of the world’s inhabitants. Whileprogress may seem meagre  we must not be swayedfrom our course  and we must remain confident that thebenefits of our activities and efforts will redound tofuture generations. Now more than ever  the worldneeds the United Nations."
"20",792,"BIH",58,2003,"﻿It is my great pleasure andhonour to address the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. At the outset  allow me  Sir  to extendmy sincere congratulations on your election and towish you every success in presiding over the Assemblyat this session.Even though we entered the new millennium withclear resolve to work for a better future  sharing avision of global solidarity and common security  whichwe expressed in the Millennium Declaration  we arewitnessing an increase in tragic events  which occuralmost daily. The tragedy that took place on 19 Augustin Baghdad is forcing us to reconsider the trueaccomplishments and values of civilization today andto re-examine the connections between poverty development  self-sustainability  respect for humanrights and the quest for true progress  as enshrined inthe United Nations Charter.Fully aware of all the global challenges facing us we must prepare for a long and exhaustingcampaign   working step by step and tackling oneproblem at a time   for poverty reduction and thedevelopment of underdeveloped countries  and againstthe scourge of terrorism  organized crime and theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction  whereversuch threats arise.The world is yet again faced with new challenges.The United Nations have yet again to make crucial2decisions in response to them. Poverty  weaponsproliferation and AIDS are among the mostdestabilizing factors on the international scene  as isterrorism. I am sincerely convinced  therefore  that thisyear's debate on all these issues  especially on the issueof terrorism  will pave the way towards a consensusamong Member States on the specific measures to betaken and thus invest the United Nations with newauthority  which is so urgently needed to counterthreats to international peace  health  stability andcollective security.Allow me to take this opportunity to stress theimportance of dialogue to resolve the most pressingissues of today. Dialogue is essential and  it goeswithout saying  only possible among those who areready for it. Dialogue based on mutual respectrepresents a key instrument for the improvement ofrelations and cooperation among peoples and countries.It is a fundamental condition for the successfuloutcome of negotiations and reconciliation ofdifferences to reach decisions that are acceptable to allsides.We in Bosnia and Herzegovina have learned thevalue of dialogue the hard way. Consider our recentpast  during which the lack of dialogue causedmisunderstanding  conflicts and hostilities that resultedin the tragic loss of human life  the exodus of youngpeople and the devastation of the economy over thepast decade. The entire international community notonly witnessed this tragedy but was called on to beactively involved to overcome it.I can only feel proud that I am addressing theAssembly today as the head of State of Bosnia andHerzegovina  which the international community nolonger views as a crisis area. Rather  it has become aState that actively participates in stabilizationprocesses in the region and throughout the world. Fromthe Central European Initiative and the South EastEuropean Cooperation Process to United Nationspeacekeeping operations  Bosnia and Herzegovina iscontributing to regional  European and world peace andprosperity. At the same time  committed to reforms  westrive to lay the ground for overcoming the aftermathof recent conflicts and are devoted to respect for thehuman rights of all individuals and peoples  as well astheir cultural  religious and other diversities.I would like to point out that the authorities ofBosnia and Herzegovina are giving priority toadvancing the political and economic stability of thecountry and enhancing its international role through theimplementation of planned reforms. I am convincedthat we in Bosnia and Herzegovina  in partnership-likecooperation with the High Representative and otherrepresentatives of the United Nations and internationalinstitutions  will find the best solutions for theimplementation of reforms and the most adequate legalsolutions for the realization of a faster economicdevelopment of the country and the creation of realchances for the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovinainto the European Union.In the process of Bosnia and Herzegovina'saccession to European integration  we have justcompleted discussions with the European Commission(EC) within the framework of the feasibility study.Working on the EC's tasks has been a positiveexperience in building partnerships with theinternational community. We are now entering a newphase with full confidence  convinced that the initiatedprocess will result in the final fulfilment of allconditions for membership in the European Union(EU). This comes as a result of the decision of theBosnia and Herzegovina authorities to take theirdestiny into their own hands and to respond to majorchallenges such as the fight against organized crimeand corruption  the strengthening of institutions conducting legal system reforms  implementation ofstructural reforms and reduction of the unemploymentrate.We are committed to following the path of provensuccess strategies in order to overcome as soon aspossible our difficult heritage from the past and to startbuilding  with mutual understanding  a modern Bosniaand Herzegovina. Only in this way may we pass on tofuture generations the message of worldwide peace anddevelopment  based on mutual understanding andtolerance.This year Bosnia and Herzegovina took over thechairmanship of the South East European CooperationProcess. We are content with the positive steps taken both in the stabilization and in the overall developmentof the Balkan region and integration of the WesternBalkans into the Euro-Atlantic structures. I am pleasedthat mutually harmonized agreements and jointpriorities are being fully supported by the EU  by theStability Pact  by many friendly countries in the worldand by international financial and other organizations. Iam all the more pleased in view of the fact that the3countries of the region confirm their readiness andcommitments to mutual cooperation and the building ofgood neighbourly and regional relations.I must stress the fact that there are still manyopen issues and incomplete tasks in Bosnia andHerzegovina. I am convinced that Bosnia andHerzegovina will succeed in the process ofstrengthening joint institutions and in establishing astrong legal framework. We are committed to fulfil allBosnia and Herzegovina's international obligations particularly those related to cooperation with theInternational Criminal Tribunal for the formerYugoslavia  participation in the world's fight againstorganized crime  respect of human rights  return ofrefugees and displaced persons  full implementation ofproperty laws and the return of property to its rightfulowners.Our absolute priority is the fight against terrorismand organized crime  and  at the international level  weare of the view that the United Nations and the SecurityCouncil should play the leading role in that fight.Together with other countries  Bosnia and Herzegovinaintends to actively tackle this issue  which represents athreat to the entire civilized world. Fully committed tothis fight  we in Bosnia and Herzegovina  with theassistance of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia andHerzegovina  which successfully completed its missionlast December  have established one of the mostmodern state border services. In addition  we haveimproved the legal framework and we are fightingactively against the trafficking of women and children this modern form of slavery. Our efforts have recentlybeen recognized by the United States Government  andas result  we have been moved to category B.The issue of missing persons is particularlysensitive and difficult for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Wehave to make additional efforts  with the assistance ofthe international community  to at least give theopportunity to grieving families to discover thewhereabouts of their loved ones  what happened tothem  where they were buried  and to identify theirremains and lay them to rest with dignity.Allow me to point out that Bosnia andHerzegovina is now a much better place for businessthan it was a year ago  due to the reforms completedduring this year in particular. I would like to mentionthe example of the Bulldozer Committee that redrafted50 laws and regulations that were discouraging privateinitiative and suffocating any sense for business.Having created a more favourable legal framework andbusiness environment  Bosnia and Herzegovina hasbecome a better place for investment opportunities andemployment.Nevertheless  we must not lie back  we mustfurther accelerate the process of economic reforms.The continuation of the privatization process andfurther reforms of the judicial system are of utmostimportance for creating a more secure businessenvironment in order to open the country to directforeign investments.We are in the process of rearranging andsimplifying the tax system through the establishment ofa single custom system and a value-added tax  thuseliminating corruption and white-collar crime. In orderto encourage the entire process of the creation of aninvestment-friendly environment in Bosnia andHerzegovina  in February 2004 we will be hosting aninternational investment conference in Mostar  wherewe will present the new economic situation in Bosniaand Herzegovina.Furthermore  particularly during recent days  wehave been finalizing the reforms of the armed forcesand the State intelligence service  having realized that amodern security system is a pre-condition for Bosniaand Herzegovina's full participation in commonsecurity arrangements  through membership in thePartnership for Peace and the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.At this moment we attach paramount importanceto reforms and the modernization of the educationalsystem in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is our firm beliefthat  by caring for the individual and by ensuring thecollective right to get an education in one's ownlanguage and alphabet  we will enhance mutualdialogue and tolerance  in order to preserve themulticultural society of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Next year we also plan to finalize thereconstruction of the Old Bridge in Mostar  where weare planning once again to celebrate the reunion ofboth banks of the river and its people. This is our wayof sending a global message to all civilizations: thisbridge is built of versatile cultural materials  it is analloy of various traditions and it is the paradigm of a4solution that is possible and evident despite theconflicts and differences in the world. I hereby inviteyou to make use of this opportunity and make thisbridge a symbol of unity for the next year.Elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina were heldalmost a year ago. This time  the internationalcommunity fully supported the election results. Theinternational community expressed its readiness tosupport democratic processes in Bosnia andHerzegovina and we  the elected authorities  have madeour choice through reforms that have as their aim amodern Bosnia and Herzegovina.We are committed to taking ownership  to bearingmore responsibilities. During his 16 months in office the High Representative imposed in the first eightmonths twice as many laws as he did in the second. Weare pleased to note the trend of reduction of imposedlaws this year  but our ultimate goal is a Bosnia andHerzegovina that is a member of the EU. This Bosniaand Herzegovina has its destiny in the hands of its owncitizens and is on the road of no return towardsEuropean integration  with more power in the engine ofits own institutions and less power in the tow truck ofthe United Nations High Representative. Above all this Bosnia and Herzegovina has a constitution cut outto the measure of its peoples and to each and everycitizen.Allow me to conclude by looking into the future.We have presented our candidature for membership inthe Security Council for 2010  reaffirming ourcommitment to build a State that may share its positiveexperience and participate actively in the world'speace-building  by that time  we hope  within thesystem of a reformed and reinvigorated United Nations.We are already participating in the United Nationspeacekeeping operations in Ethiopia and Eritrea  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Timor-Leste.We are ready to send our transport unit  militaryobservers and civilian police officers to Liberia.By the year 2009  we are planning to fulfil theconditions set forth for EU membership  fullycommitted to the development of Bosnia andHerzegovina based on stability  the rule of law democracy and a market economy. We are graduallybecoming recognized for our implementation ofdemocratic and economic reforms and for harmonizingour priorities with international standards. Next year from 15 to 17 May 2004 in Sarajevo  we are planningto host the Second Intergovernmental Conference forChildren in Europe and Central Asia  together with theGovernment of Germany and the United NationsChildren's Fund. The Conference is the continuation ofregional consultations held in Berlin in 2001  and the2002 General Assembly special session devoted tochildren.Today  Bosnia and Herzegovina is a sustainableState  albeit with the generous contributions andassistance from the international community  theUnited Nations and its most prominent leading figures including the late Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  who willbe remembered in Bosnia and Herzegovina as the headof Civil Affairs of the United Nations mission. Weremain ever so grateful to those who lent us their handsin times of need and despair.Today  Bosnia and Herzegovina is a State well onits way to being part of Europe  with the ambition tocreate an environment where the return of refugees anddisplaced persons will not be halted for political oreconomic reasons  but will be encouraged for reasonsof economic prosperity and sustainability that will beachieved through the efforts of all of us."
"21",839,"BLR",58,2003,"﻿Tobegin  I would sincerely like to congratulate you onyour election to this very important and difficultposition as President of the Assembly and I wish youevery success.This year  the United Nations has come close tothe most dangerous brink in its more than a half-century of history. This is not only and not so much theIraqi crisis per se. That crisis has become but amanifestation of what has really threatened the entiresystem of world order created after World War II. Thebasis of this world order is the unconditional primacyof international law over the aspirations of individualStates.Take that away  and the world will again  as incenturies past  become hostage to the power of themighty. This will not merely throw us backward. Thebeginning of the twenty-first century differs from pastdecades and centuries in that the existence of a singleglobal super-Power will make the rule of the mightyglobal in both scale and consequence.“We all have to recognize — no matter howgreat our strength — that we must deny ourselvesthe license to do always as we please. ... Unlesswe are all willing to pay that price  noorganization for world peace can accomplish itspurpose”.These words  spoken by United States President HarryTruman  are as urgent today as they were back in 1945.We call upon everyone to be guided by them today asthey were when our Organization was being set up.Belarus’ contribution to the creation of the UnitedNations and a new system of international security wasone-third of our population  who gave their lives forthe victory of peace over war and the victory of thecoalition of the future over the coalition of the past.That is exactly why we in Belarus today sense withspecial urgency the danger of the erosion of a just andstable world order.Let us preserve the coalition of the entire worldfor global peace. Let us not allow the Security Council as the main body for maintaining peace and security  tobe replaced by “coalitions of the willing” that use forcewithout Council authorization. Let us not forget thatonly a just peace can prove to be a stable peace.Belarus welcomes the emerging effort to return tothe United Nations its legitimate role in settling theIraq issue. This reflects the recognition that a militaryforce or an occupying force cannot solve the problemof nation-building. We hope that this will also becomerecognition of the fact that a preventive war makes apoor foundation for security.We hope that a new Security Council resolutionon Iraq being worked out now will strengthen thecentral role of the United Nations in the earliest andurgent return to the people of Iraq of its sovereignty  itsright to independently determine its political future andits right to natural resources  so that constitutionalprocesses and later election processes can beimplemented by Iraqis in the interest of Iraqis.At the same time  Belarus is worried by thepattern that is dangerous both for the future of theUnited Nations and for international peace and istaking shape on the most urgent issues: the SecurityCouncil and the United Nations are ignored when9unauthorized military action is taken  and are theninvited back only in the aftermath  when theirauthority  experience and resources are seen asessential for rebuilding a peaceful life. That is whathappened in Kosovo and what is happening in Iraqtoday.Belarus believes in the United Nations. Webelieve that it has a central role to play in the mosturgent issues of today and that it cannot be replaced.We believe in the constant values and justice of thesupremacy of international law and the fundamentalprinciples of its Charter. New global challenges andthreats merely reaffirm that these values areindispensable.As a founding Member of the United Nations Belarus sees the need to modernize and adapt theUnited Nations mechanisms and structures to therealities of this new century.Of special importance is the reform of the UnitedNations Security Council. As has been correctly notedby the Secretary-General  it is not only a question ofenlarging the Council’s membership. Life itself has puton the agenda of the reform process many otheraspects  including the Council’s capacity to react tothreats to peace and security.It is essential to achieve a reasonable balance inthe interrelationship between the main United Nationsbodies  inherent in its Charter. A stronger role of theGeneral Assembly is an important direction forincreasing the Organization’s efficiency.The potential of the presidency of the GeneralAssembly is underused. As an officer elected by theentire United Nations  the President of the GeneralAssembly can and should be called upon to serve as acatalyst and organizer in searching for solutions to theproblems the world and the Organization are facing.It is necessary to reform and improve theactivities of the Economic and Social Council as thecoordinator of United Nations efforts in economic social and related areas. Having accumulatedconsiderable experience working in the Bureau of theCouncil  the Republic of Belarus is ready to make aconstructive contribution to these efforts. Those wereexactly the considerations that guided Belarus when itproposed its candidature to Council membership for2004-2006.The United Nations should pay priority attentionto developing international law: new realities ininternational politics as well as new universal worldproblems have to be taken into consideration. Belarusis a party to all key multilateral treaties regulatingvarious spheres of international life. This year we haveacceded to a further number of such treaties  includingthe United Nations Convention against TransnationalOrganized Crime and its protocols.The international fight against terrorism thatunfolded after the tragic events of 11 September 2001rightly placed the United Nations in the centre ofantiterrorist efforts. The work of the Security Council’sCounter-Terrorism Committee has helped in theforming of a global coalition under the aegis of theUnited Nations to counter terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations.We must  however  be realistic: force alone cannever eradicate the abominable phenomenon ofterrorism  at least  not forever. Injustice  inequality andindifference will bring it forth again and again  just likethe accumulation of electricity in the atmosphereproduces a lightning bolt. The Secretary-General isright when he states that in order to maintain agenuinely global coalition for fighting terrorism theworld must also see progress on other fronts of thestruggle for a humane and just world order. Herein liesan important challenge for the United Nations  forpermanent members of the Security Council and for allMembers of the Organization.The principal contribution of Belarus to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and to conventionaldisarmament has been universally recognized. Ourconcern is therefore all the greater with regard to thegradual erosion of multilateral norms in disarmamentand the stagnation of the international bodies  above allthe negotiation mechanisms  in charge of internationalsecurity and disarmament.From this rostrum  we join in the appeal not toallow the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.This is a most important task. It should be noted  thatfor many years  Belarus has initiated efforts to preventthe development of new types of such weapons.However  has everything possible been done in recentyears  including by the most militarily powerful States to strengthen the multilateral non-proliferation regimein all its most important aspects? Is everything beingdone to that end today? An appropriate answer to that10question would be the ratification by all permanentmembers of the Security Council of the ComprehensiveNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.The activities of multilateral bodies in the area ofdisarmament should be adapted to new realities. Weproceed from the assumption that the United Nationsshould draw up a clear-cut list of priority directions inensuring international security and generateprogrammes to overcome real threats to mankind. Theresolutions we adopt should contain clear directives toexisting forums and structures in the areas ofinternational security  arms control  non-proliferationand disarmament. Only with this approach will we beable to stop the devaluation of such notions as peace security and stability.I wish to inform delegations that Belarus hasrecently taken another responsible step to strengthenthese values. While possessing the world’s seventhlargest arsenal of anti-personnel landmines  theRepublic of Belarus has joined the Ottawa Conventionon their prohibition. We count on internationalassistance in their elimination.The norms of international law play a principledrole in shaping a just international economic order. Theobjective of providing equal access to world marketsand to the benefits of the process of globalization forall States  particularly developing countries andcountries with economies in transition  hasunfortunately not been achieved. That is why we urgeMember States to pay unabated attention to the processof developing the norms and rules of international tradeand commercial activities in the interests of commonwell-being.After the recent failure of the MinisterialConference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) inCancún  the leading economic Powers shouldunderstand the risks of delaying the negotiations withinthe WTO both on the issue of new rules as well as onthe problem of new membership. One should not forgetthat providing an opportunity to all States to use thebenefits of the multilateral trading system is in thelong-term interests of peace  security and stability.I wish to inform the General Assembly that  as itscontribution to ensuring access for developingcountries and least developed countries to the worldmarket  Belarus has made a decision to extendunilateral trade preferences to a large number of suchStates. Our country’s National Centre of TechnologyTransfer has a high potential for innovation and isready for extensive cooperation with all interestedStates. Its institutional capacities are intended to meetnot only our requirements  but the interests ofdeveloping countries as well.Let me touch upon the problem of theconsequences of the largest technogenic catastrophe ofthe twentieth century  the disaster at the Chernobylnuclear power plant. We are grateful to the leadershipof the Secretariat for its ongoing activities to mobilizeinternational support in that direction. This year hasbeen marked by the establishment of the InternationalChernobyl Research and Information Network and ofthe international Chernobyl Forum by the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency.Jointly with the delegations of other affectedStates  we have prepared for this session a draftresolution on strengthening international cooperationand coordination of efforts in studying  mitigating andminimizing the consequences of the Chernobyldisaster. The document seeks to ensure theimplementation of a new United Nations strategy onChernobyl. We hope that it will be supported by alldelegations.The Republic of Belarus also proposes aninitiative to hold in Minsk in 2006 an internationalconference timed to coincide with the twentiethanniversary of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclearpower plant. The main objectives of the conferencewill be the search for ways to provide normal livingconditions to people living in affected areas and anexchange of experiences in solving the problems ofsustainable development in those regions. We invite allinterested Member States and internationalorganizations to take part in preparing and holding thisevent.In the area of counteracting international crime the fight against human trafficking and illegal drugtrafficking should become one of the United Nationspriorities. Our country has been actively participatingin international efforts to stop the modern slave anddrug trades. Located at the crossroads of the mostimportant transportation corridors between Asia andEurope  Belarus offers efficient interaction in solvingthese problems with all our neighbours and  especially with the European Union. Common efforts are neededto fight common problems; that way  everybody wins.The global scope of problems demands a globalscale of interaction involving all States withoutexception. Mankind made itself the master of the worldafter having become homo sapiens — sentient man. Inorder to become the master of its destiny  and not ahostage to challenges and threats  humanity shouldbecome humanitas sapiens — sentient humanity."
"22",874,"BLZ",58,2003,"﻿My delegation celebrates thewisdom of the United Nations in choosing one of ourdistinguished Caribbean statesmen  Mr. Julian Hunte to preside over this fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. I assure you  Sir  that the energy andindustry that you will bring to our work will producevery meaningful results in this very important session.We continue to be fortunate to have the guidanceand strength of our Secretary-General  whose skill andcompassion are especially needed today. His words lastTuesday echoed strong and true  and we should all takeheed.And speaking of all  we need to respect theprinciple of universality of our Organization. The timehas come to admit Taiwan to membership of the UnitedNations. Taiwan has proven itself to be an exemplarymember of the international community with a deepsense of solidarity with small and poor nations.Belize’s Prime Minister has said:“When we turn our attention to theinternational stage there is greater cause foranxiety. Let us ask ourselves: After all thedevelopments in building the international systemand crystallizing international law from 1945 tothe present  which of the following fundamentalprinciples are respected in practice or indeed safein theory: the peaceful settlement of disputes; theright to self-determination  sovereignty andterritorial integrity; non-interference in theinternal affairs of States; the right of peoples tohave the social and political system of theirchoice; respect for social  economic and politicalhuman rights; not to use force or the threat offorce to settle disputes; respect for theinternational rule of law; abiding by the Charterof the United Nations; and working towards aworld governance based on multilateralism andthe rule of reason  rather than of force?“Which of those is safe? Indeed  in theinternational arena … we do seem to be in freefall towards barbarism”.Barbarism may not be new  but there does seemto be a greater tolerance for it and we do seem to be22more powerless to contain it. In a world riddled withfear and dominated by terrorism  including Stateterrorism  we need to concentrate on what needs to bedone to save our humanity.As we contemplate the international arena  withmultilateralism under threat and the development ofpeoples blocked by the practices of the rich andpowerful  we can take comfort in one thing — that yes  in the end ideas are more powerful than arms. Andour ideas — we the United Nations of the world — areclearly and powerfully set out in our Charter. Yes  theCharter needs reform; we need urgently to democratizeour practice. Small States make up the majority of ourmembership and elementary democracy demands thatwe have a greater say than our Charter presently allowsus  but the basic principles of the Charter remain valid.The fundamentals are in place.Article 1 of the Charter states the fundamentalpurpose of the United Nations: To maintaininternational peace and security  and to that end to takeeffective collective measures for the prevention andremoval of threats to the peace  and for the suppressionof acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace.Article 24 of the Charter confers on the SecurityCouncil primary responsibility for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Under Article 42 should the Security Council consider that measuresshort of the use of force would be inadequate or haveproved to be inadequate  it may take such action by air sea  or land forces as may be necessary to maintain orrestore international peace and security. Such actionmust  of course  be agreed collective action  notunilateral action.I ask members of the Assembly: Is there any partof that we do not understand? It seems perfectly simpleand clear to us small States  which depend on theUnited Nations Charter and on respect for internationalprinciples and international law for our very existence.We are confronted with the question: Are we as anOrganization irrelevant? And I say: only if we makeourselves irrelevant. And we do that only if we aredetermined to self-destruct.We can call here for many lofty objectives  ascontained in our Millennium Development Goals. Wecan pronounce on the many injustices facing so manypeoples and countries in the present worlddispensation  but all of that would be futile if our veryUnited Nations should cease to be effective or becomeirrelevant. That is why I have restricted my statementto one plea to nations large and small  powerful orweak: Keep the United Nations alive  respect itsCharter  abide by agreed international principles andinternational law. That is all we ask  nothing more.Above all  let us not give up what it has cost us somuch time and effort  so much blood  to bring to amodest but important stage — our multilateral system.All civilized nations would surely agree to thisplea rather than plunge the world into barbarism.Multilateralism or chaos. Long Live the UnitedNations!"
"23",921,"BOL",58,2003,"﻿Allow me to congratulate the President on his electionas President of this session of the General Assembly.We wish him every success.At the same time  it is a pleasure to greet theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  whose efforts forpeace and cooperation between nations we highlyvalue. For that reason  I take this opportunity toexpress  on behalf of the people of Bolivia and myGovernment  our sorrow and solidarity in the face ofthe terrorist attacks against the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad  which once againdemonstrates intolerance for and lack of understandingof a peacekeeping mission  which is the only possiblepath in our search to resolve conflicts.This attempt strengthens our resolve to fightwithout giving any quarter against terrorism in any ofits forms  but  at the same time  it shows us the need tosupport the joint efforts of the nations of the worldwith policies that are debated and adopted at the UnitedNations. This Organization and its bodies are afundamental forum where our voice and that of allcountries of the world can be heard. For that reason  wealso believe that reforms are required to give theSecurity Council more flexibility and balance in orderto guarantee greater participation in the decision-making process.The terrible episodes that we have recentlyexperienced have forced us once again to reconsiderthe path that many nations have set for themselves intheir vision for development. It is a dangerous mistaketo believe that we can coexist in a world of isolated andclosed compartments. It is not possible to generategrowth and well-being for a privileged few and expectthat the excluded great majority will look on silentlyfrom the fringes of that reality. In our opinion  the onlypossible path to confront the future is the paradigm ofequity.For over a half century  Bolivia has been openingdemocratic and participative spaces for its people. Anation such as ours  where 62 per cent of the citizensidentify themselves as indigenous  must do away withthe social  economic and ethnic exclusion that has beena historic millstone that our elite refused to eliminate.The process begun by us with the revolution of 1952with its successes and set-backs of greater or lessermagnitude is part of our challenge today. This vision isalso essential to defending the human rights of thosecitizens who have been marginalized throughout thecourse of our history.For one year now  under the administrationheaded by President Sanchez de Lozada  within theframework of a pluralistic Congress with a verysignificant percentage of indigenous representativesand of very different ideological positions  we areworking to overcome levels of poverty that arethreatening to break down the buttresses of order andthe population’s faith in democracy  which has beenachieved with great sacrifice by the people of Bolivia.Our Government has broadened its political baseby integrating another political party  Nueva Fuerza26Republicana  into the alliance between the MovimientoNacionalista Revolucionario and the Movimiento de laIzquierda Revolucionaria in an effort to face an acuteeconomic crisis that has taken the form of a persistentrecession  which  fortunately  is beginning to reverseitself.We have implemented a programme thatcombines efforts to increase State revenues through anincrease in public investment in order to stimulate theeconomy and improve private contribution  create jobsand decrease social inequality. We have given priorityto the most vulnerable sectors of our society withmeasures such as an annual solidarity bonus for allcitizens over age 65 and the consolidation of freemedical insurance covering mothers and children underthe age of five. This task is linked to achieving theMillennium Development Goals  to which we aredeeply committed.In February of this year and a few days ago  mycountry lived through serious episodes of violence which have forced us to reflect. We are aware of thefact that the last 21 years of democracy — the longestuninterrupted period in our history — are at stake aswe face the legitimate pressure exercised by themarginalized sectors of our society  who deserve ourattention. Unfortunately  in spite of the new democraticparliamentary participation  we have not yet been ableto sustain a real and enriching dialogue about our mostsevere problems. I am convinced that one of ourprincipal tasks is to generate a fundamental change inthe behaviour of political parties and of everypolitician  but a less radical and more rational attitudeof the social sectors in their relationship with the Stateis also indispensable.We are going through a very difficult time  whencompliance with the law and respect for the authorityof the State threaten to collapse. Loss of trust in theseessential elements of democracy is one of the greatestdangers to the future of our society  which will onlyachieve its goals if it has a credible and legitimateadministration that acts with authority. We areassuming our responsibility in this area. It is the onlyway we can be tolerant of the ideas of others. Our aimis the urgent search for a true national encounterthrough national dialogue  an issue that we are deeplycommitted to  despite the difficulties that must beovercome.One year ago  in this very forum  I said that ourGovernment would make the fight against corruption aState policy. Today I am proud to say that we arefulfilling that commitment. We have established theSecretariat to Combat Corruption  whose tasks arecarried out from within the very core of the State  withbroad participation from all levels of society  throughcitizen networks and mobile brigades. In one year ofwork  we have made public cases of corruptioninvolving State authorities. Corrupt civil servants havebeen given prison sentences and others are currently ontrial for illicit acts. Furthermore  we have expanded theprogrammes for better management of public entities.We are launching a reform of the judiciary strengthening a culture in which the rule of law isbased on the concept of justice for all. We are alsopromoting a strategy that will transform political andproductive institutions  especially those of the informalsector  and promoting governance that is compatiblewith fair human development opportunities.Our commitment to fighting illicit drugtrafficking remains unchanged. For our country  thistask has meant high social  political and economiccosts  paid for with the blood of the Bolivian people.The support of the international community in thisfight has been an incentive and a security factor.However  our efforts require further support proportional to the scope of its effect  in Bolivia aswell as in those societies where drug consumptionremains a priority problem to be solved. We shallcontinue to honour our commitments  but we shall alsocontinue to insist that the international communityfully assume the concept of shared responsibility.For Bolivia  international assistance represents aninvaluable support. From this rostrum  I wish to thankthe nations and organizations that offer theircooperation  but I emphasize the fact that the mosteffective assistance is that which respects the decisionsand plans of those countries that receive it. Imposingrigid and unilateral prescriptions often generates moreproblems than it solves.Our continent  Latin America  has seen its role inthe international concert diminished. The continentfaces several core problems  one of which is the siegeof its own democracy by poverty  corruption  inequalityand a globalization process of which it is part  but thathas not always generated positive results for the area.Integration is the only possible solution if we wish toface the future with optimism. Bolivia is working27diligently in this direction  not only because it is a partof subregional blocs  such as the Andean Communityand the Common Market of the South — of which it isan associate member — but also because it promotesthe integration of both regional groups into one SouthAmerican body that will provide greater benefits andtargeted influence in the region. As hosts for thethirteenth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of Stateand Government  Bolivia is working for the genuinestrengthening of that mechanism  which unites theheads of State and Government of a group of countrieswhose cultural  political and economic importancethroughout the world is continuously growing.In this context  the decisions that will be made toestablish the Free Trade Agreement of the Americasmust seek a still uncertain balance for the group ofmember countries  taking into account the enormousgap between the first Power in the world and thepoorest nations of the continent  in a way that will trulybenefit everybody. This will be possible if and when beyond trade issues  we prioritize the transport andcommunications infrastructures  science  the transfer oftechnology and education.The difficulties emerging from the worldwidedebate on international trade are proof once again ofthe gap to be closed between rich and poor nations. Ifequity is the foremost exigency of mankind  the onlytrue and effective response in order to achieve it is afair trade agreement. Poor countries demand access forour products to wealthy countries under fair conditions.This urgent claim is linked to a sustained policy ofsubsidies and protectionism for key production sectorson the part of the most developed nations. Herein liesone of the basic causes of poverty and social tensionsin the least favoured societies.The issue of anti-personnel mines is a verysensitive one for Bolivia  not only as a matter ofprinciple — inasmuch as these lethal artefacts continueto kill or permanently maim people throughout theworld — but also because many such mines have beenplanted along our borders. We vehemently request theGovernments responsible for planting these mines tocontinue their removal and destruction until the areasinvolved are totally free of mines.Today  more than ever  I wish to confirm beforethis Assembly that Bolivia will never waive its justclaim of sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean inasmuch as we were established as an independentrepublic with a sea coast. This claim  which we havebeen making for over a century  is a product not ofstubbornness or caprice  but of the lack of economicresources and huge geographic obstacles thatundermine our ability to compete. Our landlockedcondition is a deterrent to our growth and the well-being of our citizens  as proven by the analysis of thechallenges faced by all landlocked countries.Reintegration of our condition as a maritime nation is amatter of justice and we cannot set it aside. We willtherefore continue to call for solidarity and supportfrom the community of nations. Our vocation and ourdestiny to be integrated with and economicallycomplemented by our neighbours compels us to exhortthe Government and people of Chile to act with a viewto the future and to repair a historical wrong that hasanchored Bolivia to the past century.We are living through difficult times  complexand full of uncertainty. It is our obligation to stop andquestion the validity of many of the premises in whichwe believe. No question and no form of questioning issuperfluous at a time such as this  in which the searchfor a clearer and fair horizon is a life or death necessityfor our planet."
"24",968,"BRA",58,2003,"﻿Let my firstwords before this world parliament be of confidence inthe human capacity to overcome challenges and tomove towards higher forms of partnership  both withinand among nations. On behalf of the Brazilian people  Ireaffirm our belief in the United Nations. Its role inpromoting peace and social justice remainsirreplaceable.I pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan forthe leadership that he has shown in defence of a worldunited through respect for international law andsolidarity among nations.The Assembly convenes under the impact of thebrutal attack on the United Nations Mission inBaghdad  which took the life of its head officer  theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights  our compatriotSergio Vieira de Mello. Sergio's renowned competencewas nurtured by the only weapons in which hebelieved: dialogue  persuasion and  above all  concernfor those who are most vulnerable. On behalf of theUnited Nations  he showed a tolerant  peace-loving andcourageous humanism that mirrors Brazil's libertariansoul. Sergio's sacrifice  and that of his colleagues  mustnot be in vain. We can best honour his memory byredoubling our efforts to protect human dignitywherever it is threatened.I warmly greet Mr. Julian Hunte  who was electedPresident of the Assembly at a particularly gravemoment in the history of the United Nations. Theinternational community faces enormous political economic and social challenges requiring anaccelerated pace of reform. Only thus will ourcollective decisions and actions be truly respected andeffective.In my nine months as President of Brazil  I haveconferred with leaders of all continents  and I havesensed in them a deep concern to defend and strengthenmultilateral institutions. The improvement of themultilateral system is a necessary counterpart todemocratic practice within nations. Every nation thatpractices democracy must strive to ensure that ininternational affairs  decision-making is equally open transparent  legitimate and representative. Thetragedies that have befallen Iraq and the Middle Eastcan be overcome only within a multilateralframework   one in which the United Nations is givena central role.In Iraq  the prevailing climate of insecurity andgrowing tension makes national reconstruction an evenmore complex task. That impasse can be overcomeonly under the leadership of the United Nations  leadership not only in re-establishing acceptablesecurity conditions  but also in guiding the politicalprocess towards the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty assoon as possible. We must not shy away from ourcollective responsibilities. A war can perhaps be wonsingle-handedly  but peace   lasting peace   cannotbe secured without the support of all.Two years later  the images of the barbaric attackon 11 September still haunt us. There is acommendable willingness today to adopt moreeffective measures to deal with terrorism  withweapons of mass destruction and with organized crime.Unfortunately  there are also worrisome signs of anattempt to discredit the Organization and even to divestthe United Nations of its political authority. Let therebe no ambiguity on this subject: no matter howinvaluable its humanitarian work  the United Nations6was conceived to do more than simply to clear awaythe rubble of conflicts that it was unable to prevent.Our central task is to preserve people from the scourgeof war  to negotiate settlements inspired by theprinciples and objectives of the San Francisco Charter.Let us not place greater trust on military might than onthe institutions we created with the light of reason andthe vision of history.Reform of the United Nations has become anurgent task  given the present risks to the internationalpolitical order.The Security Council must be fully empowered todeal with crises and threats to peace. It must thereforebe equipped with the tools for effective action. Aboveall  its decisions must seen as legitimate by thecommunity of nations as a whole. Its composition  inparticular as concerns permanent membership  cannotremain unaltered almost 60 years later. It can no longerignore the changing world. More specifically  it musttake into account the emergence on the internationalscene of developing countries. They have becomeimportant actors that often exercise a critical role inensuring the pacific settlement of disputes.Brazil believes that it has a useful contribution tomake. It seeks not to advance an exclusive conceptionof international security  but rather to give expressionto the perceptions and aspirations of a region that todayis a hallmark of peaceful coexistence among itsmembers and that is a force for international stability.Given the support we received in South America andbeyond  Brazil is encouraged to continue advocatingfor a Security Council that better reflects contemporaryreality.We also favour an Economic and Social Councilcapable of bringing about a fair and just economicorder. It is crucial that the Economic and SocialCouncil regain the role bestowed upon it by thefounding fathers of the Organization. We wish to seethe Economic and Social Council cooperate activelywith the Security Council in preventing conflicts and innation building.The General Assembly  in turn  must bestrengthened politically so as to focus on priority issuesand avoid duplication of effort. The General Assemblyhas fulfilled a historically important role by conveningmajor conferences and other meetings on human rights the environment  population  women's rights  racialdiscrimination  AIDS and social development.However  the General Assembly should not hesitate toassume its responsibilities for maintaining internationalpeace and security. Our Organization has shown thatthere are legal and political alternatives to a veto-induced paralysis and to actions lacking multilateralendorsement.Peace  security  development and social justiceare indivisible. Brazil has endeavoured to practice withutmost consistency the principles for which it stands.The new relationship we are forging with our SouthAmerican neighbours is founded on mutual respect friendship and cooperation.We are moving beyond our shared history andgeography to create a unique sense of kinship andpartnership. In this context  our relationship withArgentina remains crucial.South America and Latin America areincreasingly seen as a region of peace  democracy anddevelopment that aspires to become a new outpost forgrowth in a stagnating world economy.We are deepening the already significant ties withtraditional partners in North America and Europe but we also seek to widen and diversify ourinternational presence. Our relations with China andthe Russian Federation have revealed unexpectedcomplementarities.We are proud to be the country with the secondlargest population of African descent in the world. InNovember  I will be travelling to five countries inSouthern Africa to foster economic  political  socialand cultural cooperation. With the same goal in mind we will also host a summit meeting between SouthAmerican countries and the member States of theLeague of Arab States. With India and South Africa wehave established a trilateral forum for politicalconsultations and joint projects.The protectionism practised by rich countriesunfairly penalizes efficient producers in developingcountries. Today this is the greatest obstacle tolaunching a new era of economic and social progress.Brazil and its partners in the G-22 maintained duringthe World Trade Organization summit meeting atCancun that the crucial goal of effectively openingmarkets is achievable through pragmatic and mutuallyreinforcing negotiations that bring about an effectiveopening of markets. I reaffirm our willingness to travelalong a path that converges towards solutions that7benefit all countries  taking into account the interestsof developing countries.We are entirely in favour of free trade as long aswe can all compete on a level playing field.Liberalization should not require countries to abandonthe prerogative of formulating industrial  technological social and environmental policy. In Brazil we areengaged in setting up a new framework that balanceseconomic stability and social inclusion. From thatstandpoint  trade negotiations are not an end inthemselves  but rather a means to foster developmentand overcome poverty. International trade should be atool not only for creating wealth  but also for itsdistribution.I reaffirm before this truly universal Assemblythe appeal I launched at the Davos and Porto Alegreforums and at the Enlarged Summit of the G-8 atEvian. We must wage   both politically andmaterially   the only war from which we will allemerge victorious: the war against hunger and extremepoverty.The eradication of hunger in the world is a moraland political imperative. And we all know that it ispossible. What is truly required is political will.I do not wish to dwell on indications ofbarbarism. I would rather acknowledge ethical andsocial progress  no matter how modest. Yet we cannotdismiss the statistics that expose the terrible scourge ofextreme poverty and hunger in the world. Hunger todaytouches a fourth of the world's population  including300 million children. Daily  24 000 people fall victimto malnutrition-related diseases.Nothing is more absurd or intolerable than thepervasiveness of hunger in the twenty-first century  thisgolden age of science and technology.With each passing day  human intelligenceenlarges the horizons of the possible and achievesprodigious feats. Yet  hunger persists and  what isworse  it is spreading throughout various regions of theplanet.The more we seem to approach the divine throughour creative abilities  the more humanity betrays itsaspirations through our inability to respect and protectour fellow creatures. The more we celebrate God bygenerating riches  the more we hurt our ideals by notminimally sharing them.What is the use of all our science and technology of all the abundance and luxury that it has generated  ifwe do not put it to use  guaranteeing the most sacred ofrights: the right to life?I recall the penetrating warning  made by PopePaul VI 36 years ago  but which is still surprisinglyrelevant: The starving people of the worlddramatically address their plea to the wealthy'.Hunger is an emergency  and it should be dealtwith as such. The eradication of hunger is acivilizational challenge that requires that we seek ashortcut to the future. Will we act to eliminate hungeror will we forsake our credibility through omission?We no longer have the right to allege that we were nothome when they knocked at our door asking forsolidarity. We have no right to say to the famished whohave waited for so long: come back next century. Thetrue path to peace is to fight hunger and extremepoverty to the end  in a campaign of solidarity thatunites the planet rather than deepening the divisionsand the hatred that inflame people and sow terror.Despite the failure of systems that favour thegeneration of wealth without reducing extreme poverty many people still persist in their short-sightedness andgreed.Since my inauguration as President of Brazil on 1January  significant progress has been made on theeconomic front. Stability is back and the groundworkfor a renewed cycle of sustained growth has been laid.We will continue to work hard to balance publicaccounts and to reduce external vulnerability. We willspare no effort to increase exports  raise the savingsrate  attract foreign investment and start growing again.Yet at the same time we must strive to cope withthe need for food  jobs  education and health servicesfor millions of Brazilians living below the poverty line.We are committed to bringing about major socialreform in the country.Hunger is the most dramatic and urgentexpression of a structural imbalance requiringcorrection through integrated policies that foster fullcitizenship. That is why I launched the zero hunger'programme in Brazil. It seeks to eradicate hunger andits root causes in the shortest possible time bypromoting major solidarity and wide-rangingprogrammes bringing together Government  civilsociety and the private sector. The results of those8emergency and structural measures are alreadybenefiting 4 million individuals who were previouslydenied the right to a daily meal. The goal of thisprogramme is to guarantee that no Brazilians will gohungry.The United Nations adopted the highly acclaimedMillennium Development Goals. The Food andAgriculture Organization has at its disposal outstandingtechnical and social expertise. But we need to make aqualitative leap in the global endeavour to fight hunger.That is why I proposed setting up a global fund to fighthunger and suggested means to make it operational.Other proposals have been put forward as well  somealready integrated into existing United Nationsprogrammes.What has been lacking until now is theindispensable political will of us all  especially of thosecountries in a position to contribute most. Creating newfunds is of no use if no resources are committed tothem. The Millennium Development Goals are veryworthy  but if we remain passive  if our collectivebehaviour remains unchanged  those Goals may nevermaterialize  and the ensuing frustration will beimmense.Now more than ever  good intentions must giverise to concrete gestures. We must put commitmentsinto practice. We must practice what we preach   withaudacity  good sense and our feet firmly on the ground yet boldly  and with new methods  solutions andintense social participation.For this reason  I am submitting a proposal forconsideration by the General Assembly to establish aworld committee within the United Nations itself tofight hunger. It would be made up of heads of State orGovernment from all continents with the purpose ofunifying and operationalizing proposals. We hope toattract donations from developed and developingcountries according to their capacities  as well as fromlarge private enterprises and non-governmentalorganizations.My life experience and political history havetaught me to believe above all in the power ofdialogue. I will never forget Gandhi's invaluable lessonthat when out of violence something good appears toresult  this good is at best short-lived  while the evilthat it produces is enduring. Democratic dialogue is themost efficient of all tools for change. With the samedetermination that goes into my endeavours and thoseof my partners to make Brazilian society more just andhumane  I will invest in the establishment ofinternational partnerships that foster equitabledevelopment and a more peace-loving  tolerant andunified world.This century  so full of technological and materialpromise  must not be allowed to slide into political andspiritual decline. It is our obligation to mould  underthe reinvigorated leadership of the United Nations  aninternational climate of peace and conciliation. Truepeace will bloom from democracy  from respect forinternational law  from the dismantling of deadlyweapons arsenals and  above all  from the finaleradication of hunger in the world.We cannot afford to frustrate such high hopes.The greatest and noblest challenge facing humanity isprecisely that of becoming more humane. It is time tocall peace by its true name: social justice. I amconvinced that together we shall be able to grasp thishistoric opportunity to bring about justice."
"25",1012,"BRB",58,2003,"﻿I take special pleasure incongratulating you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession. The unanimous election of the smallest Stateever to hold that post speaks not only of the confidencewhich Member States place in your own ability  butalso of their recognition of the critical role which smallStates play in the multilateral process. We are delightedat your elevation to this high office  and we wish toassure you that  in carrying out your responsibilities you will be able to count on the unequivocal supportnot only of Saint Lucia  but also of the entireCaribbean fraternity. I wish also to thank yourpredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  who very ably guided thework of the fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly during a most trying and tumultuous year.On 19 August  the world was again plunged intoshock and despair as we witnessed the heinous attackon the United Nations Office in Baghdad and the lossof life of United Nations personnel stationed there. Asecond attempt this week added to the toll of casualties.I extend to the United Nations family  as well as thedelegations represented here  whose compatriots were thevictims of that violent attack  the deepest condolences ofthe Government and people of Barbados.We pause especially to pay tribute to Mr. SergioVieira de Mello  an international civil servant anddiplomat of the highest calibre. His death comes at atime when the world can least afford it. We join withMembers in mourning his passing as we mourn allthose who perished at his side in the service of thepeople of Iraq.Amidst the turmoil and carnage that has become adismal feature of the daily life of so many millions in12our global society  this assault on the United Nationswas particularly startling in its cruelty and distressingin its intention. As our Secretary-General has affirmed:“This was the most deliberate and vicious attackagainst the United Nations in its history.” It is thecruellest of ironies that such an attack could have beenconceived and carried out against an Organization inwhich we all have a stake  and one which epitomizesthe principles and ideals to which we all ascribe  andwhose primary purpose is peace.The global environment  over the past year  hasteetered on the brink of chaos. We have witnessedincreased instances of the pursuit of violence andretribution as first responses to the resolution ofconflict  and we have experienced the relegation ofdiplomacy and multilateralism to afterthoughts.Some of the most intractable problems facing theinternational community  in the year 2003 and beyond are the divisions  uncertainties and doubts that haveemerged since the United States-led invasion of Iraq.Our duty as members of this family of nations is toensure that we remain committed to the UnitedNations  as the only organization that can move us pastthe current cycle of retribution to a path of sustainablepeace. As we search for adequate collective responsesto the non-traditional threats to human security  thetask ahead will be to bring to bear a comprehensive multidimensional approach to security  in all itsaspects  and to reiterate the continued relevance of thisconcept to the global agenda.The challenges to small States in such anuncertain environment are numerous and at timesoverwhelming. We lack the financial dexterity torespond to economic crises as swiftly and decisively asis necessary. We have no military might and so ouronly avenue for handling traditional threats to securityrests squarely within a multilateral framework  whichresorts to military action only when  despite our bestefforts  peace cannot be achieved through diplomacy.Since the end of the conflicts of Europeanempire-building  our region  the Caribbean  has had ahistory of peace and stability  which is sustainedthrough a simple but sure formula: celebration of ourcommonalities; tolerance of our differences; mutualrespect for each other’s sovereignty; and adherence tothe principles of democracy  good governance and therule of law. We would wish to commend this formula tothose who find the key to peaceful co-existence elusive.Barbados remains unwavering in its commitmentto the precepts of multilateralism  and to the belief thatno other international institution is better suited orequipped to meet the diverse demands for global peace security and development than the United Nations. Asmembers of this Organization  we are assured that ourvoice will be heard regardless of our size or economicpower. Therefore  while we may not have the capacityto influence situations by way of exerting military economic or even political power  we do cherish ourright to express our opinions about any issue ofconcern to us  without let or hindrance.The United Nations is not a third party separatefrom the Member Governments but is rather the sum ofits Members; it belongs to them and they share all thebenefits  problems and collective responsibilities ofownership. Barbados shares the view so eloquentlyexpressed by the Secretary-General that: “The UnitedNations exists  not as a static memorial to the aspirationsof an earlier age  but as a work in progress — imperfect as all human endeavours must be  but capable ofadaptation and improvement.” We are all accountable forits shortcomings and must all strive for its improvement.To the extent that the United Nations representsour collective effort at a mechanism for globalgovernance  it is amenable to the benefits of goodgovernance practices. For we believe that goodgovernance is as important at the international level asit is at the national level. It is perhaps the single mostimportant factor in promoting development  reducinginequalities and advancing the cause of peace.We should therefore seize this moment in time torecommit ourselves to making the United Nations moreeffective and efficient. Bold and serious reorganizationinitiatives  including the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly  and the reform of the Security Council areurgently needed. We must also find effective coordinationmodalities to give new impetus to the follow-up to themajor conferences and summits of the last decade which  in most instances  have simply been reduced tostanding items on the annual agenda of this body andrhetoric-filled resolutions reaffirming the status quo.We must resolve  during this session andhenceforth  to take concrete actions towards making theSecurity Council more representative and transparent andtowards ensuring that the General Assembly movesbeyond the symbolic politics of passing resolutions tothe hard work of negotiating change.13For it is a source of the greatest continuing concernto us that too many of the premier multilateral institutions— which are charged with the fundamental responsibilityof shaping the rules by which global society isgoverned  whether in the area of peace and security  ortrade  or finance and development — are constrainedby structure and tradition to carry out their mandate ina manner that is patently devoid of democracy ortransparency. Reform must therefore extend beyond theconfines of New York to reach deep into the operationsof the international financial institutions  the WorldTrade Organization  the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development  the Financial ActionTask Force on Money-Laundering and all other bodiesthat seek to prescribe the norms of behaviour for theinternational community without the full participationof that community in the decision-making process.If the International Conference on Financing forDevelopment had one failing  it was its inability toconceive of a new system for financial governance toredress the deficiencies and imbalances of the past — asystem that is durable enough to serve for generationsto come. In this regard  I wish to reiterate the call madeat Monterrey by the Prime Minister of Barbados  TheRight Honourable Owen Arthur  for the creation of arules-based world financial authority to supervisetoday’s complex global financial and capital marketsbetter than the Bretton Woods institutions can  and foran international tax organization to oversee globalcooperation in cross-border tax matters.Despite a commitment made by all States atMonterrey towards the development of a universalframework to facilitate all-inclusive dialogue onmatters pertaining to international tax cooperation sufficient progress has not been forthcoming. While weare encouraged by and supportive of recent proposalsto strengthen the United Nations Ad Hoc Group ofExperts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters these efforts are insufficient to provide for a trulyuniversal  transparent and legitimate intergovernmentalframework to promote cooperation among all States ontax matters.Equally  Barbados believes that the all-importantfight against money-laundering must now be waged bythe international community as a whole  led by agenuinely representative international body  drawing itsmembership from all the countries of the world  withinthe family of the United Nations. While we are mostappreciative of the vital work that has been done in thisregard by the Financial Action Task Force  that bodyremains what it has always been  a task force with alimited role  and an even more limited membership ofonly 31 countries.An important step would be the adoption of aninternational convention against money-laundering under the auspices of the United Nations. Such aconvention would establish a genuine internationalconsensus on the issue of money-laundering within theuniversal ambit of the United Nations  where theinterests and concerns of all Member States would befairly and equally served in a common endeavouragainst international crime. The proposed conventionwould complement the work of the United Nationsunder the 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic inNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances  as wellas the more recent Convention Against TransnationalOrganized Crime.In this connection  we believe that the greatestlesson to emerge from the experience of Cancun is theclear understanding that strategies and solutions thatignore the concerns and needs of the developing world or that fail to analyse the implications of thosesolutions for the most fragile and vulnerable  aredoomed to failure. The special needs of small Statesthat have no capacity whatsoever to distort world trademust be taken fully into account in fashioning the newrules of trade liberalization. To do otherwise would beto condemn the most vulnerable groups of our globalfamily to the real threat of marginalization by amultilateral system that is supposed to provide benefitsfor all. It is vital that focus be restored to the DohaDevelopment Agenda and its work programme onsmall economies.Next year marks the tenth anniversary of theGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development ofSmall Island Developing States. Out of that conferenceemerged the Barbados Programme of Action  whichtoday still remains the essential blueprint for thesustainable development aspirations of all small islanddeveloping States (SIDS). As de facto custodian of thename attached to the SIDS process  Barbados accordsgreat importance to the convening of an internationalmeeting next year in Mauritius to review theimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.We are convinced that the vulnerability andsustainable development challenges of SIDS  asexpressed in the Barbados Programme of Action  in14Agenda 21  the Millennium Declaration and theJohannesburg Plan of Implementation are now betterunderstood by the international community. Accordingto estimates  since 1994 small island developing Statesthemselves have carried out approximately 70 per centof the required actions and measures contained in theBarbados Programme of Action. The Mauritius reviewwill present an important opportunity for us to takestock of new and emerging challenges and identifyadditional resources to advance implementation.The World Summit on the Information Society isconceived as a high-level dialogue leading to achievinga new kind of society  characterized by universal access toand use of information for the creation  accumulation anddissemination of knowledge. It implies the use oftraditional and new technologies  especially informationand communication technologies  as an essential toolfor the enhancement of services and the promotion ofdialogue among diverse cultures towards the attainmentof a more peaceful  prosperous and just world. Wesupport the principle that the new information societymust serve the best interests of all nations and peoples.It must seek through the available technology toempower the most vulnerable sectors of society anderadicate existing disparities within and among States.The issue relating to the passage through theCaribbean Sea of ships bearing nuclear material is stillunresolved. We are  from time to time  presented withstudies and analyses that seek to assure us of the safetyof the ships and their cargo. Despite these assurances we all know that there is no guarantee that internationalterrorism will continue to ignore such a significanttarget or that an unthinkable accident would not occur.A major explosion on board one of these shipstraversing our region would threaten the survival ofsurrounding States. The most acceptable solution to theproblem is cessation of the trans-shipment of nuclearmaterial through the Caribbean Sea  since  on thisissue  any risk is too high.In your address  Mr. President  upon the openingof the General Assembly  you called for action ratherthan inaction. This moment in global affairs willrequire courage and determination as we face theenormous challenges awaiting us. We may not beexpected to complete the task  but then  neither are weat liberty to abstain from it."
"26",1044,"BRN",58,2003,"﻿My congratulations go to you  Sir  and to the people ofSaint Lucia on your election  together with my thanksto your predecessor  Mr. Kavan  for his work over thepast year. You have our full support and best wishes inall your efforts to promote the interests of the membersof this Assembly.May I couple these greetings with my greatappreciation to our Secretary-General and his staff. Weare very grateful indeed for their dedication and serviceduring one of the most difficult years in United Nationshistory.In particular  I wish to add once more the deepestsympathy of the Government and people of BruneiDarussalam to the families of Sergio Vieira de Melloand of all who lost loved ones  colleagues and friendsin the attack on the United Nations headquarters inBaghdad. His Excellency and his staff were our publicservants  our representatives and our people. The attackon them was an attack on us all. As such  we condemnit and all other acts of terrorism.When Brunei Darussalam had the honour ofbecoming a Member of this Organization  wecommitted ourselves to two principles. The first wasnationhood and all that this implies in terms of the ruleof international law and the procedures that govern theaffairs of this Assembly. The second was multilateraldecision-making and  in turn  all that this alsoimplies — respect for fellow members  sensitivity totheir deep concerns and the need for dialogue andconsultation as equal partners in the conduct ofinternational affairs  no matter how long and howfrustrating the process involved may be.We continue to maintain our belief in theseprinciples in spite of many disappointments in the pastyear  both here in the United Nations and earlier thismonth at the World Trade Organization. We feel thatthey are the only basis upon which international affairscan be conducted fairly. They apply to all the greatpolitical and economic organizations of which we aremembers and we especially look to the United Nationsto uphold them.By this token  the United Nations is whatever weourselves make it. We form the largest coalition inhistory and we share responsibility for its successesand its failures. Among those is our failure to bring inthe changes that are necessary if we are to evolve withthe times in which we live.Since 1992  this Assembly has been debatingreform. It has the support of a large majority here including all members of the Non-Aligned Movement.The results of our failure to build on this support cannow be clearly seen. Our Security Council has beengravely divided and the past year has left a legacy ofbitterness. The consequences for the ordinary peoplewe represent — the people of developing nations yearafter year  the people of Iraq for the past 10 years ormore  and the citizens of Palestine for over half acentury — have been ever more disastrous.In all this time  Members have been well awarethat decision-making at the United Nations needs to bemore inclusive and genuinely multilateral. On manyoccasions  they have expressed the desire that theOrganization reflect today’s world rather than theworld of half a century ago. They wish to feel truly partof the decisions it makes.As it operates now  however  many observers feelthat the actual Members of this Organization are tooweak to act effectively in solving the great affairs ofthe day. It is claimed that international affairs are nowbeyond the control of individual nations. They areglobal — global finance; global economics; globaldevelopment; global poverty; global crime; and  ofcourse  global terrorism. Consequently  some voicesdeclare that an Assembly of individual nations  manyof them small and still developing  has no power toaddress such matters.That is a depressing scenario and  of course  noneof us here really wants to believe it  but it does haveone merit. It forces us to examine what the UnitedNations can actually do most effectively and what itcan realistically achieve. The reply from too many ofour people today would be  we fear: not much. Thispresents a powerful case for reform.I therefore feel that we must frankly acknowledgeour part in the feelings of hopelessness and frustrationthat are being voiced by ordinary people and indeed bymany Governments. At present  restoring belief in theUnited Nations ability to act on their behalf may be ourmost important immediate task. On the one hand  thegreat world institutions are technically multilateral.They are run by the Governments of the world. Yet  in21fact  many of these Governments feel excluded fromthe most important decisions. Many interested partiesfeel that they are also on the outside.Multilateralism  in other words  appears to haveits limits. Beyond them  it seems  the stronger nationstake over. This basic division  we hope  can be broughtto an end. That is why we were so pleased to hear ourSecretary-General emphasize the need for reform in hisaddress last week. We congratulate the Secretary-General on the structural reforms he has overseen. Wealso thank him for the many times he has kept us intouch with his thinking and that of his staff and wethank him for the hopes he has continued to expressabout the future of our world Organization.We still share his optimism. Nevertheless  thatfeeling can be maintained only if agreement on reformof the whole United Nations system is a realpossibility. We accept that the task of bringing aboutthis kind of overall change is extremely hard. Thereports of your own Working Group  Mr. President show a difficult pattern emerging over the past 10years. There are more and more proposals and basicapproaches continually diverge. Even though welargely share the same objectives  we remain dividedon the means to achieve them.The divisions we have seen this year  however suggest that we cannot keep postponing change. Theyoffer a test of whether the United Nations is indeedcapable of evolving. That test must be passed  so wecontinue to support work on Security Council reformand offer our strong encouragement to the Secretary-General in the proposals he outlined last week.In the face of today’s problems  the UnitedNations must continue to offer powerful reasons foroptimism about the future. We believe that this calls fora determined and united effort to address the rootcauses of the anger of all who feel unjustly treated. Todo this  the United Nations as a whole must be agenuine partnership between nations. It must stand forshared idealism and a shared sense of human justice.That is what no other body can do.That is what the work of Sergio Vieira de Melloand his colleagues was dedicated to. In their memory and in that of all who have given their lives to thisOrganization  we all need to do a lot better at workingtogether than we have over the past year."
"27",1085,"BTN",58,2003,"﻿It gives my delegationimmense satisfaction to see Mr. Julian Hunte in thehigh office of the presidency  not only because of hiswide experience and his proven abilities  but alsobecause Saint Lucia — a small country like Bhutan —has assumed leadership of the General Assembly at thiscritical juncture of its history. We are confident that under his able leadership and guidance  ourdeliberations on the many important and challengingissues that confront our world today will be fruitful.Let me also take this opportunity to express our deepappreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan for his excellentstewardship of the fifty-seventh session. Hispresidency enhanced the esteem of the internationalcommunity both for himself personally and for theCzech Republic.My delegation would like to pay a special tributeto the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisdynamic leadership and his tireless efforts to revitalizethe United Nations and to enable it to assume itsrightful role at a very challenging time in our history.We have gathered in this magnificent Hall yearafter year  bound together by a common vision of apeaceful  prosperous and just world. The end of thecold war renewed our hope to bring to fruition ourcollective aspirations  enshrined in the Charter of theUnited Nations. The historic Millennium Summitushered in a sense of optimism that we could bringabout a world free from want and fear. Unfortunately the horrific events of 11 September have shaken thevery foundations of our nascent faith in our ability todeliver a new era of peace and prosperity. The situationin Iraq is a serious challenge to the internationalcommunity. Three years ago  we stood united andconfident about the prospects in the new millennium providing a ray of hope for millions around the world.Today  sadly  we stand as a house divided  uncertainabout the future and unsure whether we can rid theworld of the vicious circle of conflict  poverty and fearthat has plagued humankind for centuries.It is clear that international peace and securityand the eradication of poverty remain the most pressingchallenges confronting the international community.What must be recognized is the undeniable  but oftenoverlooked  fact that those overarching goals areinterlinked and cannot be achieved in isolation. Therecan be no prosperity without peace and security. At thesame time  peace and security cannot be sustained ifbillions are deprived of the basic necessities of life.Our collective resolve to combat the menace ofterrorism must be matched with an equal commitment2to eradicate the scourge of poverty  which afflicts morethan half of the world’s population.We welcome the President’s intention to focus theAssembly’s efforts on implementation of the outcomesof United Nations summits and conferences  includingthe Millennium Development Goals. The realization ofa new economic order that is inclusive  equitable andsustainable is an imperative that must be pursued withrenewed focus and resolve. The MillenniumDeclaration provides a clear set of targets and steps tobe undertaken to achieve them. The MonterreyConsensus  the Doha Development Agenda and theJohannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Developmentprovided further impetus towards the attainment of theMillennium Development Goals. Yet 33 countries thattogether account for 26 per cent of the world’spopulation are reported to be off track on more thanhalf of the Goals. The lack of progress so far is indeeddisconcerting.While emphasizing the need to accelerate theimplementation of commitments made by bothdeveloped and developing countries at variousinternational conferences  my delegation would like tohighlight the critical need for adequate financingmechanisms through trade  investment and officialdevelopment assistance. In particular  my delegationhopes that the special needs and vulnerabilities of theleast developing countries  of the landlockeddeveloping countries and of the small islanddeveloping States will be comprehensively addressed as called for in the Brussels Programme of Action forthe Least Developed Countries  in the AlmatyDeclaration and in the Barbados Plan of Action respectively.Of the 33 countries that are off track in achievingthe Millennium Development Goals  23 are in sub-Saharan Africa  highlighting the need for specialattention to Africa. My delegation calls on theinternational community to lend its full support to theimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment. International support is particularlycrucial for countries emerging from conflicts  forwithout the rehabilitation of social and economicinfrastructure  progress in peacemaking cannot besustained. In that context  we hope that theinternational community will also provide thenecessary support to the peoples of Afghanistan andIraq as they endeavour to rebuild their nations underthe most trying circumstances.Every Member State has the responsibility toeradicate poverty and create an enabling environmentfor peace and security. It is in the mutual interest of allnations  small or large  developed or developing  tocollectively promote global prosperity and peacefulcoexistence."
"28",1127,"BWA",58,2003,"﻿Allow me  first of all to express once again to the Secretary-General and toall United Nations personnel the condolences of myGovernment and the people of Botswana for theterrorist attack on United Nations headquarters inBaghdad on 19 August. We are outraged that an attackof that magnitude was carried out against internationalcivil servants  whose sole mission in that country is tohelp Iraqis rebuild their country. The death of SpecialRepresentative Sergio Vieira de Mello and a number ofhis staff is indeed a loss to the United Nations familythat we shall all feel for a long time to come.May I now pay my respects to you  Mr. President and congratulate you on your election as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. Ipledge to you the full support of my delegation. Let mealso pay tribute to our illustrious Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his dynamic leadership of theOrganization  in particular for his unshakeablecommitment to the reform of the United Nations. Iassure him of the unwavering support of Botswana inthe discharge of his onerous responsibilities.The fifty-eighth session is beginning at a timewhen we are faced with formidable challenges to thecohesion of the international community and to the roleof the United Nations in maintaining internationalpeace and security. We have just witnessed the war inIraq  which caused deep divisions and recriminationamong the Member States of the United Nations. It isimportant that the Member States set aside theirdifferences and promote the Organization as a forcethat can rally nations  both big and small  aroundcommon causes. For the United Nations to succeed inits mission  it is important that all Member Statesrespect the Charter.Although now fewer in number  conflictscontinue to bedevil the African continent. Fighting isstill going on in many parts of Liberia  although thereis a semblance of peace in the capital  Monrovia. It is awelcome development that the Security Council hasdecided to send a peacekeeping mission to that war-torn country. The peace process in CÙte d'Ivoire though holding  is still fragile. Only recently  a militarycoup took place in Guinea-Bissau. Botswana stronglycondemns the coup  which further tarnishes the imageof Africa. We welcome the news that  through themediation of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States(ECOWAS) and the African Union  themilitary in Guinea-Bissau has agreed to hand overpower to a civilian interim administration untilelections are held  in two years' time.Those conflicts continue to drain Africa's energiesand to undermine the continent's capacity to focus on theequally challenging tasks of development and povertyeradication. The vicious cycle of war  poverty  hungerand disease has left African people in despair. Theywonder whether in this new millennium the dawn ofpeace and tranquillity that they so aspire to will evercome. The inability of the international communitythus far to act resolutely to address those conflicts willno doubt make it more difficult for the continent toimplement its major programmes  such as the NewPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).The conflict in the Middle East continues to be amatter of grave concern. All initiatives towards apeaceful settlement  including the road map promotedby the Quartet  have so far failed. The decision byIsrael and others to insist on determining who in theleadership of the Palestinians they will do business with isan unacceptable precondition for genuine negotiations.Worse still  the threat to expel the democratically electedleader of the Palestinians  Mr. Arafat  is a recipe forfurther strife that could result in more loss of life on bothsides. That development should be condemned by allwho want to see peace in that land.In Iraq  despite formal pronouncements thathostilities have ended  the country is still not at peace.Instead we see an escalation of violence  with manypeople  including coalition troops  being killed everyday. The situation clearly calls for an intervention bythe Security Council to ensure that the Iraqi people are29given the mandate to govern themselves and that theUnited Nations is given a bigger role to play in thereconstruction of the country.Botswana firmly believes that the variouschallenges that the international community faces todaycan best be tackled under a multilateral framework. TheUnited Nations remains the foremost body for promotingthe Agenda for Peace. Small States such as my ownplace great hope in multilateral partnership andcooperation  for on their own or in their small regionalgroupings the challenges they face are formidable. Wetherefore call upon Member States to rededicatethemselves to the noble ideals of the Organization.As we direct our energies towards peace andsecurity  we must also remain focused on the twinchallenges of development and poverty eradication.Those are global challenges requiring global solutionsand the active participation of all nations.Our performance in efforts to eradicate povertycannot be considered successful by any measure.Poverty still remains a blemish on humankind'sattempts at socio-economic upliftment. The policies strategies and programmes to address the situation havenot had the desired effect. It is estimated that about 1.2billion people around the world still live in poverty and a large proportion of them live in Africa. It isunacceptable that in this day and age  when billions ofdollars are spent on armaments  space technology andother advances in human endeavour  such a largenumber of people are still poor and marginalized.We should bear in mind that there is a clearlyestablished link between poverty  on the one hand  andthe political instability and insecurity that the world iswitnessing today  on the other. Poverty breedsresentment  anger and despair. People condemned tothe margins of society feel that they have nothing togain by participating in the democratic process ofgovernance. Instead they believe that they have nothingto lose by using violent means in expressing theirgrievances  for in their perception  the internationalcommunity is indifferent to their suffering.Three years after the Millennium Declaration wasadopted by our heads of State  the General Assemblyshould take full stock of the progress achieved towardsthe fulfilment of the commitments contained in it.Botswana welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration. It is the intention of my delegation toparticipate actively in the debate on this matter.We need to measure in concrete terms whether therehas been an increase in the flow of official developmentassistance. We need to measure whether we have beenable to mobilize enough domestic and internationalresources for development  including foreign directinvestment and private capital flows. We need to measurewhether we have resolved the external debt crisis. Weneed to measure how far we have gone towardsestablishing fair and equitable international monetaryand trading systems. Above all  we need to measurehow much we have achieved in the global fight againstthe HIV/AIDS pandemic. In that context  it is regrettablethat the recent talks in Cancun on trade  a key factor inpoverty reduction and development  collapsed.Earlier  I referred to the need for the internationalcommunity to address the problem of poverty with allthe resources at its disposal; for the failure to do so willonly increase the level of frustration and anger andfeelings of powerlessness among the poor  which willin turn will provide fertile ground for radicalism andextremism.Botswana strongly condemns internationalterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Terrorism like poverty  is now the biggest threat to civilizednorms of international discourse. The recent senselessand deliberate attack on the United Nations office inBaghdad is a stark reminder that even the UnitedNations servants of peace and humankind are notimmune from acts of terror. We must support theappeal by the Secretary-General for the adoption ofurgent measures to provide protection and security toUnited Nations staff wherever they serve. We believethat the United Nations must be empowered to play apivotal role in mobilizing international consensusaround measures to curb the scourge of terrorism. Inthat respect  Botswana remains ready to cooperate inany way possible with the relevant United Nationsagencies.My delegation was most pleased that a high-levelmeeting of the General Assembly was convened on 22September this year to focus on sharing best practicesand the lessons learned in the fight against theHIV/AIDS pandemic. As one of the countries mostaffected by that scourge  my Government accords thehighest priority to tackling HIV/AIDS. My delegationfully supports the conclusions reached by the high-30level interactive panel on the critical issues that mustnow be addressed  namely  political leadership; stigmaand discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS; the importance of broad-based partnerships; andresource mobilization on a very large scale. We callupon our development partners  both in Governmentand in the private sector  to dig deeper into theirpockets to support the efforts of developing countriesstruggling so hard to meet their obligations to controlthat scourge.Turning to the Secretary-General's reformproposals  while progress has been made in respect ofthe rationalization of the functions of the Secretariat especially in the economic and social fields  formidablehurdles still remain in connection with the reform ofthe Security Council. The Open-ended Working Groupon the Question of Equitable Representation on andIncrease in the Membership of the Security Councilhas  in our view  done all that is humanly possible tosolicit a wide range of views and to try to bridge thedifferences that have emerged. But  regrettably  littleprogress has been made. It is clear to us that thismatter  which is of vital importance to the wholeOrganization  will only move forward if there is politicalwill on the part of some key Member States. This issuecannot continue to defy our collective wisdom after 10years of deliberation. A compromise solution mustemerge soon or history will judge us harshly.We welcome what now seems to be an emergingconsensus towards the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly. The speeches delivered in the Assemblyhave been correctly observed by the Secretary-Generalin his report as being repetitive and sterile. The agendatends to be too long  and often results in a duplicationof issues. We share the proposal to keep the agendashort and focused  with a number of issues clustered.Long speeches should be replaced by more focuseddebates and interactive dialogue. We strongly believethat those modest reforms would make thedeliberations of the General Assembly more interestingto our stakeholders. They would also enable issues ofvital importance to be fully debated  and thus make iteasier to implement the decisions reached.In conclusion  I wish to reiterate Botswana'scommitment to the United Nations and its agenda. Tous the United Nations is the embodiment of ourcollective will to accomplish the MillenniumDevelopment Goals."
"29",1169,"CAF",58,2003,"﻿At the outset  I pay sincere tribute tothe President on his election to preside over theAssembly at the fifty-eighth session  which is beingheld in a particularly important context in this century.His long experience and his expertise on internationalissues  as well as the role that his country  Saint Lucia plays in the Caribbean region  guarantee that our workwill be a success.I also congratulate the other members of theBureau  and cannot fail to commend the skill withwhich the President’s distinguished predecessor  Mr.Jan Kavan  of the Czech Republic  conducted the workof the fifty-seventh session.I reiterate to the Secretary-General the fullsupport of the Transitional Government of the CentralAfrican Republic for his unceasing work at the head ofthe Organization to ensure peace and security in aworld beset by terrorist threats and widespreadinsecurity.The Central African Republic joins those whohave honoured the memory of the United Nationspersonnel who fell victim to the wanton violent act ofterrorism in Baghdad on 19 August  including Mr.Sergio Vieira de Mello  and reiterates its sinceresympathy to the Secretary-General. We appreciate hisdecision to maintain the United Nations mission inIraq  despite everything.24For a decade  the General Assembly has adoptedmany recommendations  whose implementation has notalways brought solutions to our diverse sharedconcerns.Before my delegation contributes its appraisal ofthe state of the world  against the backdrop of the manychallenges of the twenty-first century  I would like  onbehalf of His Excellency François Bozizé  President ofthe Central African Republic  and of the Republic’sGovernment and people  to express the wish that ourmeetings may be crowned with success.A world that cherishes peace  progress  solidarityand concord is the objective to which the entire worldaspires and the main philosophy of the founding fathersof the United Nations. Indeed  when peace is notassured  various crises ensue. Aggravating factors likedestitution  penury  extreme poverty  HIV/AIDS tuberculosis and malaria  combined with intolerance injustice  indifference and social inequality  greatlythreaten the balance of peace in many regimes of theworld  and particularly in the Central African Republic.It was against this background that a surge inpatriotism occurred on 15 March this year in theCentral African Republic as the outcome of a processto which all the leading lights of the nation contributed.The situation that prevailed in my country before15 March was the subject of several debates  andunsuccessful attempts at settlement  by the SecurityCouncil  the African Union’s/Central Organ of theMechanism for Conflict Prevention  Management andResolution  the Central African Economic andMonetary Community (CAEMC) and the Communityof Sahelo-Saharan States. A number of bilateralinitiatives also failed.I reiterate once again the gratitude of theGovernment and people of the Central AfricanRepublic to the Secretary-General  the United NationsPeace-building Support Office in the Central AfricanRepublic  the Security Council members andparticularly friendly countries  who generouslycontributed to supporting the Central African people atan extremely difficult time.Since 15 March the resolve of the TransitionalGovernment to work for a return to normalconstitutional life has resulted in significant advances in the framework of the implementation ofcommitments according to the following timetable:May 2003  establishment of the National TransitionCouncil to replace Parliament;. September 2003  theholding of a national dialogue for the Central Africansto examine the deep causes of their long-standingconfrontations; 2004  holding of a constitutionalreferendum; the third quarter of 2004  presidentialelections; and fourth quarter of 2004  municipal andlegislative elections.This consensual transition  scheduled to end inJanuary 2005  should establish security throughout thecountry  improve public finances and revive theeconomic and social sectors  which are engines ofgrowth.These main points of our overall policy and of theTransitional Government’s economic and socialrecovery strategy now being implemented aresupported and commended by the neighbouringcountries in general  and in particular by the membersof CAEMAC  which acknowledge the work of the newregime.The member countries of the United NationsStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions inCentral Africa  at their nineteenth ministerial meeting held in Brazzaville from 14 to 17 May this year expressed their support for the change that hadoccurred in Bangui in a declaration  and appealed tothe international community to provide assistance tothe Central African Republic.The exhaustive report of the situation before15 March presented by the President of the Republic His Excellency General François Bozizé  to the specialsummit of CAEMAC devoted exclusively to thesituation in the Central African Republic led heads ofState and of delegations to understand and support theTransitional Government’s efforts to bring about areturn to constitutional order. Clear signs of thesignificant progress in establishing nationalreconciliation and restoring constitutional anddemocratic order are the fruitful discussions with manyfriendly countries and partners  the consultationsbetween the Central African Republic and theEuropean Union which have been going on since22 May  and the fact-finding visit to Bangui from 17 to21 August of the Committee of Ambassadors of theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific States.In his introductory report to the MillenniumSummit  the Secretary-General recalled that people arethe purpose of any activity. Nothing could be moretrue. My delegation would like to see the United25Nations regain its authority in order to help promotehuman rights  democracy and development throughoutthe world.Protecting and guaranteeing human rightscontributes to a country’s national concord and to thestrengthening of its democracy. This was so wellunderstood by the Central African Republic that on15 March we chose consensual governance  at thecentre of which the well-being of the citizens and theprotection and guarantee of their rights are the highestpriorities.Implementing this will require resources thatpermit the widespread promotion of human rights andsocial development. My delegation hopes that theUnited Nations will become more involved  at thebeginning of this third millennium  in internationalaction to create a true human rights culture. To do this the United Nations needs to reform  renew itself andadapt to today’s world. It will have to rationalize itsprocedures  methods and approaches to all questionswithin its purview.It will be understood that my delegation wouldlike to see the Security Council reformed  so that itmay better discharge its noble mission. Even if the vetois not as abused as it was during the cold war  SecurityCouncil membership needs to be reformulated  both atthe level of permanent membership and non-permanentmembership  in order to reflect the new realities of ourworld. This is the view of the delegation of the CentralAfrican Republic.The need for a new approach in relations betweenStates means that we all need to make a realcommitment. This led to the adoption of theConstitutive Act of the African Union as an expressionof the desire of Africa to meet  together with theUnited Nations  all the challenges of the twenty-firstcentury. My country will spare no effort to promotethis new dynamism."
"30",1216,"CAN",58,2003,"﻿It is agreat pleasure for me to address this importantgathering. I would like to congratulate you  Sir  onyour assumption of the presidency of the GeneralAssembly and to wish you well.As is well-known  Canada has always believed ina multilateral approach to global issues — not forideological reasons  but because it is a proven way toenhance security and to resolve those over-archingproblems that transcend national frameworks.The present era provides us with enormousopportunities for action. We can improve health andextend life expectancy  especially in poor countries; wecan safeguard security and the rights of citizens; andwe can increase access to education and help people tofulfil their aspirations.The present era also presents us with urgentchallenges: protecting the environment; rolling backdiseases such as AIDS and malaria; preventing conflictand ending impunity for crimes against humanity;putting a stop to terrorism and organized crime; andcontrolling weapons of mass destruction.Each Government is responsible for taking actionwithin its own borders. In this global era  however such issues cannot be successfully addressed by Statesacting alone. Multilateral cooperation is indispensableto ensure the well-being of citizens and to protect themeffectively from harm. We need only consider the fightagainst terrorism. None of us has ever believed thatterrorism could be controlled  let alone stopped without the cooperation of all of us. The task of dryingup the sources of terrorist funding also requirescoordination and effective legal regimes. Information-sharing is imperative if attacks are to be prevented.The United Nations has been playing anextremely useful role in this fight. Since the tragicevents of 11 September 2001  the Security Council hasbeen undertaking an extensive effort in support of thefight against international terrorism.We could also consider the issue of health.Distance from the source of new viruses no longerprovides us with protection. The next virus may be justan aeroplane flight away. Multilateral cooperation isessential for the management of health threats. We riskdisaster if we do not share with each other allinformation that is are available to us and if we do notcoordinate efforts to combat epidemics. Coordinatedaction is also required for development in poorcountries and to ensure reasonable access to healthcare.We need only consider  furthermore  the ongoingproblem of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons.The proliferation of these weapons of mass destructionamong States and terrorist groups represents a growingthreat. Such proliferation must be prevented throughcoordination  the strict application of export controls rigorous verification  the enforcement of multilateraltreaties and other forms of collective action underinternational law.We all recognize that the United Nations hasenabled us to successfully address many internationalchallenges. But we also recognize that we have failedin certain other cases. We have been slow to adapt theUnited Nations to changing circumstances. The timehas come to begin bold renewal at the United Nations.This morning  the Secretary-General set outproposals that are timely  necessary and courageous. Icongratulate him on his remarkable statement  and Ican reaffirm that Canada subscribes fully to theobjectives that he proposes.22The United Nations remains the principalinstrument for effective multilateral action. I call onmy fellow leaders to make meaningful United Nationsreform a priority.(spoke in English)We should not be pessimistic about our ability tosucceed. Consider some United Nations successes: the2000 Millennium Summit and  in Monterrey  Mexico the 2002 International Conference on Financing forDevelopment. We created a shared framework onsetting priorities for more effective aid; we set targetsand key principles; we spelled out mutualaccountabilities for developed and developingcountries. That spirit of accountability and sharedresponsibility also lies at the heart of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development and of the Groupof Eight Africa Action Plan. And it has led to policyinitiatives with respect to market access and theavailability of pharmaceutical drugs to poor countries.For instance  this year Canada eliminated virtually alltariffs and quotas on products from least developedcountries.At the same time  the outcome of the World TradeOrganization meeting in Cancún is very  veryworrisome. Agricultural subsidies of developedcountries must be radically reduced to give developingcountries — particularly in Africa — the chance toprosper. The developed world has an obligation to act and to act quickly.Colleagues  on no issue is progress morenecessary or more urgent than on the protection of theinnocent. Canada  in partnership with others  advocatesputting the protection of people at the heart of themandate of the Organization. Too often  conflicts areallowed to start  even when the whole world can seewhat the dreadful consequences will be. Too often innocent civilians are left to their fate.Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of thegenocide in Rwanda. In all conscience  we must askourselves: are we any more ready now than we werethen to respond to another Rwanda? I fear the answer unfortunately  is no.It was with our collective failures in Bosnia andRwanda in mind that Canada sponsored theInternational Commission on Intervention and StateSovereignty. The Commission has done excellent work and in its report  it argues that sovereignty entailsresponsibility as well as rights.The most fundamental duty of a State is to protectits people. When a Government cannot or will not doso  the responsibility to protect them becomestemporarily a collective international responsibility.Some question that idea because they fear interventionon slight pretexts or with motives other than humanprotection. Others  owing to their own tragicexperience  fear that there would be too little outsideinvolvement. We need to reconcile those two concerns.We believe — as does the Commission — that  inthe face of great loss of life or ethnic cleansing  theinternational community has a moral responsibility toprotect the vulnerable. The primary purpose must be toavert and end human suffering. No entity is moreappropriate than the Security Council to authorizemilitary action to protect the innocent. But the memberStates of the Council have sometimes failed theinnocent. Past failures must motivate us to preparebetter for future crises. We can reform how this placeworks  improve its effectiveness  enhance its relevanceand inspire its participants.Before closing  I wish to comment on some of thechallenges to peace and security that we face. InAfghanistan  much has been achieved and muchremains to be done. For our part  Canada has beenengaged in the war on terrorism from the outset. Weare the largest current military contributor to theInternational Security Assistance Force. We havepledged 250 million Canadian dollars for humanitarianassistance and reconstruction. We are committed tohelping the Afghani people build a democratic pluralistic society. In Iraq  we have also joined theinternational effort to help the Iraqi people. We havedecided to contribute 300 million Canadian dollars  oneof the largest single-country pledges we have evermade. We are encouraged that the members of theSecurity Council are exploring how to elaborate uponthe United Nations role in the reconstruction and inprogress towards Iraqi self-government.The situation in the Middle East preoccupies us as it does the entire international community. Innocentlives on both sides are being lost. Israeli families andPalestinian families fear for their children and for theirfuture. Terrorism and violence — in whatever form  toadvance whatever cause — simply creates moreviolence and takes even more innocent life.23For the international community  as for Israelisand Palestinians  despair is not an option. Our goalmust remain a political solution based on two viableStates  Israel and Palestine  within secure andrecognized borders. We need to support Palestinianefforts to develop modern  transparent and responsiblegovernment. We need also to support those seeking topromote dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians inthe search for practical solutions to the core issues. It isour responsibility to help those who are preparing forpeace  which must one day come.When the time is right  the internationalcommunity must be able to offer a robust internationalpresence that will guarantee the safety and security ofIsrael and of a Palestinian State  and we should begetting ready to do so now. In addition  we should belooking for lessons on how the internationalcommunity has acted in other places to stopviolence — as  for example  in Cyprus and in Kosovo.Regional tensions  the war on terror and efforts atreconstruction in recent hot spots must  nevertheless not distract us from continuing to help Africans realizetheir goals for trade and investment  democracy  humandevelopment and good governance.In summary  multilateral cooperation remainsindispensable. The United Nations remains at the heartof the multilateral system. New challenges demandnew structures  and a historic opportunity has emerged.Let us seize it  and let us realize the powerfulidea that created the United Nations — the idea thatnations can unite to save their people from the scourgeof war. Let future generations say of us that we did notbetray that idea — that we realized the potential of thisgreat body  supported it  renewed it and re-energized itto better serve humanity."
"31",1231,"CHE",58,2003,"﻿In 2000  at the dawn ofthe new millennium  the heads of State andGovernment of the Member States met here to reaffirmtheir shared goals. Three years later  that internationalconsensus has eroded. Member States perceive threatsdifferently  and they do not share the same priorities.Some States emphasize the fight against terrorism andthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Inother regions in the world  civil wars  small arms poverty  hunger and AIDS are the main dangers.21Can the international community reach aconsensus on the objectives to be attained and the wayto achieve them? What importance should we give tomultilateral cooperation? Has the time not come toreview the system of collective security inherited fromthe Second World War? Could it be that the UnitedNations is due for far-reaching reform?The fact that so many heads of State andGovernment have responded to the Secretary-General'sinvitation is a preliminary answer. It is an encouragingsign. The Member States look to the United Nations toseek solutions. We must seize the opportunity of thisdebate to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralcooperation and the goals of the United Nations.Life in society demands a minimum of order rules and solidarity. That also applies to internationalrelations. Switzerland attaches great importance torespect for international law  which explains itscommitment to humanitarian law or to the InternationalCriminal Court. Without international law  manycountries would feel themselves at the mercy of the lawof the mightiest. The great powers  like the smallerones  need a multilateral framework to resolve theirdifferences.The time has come to rethink the role of theUnited Nations. Almost 60 years after the foundationof the Organization  the threats have changed  as havethe geopolitical realities. Terrorism and theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction havetaken on more threatening dimensions. Civil wars havemultiplied. AIDS has become the most deadlyepidemic in the history of humankind. Poverty is farfrom being eradicated.Security can no longer be addressed in purelymilitary terms. We need to review our vision ofsecurity by focusing greater attention on individuals.By broadening our approach to security and by placingfresh emphasis on human security  we can overcomesome of the current differences between the North andthe South.Together with other countries  Switzerland isendeavouring to promote the idea of human security.This year it will commit itself to the issues of theproliferation of light weapons and anti-personnelmines. We hope the General Assembly will establish aworking group to develop an instrument for markingand tracing small arms. If the Members of theOrganization concur  Switzerland is ready to take thechair.The Swiss Government also takes an activeinterest in the issue of migration. We are working withother countries to establish a global commission oninternational migration  which will be asked to makerecommendations.In order to promote human security  we must alsokeep the promises made in the field of development. Inthe Millennium Declaration we have undertaken toensure that globalization becomes a positive force forall humankind. To that end  we have adopted a series ofclear objectives  and deadlines to meet them have beenset. But merely proclaiming goals is not enough; wemust now fulfil them. If the rich countries   and mycountry is among them   do not keep their promises they will end up causing poor countries to lose hope.In Cancun  the members of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) tried to revive trade liberalization.Although positions converged somewhat disagreements persist and there is a risk of lastingfailure. That would result in weakened growth at theglobal level  to the detriment of all countries. We needto give negotiations another chance and  above all avoid the lure of protectionism.To affirm a belief in the multilateral systemshould not blind us to its weak points. The UnitedNations needs more thorough reform.Switzerland considers that the role of the UnitedNations in the economic and social fields must bedefined. We must better take account of the linksbetween international security and economicdevelopment. Relations between the United Nations the Bretton Woods institutions and WTO should also bereconsidered by a group of independent eminentpersons.We must also focus our attention on thefunctioning of the Organization itself. In the GeneralAssembly  resolutions that are adopted are too oftenreduced to the lowest common denominator or to along  vague wish list  with no real impact. TheAssembly must be revitalized. There is a need toreduce the number of agenda items  limit the length oftexts and avoid the proliferation of resolutions onissues that overlap.With regard to the Security Council  a consensusalready exists on the fact that its composition no longer22sufficiently reflects contemporary geopolitical realities.Switzerland supports the idea of enlarging the Council.That could be done without harming its effectiveness aslong as the increase in the number of members remainswithin reasonable bounds and takes into account thevarious regional sensibilities.In the last few years  countries not members ofthe Council have been given more opportunities toparticipate in the Council's work. Switzerlandwelcomes those efforts. However  the crucial decisionstoo often remain confined to the restricted circle of thefive permanent members. All members of the SecurityCouncil should be permanently involved in thedecision-making process. It is also important toinstitutionalize the modalities of participation for theother Member States. For example  consultationmechanisms with those States most directly affected byconflict areas should be strengthened. It should benecessary for non-permanent members of the Councilto feel a greater responsibility to represent the views ofthose who elected them.The right of veto is a privilege involving specialresponsibilities. It should be used only in exceptionalcircumstances. When a permanent member exercises itsright of veto  would it not be desirable for it then toexplain its action to the General Assembly? That way that member could make its position better understoodby the international community.Another goal is to open the United Nations tocivil society. Switzerland welcomes the decision of theSecretary-General to set up a panel of experts toconsider the possible ways to achieve that.It is in this spirit of openness towards civilsociety that preparations are being carried out for theWorld Summit on the Information Society  due to takeplace in Geneva in December. More than half of theworld's population does not have access to a telephone.The use of Internet is even more limited. The goal ofthe Summit  a part of the larger framework of theMillennium Goals  is to discuss ways to narrow thedigital divide between the rich and poor countries. Newtechnologies must be placed at the service ofdevelopment  human rights and democracy.I invite all Member States to participate activelyin the Summit. Many heads of State and Governmenthave announced their intention to attend  which givesme great pleasure. I must address  above all  mycolleagues of the industrialized countries: we mustshoulder our responsibilities. I appeal to them not tomiss that important appointment. We need a North-South dialogue at the highest level. As I have alreadysaid  we must keep our promises.In recent months  Iraq has made visible someinternational tensions. We must now search together tofind solutions for the future. We all face the samedanger: that of Iraq falling prey to disorder andinstability. The United Nations must be given its placein Iraq and must receive a clearer mandate from theSecurity Council. At the same time  determinedprogress must be made towards restoring Iraqisovereignty.In its national history  Switzerland has a longtradition of harmonious coexistence among its differentcommunities. We well understand that no singlepolitical model fits all situations. Nevertheless Switzerland is ready to share its experience and toprovide support for the process of drawing up a newconstitution in Iraq.Switzerland joined the United Nations as aneutral country. That does not prevent it fromdefending the universal values to which it is attached.In this  Switzerland wishes to collaborate with theother Member States  drawing on the strength of theOrganization. At this point  I would like to pay tributeto the United Nations and all its staff  who have justsuffered a deadly attack in Baghdad. Every day throughout the world  the United Nations and itsspecialized agencies do irreplaceable work.The Secretary-General has spoken of peace as adream in suspense. I believe that this also applies to theother ideals for which the United Nations stands:justice  solidarity and respect for human dignity.Dreams are an essential part of the vision of the UnitedNations  but so are action  realism  courage andperseverance."
"32",1277,"CHL",58,2003,"﻿I congratulate Mr. Hunte on his election asPresident of this Assembly. As the Foreign Minister ofSt. Lucia  a member of the Latin American andCaribbean community  he can be especially assured ofthe full cooperation of the delegation of Chile.The events of 11 September 2001  the crisis inIraq  the conflict in the Middle East and the attack onthe United Nations in Baghdad all pose enormouschallenges for the international community. Tensions31have arisen over the way in which we have respondedto some of these crises  but opportunities have alsobeen created for joint action in new areas. We mustconfront these challenges with seriousness of purposeand a collective approach.The Secretary-General has expressed his concernat the differing perceptions of the new and old threatsand the urgent need to develop a programme ofsecurity aimed at building a common destiny. TheUnited Nations will be what its Member States wish itto be. The success of the Organization will be thesuccess of its Members and its failure will be theresponsibility of none other than its Member States.The United Nations can and must play a central role inbuilding a common destiny based on universally sharedprinciples and values. The renewal of the UnitedNations is therefore an urgent task that must beapproached from a lofty political and ethicalperspective and not from the bureaucratic standpointthat has led to stagnation  empty rhetoric andfrustration of the desire for change.According to our Charter  faith in human rights isa core value of every society and culture. It is essentialfor us vigorously to promote its universality. We notewith concern how the progress made by mankind inpromoting these values is accompanied by reversalsthat frustrate the sense of ethics that we wish to impartto the global community.The work of the United Nations must continue tobe a guarantee for the promotion and protection ofhuman rights and for the strengthening of a culture thatguides the conscience of each individual  each peopleand each nation. Democracy is consistent with thepurposes and principles of this Organization.In our region  we have made progress towards theinculcation of these values. The historic SantiagoCommitment to Democracy of 1991 culminated in theadoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter andhas been complemented by the Declaration of Santiagoon Democracy and Public Trust: A New Commitmentto Good Governance for the Americas  which wasadopted at the thirty-third General Assembly of theOrganization of American States  held in Chile in Junethis year. In that instrument  we reaffirmed the vitalrole of multilateral cooperation in promotingdemocratic governance. This effort is an example ofhow international cooperation can help to strengthenthe universal value of democracy.Chile’s commitment to democracy goes beyondour region. We and other countries are part of theCommunity of Democracies  an initiative aimed atpromoting and strengthening this system of coexistencethroughout the world. We hope to work in the UnitedNations in pursuit of these objectives.International peace and security continue to bekey concerns of our Organization. The sacrifice of theBrazilian and Latin American Sergio Vieira de Mello the Special Representative of the Secretary-General inBaghdad  and of his colleagues reaffirms ourcommitment to working on behalf of peace.The United Nations must play a more substantiverole in the future of Iraq. We must work to ensure therapid restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people sothat they can freely build their future. Chile standsready to continue to work in the Security Council withan approach that will permit progress to be madetowards the consensus that is needed to improve theconditions of security and to establish a clear timetablefor political transition in that country.Security must guarantee people a life free fromthreats. Human security thus emerges as a distinctivefeature and a prerequisite for a world without fear. Weshare the ideas of the Secretary-General for theelaboration of a programme of common security thatwill permit us to overcome the differences that havearisen in dealing with the increasing fears of our globalcommunity.Globalization has created new opportunities for thepeoples of the world  but it has also created imbalances asa result of unequal access to the advantages that it offers.The equity perspective must therefore be a keycomponent of this programme of security.Development in the globalized world can no longer besustained only in terms of technological innovation andeconomic growth. Progress must be aimed at ensuringthat technological development is placed at the serviceof integration and collective prosperity.In this spirit  we look forward to broadparticipation in the Global Biotechnology Forum  to beheld in the Chilean city of Concepci n in March 2004 and to an outcome that will help to further strengtheninternational cooperation in one of the most dynamicfields of science and technology.Our political and economic multilateral institutionswere created in a different historical period. We must now32demonstrate our capacity to adapt them to better respondto the challenges of the twenty-first century. Our mainconcern today must be how to overcome our immobilityand embark upon a process of renewal. The method usedthus far has not yielded the desired results. It is thereforenecessary to explore new alternatives.We warmly welcome the initiative of theSecretary-General to establish a group of eminentpersonalities to elaborate a proposal for submission tothe Organization. It is essential to address theweaknesses of the General Assembly  the SecurityCouncil and the Economic and Social Council. Wemust also reflect on what new functions could beentrusted to the Trusteeship Council. We muststrengthen the dialogue between these organs andextend it to other international organizations  includingthe Bretton Woods institutions  the World TradeOrganization and regional organizations. In order to goforward in this process of renewal  we must be able toutilize the full potential of the Charter  which has notbeen fully exploited.The Security Council has recently gone through acritical period. We have witnessed the difficulty it hashad in discharging the responsibilities entrusted by theCharter to this vital organ for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. We are in favour of itsrevitalization  in order that an appropriate balance canbe achieved between representativity and effectiveness.Reform must give consideration to the addition ofnew members  both permanent and non-permanent  andinclude a review of the veto. This process can becomplemented by mechanisms that will allow  withinthe framework of the Charter  more active participationby countries that are not members of the Council.It is also necessary more effectively to involve theprincipal organs in the consideration of issues affectinginternational peace and security. This must be done in acoordinated manner through the effective application ofthe Charter  as provided for in Article 15 thereof.It is necessary  too  more actively to involveregional organizations and arrangements in efforts tomaintain peace and security by applying Chapter VIIIof the Charter. The region of the Americas has aninstitutional structure and various coordinationmechanisms that can be used to contribute to thefulfilment of the purposes of the United Nations. Theexperience of the Organization of American States ispertinent in this regard.The General Assembly must undertake a processof revitalization in order to be able to play its roleeffectively as the principal deliberative  normative andrepresentative organ of the United Nations.The Assembly has a multiplicity of items on itsagenda and has adopted many resolutions  most ofwhich remain unimplemented  thereby affecting theeffectiveness and credibility of the system as a whole.We must have the political will to implement ourdecisions. In short  we must strengthen the capacity ofthe Assembly to assume political leadership. We mustalso promote the establishment of regional agendas thatfacilitate agreements and global consensus.The United Nations must play a key role in thepromotion of equitable development by increasing theOrganization’s capacity to influence the design andimplementation of national and international publicpolicies in the economic and social spheres.The process of revitalization of the Economic andSocial Council must be aimed at repositioning thatorgan. This will require the streamlining of its agenda methods of work and membership  and thestrengthening of its relationship with the SecurityCouncil  as provided for in Article 65 of the Charter through its assumption of a role in the prevention andcontainment of threats originating in social problems.We must seek to ensure that the search forconsensus does not prevent this forum from reachingthe necessary substantive agreements required for theachievement of the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations.Chile  from the southern part of the world  willcontinue to shoulder its responsibility to make acontribution to the international community.The United Nations is a unique and indispensableforum for building a world of peace and developmentfor all. Its core values must inspire efforts for a renewalthat will permit the Organization  in the building of ourcommon destiny  to rise to the challenges of thecentury upon which we have just embarked."
"33",1323,"CHN",58,2003,"﻿Please allow me warmly to congratulate Mr. Hunte  onhis assumption of the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I would also liketo thank Mr. Jan Kavan for his valuable contribution asPresident of the General Assembly at its last session.I also take this opportunity to express myheartfelt condolences on the recent tragic deaths inBaghdad of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq  andother United Nations staff members.The twenty-first century is about to complete itsthird year  with hope and distress coexisting side by28side. Peace and development remain the overridingthemes of the times and the shared aspirations ofpeople of all races  colours and nationalities. Theconcept of democracy and equality has planted deeproots in the hearts of the people. The sharedconfrontation of global challenges through strongercoordination and cooperation has become theconsensus of the international community.Countries are increasingly closer in theireconomic relations. Advanced means ofcommunications have made it possible to shareinformation in real time. With their interests closelyconnected and intertwined  countries are findingthemselves more and more like passengers in the sameboat. Regional cooperation has grown substantially inboth depth and scope  with cooperation mechanismstaking shape at various levels. Regional economicintegration is forging ahead in many parts of the world.There are  however  many worrisome aspects ofthe international situation. Local wars and conflictscontinue to emerge sporadically. Although the Iraq waris over  peace remains elusive  with no end of sufferingin sight for the Iraqi people. With the situation betweenIsrael and Palestine still experiencing ups and downs the Middle East peace process remains a long  uphilljourney. In Africa  wars are still raging in somecountries.Non-traditional security concerns such asterrorism  drug-trafficking  arms proliferation  thespread of diseases and environmental degradation havebecome more pronounced. Given modern conditions they can easily spread within regions or even across theworld  making the security situation of humancommunities even more complicated.Humankind still confronts severe challenges in itsdevelopment. In the past 30 years  the number of leastdeveloped countries has doubled  reaching 50  whichaccounts for one quarter of the United Nationsmembership. The ever-widening gap between the Northand South and the aggravated disparity between therich and the poor have become a major factor breedingnew conflicts and wars and undermining regionalstability.At a moment like this  people are inevitablypondering the same question: in the interest of worldpeace and common development  what kind of newworld order should we establish in the twenty-firstcentury?China is of the view that the future well-being ofhumankind hinges on closer international cooperationand a multipolar world. We should promote democracyin international relations. Multipolarization does notmean back-pedalling into the age of spheres ofinfluence or a replay of the now long-gone rivalry ofmajor Powers. It simply means bringing about a newregime of international relations under which allcountries — big or small  rich or poor  strong orweak — are treated as equals  and under which nocountry has the right to impose its will on others.We should cultivate a new security concept basedon the principles of mutual trust  mutual benefit equality and cooperation. Security should bemaintained through cooperation  and disputes shouldbe resolved peacefully through dialogue. The frequentuse of force and the threat of its use should be avoided.The practice of building one’s own security at theexpense of others should be rejected.We should support diversity in the process ofdevelopment. Our world is a place of many colours andstyles. A single musical note cannot make a melody nor does a phonetic alphabet make a language. Humanwisdom has produced so many civilizations  allowingus to follow different paths of development and avariety of values. It is through the exchanges emulations and integrations of diverse cultures thathuman reason and wisdom shine brilliantly.We should dedicate ourselves to theempowerment of developing countries in their largenumbers. The developing countries  which make upthree quarters of the world’s population  shouldbecome a key pillar of a multipolar world. Withouttheir extensive participation on an equal footing  therewill be no democracy in international relations or a fairand rational world order. Without their economicrevitalization  there can be no common development ofall humankind to speak of.We should step up multilateral cooperation.Multilateral cooperation in various forms shouldbecome the principal vehicle in the handling ofinternational affairs. Countries should join hands intaking on global challenges through globalizedcooperation.In a multipolar world  countries should respectand consult with one another politically  strive forcommon development by helping one anothereconomically  prosper together by drawing on one29another’s cultural strengths and jointly maintainsecurity through mutual trust  thus working hand inhand to realize the peace and prosperity of humankind.More than half a century ago  our forefathersgathered to give birth to the United Nations. The past58 years have seen the Organization’s notableaccomplishments in preserving peace in regions andaround the world and in promoting human developmentand progress. The spirit of the United NationsCharter — characterized by such words as “to livetogether in peace with one another as good neighbours”and “to promote social progress and better standards oflife in large freedom” — has been widely accepted inthe international community.The United Nations has become the mostuniversal  most representative and most authoritativeinternational organization in the world today. This iswhat history affirms and what reality mandates.China maintains that in the current situation thepurposes and principles of the United Nations Chartershould be adhered to and earnestly abided by with aview to realizing democracy  the rule of law ininternational relations and the mutually advantageouscoexistence of the countries of the world.In handling affairs affecting regional orinternational peace  all Member States are obliged tomaintain the leading role and authority of the UnitedNations and its Security Council. China is in favour ofan important role for the United Nations in Iraq’s post-war arrangements and reconstruction and supports therestoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people at an earlydate.China also supports the United Nations carryingout the necessary reforms to enhance its role andeffectiveness in the light of changing circumstances.The United Nations is a microcosm of our world.The world’s hope rests on a strong United Nations. Inorder to build a better future for humankind  it isincumbent upon us first to turn the United Nations intoa forum for cooperation instead of an arena ofrecrimination. No country is entirely populated bysaints and therefore no country should have the right tothrow the stones of prejudice.To that end  we should forsake all the oldbaggage of arrogance  estrangement and narrow-mindedness and let harmony  understanding andtolerance ring out loudly as the undiminished themes ofthis great Hall. The ocean is made great by all therivers it takes in. Let that be the motto of all MemberStates.Development is the foundation for world peaceand human progress. We stand for strongerinternational cooperation and the achievement ofcommon development.The current state of affairs — in which the gapbetween the North and the South has been wideningwithout pause  with some countries of the Southlanguishing in dire poverty — must be changed withoutfurther delay. The key lies in establishing a fair andequitable new world economic order in response to therequirements of economic globalization.An open and fair multilateral trading regimeshould be established and improved. The principles ofmutual understanding and mutual accommodationshould be followed to bring about due progress inmultilateral trade talks. Close attention should be givento reforming and improving the international financialsystem  setting up a financial early-warning mechanismand enhancing the capacity of countries to prevent anddeal with financial crises.Stronger South-South cooperation and North-South exchanges should be promoted. The developingcountries should step up their cooperation andcoordination and gradually change theirdisadvantageous position in the economic globalizationprocess. This coming December  the second ministerialconference of the China-Africa Cooperation Forumwill be held in Addis Ababa  where the two sides willwork together to deepen their equality-based andmutually beneficial cooperation and open up a newhorizon in South-South cooperation.The developed countries should also shouldertheir duties and responsibilities by giving greatersupport to the developing countries in the areas ofmarket access  funding  technology transfer  debt reliefand trade terms.All human communities make an organic wholewhen it comes to development. When hundreds ofmillions of fellow human beings are suffering fromcold and hunger  the rich countries should not norcannot enjoy their riches by themselves for long. Thestriking contrast in wealth is eroding the very dignitythat all human beings share. Upon the monstrous gap30between the North and South cannot stand the greatedifice of future prosperity.While addressing the development issue  it isnecessary to highlight the need for a harmoniousdevelopment of the economy and society.At present  humankind’s further development isbeing increasingly hampered by excessive populationgrowth  environmental degradation  energy depletion the decline and demise of indigenous cultures  andother constraints. Sustainable development can be trulyrealized only when there is harmony  mutualcomplementarity and mutual promotion between theeconomy and society  and between their developmentand nature.In the first half of the year  SARS struck anumber of regions and countries  which testifies yetagain to the crucial importance of public health in thecontext of development. While countries shouldstrengthen their public health systems  the world ingeneral should enhance its capacity to deal with majordiseases and disasters through an improved globalizedcontingency response mechanism.The Chinese Government supports the proposalmade by the World Health Organization (WHO) andcertain countries at the fifty-sixth World HealthAssembly for the establishment of a global fundagainst SARS and is ready to contribute to it. We callon all countries to support the United Nations in itsrelevant activities  including incorporating publichealth into United Nations development programmesand other action plans and promoting regional andinternational cooperation in this regard.Last fall  the Communist Party of China convenedits 16th National Congress  which called for thebuilding  during the first two decades of the twenty-first century  of a society that is well off in all respects.This past spring  a new Chinese Central Governmentwas elected at the 10th National People’s Congress —thus a smooth leadership transition was realized.In the first half of the year  the people of Chinaput up a heroic fight against SARS and won aresounding victory. Many friendly countries andpersonalities in the world  together with the WorldHealth Organization and other United Nationsagencies  have rendered us valuable support andassistance  for which I wish to express our heartfeltgratitude.China has kept its economic growth in high gear.The first two quarters saw the nation’s gross domesticproduct grow by 8.2 per cent over the correspondingperiod of last year  and foreign trade grow by 39 percent. China’s economic efficiency has improvedmarkedly  and its reforms on all fronts are progressingin an orderly way.Needless to say  China is a developing country. Itstill has a long way to go before all its citizens can livea comfortable  even affluent life. Development therefore  remains China’s top priority.China’s development requires a peacefulinternational and surrounding environment. We willcontinue to pursue an independent foreign policy ofpeace and will seek to play a constructive role inregional and international affairs.China will continue to push for friendship andgood-neighbourliness in the interest of peace andtranquillity in the region. Based on our support for anuclear-free Korean peninsula on which peace andstability should be maintained  we initiated andsponsored the three-party Beijing talks and the firstround of six-party talks. China remains committed toresolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsulapeacefully through dialogue and the building of alasting peace there.To develop  China needs the world  and aprosperous world also needs China. The market andcooperation potential unleashed by a rapidlydeveloping China could bring fresh and immeasurableopportunities to the region and to the world at large.We desire peace  stability and development. Weaspire to equality  mutual benefit and a win-win resultfor all. Conforming to the tide of history  China hasopted for the path of peaceful development  linking itsrejuvenation with that of the region  with the interestsof the majority of countries  and with the lofty cause ofpeace and development for humanity. We herebypledge our continued and ever-greater contribution toworld prosperity and progress."
"34",1357,"CIV",58,2003,"﻿Ihave the great honour of conveying to the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session the greetings of thepeople of Côte d’Ivoire  President Laurent Gbagbo Prime Minister Seydou Elimane Diarra and theGovernment.The delegation of Côte d’Ivoire has the pleasureof warmly congratulating the President of the GeneralAssembly on his election. We wish him every successas he carries out the lofty and important tasks entrustedto him by the Member States of the Organization. Hiselection is a testament to the international community’srecognition of the vibrancy and diplomacy of SaintLucia — the President’s very beautiful country — inworking for the ideals of the United Nations. Hiselection is also a tribute to his skills as a diplomat  andan illustration of the fact that all countries are treatedequally at the United Nations  which I welcome and Iassure the President of the cooperation of mydelegation.I am also pleased to convey the gratitude of thedelegation of Côte d’Ivoire to Mr. Jan Kavan  Presidentof the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session for the skill and mastery with which he guided theAssembly’s work.I take this opportunity to once again express tothe Secretary-General  the United Nations and thebereaved families the sincere condolences of the peopleof Côte d’Ivoire on the tragic death of Mr. SergioVieira de Mello  the Secretary-General’s SpecialRepresentative for Iraq  other United Nations staffmembers and all other persons killed or wounded in thefight for peace and justice.I also take this opportunity to reaffirm theappreciation of the people and Government of Côted’Ivoire for the work of Secretary-General Kofi Annan who works tirelessly for peace in the world and inAfrica and who makes every effort to lend his personalsupport  as well as that of the Organization  to therestoration of peace in Côte d’Ivoire.Côte d’Ivoire was once a model of stability and ahaven of peace that enjoyed relative economicprosperity. However  for almost a decade it experienceda hidden crisis that led to the coup d’état of24 December 1999  followed on 19 September 2002 byanother attempted coup d’état that quickly became anarmed rebellion. It was backed by foreign elementswhose aim was to undermine our republicaninstitutions and the democratically electedGovernment. That crisis did enormous harm to thepopulation of Côte d’Ivoire and to all who had chosento live in our country and to freely carry out theiractivities there.A round table  held upon the initiative of France brought together the various political forces of Côted’Ivoire  leading to what is now known as the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement. The Agreement — to whichthe United Nations gave formal internationalrecognition through Security Council resolution 1464(2003)  after it had been endorsed by heads of Stateand leaders of international institutions meeting at theKléber conference centre in Paris — provides for among other things  the establishment of a Governmentof national reconciliation headed by a consensus PrimeMinister with the necessary executive powers toimplement the Agreement.The Government of National Reconciliation established on 13 March 2003  has made significantprogress  including the 3 May 2003 signing of acomprehensive ceasefire agreement between the Forcesarmées nationales de Côte d’Ivoire (FANCI) and theForces nouvelles — the former armed rebellion; theestablishment of a consensus national disarmament 21demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programme;the normalization of relations between Côte d’Ivoireand its neighbours  including the reopening of railservice from Abidjan to Ouagadougou; the 4 July 2003joint declaration by the two parties of an end tohostilities; and  above all  the passing of an amnestylaw on 6 August 2003. It should be pointed out thatthat law does not provide amnesty for common crimesand offences  including crimes related to violations ofhuman rights  which must be investigated.With regard to human rights  Côte d’Ivoire despite the severe crisis it is experiencing  hasconstantly placed respect for the human person at thecentre of its concerns. In addition  despite its meagrefinancial capacity  it has been tireless in pursuing itsoriginal policy of welcoming refugees  whose numbershave increased due to the crisis in neighbouringLiberia. Increased financial support from theinternational community is needed to share that heavyburden. My country must simultaneously guarantee therepatriation of the many Ivorian refugees in a numberof neighbouring countries.Here  I am pleased to mention that Côte d’Ivoirehas ratified all instruments relative to the protectionand promotion of human rights and  on 5 August2002 — even before the crisis had occurred — createda Ministry devoted exclusively to human rights.Moreover  in view of massive human rights violations Côte d’Ivoire formally requested on 5 November 2002that an impartial United Nations fact-finding missionbe sent to verify such violations throughout its territoryin order to combat impunity.Thus  after having at the same time consulted theAfrican Commission on Human and People’s Rights —whose first high-level fact-finding mission had alreadyvisited Côte d’Ivoire in April 2003  following theUnited Nations mission dispatched by the Secretary-General at the request of the President of theRepublic — Côte d’Ivoire  in order to demonstrate itsfull cooperation with the various mechanisms of theCommission on Human and People’s Rights  hastenedto ensure positive follow-up with proposed dates forvisits by the following: the Special Rapporteur of theUnited Nations Secretary-General on InternallyDisplaced Persons and by the Special Rapporteurs ofthe Commission on Human Rights on ContemporaryForms of Racism and Racial Discrimination; onXenophobia and Related Intolerance; on the Right toFreedom of Opinion; on the Human Rights ofMigrants; and  recently  on the Use of Mercenaries.The fact that it is temporarily impossible for ourAdministration and for the Special Rapporteurs totravel throughout the territory to verify the facts —together with the cries of distress of the people in thoseareas — is a challenge to the international community.I must commend the international community’s firmcommitment and immense efforts to extricate Côted’Ivoire from this crisis.Coming back to the progress achieved on the pathto peace  I am pleased to note the 12 September 2003appointment  after long and difficult negotiations  ofthe Ministers of Defence and of Security  which pavesthe way for implementation of the national programmeof disarmament  demobilization and reintegration(DDR) established by the Government of NationalReconciliation. To that end  a disarmament committeeand another committee responsible for reunificationhave been established. In those ways  the Governmentintends to show its resolve to work for a return topeace.However  despite such encouraging results  wemust acknowledge that the path of peace is fraughtwith pitfalls. The current difficulties prove that theprocess of peace and national reconciliation remainsfragile. Still  the inter-Ivorian dialogue is continuing and all of the forces recognize that the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement is the only solution providing away out of the Ivorian crisis.In that connection  Côte d’Ivoire welcomes thefirm commitment of the United States to Liberia insupporting the efforts of the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) to help that fraternalcountry exorcise the demons of war and division. InCôte d’Ivoire  as in Liberia  the DDR programmeremains of paramount importance to that end. Indeed the Government attaches particular importance to theDDR programme  which  by re-establishing securityand restoring territorial integrity  will enable Côted’Ivoire to organize transparent and fair elections in2005  under international supervision.On behalf of the Ivorian Government  I shouldlike to take advantage of this rostrum once again tothank the international community — particularly theheads of State of the ECOWAS countries and thePresident and the Government of France — for itsunwavering support for the peace effort in Côted’Ivoire.22Côte d’Ivoire remains concerned about theinternational situation and the problems afflicting it including the current pandemics of HIV/AIDS  malariaand tuberculosis; armed conflicts; disarmament;terrorism; and comprehensive human development.Indeed  we note that  although HIV/AIDS affects 20million people in Africa — two thirds of those infectedworldwide — malaria continues to have at least anequal effect on the continent’s mortality rate. To makematters even worse  tuberculosis is showing signs of adisturbing resurgence.The establishment of the United Nations GlobalFund to fight these three pandemics — amounting to$10.4 million — therefore provides genuine groundsfor encouragement and hope for affected populations particularly in countries of the third world. However we hope that the Fund’s endowment will increase andthat it will swiftly become operational and more easilyaccessible to countries that are already hard hit bythese scourges and that — ironically enough — arealso the chief theatres of armed conflicts.It is paradoxical to note that such conflicts areincreasing in number  frequency and intensity —particularly in Africa — even as the modes andmodalities for their management by the United Nationsand by regional and subregional organizations arebeing strengthened  diversified and improved. Côted’Ivoire therefore congratulates the Organization andits dedicated Secretary-General  as well as regionalcountries and organizations  on the results alreadyachieved in Sierra Leone  Guinea-Bissau  Côted’Ivoire  Liberia and the Great Lakes region  to citejust the most recent cases. Those results encourage allthe parties concerned to persevere in the effort to re-establish and consolidate peace in all these war-tornareas.Concerning the situations in Iraq and inAfghanistan  my country hopes for a swift return topeace and security so that their respective peoples —who have suffered much over the past decade — willbe able to devote their efforts to economic and socialprogress.In the Middle East  Côte d’Ivoire appeals formoderation on both sides and for compliance with theroad map  which is the way back to peace in that partof the world.In any event  law must always prevail overviolence  and dialogue — under the aegis of theinternational community — must always be thefavoured tool for resolving disputes.Conflicts are the work of  inter alia  armed gangs the unemployed  the marginalized and deserters whofeed the flourishing market for mercenaries in Africa ingeneral and in our subregion in particular.Mercenarism  together with the proliferation of andillicit trade in small arms and light weapons  is adangerous threat to the peace and stability of ourcountries. Those scourges — along with terrorism which sadly continues to claim its victims — demandspecial attention from the international community.The Assembly must undertake concrete measuresin the fight against these destabilizing factors in theworld  particularly in Africa. The implementation ofthe Programme of Action of the United NationsConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms andLight Weapons in All Its Aspects — whose review lastJuly revealed an increasing universal awareness of thedanger of proliferation and the need to take coordinatedactions to control it — will be an important stepforward if we have the necessary political will. Themeasures undertaken at the regional and subregionallevels — particularly the ECOWAS Moratorium andthe assistance provided by the Programme forCoordination and Assistance for Security andDevelopment in Africa and by other entities — areelements leading in the right direction.Likewise  the Assembly should activate and givefresh impetus to regional and international conventionand encourage the standardization of legislation toeffectively fight the phenomenon of mercenarism. Côted’Ivoire endorses the proposal to draw up and establish— within the framework of ECOWAS — a generalplan for stabilization in the subregion  which  I amconvinced  would contribute to a return to lasting peaceand stability in West Africa.Preventive action must also be taken at severallevels. At the political and diplomatic level  theinternational community should devote greaterattention to preventive diplomacy  because it isessential that the outbreak of conflict be preventedthrough an early-warning system. At the economic andsocial level  the fight against poverty must becontinued  particularly by integrating the unemployedand other marginalized people into economicstructures.23At the cultural level  education for peace expanding sporting and cultural exchanges  meetingsamong groups of women and young people  at the levelof each State and among the various countries  canpromote tolerance and mutual understanding amongpeoples in the context of a dialogue amongcivilizations.The globalization of the economy may be a factorfor progress by favouring competitiveness  bringing tothe market the best products at the most competitiveprices. Sadly  such globalization could also impede thedevelopment of poor countries  which suffer fromfluctuations in the price of their products on theinternational market and  moreover  must cope withunfair competition imposed by States that subsidizetheir export items.Given these mixed results  the recent MinisterialConference of the World Trade Organization in Cancúnhelped to gauge the magnitude of the ruinousconsequences for African farmers of the subsidiesgiven to producers in the North. By breaking the rulesof free competition  the industrialized countries haveenabled the richest producers to thrive whileimpoverishing those that are struggling for survival.This dire situation should cause us to examine ourconscience so that together we may seek ways andmeans to redress this injustice.There is also an urgent need to take action tostabilize commodity prices at a profitable rate.If poor countries are to escape the vicious circleof poverty  there must be fair remuneration for thework of their farmers  complemented by an increase inofficial development assistance  which should reach 0.7per cent of the gross national product of industrializedcountries  and by debt cancellation.Let us take the opportunity of the present sessionto reflect together on ways to strengthen North-Southcooperation in the framework of the New Partnershipfor Africa’s Development. In the framework of South-South cooperation  the most advanced countries shouldplan to increase trade and technology transfers tobenefit less advantaged countries  in support of theirown efforts.We are concerned about the coordinated follow-up to the outcome of the major internationalconferences held under United Nations auspices. Thefight against poverty cannot be won unless therecommendations adopted in the framework of thosesummits are implemented. It is no good expanding theforums for discussion if the conclusions concerningfinancing for development or technology transfer  inparticular  cannot be implemented and used on theground in a new spirit of genuine solidarity.My country  Côte d’Ivoire  fervently wishes tosee the advent of the new spirit of solidarity called forby globalization and the interdependence of our States and also supports reform of the United Nations to makeit democratic and efficient.May we all have the wisdom to ensure that ourresources and intelligence are put to the service of thebuilding of a better world  where peace  solidarity andjustice reign — a world that reflects the ideals of theCharter of the United Nations."
"35",1400,"CMR",58,2003,"﻿I should like at the outset to congratulate you Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. You haveset in motion a cycle of African presidencies of theAssembly — today  the African diaspora  tomorrow theAfrican motherland. Your election attests to the highesteem in which the Member States hold your country Saint Lucia  a traditional partner of Cameroon in thegreat African  Caribbean and Pacific family. It is alsotestimony to the trust that the representatives of thoseStates place in you and your eminent diplomaticqualities. You may rest assured that my delegation willcooperate fully with you  as we have the pleasure ofbeing a member of your Bureau in our capacity asChairman of the Third Committee. Allow me to extendmy wishes of success to the other members of theBureau.I also take this opportunity to commend yourpredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for the skill with which heguided our work at the last session.To Secretary-General Kofi Annan  I wish toreiterate  in the context of the current internationalscene  Cameroon’s expression of great pride and trustin him and his role as a facilitator in the settlement ofinter-African conflicts. I thank him for his energeticand tireless activity in the service of the great ideals ofthe Organization.Our Organization was created to preserve futuregenerations from the scourge of war  to createconditions in which all can enjoy dignified lives  and topromote respect for human rights and fundamentalfreedoms. The United Nations was created to ensurethe reign of peace at the service of humankind. AsPope John XXIII recalled in his encyclical Pacem inTerris  which was addressed to all men of good willand the fortieth anniversary of which we celebrate thisyear  that peace rests on four indispensable conditionscorresponding to four specific necessities of the humanspirit: truth  justice  charity and liberty. Our heads ofState trod the same path at the Millennium Summit.They undertook to free humankind from warfare andpoverty  to promote human rights and to strengthen theUnited Nations. We felt that it would be useful to recallthose principles because the picture of the world thathas emerged in this general debate since 23 Septemberis not a very optimistic one.On 19 August  the United Nations was struck bytragedy. The terrorist attack that destroyed the UnitedNations headquarters in Baghdad and struck and killeddozens of innocent victims  including Sergio Vieira deMello  Special Representative of the Secretary-Generalfor Iraq  posed a great challenge to the principles andvalues that are the bedrock of our Organization. At thetime  President Paul Biya expressed on behalf ofCameroon expressed his profound indignation andfirmly condemned that odious  criminal act. Tomorrow we will weep with the people of Iraq for the tragicdeath — again in Baghdad — of Akila Al-Hashemi  ahighly talented diplomat and eminent member of theIraqi Governing Council.Cameroon is proud that our Organization did notshirk its responsibilities or even weaken in its resolveto play a central role in the stabilization  orderlyrestoration of the sovereignty and reconstruction ofIraq and to support the political process under way.Following upon the long series of terrorist actscommitted throughout the world since the tragedy of 11September 2001  the 19 August attack in Baghdad wasa timely reminder of the vulnerability of our worldtoday. The complexity of the challenge and the gravityof the danger require us to step up our collective effortseffectively to confront terrorism  which today posesperhaps the most serious threat to international peaceand security. Cameroon again calls for a high-levelconference to be convened to define a collectiveorganized response by the international community toterrorism.In addition to new threats to international peaceand security  such as terrorism and the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  there are other  equallydangerous  threats: all sorts of pandemics  includingHIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  and despairstemming from almost endemic poverty.Therefore  our joint mobilization should be aimedprimarily at reducing or even eliminating the germsand causes of conflicts and despair.In the Middle East  we must demand that theparties to the conflict — Israel and Palestine — returnwithout delay to the negotiating table to agree onmodalities conducive to the rapid and comprehensiveimplementation of the road map. Cameroon regrets andcondemns the escalation of violence  which is seriously26endangering any peaceful solution based on the letterand spirit of Security Council resolution 1397 (2002) adopted with no vote against. In it the Council affirmed“the vision of a region where two States  Israeland Palestine  live side by side within secure andrecognized borders”.Our Palestinian and Israeli friends must get usedto the idea that they are condemned to live side by side to coexist in the geopolitical configuration forged bytheir rich  common history. To that end  Israelis andPalestinians will have to disarm — of course  in termsof weapon policies  but primarily disarm at the culturallevel by unanimously and sincerely ridding their heartsof fear and the psychosis of war. The axiom that peaceresults from a balance of war-making ability andweapons should be replaced by the principle that realpeace can be built only on mutual trust.The same applies to the peoples of the renownedMesopotamia  who are emerging from three decades oftyranny  and must very soon  with the help of theinternational community  have their full dignity andsovereignty restored in a stable and prosperous Iraq living in peace with all its neighbours.Over the past year  the many conflicts that havebloodied Africa have remained at the centre of theconcerns of the United Nations  which has made manyefforts to end them. Fortunately  those efforts arebeginning to yield results. Some African conflicts areon the way to being resolved  nourishing new andlegitimate hopes. Unfortunately  despite everything there are still deplorable situations where theprotagonists are having trouble finding a negotiatedpolitical solution or keeping their commitments. We areconvinced that there will soon be results  given genuinepolitical will on the part of the major actors. Theirreplaceable support they receive from the UnitedNations deserves to be welcomed and recognized.Africa in general and our subregion in particularare fully aware of the role this important partner playsin our economic development  in consolidatingdemocracy and the rule of law  and  finally  inpromoting peace and security within and outside ourcountries. That is why the member States of theEconomic Community of Central African States(ECCAS) have forcefully expressed their desire tostrengthen their cooperation with the United Nationsthrough a political presence of that Organization in thesubregion  which would bolster our subregionalcapacities  particularly in the area of peace andsecurity.In that connection  Cameroon reiterates its thanksto the Secretary-General for sending amultidisciplinary mission to Central Africa last June atthe request of the members of the Security Council. Weawait with interest its innovative recommendations which will shortly be made to the Security Council.They will nourish the debate to be held in this Hall onthe agenda item entitled “Cooperation between theUnited Nations and the Economic Community ofCentral African States”.We welcome the Secretary-General’s suggestionsconcerning the functioning of the Organization in thisconstantly changing world. We will fully support anyreform that will bring the Organization closer to ourpeoples  as envisaged by the measures for strengthenedcooperation between the United Nations and CentralAfrican organizations.In the Millennium Declaration  the politicalleaders of the world committed themselves to creatinga world partnership for development and to respond tothe special needs of Africa. The New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD)  whereby Africa hasdecided to take back the initiative and to control itsown fate  can serve as a sound platform for a fruitfulpartnership between the continent and the internationalcommunity.Africa is waiting for multiple responses. One which will play a decisive part in the growth of ourcontinent  is linked to trade. What African States wantand aspire to is to play a more important part in thetrade of goods and services. That implies in particularstandards favouring fair competition.The failure of the recent World TradeOrganization Ministerial Conference held at Cancúnhas raised grave doubts  particularly among Africancountries that export agricultural products. Thetremendous reluctance of wealthy nations to dismantletheir agricultural subsidy regimes is puzzling  andseriously threatens the survival of African economiesbased on agriculture and livestock. The subsidies givento that sector are stifling millions of farmers and cottonproducers in Central and West Africa.In the same context  Mr. President  your country Saint Lucia  and Cameroon have been carrying out anepic battle for almost a decade for the survival of our27banana industries  which are up against the giants ofthe sector.There are many more examples of the need forsolidarity and urgent reform of the multilateraleconomic system. We hope that the Doha round willnot deviate from its main objective — development —and that it will take well into consideration theconcerns of the poorest in order to integrate thempromptly into the global economy.Globalization does not relate only to trade. It alsoaffects human development and new technologies  theprotection of the ecosystem and the sustainabledevelopment of water and other natural resources. Allof those aspects require a concerted approach  giventhat the sacrifices of some work to everyone’sadvantage. Cameroon  which has chosen  for example to participate in rational and sustainable managementof the world forest ecosystem  has established a boldnational environmental management plan.It is clear that  in order to effectively implementsuch policies without exposing its rural populations toextreme poverty  our country needs significantfinancial assistance  particularly to diversify itsproduction and to ensure systematic transformation ofits natural resources. In other words  today  more thanever before  solidarity should rhyme withpartnership — and globalization with fair trade — toensure the comprehensive and orderly development ofour world.The United Nations assuredly remains the onlyuniversal Organization that not only possesses thenecessary competencies and impartiality  but is also theonly entity that can confer legitimacy on anymultilateral action tackling the great world challenges a number of which we have just listed. To attain thesenoble objectives  it urgently needs to consider in depthits current approaches  the way it operates and itsimplementing mechanisms.Cameroon unreservedly supports the Secretary-General’s initiative to establish a high-level panel ofeminent personalities to consider ways to strengthenthe United Nations. We hopefully await theircontribution to the Organization’s necessary andunavoidable reform to improve its performance including its missions of an economic and social natureas well as international peace and security.The Secretary-General invites us to go furtheralong the path of reform  to which he has beencommitted for several years. He is right. What is atstake is the Organization’s very effectiveness  which itneeds to tackle the great challenges of our time. He cancount on Cameroon’s support.As I have been concluding my remarks  the lighthas changed from green to yellow and from yellow tored. How can one refrain from prolonging hiscomments when it is a question of humanity andhumanity’s future through peace  a negotiated peace  aconcerted peace  a peace that rests on justice and theequitable distribution of benefits and wealth?"
"36",1444,"COD",58,2003,"﻿Allow me Sir  to discharge the agreeable duty of congratulatingMr. Julian Hunte on his unanimous election to thePresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthregular session. I would also like to commend yourpredecessor  His Excellence Mr. Jan Kavan  whofulfilled his mandate to the satisfaction of all.I note the efforts and specific involvement of theSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  in the peacefulresolution of the complex crisis in the Great Lakesregion and Central Africa. The Congolese peoplecontinue to be grateful to the United Nations systemfor the assistance that it gave it through the UnitedNation Mission in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and the Interim Emergency Multinational Forcedeployed in Bunia and especially for strengthening thepeacekeeping mandate of the United NationsOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo (MONUC).The Congolese delegation associates itself withthe spirit of sympathy and solidarity elicited by theterrorist attack committed in Iraq against the greatfamily of the United Nations. Indeed  the Congolesepeople were also deeply moved to learn of the brutaland tragic death of the ardent defender of freedom andhuman rights  Sergio Vieira de Mello  to whom I paytribute.At a time when the entire world remembers thetragic events of 11 September 2001 in this very city ofNew York  the United Nations was still mourning theloss of its staff and fell victim yet again to a terroristattack in Iraq. The Congolese people renew theirunequivocal condemnation of international terrorism.Africa is not spared from the scourge of terrorism. It isenough to recall the tragic events in Nairobi  Dar esSalaam and Casablanca.This session coincides with the final phase of theprocess of the establishment of transitional institutionsin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is here thatI would like to express my gratitude to the internationalcommunity  because its efforts  support and assistancein this peace process led to the signing andimplementation of the Comprehensive Agreement.It is the hope of the people of the Congo and theTransitional Government to see the United Nationsredouble its efforts and pursue its support for theprocess of peace and reunification now underway. At atime when this lengthy war is coming to an end  itshould be noted that the Ituri district is still a gapingwound that the slightest careless mistake couldinflame. While the deployment of the InterimEmergency Multinational Force in Bunia allowed for asharp reduction in acts of violence and contributed to15stabilization of the security and humanitarian situation the situation in the provinces of North and South Kivuremain of concern.It is important that neighbouring countries respectthe sovereignty  territorial integrity and politicalindependence of the Democratic Republic of the Congoso as to recreate a climate conducive to a return to thenormalization of relations in the region.Aside from the numerous human lives affected bythis war  the plants and the animals have also enduredimmeasurable damage. Our determination to restoreeverything that was destroyed is equalled only by ourhope of turning our country into an oasis of peace forall. We believe that a United Nations fund to supportthis effort would be fair compensation.All the present efforts of the TransitionGovernment for the reunification of the nationalterritory  the pacification of the country  thereconstruction of infrastructure and the restoration ofState authority are working to achieve the ultimateobjective of transition  namely  the holding of free transparent and democratic elections. It is in thatcontext that my country voices the hope that theinternational community will provide the necessaryassistance at all stages of the electoral process.In the peace process now underway  an areawhich is of critical importance and an imperative isthat of independent justice  whose equitableadministration would mark the end of impunity. On thedomestic level  the Transition Government is workingto conclude successfully the reform advocated here  forequitable justice is the real proof of nationalreconciliation.On the international level we believe that themajor objective is the establishment  with theassistance of the United Nations  of an internationalcriminal tribunal for the Democratic Republic of theCongo to deal with crimes of genocide  crimes againsthumanity  including rape used as a weapon of war  andmass violations of human rights. Moreover  to ensurethe best possible coverage for protection of humanrights  as well as of humanitarian rights  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo has ratified severalinternational conventions  including the Rome Statuteestablishing the International Criminal Court.Given the important provision for the protectionof human rights contained in that Statute  the Congo on the basis of respect for fundamental principles thatgovern international relations  intends to see that thereis strict respect for the implementation of thatinstrument.As one can see  a new era has dawned in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  an era of peace andreconciliation  of national unity and the re-establishment of State authority  an era ofreconstruction  economic recovery and development toconsolidate and put to use the gains of arduous politicalnegotiations.Aware of challenges and looking toward the post-conflict period  the Transition Government has placedthe well-being of the Congolese people at the centre ofits concerns. It intends to imprint on its programme therequisite good governance  as well as macroeconomicmanagement that ensures the security of investments respects social rights and guarantees protection andlegal and judicial security for employment  businessand foreign investment.We remain aware of the importance of sharingthose resources likely to contribute to economicintegration  and we intend to conduct a policy ofdialogue  openness and good-neighbourliness. Thepriority given to regional integration is a sign of ouradherence to the initiative of the internationalconference on peace  security  democracy anddevelopment in the region of the Great Lakes and ofCentral Africa. The Congolese people consider theholding of this forum a historic opportunity that mustbe seized so that it can lead to the application offundamental principles of international law.As we are determined to maintain goodneighbourly relations and relations of mutual respectwith border countries  and thus refuse to serve as arear-guard base for subversive movements against thecountries surrounding us  we in turn will rejectinterference or destabilization from neighbouringcountries.For us there is a need to do everything possible inorder to build peace in the region and to effectivelyaffirm: a spirit of solidarity  of sharing and of peacefulcoexistence at the regional and global level; the fightagainst poverty and the HIV/AIDS pandemic; controlof the movement and proliferation of small arms andlight weapons  which are claiming victims every day;and the campaign against the proliferation ofantipersonnel mines.16Throughout my statement I have condemnedterrorism in all forms. I also spoke of the consequencesof the bloody  unjust and unacceptable war which hasjust devastated the fundamental infrastructure of theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. I have also referredto the significant progress made in the peace processunderway while emphasizing the importance of thesupport of the international community for the successof that process  which will culminate in theorganization of elections.We are aware and convinced that it is within ourpower to play a stabilizing role in Central and SouthernAfrica upon which the stability and economic recoveryof the region depend.I conclude by reaffirming the will of the peopleof the Democratic Republic of the Congo to cooperatewith the international community in building a betterworld that is designed to build peace and greatersolidarity among peoples and nations."
"37",1491,"COG",58,2003,"﻿Threeyears ago  we held the Millennium Summit  duringwhich we crafted a clear-cut common vision for thetwenty-first century  a road map to confront thechallenges of globalization: peace and security nowfacing new threats  development and internationalcooperation  the environment  pandemics and so forth.One year later the first challenge to thisreassuring and ambitious edifice arose  the terroristattacks of 11 September 2001. The internationalcommunity reacted unanimously and immediatelyadopted a collective response. A few months later wewitnessed the aggravation of tensions with the Iraqcrisis  which severely tested the principle of collectivesecurity and moral authority of the United Nations  tothe point that we doubted the rationale for and thesurvival of what should be  after all  our commonhome.Finally  and most recently  we have witnessed thefailure of the Ministerial Meeting of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) in Cancún. This deadlock indefining a negotiating process to revive the Doha roundplaces in jeopardy the growth prospects of the worldeconomy which would otherwise benefit all people.This can also be interpreted as a new opportunity tomarginalize the countries of the South.All of this shows that this present session is beingheld in a particularly worrisome context. Thesedevelopments are dangerous for the management ofinternational affairs that should be marked with a spiritof dialogue  consultation and openness.We must  therefore  return to the spirit ofmultilateralism that characterized the MillenniumSummit. We must reaffirm  loud and clear  the role ofthe United Nations as a central axis of collectivesecurity and inspiration for the rules of internationalcooperation aimed at justice and equality.For this reason it is important to strengthen therole of our Organization and improve its effectiveness.The Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  has nowpresented a very edifying report in this connection andwe very much encourage him to persevere along thepath of reform and rationalization and to place themultilateral system at the core of the management ofcrises and the display of leadership in the world.Your election  Sir  to the presidency of thissession of the General Assembly is  for us  atremendous asset. It symbolizes the sovereign equalityof all States  large and small  and is a way of payingtribute to your great qualities and your diplomaticexperience. We are convinced that you will know howto skilfully guide our debate on multilateralism to asatisfying outcome  very much in keeping with the highexpectations of the community of nations.This year  once again we see the challenges topeace and international security at the very core of ourmajor preoccupations. Everyone remembers the attackof 19 August 2003 against the United Nations officesin Baghdad. The death of the Special Representative ofthe Secretary-General  Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  andseveral dedicated servants of the United Nations  is stillalive in our memories.In paying tribute to their courage and dedication we must do everything within our power to ensure thattheir sacrifice was not made in vain and that the causethey served so heroically does indeed triumph in theinterests of the Iraqi people and the noble ideas of theUnited Nations.We must therefore encourage the SecurityCouncil to return to its essential unity so that theinternational community  led by the moral authority ofthe United Nations  can help the Iraqi people to findpeace  security and stability and reconstruct theircountry devastated by war and many years of embargo.Not far from Iraq  the international community isstill confronted with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.14This shows that the infernal cycle of violence can onlylead to a dead end. The two parties must come to theirsenses and return to the vision set out in the road map which provides for the creation of a Palestinian Statethat is independent  democratic and viable  living sideby side with Israel and its other neighbours in anatmosphere of peace and security.The Security Council approved this vision inSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002) and the twoparties committed themselves to respecting the roadmap on 4 June 2003 at the outcome of the AqabaSummit. We must now bring them back to thenegotiating table  with no pre-conditions  and demandthat they refrain from any measure or unilateral actionthat is incompatible with the goals of the road map.Still on the subject of peace and security  it seemsto be necessary and essential to emphasize that wemust refrain from conflating terrorism  religion orcivilization as belonging to any geographical area orsupporting any national liberation struggle.Just as we must be firm  demanding and unitedwhen confronting acts of unjustifiable blind violence we must also be vigilant so as not to be tempted byconvenience.In our relentless struggle against terrorism  it isimportant to give appropriate responses when it comesto the sovereignty of peoples  respect for human rights social justice and combating poverty. We must alsoseriously analyse the causes that serve as the breedingground or pretext for terrorism. This is also part ofconflict prevention and  to some extent  the preventionof terrorism.This year we are celebrating the twenty-fifthanniversary of the first special session of the GeneralAssembly on disarmament. It is regrettable to note that since the end of the cold war  so little progress hasbeen accomplished and today’s deadlock in theConference on Disarmament is a tragic display of ourfailure.At a time when the international community islegitimately concerned about weapons of massdestruction that might fall into the hands of terrorists  itis important to remind all of the actors that they mustabide by the multilateral agreements and scrupulouslyrespect them.Within the context of disarmament activities  wewelcome the holding  last July in New York  of the firstBiennial Meeting of States to Consider theImplementation of the 2001 Programme of Action onSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Mycountry hosted in Brazzaville  from 12 to 14 May 2003 a sub-regional seminar on the implementation inCentral Africa of the United Nations Programme ofAction to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the IllicitTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All ItsAspects and presented at that time a report reflectingAfrica’s firm determination to eradicate this scourge.As part of its implementation of the OttawaConvention on anti-personnel landmines  from 9 to 10September 2003  Congo destroyed its stock oflandmines. During two public operations carried outwith the support of Canada and the United Nations  ourGovernment destroyed 5 220 landmines. We intend tocontinue with an operation to search out landmines inthe southern part of our country that borders on Angolaand the Democratic Republic of the Congo.This is to illustrate the degree of cooperation thatprevails among the countries of Central Africa when itcomes to questions of peace and security.Africa is seen today as the focal point for thechallenges confronting humanity  in particular asregards armed conflict  underdevelopment and theproliferation of pandemics. But this is not all thatAfrica has to offer the rest of the world. Variouscourageous initiatives now show Africa’sdetermination to take its fate into its own hands: theadoption of the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment (NEPAD)  the African Peer ReviewMechanism and the Council for Peace and Security.The African Union Summit that was just held inMaputo  Mozambique  eloquently displays this attitudeof ours. My delegation associates itself with thestatement made on 24 September by His ExcellencyMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano  President of theRepublic of Mozambique  on behalf of the AfricanUnion. The Acting President clearly informed theinternational community about the resolve of theAfrican continent to overcome current obstacles tobuilding a new Africa in the areas of peace  security democracy  human rights  economic development andregional integration.It is precisely in this sprit that His ExcellencyMr. Denis Sassou Nguesso  President of the Republicof Congo  put forward his thoughts in a statemententitled  “For a Pan-African Pact against Aggression”15at the summit in Maputo  which constitutes acontribution to preventive diplomacy that will help tospare the African peoples the horrors of fratricidalstrife and enable them to devote themselves exclusivelyand usefully to development objectives and a code ofconduct between African States  lending timely supportto the framework outlined by the Peace and SecurityCouncil of the African Union. My country  which is thecurrent acting President of the Economic Communityof Central African States (ECCAS) and the CentralAfrican Economic and Monetary Community(CAEMC)  takes such concerns to heart as it dischargesits mandates in the management of various crises thatare shaking our subregion.We have already had the opportunity to deplorethe fact that Central Africa suffers from the paradox ofbeing both one of the richest subregions on thecontinent and one of the weakest zones in terms ofhuman development indices. All the current initiativesof the leaders of the subregion are geared towards theresolution of this paradox. Thus  during the past year significant progress had been registered in the variouscountries that have experienced  or are experiencing armed crises — Angola  Rwanda  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Congo  the Central AfricanRepublic  Burundi and Chad. In the quest to resolvethese crises  we have counted on the cooperation ofdiverse partners  especially the United Nations andAfrican Union.Allow me to briefly touch on some of thesituations that require particular attention from theinternational community. With respect to Angola  whilewe welcome the return of peace in that country ravaged for nearly three decades by civil war  we wishto urge the international community to help theAngolan authorities in their efforts at reconstruction.We continue to support the intention of the AngolanGovernment to submit for consideration at the presentsession a draft resolution on international assistance forthe reconstruction and economic development ofAngola.We also welcome the positive developmentsunder way in the Democratic Republic of the Congo distinguished in particular by the establishment oftransitional institutions and the deployment of theUnited Nations Organization Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo in Ituri. We urge theinternational community to continue its support for thepacification and reunification process under way in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and to furthercontribute substantively to the reconstructionprogrammes in place. I would like to reaffirm oursteadfast wish to see this neighbouring and brotherlycountry find peace again  a guarantee for stability ofthe subregion.I am also duty-bound to draw the attention of theinternational community to the situation in the CentralAfrican Republic  which has been confronted for yearswith serious and persistent economic  social andsecurity problems. I would like to recall here thatalarmed by this ever-worsening situation  CAEMC hasestablished an ad hoc committee on the Central AfricanRepublic  presided over by His Excellency El HadjOmar Bongo  President of the Gabonese Republic. Ithas also deployed a peacekeeping force in that country.CAEMC’s involvement in the Central AfricanRepublic  which has received much encouragement particularly from the Security Council  mainly aims atthe reconciliation of the Central African people  thepacification of the country and the prompt restorationof constitutional order. The holding of a CentralAfrican dialogue fits precisely in the framework of therecommended measures.This country  which has suffered greatly thesepast years  truly needs assistance from the internationalcommunity to regain peace  stability  economic growthand democracy. That is the meaning of the appeal madeat Brazzaville on 17 May 2003 by the ECCASMinisters at the meeting of the United NationsStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions inCentral Africa.Still with respect to our subregion  I would likefinally to stress in particular the crisis that raged in theDemocratic Republic of Sâo Tomé and Pr'ncipe in July2003. At that time  ECCAS  the African Union  theCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries andNigeria worked in perfect concert to re-establish theconstitutional order shattered in this country on 16 July2003. While we commend the contribution made by theUnited States and South Africa  we would like toappeal again for the entire international community togive substantial assistance to the Democratic Republicof Sâo Tomé and Pr'ncipe  particularly to theemergency programme that has just been established bythe Government of this country.We must also follow with great interestdevelopments in Burundi  where every step forward16must be supported and encouraged to make the processirreversible. To that end  the international communityis urgently called upon to make good on the financialcommitments made during the conferences in Paris andGeneva.The situations that I have just mentioned lead usto the relevant conclusions of the open SecurityCouncil meeting on 22 October 2002 on strengtheningcooperation between the United Nations system and theCentral African region in the maintenance of peace andsecurity. At that meeting  we expressed ourappreciation for the cooperation between our regionand the United Nations while welcoming  inter alia  thework of the Standing Advisory Committee on SecurityQuestions in Central Africa. We welcomed the multi-country programme of demobilization and reintegrationput forward by the World Bank.Since then  we welcomed the visit of the SecurityCouncil in June 2003 to the Great Lakes region and themultidisciplinary mission of the United Nationssystem  and we are eagerly awaiting its conclusions.These conclusions will allow us to meaningfullyparticipate in the future public debates of the SecurityCouncil on our subregion  one year after the meetingthat elaborated a comprehensive  integrated determined and concerted approach to the problems ofpeace  security and development of Central Africa.Energized by that approach  we intend toparticipate in the international conference on peace security  democracy and development in the GreatLakes region. We intend to seize this historicopportunity to exorcise the demons of hatred andviolence and lay the foundation for peacefulcoexistence among our peoples and nations  whichshare a common destiny.While reaffirming the central role that theDemocratic Republic of the Congo has to play in thatconference  I would like to stress that the Republic ofCongo  my country  which is close to the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo in so many ways  would notunderstand if it had to attend as an observer at thiscrucial event. The same goes  by all accounts  for otherneighbouring countries of the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  such as Angola and the Central AfricanRepublic.The issues of peace  security and buildingnational unity were at the core of the Congoleseauthorities’ concerns during the past year. It is in thisframework that the 17 March 2003 agreement must beplaced  thanks to which peace continues to reignthroughout the entire territory.Having regained peace  we are seeking to buildon it each day  particularly by implementing theprogramme of disarmament  demobilization andreintegration of ex-combatants. We are also workingtowards the resettlement of internally displacedpersons. It is not hard to fathom that these missionsrequire considerable funding  which the Congo cannotprovide alone. We would like to thank all our partnersfor their active solidarity.We must still meet the great challenges ofreconstruction  economy recovery  poverty reductionand the fight against HIV/AIDS  all sectors for whichnational strategies have been adopted. To implementthis vast project  which we have called “The NewHope”  we are mobilizing all the national forcescapable of providing assistance to the State  includinglocal government authorities  non-governmentalorganizations  civil society and the private sector. Inthat framework  we have conducted negotiations withour external partners with a view to benefiting from theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.All of these achievements can be implementedonly in a world free from fear  as envisaged by thefounders of our Organization  and as we believe today.This is why we wish to reiterate our faith andattachment to the United Nations  an irreplaceableframework and beacon of all hopes for peace forhumanity  and which has never seemed more clearlynecessary than today."
"38",1538,"COL",58,2003,"﻿Ishould like to congratulate you  Sir  upon your electionas President of the General Assembly  and to wish youevery success in the performance of your duties.Despite the anxiety that we feel in the face of theterrorism that is affecting so many countries  wereaffirm our commitment to fight that scourge until wehave defeated it. Colombia reaffirms its faith inmultilateralism as the most effective system throughwhich to seek peace  security and human  economicand social development. The United Nations isirreplaceable  even if  for the good of the humanity  itsstructure and procedures must be constantly updated soas to increase the efficiency of its anti-terrorismactivities.The United Nations itself recently suffered aterrorist attack  an act that resulted in the death ofSergio Vieira de Mello  a tireless campaigner for thecoexistence of peoples. We deeply regret the loss ofthose who have sacrificed their lives as they worked toput an end to terrorism. Our obligation to reciprocate isall the greater as a result of the solidarity expressed bythe United Nations towards Colombia.A year ago in the General Assembly I set out mydemocratic security policy  developed to free theColombian people from terrorism. That policy isdesigned to protect the rights of all citizens  regardlessof their social or economic status  political ideas orreligious beliefs. The policy affords equal protection tobusiness and union leaders as well as Government andopposition politicians. It is based on the dream of apluralist nation that shares in an ongoing constructivedebate in a spirit of brotherhood and without hatred.In an area of Colombia covering almost 1.2million square kilometres  about 400 000 of themconsisting of jungle  terrorists have taken advantage ofthe absence of a State presence in many places. A yearago  out of a total of 1 100 municipalities  170 did nothave a police presence. That number has been reducedto 151  and we hope to extend coverage to all themunicipalities within a few weeks. Hundreds of smallertowns  however  lack a police force. We now havesoldiers and marines — known as soldiers of thepeople — in 439 municipalities  under a programmethat allows them to carry out their military service intheir home town. The results thus far have beenpositive  and when the soldiers have completed theiractive duty  we hope to rely on them as permanent law-enforcement leaders.Such efforts  together with others that we haveundertaken in similar areas  must continue so that theGovernment can rid the country of terrorism.I would like to share with the Assembly some ofthe achievements of my Administration during the firstnine months of this year. The murder rate hasdecreased by 22 per cent when compared with the sameperiod in 2002 — down from 21 253 to 16 531. Thetotal of 1 485 kidnappings represents a reduction of34.7 per cent over the same period last year; thenumber of victims of illegal road blocks decreased by49 per cent  and the number of operations to rescuekidnapped people increased by 22.8 per cent. But whatcountry could accept 1 485 kidnappings in ninemonths?The number of massacres and the number of theirvictims have decreased by 35 per cent and 41 per centrespectively. We will be able to claim victory onlywhen we have completely eliminated these attacks.Every terrorist act brings suffering to the whole nation.FARC carried out the car bombing of the club ElNogal  used a bomb in a boat in the rural town ofPuerto Rico and exploded a truck bomb in the smalltown of Chita. These bombings together killed 47people and injured 233. And just a few hours ago  inFlorencia  another bomb has left 12 dead and wounded46.The number of union members assassinated hasdeclined from 120 to 36. Several of those responsibleare now in jail  as a result of our determination to fightimpunity. Sixty teachers were murdered in 2002. Thisyear  24 such cases have been reported. The number ofjournalists murdered has dropped from 9 to 5.The decrease in overall crime is significant  butthe numbers are still staggering. No country could feelsafe under such circumstances. I reaffirm ourdemocratic desire to protect  in particular  our teachers union leaders and journalists.9I acknowledge with great sorrow that the numberof indigenous people murdered has increased from 72to 75. Illegal self-defence groups were responsible for33 of those cases  with various guerrilla groups beingresponsible for the remainder.During the first six months of 2003  73 586 casesof forced displacement were reported. This represents adecrease of 66 per cent. We are beginning successfullyto return families to where they came from. I reaffirmour commitment to fight to protect the indigenouscommunities and to put an end to forced displacement.Of the 246 mayors who in August 2002 were inexile from their municipalities as a result of threats 191 have now returned  thanks to the improved securitysituation. The progress we have made in regard to theprotection of our citizens encourages us to continuemaking efforts in that direction.Between 7 August 2002 and 7 August 2003 2 544 members of illegal self-defence groups werecaptured  which represents an increase of 146 per cent.The number of those killed in combat by the armedforces has increased by 38.7 per cent  the number ofguerrillas captured has increased by 126.3 per cent andthe number of those killed in combat has increased by78 per cent.Because of my pure democratic conviction  Ireaffirm our commitment to human rights. We haveextended the stay of the Office of the United NationsCommissioner in Bogota. We agree with many of itsrecommendations. We have no doubt about seekingtheir implementation  and we will discuss the cases onwhich we disagree.Our requirement for the soldiers and the police isefficiency and respect for human rights. We encourageand care for our armed forces  as we demonstratedrecently with the improvement of our social securitysystem. However  we will not hesitate to send to jailthose who break the law.The sacrifice of our soldiers and policemen hasbeen enormous. This year  because of anti-personnelmines alone  109 soldiers have been killed and 334have been wounded  many of them mutilated for life.If we request international support  it is becausewe are open to international monitoring. We respect thehuman rights organizations and their workers whoproceed seriously and we respect their criticism andconstructive suggestions. Those organizationscontribute to improving democratic conditions. That iswhy we agree with the Human Rights Watch report onthe recruitment of children by terrorist groups. Wereserve the right  however  to disagree with falsereports which distort our efforts to consolidate ademocratic concept of security.As the United Nations has acknowledged  wehave made substantial progress in destroying illicitdrugs. We have eradicated 70 per cent of illicit crops and we will not stop until we rid our country of thatserious scourge. We have authorized the extradition of94 persons for drug-trafficking crimes.We have hired 5 400 families as forest rangers  aspart of our goal to recruit 50 000 families. They receiveeconomic compensation to replace illicit crops for thepurpose of replanting and taking care of the rainforest.A more effective law designed to confiscate illicitdrug wealth has allowed for the increase in the numberof rulings in one year from 5 to 68.In Colombia’s current situation  terrorism  illicitdrugs  violence and insecurity are really the samething. We plead for a commitment from the world sothat we are able to completely defeat drugs. Weimplore the world not to harbour our terrorists  to helpus confiscate their goods and to open their doors onlyto help peace processes.Our country is a State based on law. We want toovercome terrorism and be able to look to theinternational community with the certainty that wehave acted in strict compliance with the law. In order tofight impunity  we have incorporated the accusatorypenal system and oral procedure  which will begin in2005.At the present time we are introducing aconstitutional change to allow the armed forces toproceed with specialized personnel  in cases ofterrorism  to carry out raids  conduct property searchesand undertake interceptions. Those actions will beconducted with democratic safeguards  allowing for anindependent attorney to intervene quickly. Theattorney’s office and Congress will be informed. Theproposed measures are infinitely less rigorous than thecurrent laws of democracies that do not have the highlevels of terrorism that we have in Colombia.10This Government found approximately 30 000people who belong to illegal terrorist organizations defined in this way because of the nature of theiractions. Consideration and reflection on that figuredictates the need to continue with a strong authoritarianpolicy and of opening avenues for negotiation oncehostilities have ceased.I welcome the efforts made by the Secretary-General this past year to seek paths to peace with theFARC. The Government supports his good offices which  until now  have been unsuccessful because ofthe lack of willingness on the part of the terrorists.That group has kidnapped hundreds of Colombians andsome foreign citizens  most of whom are kept inconcentration camps that recall the Nazi era. I reaffirmto the Secretary-General my commitment to find asolution  to be recommended by him  to free thehostages  under conditions that are in keeping withlegal norms and that do not intensify violence.Since the last Colombian Government  we havesought  through Cuba  on the one hand  and severaladditional Governments on the other  a peace processwith the National Liberation Army (ELN). We havemade every effort  which  to date  has been futile. Theleaders of that group who are in jail have received thebest treatment possible. On 30 June  through afacilitation commission  I offered to examine an ELNprisoner release proposal  in exchange for theirrenunciation of armed activity and their dedication tohelp achieve peace. I did not get a positive response but I will continue to insist on this.The ELN is holding seven foreign citizens whomit should release  in keeping with its promise to ceaseits crimes during the current electoral process.Since the last Government  we have also sought apeace process with the illegal paramilitary groups  withthe mediation of the Catholic Church. The condition isthe same — the cessation of hostilities. Groups of thoseorganizations  which represent 10 000 or more people have expressed the willingness to demobilize. TheGovernment is making progress in that process.During my Administration  2 250 members ofterrorist groups have been demobilized; 70 per cent ofthem belong to the FARC  18 per cent to the ELN and12 per cent to illegal paramilitary groups. Toreintegrate members of the various groups into civilianlife  Colombia requires a judicial framework thatrealistically defines how to achieve justice  repairdamage to the community and ensure peace. Thealternative sentence proposal  submitted by theGovernment for congressional consideration  sets fortha legal and transparent procedure that will allow forprogress towards a negotiated peace solution with theillegal paramilitary groups  the FARC and the ELN.I understand the concern raised by offeringdiminished sentences for grave crimes. But  in acontext of 30 000 terrorists  it must also be understoodthat a definitive peace is the best justice for a nation inwhich several generations have never gone through asingle day without experiencing an act of terrorism.The proposal has prompted national andinternational controversy. We are looking for thebroadest possible consensus. We invite everyone toexamine the various options and to achieve  throughthe process of amendments  the best final text.We have no doubt about defeating terrorism.However  there are times that call for adjusting theequation between justice and peace in order to reach aconsolidated peace.We agree with what was expressed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who has proposed an excellentbalance between the need for justice and the need tosave innocent lives. To protect our communities  weneed to pursue terrorists relentlessly and not missopportunities to obtain peace agreements with them provided that  through their actions  they convince theColombian people and the world of their good faith andtheir desire for rectification.Our problem is an international threat. IfColombia does not destroy illegal drugs  illegal drugswill destroy the Amazon Basin. If Colombia does notstop terrorism  it will jeopardize the democracies of theregion. The President of Ecuador  Lucio Gutiérrez  andthe Rio Group  have understood that. The Rio Groupendorsed the proposal that the United Nations continueto make efforts for negotiations with the Colombianterrorists  or  if that is not possible  to seek alternativesto overcome the problem.Our rule of law calls for a social commitment.Poverty and inequality have worsened as a result ofterrorism. We are making progress with limitedresources in applying the seven tools for equality: aneducational revolution  expanded social protection  aneconomy based on the principle of solidarity  ruralsocial management  management of public services building a country of owners and improving the qualityof urban life.As examples of this  we have created newcapacity for 500 000 children in schools  but we stillhave 1.5 million children who do not have access toprimary education. Microcredit has increased by 50 percent  but we are still far from being a country ofowners. The social task is arduous  but with ourcharacteristic determination we will overcome everyobstacle in order to build a just society.Security is the most important human right of thepoor  who need our policy to be successful so that therecan be peace  confidence  investment  employment andequity.Amidst tragedies  the Colombian democracy isvigorous. On 25 October  our citizens will decidewhether to accept a referendum to defeat corruptionand to strengthen social investment. And the followingday the people will elect 30 governors from among 133candidates; 914 mayors from among 3 441 candidates;398 deputies from 373 lists composed of 2 723candidates; approximately 9 000 municipal councilmembers from 6 105 lists with 56 590 candidates; andlocal administrative boards from 3 156 lists with13 387 candidates. Today  we live in a pluralistic andenthusiastic democracy  despite the challenge ofterrorism.It would be a tragedy if the civilized world doesnot unite its efforts once and for all to defeat terrorismand to support the democracies that are fighting againstit. We need the unity of all democratic people in orderto defeat terror."
"39",1578,"COM",58,2003,"﻿It is agreat pleasure for me to join with others who havespoken before me in congratulating  on behalf of mycountry  the Union of the Comoros  and on my ownbehalf  Mr. Julian Hunte on his election to preside overthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. We areconvinced that  given his wisdom and extensiveexperience  he will guide our work to a successful8 outcome. I am very pleased to assure him of the fullcooperation and support of my entire delegation.I would also like to express appreciation for theopenness demonstrated by his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Jan Kavan  throughout the fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly  over which hepresided with the skill and farsightedness that we allknow so well.I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his dedication to this global Organization   asentiment that I am sure is shared by all nations.It goes without saying that the challenges beforeus are great  as many changes are taking place in theworld at an ever-increasing rate  requiring renewedcommitment on the part of the United Nations  as wellas a strengthening of its role. Unfortunately  every daywe see evidence of the risks that such changes entail.In this context my country  the Union of the Comoros joins those who have paid tribute to the memory of theUnited Nations staff members who fell as a result ofthe indiscriminate violence and terrorism in Baghdad including the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello.Today more than ever  we should be concernedabout the direction in which the world is heading. Theworld is characterized by violence  poverty and despair  despite the fact that science and technology havenever been more advanced and wealth never moreabundant. The division of the world into developed anddeveloping countries does nothing to assuage ourcommon fears and uncertainties.It is true that the countries of the North are increasingly  questioning themselves on the subjectterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. But it must be recognized that thecountries of the South  while asking themselves thesame questions  are also labouring increasingly underthe burden of debt  civil war  insecurity  poverty andendemic disease. The pursuit of security and harmonyin the world therefore requires a sustained focus on allcountries with a view to achieving a safer  more unifiedand more humane world.Of course  as we see every day  terrorism cowardly and indiscriminate  thrives in poverty andseeks to express itself through violence  exploiting theweakest links in the global chain. It respects noboundary  no race and no religion. As His ExcellencyGeorge W. Bush  President of the United States ofAmerica  rightly said in his address to the GeneralAssembly  the victims of terrorism are also to be foundin Bali  Casablanca  Dar es Salaam  Mombassa Nairobi and Baghdad. We must respond  therefore  soas to ensure that such borderless networks never gainany respite and so as to prevent cowardice fromholding sway and destroying humanity.In order to better combat this situation  we mustbring terrorists to justice and commit ourselvesresolutely to the long-term fight against terrorismitself. In order to do so  we must fight frustration andinjustice and appeal for greater tolerance and forrespect for the right to differ and for the right of everypeople to live in dignity.In suppressing terrorism  however  we must guardagainst any tendency to strike a blow against humanrights  and refrain from equating terrorism with certainreligions or regions. Indeed  committing such a gravemistake could give rise to a vicious circle of hatred vengeance and isolationism at the global level. Mycountry is steadfastly committed to preventing andcombating terrorism in all its forms  and we have setup the necessary institutional mechanisms to this end.We appeal for greater technical and logistical supportfrom the international community to help us to be moresuccessful in this fight.All the countries of the world   those of theNorth and South alike   have a shared destiny.Countries and peoples cannot get along without eachother. Solidarity is a necessity; complementarity is anobligation. But we must recognize and reaffirm that wecannot today truly talk about security in a world ofpoverty. We cannot talk about peace if we do notensure the economic development and well-being of allpeoples. Harmony and democracy cannot reign in theworld if it is rife with inequalities and disparities thatleave entire sectors of the global population inconditions of uncertainty  precariousness and oblivion.We have  indeed  forgotten that humankind mustbe at the centre of all of our concerns. Unfortunately the general feeling of uncertainty   the daily fear thatall of us experience   vividly brings to mind the factthat  whatever the social status of particularindividuals  humankind is vulnerable and people needeach other in order to be reassured and to survive.But the insecurity that causes so much anxietythroughout the world and makes it seem so fragile has9 a number of different sources. We are entitled to ask  aswe consider the current situation  if it was wise in thepast to have brought together   almost by force  people of various nationalities  given that nothing wasdone to foster a common desire among them to livetogether.It should come as no surprise  therefore  thatthere are inter-ethnic problems and friction betweennationalities in many States throughout the world  andthat these are a source of instability and insecurity.That shows the seriousness of lack of respect for thedifferences and even the character of each people in theworld's harmonious development.Countries and peoples throughout the world aresearching for their integrity  their sovereignty and theiridentity. Most often  of course  that generates threats topeace and security. The same causes produce the sameeffects everywhere. My country  the Union of theComoros   today still a victim of its colonial past  is very eloquent testimony to that. But there are similarcases  particularly in China  in Morocco  in Palestineand in other regions. Under those conditions  theComorian State is experiencing   as might be the casefor any other country   all the difficulties of achievingreal development in its desire to consolidate democracy.Today  democracy and respect for human rightsare requirements that must be respected by everycountry. It is universally established that democracy isthe most appropriate remedy to overcome the pain ofcountries and of peoples. But it is also established that whatever the remedy  the dose must be prescribedaccording to the patient's age and physical state  andobviously one must always bear in mind the possibleside effects. So we must help every country to move atits own pace on the path of democracy  while bearingin mind each people's history and traditions.The dialogue of cultures   openness towards theother   must be a permanent inspiration in thecommitment to a peaceful and responsible internationallife. Multilateralism   which is the guarantee ofparticipation by every nation in the world's progress  must be safeguarded and strengthened. Therefore  wesupport the proposals of the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  for a restructuring of the Organization sothat it will be effective and can meet currentchallenges. In that way  the moral authority of theUnited Nations will be gradually restored andmaintained. As for the Security Council   the bodycharged with maintaining peace and security   it mustbe reformed and its role must be fine-tuned. That is anessential condition for ensuring the success of itsdiverse missions.In its development  the world   if it is to beharmonious and stable   must concern itself with andbear in mind the most vulnerable regions and the mostdisadvantaged countries. Among those  the small islandStates deserve particular attention so that we can bridgethe development gap inherent to their geographicalsituation. Only economic development   and thus realsolidarity between rich and poor countries   willguarantee stability and peace in the world. Thus willdemocracy and the rule of law be consolidated andstrengthened.The New Partnership for Africa's Development  an ambitious project conceived in Africa byAfricans for Africans   must be a reality that issupported by and profitable for all. Debt   which is atrue burden and is truly stifling developing economies  must be circumscribed and overcome to liberate thecountries of the South and to give them the capacity forreal involvement in global wealth creation. But  inorder to support the survival and emergence of oureconomies  we must also put an end to agriculturalproduct subsidies in the countries of the North and letthe market have free reign. Our countries seek andneed support so that they can emerge from economicmarginalization. Our assets and our potential deserve tobe valued. Our efforts must be encouraged.My country  which believes in Africa's ability totake charge of itself  is facing its future withdetermination and responsibility. I do not believe it isuseful to return to the ups and downs that have markedmy country's historical development   particularly thepast few years  characterized by a secessionist crisiswith tragic consequences. Today  I welcome the new-found normality and the significant progress achieved.We owe that success to Comorian wisdom  to thenational conscience and to the multiform assistance ofall our bilateral and multilateral partners. Today  wemust still establish the Assemblies. But the Comoriansare convinced that only real economic development canguarantee national cohesion and ensure a secure future.The international community's support is neededmore than ever before. I thank our partner countriesand organizations  particularly the Republic of SouthAfrica and the African Union  which have always had10 confidence in the Comorian people and stand by themin their resolve to achieve stability and well-being forevery citizen. Together  we have an opportunity toguarantee a more just and more humane world. Theinternational system's weaknesses  the blindness andthe deafness  and the ill-fated and suicidal networksmust be overcome  allowing the emergence of aninternational conscience  the guarantee of unity  peaceand solidarity. The world needs each of us  everycountry and every difference  to guarantee its future.Let us commit ourselves  all together  with resolve anddetermination."
"40",1617,"CPV",58,2003,"﻿Let me at thevery outset offer my warm congratulations to Mr.Hunte on his election to preside over this fifty-eighthsession of the General Assembly. With his proven skillsin the field of international affairs and his wide-rangingexperience  we are confident that we will dealeffectively with the many crucial tasks facing thisAssembly. I assure him of the full support and bestwishes of my delegation as he carries out the tasks ofhis high office.Let me also extend our appreciation to theoutgoing President  Mr. Jan Kavan  whose committedefforts guided the fifty-seventh session of thisAssembly.I wish to express my delegation’s appreciation forthe indefatigable efforts of the Secretary-General topreserve and enhance the role of our Organization lastyear  which proved to be one of the most difficult in itsexistence. One sad sign of this was the bombing of theUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad last month which took the lives of Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21other persons of different nationalities. It was amonstrous act that deserved strong and universalcondemnation. Nothing could justify such a senselessattack against the civil personnel of a mission whoseaims were none other than to help the Iraqi people toface the tragic situation in which they are living. Wethus pay our respectful homage to the memory of thosededicated persons who lost their lives in the tragedy.My country fully cooperates with the UnitedNations bodies in the struggle against terrorism andorganized crime. However  the fight against terrorismshould not lead the international community todownplay the importance of promoting developmentand fighting poverty and everything associated with it including hunger  illness  illiteracy and environmentaldegradation. Nor should the international communityforget the need to guarantee the respect of the rights ofpeoples and individuals  combat discrimination and allits aspects that deprive human beings of their dignity.Very relevant proposals concerning the future ofour Organization have been presented by the Secretary-General. He stressed the need to accelerate the reformof the United Nations by adapting it to the realities ofthe world in which we live  namely addressing thequestion of enlarging the Security Council andincreasing the number of its permanent members strengthening the General Assembly and reinvigoratingthe role of the United Nations Economic and SocialCouncil (ECOSOC)  as well as of the United Nationsas a whole  including its relationship with the BrettonWoods institutions.By their size  economic power  regional andinternational influence  there are obvious candidates tobecome permanent members of the Security Council.Their weight in international affairs can no longer beoverlooked. We should not lose sight of the fact thattheir contributions to peace  security and developmentcan bring more legitimacy to the body. The time is ripeto welcome those countries in an enlarged and morerepresentative Security Council  in which Africa shouldhave at least two permanent seats.Being a member of the Community of PortugueseSpeaking Countries (CPLP)  Brazil should  in our view take a permanent seat in the Council.The issues relating to the reform of the UnitedNations have been the subject of a longstanding debatethat points to an overwhelming consensus amongMember States. My delegation supports the proposalsmade by the Secretary-General and hopes that themomentum provided by acknowledgement of thechallenges  threats and dangers faced by the world willbe seized by this Assembly and instil its members withthe sense of urgency to come up with appropriatebinding and pragmatic decisions relating to theseissues.18As the President of the Assembly rightly pointedout in his inaugural speech  “Many developingcountries do not have a wide range of developmentchoices available to them and in fact face seriouschallenges due to their special circumstances.”Among these developing countries theinternational community recognized small islanddeveloping states as a special case of development andenvironment. It will be during the mandate of thecurrent President of the General Assembly that  byhappy coincidence  an international meeting will beheld in Mauritius to assess the state of implementationof the Barbados Programme of Action.Earlier this month  Cape Verde hosted the secondregional preparatory meeting in anticipation of theMauritius event. In this context  I would like tounderline the meaning of my country’s commitment tothe process of global support to the sustainabledevelopment of small island developing states  aprocess to which my Government is fully dedicated.The SIDS denomination has now been inexistence for nearly a decade. The work accomplishedby the United Nations toward a greater internationalawareness of the problems of small island developingstates has been generally successful.I take this opportunity to express myGovernment’s gratitude to the entire United Nationssystem for the central role it has played in cultivatingand maintaining the high degree of internationalawareness that is essential to our countries.However  the recognition of a special category ofcountries cannot be justified for the purposes ofclassification alone. One would expect that the specialdesignation would lead to some minimal amount ofspecial treatment of the countries concerned commensurate with their specific disadvantages andhandicaps. Regrettably that is not the case with thesmall island developing states. In fact  island-specificspecial treatment is almost non-existent  even thoughmany SIDS are in dire need of greater differentiation inthe current pattern of international cooperation.I therefore wish to convey my Government’shope that the Barbados Programme of Action +10process  culminating in the Mauritius internationalmeeting  will constitute a landmark in the history of thedifferentiated treatment of developing countries particularly small island developing States.The need for special consideration that is mostcommonly shared by small island developing states isthe need to see market-access preferences preserved not eroded. Such a need is not a luxury  but aprerequisite for many SIDS in their efforts to maintaincompetitiveness and economic viability in response tothe structural disadvantages resulting from theirremoteness and small size.While several SIDS do enjoy a fair amount ofspecial treatment  such as the treatment derived fromleast developed country (LDC)  African  Caribbean andPacific States (ACP) or African Growth andOpportunity Act (AGOA) status  there are still areas ofinternational cooperation in which the absence ofreference to island status is difficult to understand. Oneof these areas — of direct relevance to the question oftrade preferences — is the ongoing debate in the WorldTrade Organization concerning the Work Programmeon Small Economies  a debate in which small islanddeveloping states  regrettably  have not been able toadvocate their case under the SIDS designation.Cape Verde has again been deemed to qualify forgraduation from least developed country (LDC) statusunder the criteria and graduation rules used by theCommittee for Development Policy and the Economicand Social Council. As stressed by my delegation inthe substantive session of the Council in July  we feelthat a decision to graduate Cape Verde from leastdeveloped country status at this juncture would givethe international community a gravely incorrectimpression of our structural progress and prosperity whereas Cape Verde remains one of the mosteconomically vulnerable and aid-dependent countriesin the world.Here we are faced with a peculiar paradox: in thecontext of its support to small island developing statesthe United Nations system recognizes the permanenthandicaps of a country  but  at the same time  it isconsidering withdrawing the special treatment thiscountry has been eligible for  without leaving anyalternative treatment available.In this context  and in the light of theinternational recognition of the special handicaps ofsmall island developing states  my Government urgesthe General Assembly to request the relevant bodies ofthe United Nations system to re-examine with care therule whereby a least developed country would be seenas qualifying for graduation. We believe that such re-19examination ought to result in a methodological reformthat will do justice to the least developed small islanddeveloping States.Africa has made a remarkable effort to respondpositively to the call of the international communityand its own peoples to foster development  promotedemocracy  transparency  good governance  the rule oflaw and accountability. In the wake of this call Africanleaders agreed to establish the New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD)  in whose success weare all engaged in order to lead our continent out ofpoverty and conflict  ushering in a new era ofprosperity and peace. Its adoption not only by theAfrican Governments and civil societies but also by theinternational community as a framework for Africandevelopment will help establish common goals andclear commitments that will lead our continent on apromising new journey. We believe that the NEPADproject should pay special attention to the situation ofthe island States.Noticeable progress has been achieved  both inthe manner of installing democratic Governmentsthroughout the continent and in putting an end toconflicts.In this particular case  we are heartened by therecent accord between the Sudanese Government andthe Sudan People’s Liberation Army. This constitutes avery significant step towards putting an end to thesuffering of the Sudanese people. If  as we allanxiously hope  this agreement brings peace to thatgreat African nation  it will add to the successesalready registered in Mozambique  Angola and SierraLeone  along with the ongoing processes in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  the Great Lakesand Liberia.We must be cautious  however. Conflicts resultfrom unsettled social and political issues. If these arenot adequately tackled  the risk of new conflicts willpersist. It is important to recall that democracy and therule of law can develop unhindered only when and ifthe minimum conditions for survival are assured for thepopulations and when the rights of individuals andgroups  including minorities  are respected.The events in Guinea-Bissau two weeks agoillustrate the fragility of the institutions in a countrythat cannot address the basic problems of itspopulation. While it may be true that political leadersmust be held accountable for not ensuring goodgovernance  in an environment of poverty  lack ofresources and indebtedness good governance is easilyset aside. These events point to the need for a strongercommitment of the international community to helpingcountries in distress face the tasks of fighting poverty consolidating democratic institutions and promotingeconomic and social development not only withpromises and advice  but also with concrete means.Notwithstanding the serious threats that hoverover mankind  a safer  more just and more peacefulworld is now within reach of our living generations.Never before has mankind had such an array of meansto face the great challenges that continue to defyhumankind  such as hunger  poverty  illiteracy andcurable diseases. Hunger is a case in point. Severalexperiences in different regions of the world prove thathunger can be eliminated if there is determination andavailable resources. It is therefore unacceptable that  ina world awash with food  one in three sub-SaharanAfricans should continue to suffer from chronic hunger.Last July  at the second ordinary session of theAssembly of the African Union  held in Maputo Mozambique  heads of State and Government of theAfrican Union adopted a Declaration on Agricultureand Food Security in Africa. In this Declaration African leaders once again demonstrated their firmcommitment to combating hunger on the Africancontinent.At the national level  fighting hunger was set asone of the main priorities of the first Government ofCape Verde immediately after independence andcontinues to have a prominent place in Governmentpolicies in the framework of poverty reductionstrategies. That is why we support the plea made by thePresident of Brazil to establish a world committee tofight hunger.Three years ago  world leaders endowedthemselves with the important political tool that is theMillennium Declaration. There is no excuse for the factthat the promised resources and the proclaimed willhave not been put to work to achieve and even surpassthe arduously negotiated but unanimously agreed Goalsadopted in this very Hall. Despite the difficulties anduncertainties looming over the Organization  the eyesof the world are focused on the United Nations becauseall believe that our Organization can and should be thevehicle for achieving those Goals. Let us work togetherto make it happen.20"
"41",1663,"CRI",58,2003,"﻿Allow me at the outset to congratulate His ExcellencyMr. Julian Hunte on his well-deserved election to thepresidency of the General Assembly. We are convincedthat his well-known personal and professional qualitieswill allow him to lead our work to full success.We particularly welcome the fact that a fraternalCaribbean country should hold so high a position. Wetrust that your election will shed light on the role of thesmaller nations in this Organization and will allow usto consider the challenges that small economies face.Today  once again  the international community isgathered at the United Nations to consider the mostserious problems afflicting mankind and to designspecific measures to resolve them. In so doing  wemust recall the essential purpose of this session  attaining peace  justice and well-being for each andvery individual on this planet. Indeed  the human rightto peace informs  nourishes and justifies all other basicrights and constitutes the very essence of the purposesand principles of the United Nations.Basic individual freedoms  political  social andeconomic rights and commitments to sustainabledevelopment and disarmament all have a singlepurpose   securing peace  freedom and happiness forall. The first step towards peace therefore is full respectfor human rights.Fundamental human rights constitute a minimalframework of guarantees necessary to ensure theintegral development of the human person and theconstruction of a harmonious society. For that reason respect for human rights at all levels of society and forall peoples  without distinction  is indispensable.Costa Rica advocates for the strengthening of theinternational mechanisms for the promotion andmonitoring of human rights. We must overcome thepoliticization of verification machinery by creating31objective criteria for the implementation of humanrights instruments in such a way that verification itselfencourages policies that promote human rights and thatconsolidate their protection.Similarly  it is necessary to achieve theuniversality of international treaties that promoterespect for basic rights. In that context  we welcomethe fact that  in conjunction with the current generaldebate  a special treaty event to promote the signatureand the ratification of the Optional Protocol to theConvention Against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhumanor Degrading Treatment or Punishment is being held.That instrument constitutes an effective mechanism forpreventing those very serious violations of humandignity.We welcome the creation and the establishment ofthe International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague thanks to the successful election of its Judges lastFebruary. Fortunately  mankind now possesses aneffective  independent and impartial institution with theauthority to prosecute the most serious crimes thatinfringe upon human dignity.We also deem it urgent to consider therelationship between human rights and theenvironment. We welcome the fact that theJohannesburg Plan of Implementation recognized theimportance of studying  in an exhaustive andtransparent way  that relationship between humanrights and the environment  including the fundamentalright to development. We consider it indispensable thatthis item be added to the agenda of the GeneralAssembly.Full observance of human rights is beingthreatened by some recent developments in the area ofbiotechnology. Unquestionably  progress in the areas ofmedical science and genetic research facilitate thedevelopment and the discovery of new therapies andmedical techniques. However  those same technologiespose new ethical challenges  because they can be usedto violate human rights and assault the intrinsic dignityof the human person.The use of human embryos in scientificexperiments  discarding them in the process  isunacceptable. Cloning reduces the individual to a mereobject of industrial production and manipulation. Thatis objectionable both morally and legally. Costa Ricasupports the prohibition of all forms of human cloningand has proposed a draft resolution to this end  whichtoday has dozens of countries sponsoring it.The second step in the path to peace is to makedemocracy a form of life. True democracy is apermanent process that demands daily efforts ofcoordination and cooperation in order to respect thewill of the majority and the rights of the minorities.True democracy also entails equal opportunities in theareas of social and economic development.A third step to peace is disarmament demilitarization and the reduction of militaryexpenditures. The reduction of military arsenalsdecreases opportunities for violence and makes itpossible to devote greater resources to socialdevelopment programmes. In that context  we welcomethe progress made by the Central American nationsregarding the reduction of their armed forces andmilitary arsenals. Two States from the region havealready abolished their armies   Panama in 1990 andCosta Rica since 1948. We support the proposal ofPresident Bolanos of Nicaragua  on the reasonablebalance of forces in the Central American region which will generate greater transparency andconfidence.My Government supports the adoption of acomplete ban on arms transfers to all terrorist groups as well as to those groups and Governments thatcommit gross or systematic violations of human rightsor international humanitarian law. The prompt adoptionof a legally binding convention to regulate the armstrade is urgent.We urge those States that possess nuclearweapons to truly commit themselves to the nucleardisarmament negotiations. We call upon all States torenounce the development of new nuclear weapons andto ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of NuclearWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty.We welcome the fact that the member States ofthe Organization of American States have recentlyadopted a Costa Rican initiative on the non-proliferation of chemical weapons in the WesternHemisphere.The pursuit of peace requires the peacefulresolution of conflicts through the mechanismsestablished pursuant to international law. TheInternational Court of Justice occupies a central32position as the principal judicial organ of the UnitedNations that ensures the rule of law in internationalrelations. We urge all States to accept its obligatoryjurisdiction without conditions.In order to make further progress towards peacewe must strengthen United Nations mechanismsdesigned to prevent armed conflict and humanitariancrises from occurring and to re-establish the peace oncesuch conflicts have broken out. The Security Councilmust carry out its duties in a more effective  active andfair way; no national interest should prevent it fromtaking action. In this context  we must revitalize theSecurity Council reform process  which  after 10 yearsof work  still lacks results.In order to attain peace and prevent civil wars  wemust devote sufficient financial  technical and humanresources to the peacekeeping operations carried outunder the auspices of this Organization. Such missionsshould enjoy the resolute support and effectiveparticipation of all nations  as was reaffirmed in theRio Group statement on the situation in Colombia adopted on 24 May in Cuzco. We urgently appeal forthis Organization to support the peace process inColombia and to urge the guerrilla movements to signan agreement to cease hostilities and enter into anopen-ended and transparent dialogue with a view toreaching a peaceful and definitive resolution of theColombian conflict.The United Nations must decisively address thedeep-rooted causes of armed conflict. It is necessary toeliminate the sources of tension and violence. It isessential to eradicate the economic  social and politicalinjustices that fuel conflict.The change of regime in Iraq  which we welcome has given the United Nations and the internationalcommunity at large a unique opportunity to fullyintegrate that nation into the international system. Wemust not miss this opportunity. We therefore call uponthe occupying Powers  the rest of the internationalcommunity and the United Nations to work for thereconstruction and normalization of that nation.Furthermore  we must not allow Iraq to become asource of regional instability or a breeding ground forinternational terrorism. We must bear in mind thesacrifice made by Sergio Vieira de Mello and all theother United Nations personnel who gave their lives inBaghdad for this Organization and for the people ofIraq. Their sacrifice must guide us in our work. Theirmartyrdom must lead us to devote every effort to theprotection of the fundamental right to peace.Today  peace is threatened by the resurgence ofinternational terrorism. All necessary measures musttherefore be taken  in conformity with the rule of law to prevent acts of terrorism and punish those whocommit them. The fight against international terrorism however  should not become an excuse to violatehuman rights or to adopt repressive measures againstan innocent population.In 1971  the General Assembly approved theentry of the People's Republic of China into the UnitedNations. That decision was correct  inasmuch as itpromoted the universal character of this globalOrganization. In accordance with that same principle my country has since that time been advocating that theRepublic of China on Taiwan also be represented inthis Organization.We believe that the Republic of China on Taiwancould greatly contribute to the work of thisOrganization. For many years that nation was an activeMember of the United Nations. It participatedconstructively in all of its activities and the work of itsbodies. Since then  the Republic of China on Taiwanhas been developing close and productive relationswith peoples and Governments throughout the world promoting programmes and projects for the sustainabledevelopment of communities. In keeping with theprinciple of universality that the United Nations itselfpromotes  Costa Rica advocates that both Governmentsbe represented at this Organization.I have set out a series of steps that areindispensable if peace is to be fully enjoyed. Such stepsare the very least we need to take in order to fulfil ourcommitment to peace   and that commitment must beabsolute.May God bless us all as we work for the well-being of humankind."
"42",1732,"CUB",58,2003,"﻿Lastcentury bore witness to two terrible world wars  inwhich over 80 million human beings perished. It laterseemed that  due to the lessons learned  the UnitedNations Organization was born so that war would neveragain occur. The Charter  adopted in San Francisconearly 60 years ago  proclaimed the purpose of savingsucceeding generations from the scourge of war'.However  after that we suffered wars of aggression andconquest  colonial wars  border wars and ethnic wars.Many peoples were left with no other choice but war todefend their rights. Moreover  in the last 13 years thescourge of war has taken another 6 million lives.Sixty years ago  the world order proclaimed inthe United Nations Charter was sustained through themilitary balance of two super-Powers. A bipolar worldwas born  which generated clashes  divisions  the coldwar and almost a devastating nuclear war. It was notthe ideal world  far from it. But since one of thosesuper-Powers has disappeared  the current world isworse and more dangerous.Now world order cannot be held together in thespheres of influence of two similar super-Powers or bymutual deterrence. What should it be founded on  then?On the honest and generous recognition by the onlysuper-Power that  far from disturbing it  shouldcontribute to the creation of a peaceful world  with theright to justice and development for all.Does the war in Iraq contribute to that objective?No  it does not. Its outcome is just the opposite of theideal of preserving peace  strengthening the role of theUnited Nations and enhancing multilateralism andinternational cooperation. Unfortunately  the truth isthat those most able to prevent and remove threats topeace are the ones causing war today.Should the Government of the United Statesrecognize this truth that almost everyone in this Hallshares? Yes. What humiliation or harm would there beto the prestige of this great nation? None. The worldwould recognize that a remedy benefiting all had comeabout  after the unleashing of a war supported by just afew  either by shortsightedness or by meanness ofinterests; after it was proven that the pretexts brandishedwere not true; and after observing the reaction of a peoplewho  as every invaded and occupied people will do have begun to fight and will continue to fight forrespect for their right to self-determination.23Therefore  must the occupation in Iraq cease?Yes  and the sooner the better. It is a source of new andmore serious problems  not of solutions. Must theIraqis be left alone to freely establish their ownGovernment and institutions and make decisions ontheir natural resources? Yes. It is their right  and theywill not stop fighting for it.Must the Security Council be pressured intoadopting decisions that would further undermine itethically and morally? No. That would eliminate thelast possibility to profoundly reform  expand anddemocratize the Council. The future of the UnitedNations will be determined today in the outcome of theinternational crisis generated by the war in Iraq.The most critical danger stalking us today is thepersistence of a world where what prevails is the law ofthe jungle  the might of the most powerful  theprivileges and extravagance of a handful of countries and the dangers of aggression  underdevelopment andhopelessness for the vast majority.Will a worldwide dictatorship be imposed on ourpeoples  or will the United Nations and multilateralismbe preserved? That is the question. We all agree  I believe that the role of the United Nations is irrelevant today  or atleast is on its way to being so. But some of us say so withconcern and would like to strengthen the Organization.Others say so with covert satisfaction and encouragethe hope of imposing their designs on the world.We must speak frankly. What role does theGeneral Assembly play today? In truth  almost none. Itis merely a debating forum without any true influenceor practical role whatsoever.Are international relations governed by thepurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter? No.Why now  when philosophy  the arts and science arereaching unprecedented levels  is the superiority ofsome peoples over others once again proclaimed? Andwhy are other peoples  who should be treated asbrothers and sisters  referred to as living in the darkcorners of the planet or on the Euro-Atlantic peripheryof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization? Why dosome among us feel entitled to launch a unilateral war given the fact that in the Charter we proclaimed thatmilitary force would only be used to serve the commoninterest and that collective measures should be taken topreserve peace? Why is there no longer any talk aboutusing peaceful means to settle disputes? Can webelieve that everyone is fostering friendship among ournations on the basis of respect for the principle ofequality of rights and the self-determination ofpeoples? Why then has my people had to suffer  andcontinue to suffer  from over four decades ofaggression and economic blockade?The principle of the sovereign equality for allStates was established when the Charter was adopted.Are we in fact equal? Do all Member States enjoysimilar rights? According to the Charter we do  butaccording to stark reality we do not. Respect for theprinciple of the sovereign equality of States  whichshould be the cornerstone of contemporaryinternational relations  will only be established if themost powerful countries accept in real terms that theymust respect the rights of others  even if those othercountries lack the military might and the economicpower to defend those rights. Are the mightiest andmost developed countries ready to respect the rights ofothers  even if doing so might perhaps slightly restrainthe privileges they enjoy? I am afraid that they are not.Are the principles of the non-use or the threat of useforce  non-interference in the internal affairs of States the peaceful settlement of disputes  and respect for theterritorial integrity and independence of States actuallyin force? According to the language and the spirit ofthe Charter  they are. But are they really?It is true that a handful of developed countries hasbenefited from the current situation over the last fewdecades. But that time is coming to an end. Thosecountries are also beginning to become victims of theimperial policies of a single super-Power. Should theynot take into account  with modesty and common sense the need to work with the over 130 Third World countriesthat have been compelled to endure this unjust order andthat are ready to attempt to persuade the most powerfulcountry to put aside its arrogance and to comply withits duties as a founder of the United Nations?Cuba believes that we should not  and cannot relinquish multilateralism; that we should not  andcannot  relinquish the United Nations; and that wecannot  and should not  relinquish the struggle for aworld of peace  justice  equality and development forall. Cuba therefore believes that we must achieve threeimmediate objectives.First and foremost  we must put an end to theoccupation of Iraq  hand over real control to the UnitedNations immediately and begin the recovery process tore-establish Iraq's sovereignty and put in place a24legitimate Government decided upon by the Iraqipeople. In addition  the scandalous distribution ofIraq's wealth must cease immediately. That will bebeneficial for the United States  whose young peopleare dying in Iraq while waging an unjust and ingloriouswar. It will be beneficial for Iraq  whose people will beable to turn over a new page in their history. It will bebeneficial for the United Nations  which has also beena victim of that war. And it will be beneficial for all ofour countries  which have had to suffer internationaleconomic recession and an increase insecurity that isthreatening us all.Secondly  we must address without delay theissue of truly reforming the United Nations and  aboveall  undertake a far-reaching democratization process.The current situation is already untenable  asevidenced  first of all  by the Security Council'sshameful inability to prevent the war in Iraq and secondly  by its demand on the Government of Israel torefrain from expelling or murdering the leader of thePalestinian people   a people who  in accordance witha decision the Council itself took over five decadesago  should long ago have had an independent State.That the Government of the United States has exercisedits veto power on 26 occasions to protect the crimes ofIsrael is evidence of the fact that that unjust privilegemust be abolished.What is needed is a reform that goes back to theroots of the founding of the United Nations; thatguarantees effective respect for the Charter; and thatre-establishes the mechanisms of collective securityand the rule of international law. Reform should alsoensure the ability of the United Nations to preservepeace and to lead the fight for general and completedisarmament  including nuclear disarmament  to whichmany generations have aspired. Reform should alsorestore to the United Nations its prerogatives to fightfor the socio-economic development and the basicrights of all the planet's inhabitants  including therights to food and life. Doing so is more necessary thanever before  given that neo-liberalism has spectacularlyfailed and that a new opportunity now exists forestablishing a new system of international economicrelations. We need to rescue the role of the UnitedNations and to ensure that all States  large and small respect the Charter. But we do not need a reform that isgoing to founder unceremoniously as part of abureaucratic process of adapting what is left of theUnited Nations to the interests and whims of a few  richand mighty countries.Finally  we need to return to a discussion of theserious economic and social problems currentlyaffecting the world. We have to make the battle for theright of nearly five billion people to development apriority. The Millennium Assembly committed us toworking for very modest and insufficient goals. Buteverything has now been forgotten  without even adiscussion. Seventeen million children under the age of5 will die this year  not as victims of terrorism but asvictims of under-nourishment and preventable diseases.Will a realistic debate based on solidarity be held inthis Hall to discuss how  in line with the MillenniumDeclaration  to halve by 2015 the number of people currently over 1.2 billion in number  who are sufferingfrom abject poverty  as well as the number who sufferfrom hunger  which is more than 800 million? Willthere be any discussion about the nearly 900 millionilliterate adults? Or will the Millennium Declarationalso become a dead letter  as has been the case with theKyoto Protocol and the decisions of 10 summits held atthe level of head of State?Developed countries will provide Third Worldcountries with $53 billion in official developmentassistance this year. In return  those countries willcharge recipients over $350 billion in foreign debtinterest; and our foreign debt will have grown by theend of the year. Do creditors by any chance believe thatthat unjust situation will last forever? Should we  asdebtors  resign ourselves to being poor forever? Is thatpicture of injustice and peril confronted by mostcountries what the founders of the United Nationsreally dreamed of? No. Like us  the founders alsodreamed that a better world was possible.Those are the questions that  with all due respect we would like some in the Hall to answer for us. I amnot talking about Cuba  which  condemned to die forwanting to be free  has had to fight on its own  not onlythinking about itself but also about all the peoples ofthe world."
"43",1778,"CYP",58,2003,"﻿I would like to extendto you  Sir  my warmest congratulations on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at itsfifty-eighth session. We are indeed very happy to see aMinister from a fellow Commonwealth  and also anisland State  presiding over the session. I am sure thatyour diplomatic skills  experience and grasp of theissues will harmoniously steer our work. I would alsolike to express our thanks and appreciation to yourpredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for the excellent record ofhis presidency.This year my country is about to fulfil its mostambitious aspiration — joining the European Union.After having signed the accession treaty in April  weexpect to become a full member  along with nine otheracceding countries  on 1 May 2004. But already we areassociated with the work of the Union and participatein all meetings and in the life of the new Europeanfamily of the 25 members. Hence  Cyprus is representedby the statement of the Italian Presidency of theEuropean Union and fully subscribes to its contents.Unfortunately  the current session is taking placein a heavy and loaded atmosphere. The deadly attackagainst the United Nations headquarters in Baghdadlast month  as well as the most recent one of two daysago  continue to fill us with bitterness and indignation.We all share the feeling of great injustice and insult tothe international community. Once again  I wish toexpress our deep condolences to the victims’ familiesand our sympathy to those injured. At the same time we should also convey the message that such actionswill not deter us from the pursuit of the high ideals ofthe United Nations and its engagement in Iraq.From Baghdad to Jakarta  from Russia to India and back to the heinous attacks of 11 September twoyears ago  terrorist acts around the globe serve as apainful reminder that terrorism transcends borders andattacks universal values. Freedom  democracy  humanrights and humanity itself have to be defended by theinternational community with persistence anddetermination. At the same time  we should be cautiousand ensure that our actions are fully in line with thecherished values we want to uphold. As the threat isunfortunately far from over  a genuine globalmobilization  under the aegis of the United Nations  isof the essence if this endeavour is to be successful.2 Cyprus is playing its part fully in this concerted effortand is among the countries that have ratified all 12 ofthe international conventions pertaining to terrorism.Furthermore  it has recently ratified the United NationsConvention on the Safety of United Nations andAssociated Personnel of 1994.The non-proliferation of weapons of massdestruction has become  and rightly so  a top priority inthe world’s agenda. The risk of acquisition of suchweapons by terrorist groups highlights even more thegravity and the urgency of the issues to be addressed.In that respect  the United Nations has a trulyinstrumental role to play. The universalization of  andcompliance with  multilateral treaties related todisarmament and non-proliferation  as well as verificationmechanisms and internationally-coordinated exportcontrols  are essential tools in our efforts. We haverepeatedly expressed our genuine commitment tointernational norms in the field of disarmament. I amhappy to report that Cyprus  earlier this year  ratifiedthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and theOttawa Convention.The Government of Cyprus attaches greatimportance to the international effort against mineproliferation and the clearing of minefields. For thisreason it has taken the initiative to clear all minefieldslaid in the buffer zone by the Cyprus National Guardimmediately after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Inthis regard  I would like to announce today myGovernment’s decision and firm commitment: first  tounilaterally start within the next two months  incooperation with the United Nations and with thefinancial support of the European Union  mineclearance in the buffer zone and  secondly  tounilaterally proceed with the destruction of anappreciable amount of stockpiled antipersonnel minesthis year during the month of November. This is just afirst step but  I believe  a major one in theimplementation of our obligations under theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines andon Their Destruction (Ottawa Convention).This year again  the situation in the Middle Eastremains a source of major concern for the region andbeyond. The Quartet’s road map  with theoverwhelming international support it enjoys represents an historic opportunity that should not bemissed. Unfortunately  in recent days  the internationalcommunity has held its breath as blind and spirallingviolence thwarts the efforts to place and maintain on asolid track this process which would lead to asettlement. The necessary political will should bedemonstrated by both sides  at all levels  and bematched with persistent action on the ground  in theright direction.I would like to take this opportunity to reiterateour longstanding position for a just settlement  inaccordance with international law  United Nationsresolutions and the agreements reached between theparties  which will put an end to the occupation andrealize the aspirations of the Palestinian people for theestablishment of an independent state  side by side withIsrael  in peace and security. Cyprus  a country of theregion with traditionally close relations with bothparties  stands ready to assist in every possible way.The realization of the Charter’s vision of a just peaceful and prosperous world remains inextricablylinked with the commitment to promote and protecthuman rights and fundamental freedoms in fullconformity with their universal  indivisible andinterdependent nature.The Republic of Cyprus  still witnessing seriousviolations of human rights within its territory byforeign armed forces  places human rights at the very topof its agenda. While working hard for the promotion andprotection of the human rights of all its citizens under theharsh circumstances imposed by the invasion andoccupation of a significant part of its territory  Cyprusnever loses sight of the universal dimension of humanrights and remains active and resolutely watches overthe protection of human rights throughout the world. Itreaffirms its full support of the Secretary General’sefforts to integrate human rights into the whole rangeof United Nations activities and reiterates itscommitment to working closely with United Nationspartners towards their universal implementation.We still strive in Cyprus for establishing the fateof all those Cypriots  both Greek and Turkish  missingsince the Turkish invasion of 1974. This is a majorissue of a purely humanitarian character and we seekthe support of the international community as a wholein order to put an end  at last  to the continuing ordealof so many families. For this to happen  thecooperation and political will of the Republic ofTurkey are absolutely necessary.Furthermore  the rights of the few remainingenclaved persons in the occupied part of Cyprus3 continue to be violated. The rights of the refugees arealso still being denied  while our people face new faitsaccomplis by the occupation army  as in the case of theadvance of the Turkish Army in the area of Strovilia.With the assistance of the international community weare  nevertheless  resolved to persevere in theimplementation of international conventions and forthe restoration of the human rights of all Cypriots.In view of the new challenges that the UnitedNations is required to face  Cyprus strongly supportsthe Secretary General’s United Nations objectives which aim at adapting the internal structures andculture of the Organization to new expectations. Ittherefore welcomes the work done on strengthening themanagement and administration — as well asstreamlining the budget — of the United Nations.My country also attaches great importance to theimprovement of the intergovernmental structure andprocesses of the United Nations and the revitalizationof the General Assembly as essential elements of thereform process  whose aim is to bring about a strongerUnited Nations system that will be able to effectivelypursue the priorities adopted in the United NationsMillennium Declaration.We certainly need effectiveness but we cannotseparate it from legitimacy. In Cyprus  we know  fromour own experience  both the importance of legitimacyand the need for effectiveness. We have been facing thecatastrophic results of aggression and we have beenstruggling for more than 29 years for the solution ofthe problem created by the invasion and occupation ofthe northern part of our country by Turkey.Despite all efforts  Turkish intransigence has notbeen curbed and their defiance of numerous resolutionsof the General Assembly and of the Security Councilcontinues unabated. Such an attitude constitutes notonly unacceptable behaviour in international relationsbut is also completely anachronistic andincomprehensible to any rational thought. Furthermoreit is at variance with the will and the wish of theoverwhelming majority of Turkish Cypriots themselveswho are persistently asking for a solution and forparticipation in the accession of Cyprus to the EuropeanUnion. We continue  as far as we are concerned  to doour best to bring them on board and we have embarkedon an ambitious policy in order to enhance theirstandard of living and allow them to fully enjoy therights and benefits that they are entitled to as Cypriots.In Cyprus  we have faced adversity for so manyyears and we have survived. Hence  we know that wehave to persevere. We still believe in the UnitedNations and we are grateful for its interest andinvolvement. I would like to take this opportunity toexpress our sincere thanks to the Secretary-General forhis tireless efforts within the framework of his missionof good offices in Cyprus  entrusted to him by theSecurity Council. I would like also to praise the workof the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General Mr. Álvaro de Soto  and all members of his team  of hisassistant of the United Nations Mission  as well as ofthe United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus andof the contributing countries. I believe that it isappropriate to mention this here at this stage because as you all know  the continuing and longstandingTurkish intransigence thwarted a few months ago whatwas probably the strongest initiative ever of the UnitedNations for finding a solution in Cyprus.We understand and share the bitterness and thedisappointment of all involved regarding this failurebut  as I said before  we should not give up. We havealways counted on United Nations support andinvolvement and we will continue to do so. We arealways ready  whenever the Secretary-General invitesus  to engage in serious negotiations on the basis of hisplan in order to reach a settlement as soon as possible in conformity with relevant United Nations resolutions.We hope that it will soon be possible for the other sideto realize that they have to return to the negotiatingtable  to cooperate constructively with the Secretary-General and to demonstrate the necessary political willto yield a settlement.A solution is urgently needed in Cyprus  afunctional and viable solution that will embrace allCypriots and will allow our country to take its strideand fully assume its place and role within the Europeanfamily. A united Cyprus in a united Europe will thriveand progress with its partners towards a secure andprosperous future  working hand in hand with all othermembers of the international community for thepromotion of universal values and peace."
"44",1802,"CZE",58,2003,"﻿Let mecongratulate you  Mr. President  on your election topreside over the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly  and to wish you every success in yourimportant position. It is a pleasure to see as President arepresentative of Saint Lucia  the smallest country everto hold the office. That fact upholds the Charterprinciple of the sovereign equality of nations in thisimportant world body  as well as the desirability ofuniversal membership in the United Nations  where allcountries  large and small  have something tocontribute.I also take this opportunity  Sir  to thank yourpredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for his work and effortsdevoted to the activities of the United Nationsthroughout the past year. It was a great honour for theCzech Republic to preside over the General Assemblyand to use that unique opportunity to further enhancethe United Nations capacity and ability to respond tocurrent global challenges.Let me also express my country's deepestsympathies to all who have lost loved ones in terroristattacks  including the attack on the United Nationsbuilding in Baghdad  which claimed the lives of theSecretary-General's Special Representative in Iraq Sergio Vieira de Mello  and a number of his co-workers. We view that horrible act as an attack againstthe principles of freedom  democracy and peace  theprinciples on which our Organization is built.The United Nations effort aimed at thestabilization  democratization and reconstruction ofIraq has the full support of my country  and Iappreciate the bold and selfless work done by the staffof the United Nations. The United Nations plays anirreplaceable role in that field. We therefore support theidea of adopting a new Security Council resolution thatwould provide a framework for the widest possibleparticipation of other countries. The Czech Republicwill actively participate in that process  and isdetermined to continue its engagement.The recent terrorist attacks in Iraq and otherregions of the Middle East strengthen our convictionthat the international community must not give in toterrorist threats. On the contrary  we must combine andintensify our efforts to combat them. The success ofcooperation between the United Nations  the CoalitionProvisional Authority and Iraqi representatives instabilizing the situation in Iraq and handing over thecountry's administration to the Iraqi people will be theessential step in that direction. The Czech Republictherefore welcomes the establishment of the GoverningCouncil  the appointment of provisional ministers andthe continued work on drafting a constitution  and isinterested in the speedy creation of a stableGovernment in Iraq that will honour its internationalcommitments and respect human rights and freedomsand the fundamental principles of democracy. But thatis not something than can happen overnight  as weknow from our own experience. The transition fromdictatorship to a functioning democracy takes sometime.We believe that progress in the Middle East peaceprocess based on the road map must be at the centre ofthe efforts of the whole international community. Weshould not allow extremist and terrorist groups todominate its agenda  as recent developments have12shown. At the same time  we call upon all partiesinvolved to exercise maximum restraint in takingactions that may contradict the achievement of apeaceful political settlement of the crisis  especiallyextrajudicial killings and suicide bombings.The Czech Republic supports activities aimed atreviving and continuing the implementation of thepeace plan. In their talks  the Quartet and the partiesconcerned must take stock of the peace plan andidentify obstacles on the road to peace  as well asoutstanding tasks before the Government of Israel andthe Palestinian Authority. Without properimplementation  the road map will suffer the same fateas those of the numerous peace initiatives we have seenin the past.The problems of the Middle East are verycomplex. My country would like to emphasize threebasic issues in this fragile phase that we considercrucial for the implementation and success of the roadmap for peace  namely  the security aspects of a peacesettlement  the consistent suppression of allmanifestations of terrorism and the consolidation andstrengthening of the position of the PalestinianGovernment and its process of reform  includingconcrete steps to confront terror and violence.In our view  tangible changes in the situation onthe ground should be an inseparable part of thoseefforts. At the same time  with their vision of their ownindependent State  Palestinians should feel that theireconomic and humanitarian situation is improving. TheCzech Republic is prepared to assume its share ofresponsibility in the efforts to improve the economicsituation of Palestinian autonomous territories at boththe bilateral and multilateral levels.The restoration of ethnic peace  the strengtheningof stability and economic growth remain the mainobjectives of the international community in the crisisregions of the Balkans. In the present circumstances the maintenance of an international presence in theregion is still a necessary prerequisite for thedevelopment of democracy and the strengthening ofpeace. The United Nations and other internationalorganizations must exercise their control function evenmore systematically  use their experience in assisting inthe transformation of society  ensure the activeparticipation of all ethnic groups in the area ofadministration  create conditions for the safe return ofrefugees  help with development of local economiesand curb organized crime.I am convinced that Mr. Harri Holkeri  the newSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General forKosovo  will further contribute to the achievement ofthe declared objectives. The transfer of competenciesfrom the United Nations Interim Administration inKosovo to local authorities must  at the same time include the transfer of responsibilities for theachievement of the objectives set by the internationaladministration and  above all  the creation ofconditions for the safe return of refugees. For the sakeof the functioning of a multi-ethnic society  it is alsonecessary to ensure the active participation of all ethnicgroups in the administration of the province.The Czech Republic supports all internationalefforts in the field of disarmament and arms control including verification of the non-proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and their means ofdelivery. That process is a long-term priority of Czechforeign policy. The Czech Republic devotesconsiderable attention to the relevant internationaltreaties and conventions in that regard and takes anactive part in addressing security problems. We areconvinced that it is necessary to promote andstrengthen universal adherence to the three majormultilateral agreements relating to weapons of massdestruction  namely  the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  the ChemicalWeapons Convention and the Biological and ToxinWeapons Convention. In that connection  we alsosupport the promotion of an early entry into force ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Particularemphasis should be placed on establishing effectiveverification mechanisms  namely  for the Biologicaland Toxin Weapons Convention.We consider the Additional Protocol to the NPT which creates an integral part of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency's safeguards system andstrengthens the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  to bea very important element of the verification system.That is why it is urgent for the States that have notentered into safeguards agreements with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency to do so and tofulfil their obligations under article III of the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty. We believe that theAdditional Protocol should be made the standard for allNPT signatory States.13The problems associated with the currentconflicts severely affecting civilian populations areclosely connected with the issue of conventionalweapons  especially as regards small arms and lightweapons. The Czech Republic supports theinternational community in its efforts to prevent theillicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons andtheir uncontrolled proliferation.The Czech Republic very much welcomes the factthat the international community is increasinglysensitized to the observance and protection of humanrights. There is a growing body of globally recognizedhuman rights and most cases of human rights violationsare strongly criticized by the democratic internationalcommunity. Nevertheless  it would be too daring toassume that criticism by the international communitycan always mitigate the consequences of a humanrights violation. However  the fact that most entities ininternational law lay stress on human rights isunquestionably a positive aspect. I would therefore liketo take this opportunity on behalf of the CzechRepublic to call for the release of all prisoners ofconscience in various parts of the world  as well as tocall for the observance of their fundamental humanrights.In the light of recent developments  I consider itnecessary to again mention the Nobel Peace Prizelaureate from Myanmar  Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi  andthe numerous Cubans who were sentenced to manyyears in prison in the political trials of March and April2003. Those and similar cases only deepen the isolationof the countries concerned and do not solve theexisting situations.The Czech Republic remains fully committed tothe United Nations and is aware of the fact that theUnited Nations is a universal international organizationthat plays an irreplaceable role in the presentglobalized world. We support the MillenniumDeclaration as the basis for the reform of the entireUnited Nations system and as a further step towards thestrengthening of the Organization's authority operational capability and effective functioning. Wesupport in particular the initiatives of the Secretary-General aimed at improving the management andadministration of the United Nations. Anotherimportant task is to proceed with the revitalization ofthe General Assembly  including such areas as theclustering of agenda items.The reform of the Security Council represents acrucial element in the development of internationalrelations in the new millennium. The Czech Republicshares the majority view that the composition of theCouncil is outdated  that it reflects the realities of theSecond World War rather than those of today and that itshould be adjusted to the current state of affairs. Thepresent situation is unsustainable and undermines thelegitimacy of the United Nations  and therefore callsfor urgent action. The Czech Republic will continue tosupport inevitable reform steps  including theenlargement of the Council in both categories ofmembership. In particular  we support the aspirationsof Germany and Japan for permanent seats  as well asthe allocation of another three new permanent seats forAfrica  Asia and Latin America.I would also like to take this opportunity toinform the General Assembly of the decision of theGovernment of the Czech Republic Government topresent its candidature for a non-permanent seat on theSecurity Council for the period 2008-2009 as ourcontribution to safeguarding international peace andsecurity.I welcome the President's intention to focus theAssembly's attention on the implementation of theoutcomes of the United Nations summits andconferences held during the past decade and on theUnited Nations development agenda  including theMillennium Declaration Goals. The Czech Republicemphasizes the importance of the implementation ofthe Millennium Development Goals as an overarchingplatform for specific actions to achieve specific goalsand targets. Actions at the national  regional andinternational levels are necessary to fight poverty improve access to health services and water  combatthe spread of HIV/AIDS  provide education  bridge thedigital divide and preserve the environment  to nameonly a few of our many concerns. At the same time efforts to achieve development goals complementefforts to achieve sustainable development  includingits economic  social and environmental aspects. TheCzech Republic believes that a focus on multilateraland international cooperation is indispensable to thesuccess of the United Nations development agenda. Weare therefore prepared to continue to contribute to thatimportant process.As regards the strategic document entitled theNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) in which  for the first time in their history  African14States assumed responsibility for their furtherdevelopment  the Czech Republic is well aware thatsupport for that document must be translated intoaction as soon as possible. An active and constructiveapproach should be reflected in all horizontal activitiesof the international community. That is why the CzechRepublic regards the principle of good governance asone of NEPAD's key principles that can substantiallycontribute to the establishment of suitable conditionsfor the integration of African States into ongoingglobalization processes and to the creation of afavourable climate for the continent's furtherdevelopment.As an acceding country to the European Union the Czech Republic is prepared to assume its part in theimplementation of the African policy that is part of theEuropean Union's Common Foreign and SecurityPolicy.In conclusion  let me stress that the challengeposed by security has likely been the most bitter andforceful to arise in the global community in the pasttwo years. In that regard  we face a real test of our willand ability to cooperate  and in that connection theUnited Nations remains an irreplaceable forum forconflict prevention and a legal platform for the takingof multilateral steps to preserve the world's securityand peace. In that respect  we very much support theSecretary-General's call for the strengthening ofmultilateralism  as international security cannot befully achieved by single States or coalitions dealingwith threats for the rest of the world.Humankind has not been challenged in suchterms in all of its history. I am not referring solely toterrorism or nuclear threats  but also to variousepidemics  poverty and the worsening environment which are themselves the root causes of conflicts.Furthermore   and we are now witnessing this inIraq   reactive military actions  both targeted and ofshort duration  are part of the solution  but they do notprovide the whole remedy. There is an irreplaceablerole for the world community to play. We  the MemberStates of the United Nations community  shouldtogether therefore focus our utmost attention onefficient measures to make our planet secure andprosperous for present and future generations."
"45",1864,"DEU",58,2003,"﻿I wish tobegin by congratulating the President  on his electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession and wish him every success with his work. Ialso wish to thank his predecessor  President Kavan for the dedication with which he presided over thefifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.I also wish to endorse the statements made by theItalian presidency on behalf of the European Union.This year is a special one for Germany’s workwithin the United Nations. History is both a reminderand a guide for us. Thirty years ago  on 18 September1973  the United Nations welcomed Germany back intothe fold of the family of nations. My predecessor Federal Chancellor Willy Brandt  paved the way forthat move. His standing as an anti-fascist inspiredconfidence for Germany. His passionate commitment tointernationalism went far beyond the policy of détentein the then East-West conflict.In 1980 he made an urgent appeal to thecommunity of States with a report entitled “North-South  A Programme for Survival”. He wrote:“The globalization of the dangers resulting fromwars  chaos and self-destruction calls for adomestic policy that goes far beyond nationalborders.”We are strongly committed to this task  and Ithink that we Germans are not the only ones who arecommitted to it  because  as I said  history is our guide.It guides us towards intensive internationalcooperation  of course under the auspices of the UnitedNations  that we must strengthen through courageousreforms. It guides us towards a universal order basedon the rule of law and human dignity  on good responsible governance and prosperity that is trulyshared by all people. It also guides us towards securityand peace through comprehensive prevention. We mustact resolutely by pursuing an effective multilateralstrategy wherever peace is threatened and human rightsare violated. But we must act just as resolutely toprevent conflict and create stable structures so thatpeople can lead their lives in freedom and tolerancewith one another.Thirty years ago  Germany was a country withlimited sovereignty  divided by the Iron Curtain. Today Germany is a sovereign nation  a civil Power in theheart of a united Europe. We live in a common area offreedom  the rule of law  prosperity and socialresponsibility. This goes to show that developmenttowards justice and peace is indeed possible and weshall not cease to support endeavours to that endanywhere in the world  be it in the Middle East  inAfrica or in any other crisis area. Bearing in mind ourown history  we are indeed assuming responsibility fora cooperative policy of peace. This we do byemploying economic  political and humanitarianmeans.But we are also assuming military responsibility shoulder to shoulder with our partners in NATO andthe European Union  where there is absolutely no otherway to secure peace and protect human beings. Today more than 9 000 members of the German armed forcesand police are deployed on international peacemissions. Our top priority is our commitment to peacein Afghanistan. Germany is willing to maintain itscommitment there in the long term and we are ready toincrease it beyond its present scope. The basis for suchcommitment is the Charter of the United Nations.In the Unification Treaty  Germany vowed that itwould only deploy its armed forces within theframework of this Charter. The Charter provides uswith “the necessary building blocks to ensure that ourcommon humanity is an inclusive one  built on valuessuch as tolerance and dignity”. These were the wordsof Sergio Vieira de Mello  who on 19 August 2003 fellvictim to an underhanded criminal attack in Baghdad.He was killed along with 22 others  including manymembers of the United Nations staff working for thepeople of Iraq and their hopes of a better future.We are deeply affected by their deaths and musthonour them by taking on their legacy. Our responsemust be to strengthen the role and commitment of theUnited Nations in Iraq. Only the United Nations canguarantee the legitimacy required to enable the peopleof Iraq to speedily rebuild their country under anindependent  representative Government. Germanystands ready to support such a process. We are ready to24provide humanitarian  technical and economicassistance and could also train Iraqi security personnel.International terrorism  failing States and thedangers posed by the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction all threaten our joint security. The obviousquestion is: What must be done to truly enhancesecurity? We must capture the terrorists and theirmasters and destroy their infrastructure. There can beno doubt that we must prevent any further proliferationof nuclear weapons. We must strengthen theinspections regimes and pursue a policy of controlleddisarmament.But as we know from history  as well as our ownexperience  to follow any strategy focused narrowly onthe military and the police would be a recipe forfailure. Rather  what is needed is to address the rootcauses of terrorism and insecurity. To combatfanaticism  we must ensure social and material as wellas cultural security. That can only be achieved on thebasis of a broad concept of security. If we want tooutlaw infamy we must put an end to lawlessness. Thatis the core task  indeed  of the international courts ofjustice and especially the International Criminal Court.In order to win hearts and minds for freedom peace and an open society  we must help people toacquire a greater stake in society  build better lives forthem and provide them with a secure environment.Afghanistan is a good example of this. There  theinternational community succeeded in liberating theAfghan people from the scourge of the Taliban andal Qaeda.At the same time  the Petersberg Conference onAfghanistan  held in Bonn under the auspices of theUnited Nations  created a political framework forrebuilding the country. This process needs ourcontinued support. There must also be sustainedinternational commitment to the task of strengtheningsecurity. In the long run  the fight against terrorism canbe won only if people see that it produces tangiblebenefits in their everyday lives. They need toexperience at first hand that being once again part ofthe international community means not only greaterfreedom and more security  but also entails betterdevelopment opportunities and a greater stake insociety.There is no doubt that we have already mademajor strides towards realizing our common goalsenshrined in the United Nations Charter. Morecountries than ever before now have democraticGovernments. Our concerted efforts have enabled morepeople than ever before to put poverty behind them.But we must note that the gap between the world’s richand poor has still not been closed and the fight againsthunger  injustice and oppression is still far from won.For this reason  eradicating poverty remains animperative of our policy for peace and stability.There has been a drastic reduction in the numberof wars fought between States. In the Balkans  forexample  resolute action by NATO and the UnitedNations enabled us to put an end to certain wars andprevent others from breaking out in the first place.Nevertheless  our world has become — and not justsince the barbaric terrorist attacks in New York andWashington or indeed Bali  Casablanca  Moscow orDjerba — a dramatically more insecure place. Newthreats that no country in the world can tackleeffectively on its own  make international cooperationmore vital than ever before. Such threats also requirenew strategies and that is why we are all called upon toreview whether the instruments available to the UnitedNations are still appropriate for tackling these newchallenges. We all have a responsibility to ensure thatpeople and their rights are also protected in situationsother than inter-State wars. They must be protectedfrom genocide and the consequences of randomviolence as well. A political commitment tocomprehensive prevention must further strengthen theUnited Nations monopoly on the use of force as well asthe institutions of international law.Within the United Nations we need to muster thestrength to launch overdue institutional reforms. MyGovernment fully and wholeheartedly supports theproposals made by the Secretary-General. We mustagree how to ensure in the future an even betterallocation of abilities  skills and scarce resources. Ialso share the view of the Secretary-General that thelegitimacy of the Security Council depends on howwell it represents all nations and all regions. It is truethat the Council must be reformed and enlarged. Firstand foremost  it must also include more representativesof the developing countries. Let me reiterate that in thecontext of such reform Germany is ready to assumegreater responsibility.The world of the twenty-first century offers us  itsinhabitants  ample scope for change  for better orworse. Given the wealth of opportunities and theimmense dangers ahead  we have no choice but to25strive for greater international partnership and expandand strengthen multilateralism. We will only be able tomake our world a more secure place if we can alsomake it more fair and equitable. It was for that verypurpose  after all  that the international communitycreated the United Nations. That is its mandate. Let usjoin together to make the United Nations even stronger.Let us make sure that it can fulfil its mandate tomaintain international peace and security and that itcan achieve greater justice for all."
"46",1923,"DMA",58,2003,"﻿Allow me tostart by congratulating you warmly  Mr. President  onyour election to the high post of President of thisrespected global forum and to wish you success duringyour tenure. Your election to the post of President ofthe General Assembly is indeed an honour and a sourceof pride for all Saint Lucians  as well as for yourbrothers and sisters in the Organization of EastCaribbean States (OECS)  the Caribbean Community(CARICOM) and Latin America.Your presidency is  as such  a CARICOM-LatinAmerican presidency  and your record of prudence anddiplomatic skills will certainly be instrumental inmeeting the lofty goals sought commonly by all of ournations and peoples.I take this opportunity to congratulate yourpredecessor  His Excellency Jan Kavan  for theleadership he provided to the fifty-seventh session ofthe General Assembly  a session that brought outclearly the many challenges confronting the UnitedNations in this decade.The delegation of the Commonwealth ofDominica assures you of its full cooperation andsupport. Profound appreciation is also due to ourSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tirelessefforts to make the United Nations more responsiveand effective.13 Over the last nine months  the relevance of theUnited Nations has become a burning issue worldwide.We must all appreciate that it remains the onlyuniversal multilateral institution with the capacity toaddress the complex set of global problems of thetwenty-first century  ranging from peace and security todevelopment.Today's world is entangled in a web of complexproblems that threaten global security. These problems which require the urgent attention of the UnitedNations  include HIV/AIDS and other diseases poverty  the marginalization of indigenous people terrorism and global crime  the growing scarcity offreshwater  global warming  the spread of light arms which threaten peaceful countries like Dominica nuclear proliferation  armed civil conflicts and therefugees they give rise to  trafficking in humans andunfair trade rules that contribute to growing poverty inthe developing countries.All of these problems require a strong andeffective multilateral organization  which enjoys thetrust and confidence of the people on this planet and iscapable of articulating collective approaches towardssome solutions.The world has changed considerably  yet presentinstitutions for global governance   the United Nations the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and theWorld Trade Organization   continue to operate onoutdated political and economic foundations. Thelegitimacy  effectiveness and credibility of the UnitedNations continue to erode in the face of thedemocratic deficit'  which was an integral part of theoriginal design but which needs to be remedied now.The reform of the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly is indispensable to the restoration ofthe moral authority lost because of failure to enforceresolutions. Effective governance  predicated on theprinciples of accountability and transparency to thepeople of the Member States  is a highly desirableobjective that we must strive for.I wish to reaffirm our country's total commitmentto  and support for  the United Nations.Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute toSergio Vieira de Mello  Special Representative of theSecretary-General  other staff members of the UnitedNations and the citizens of Iraq who lost their lives orsustained injuries in the tragedy of Baghdad lastAugust. We share the sorrow of the Secretary-Generaland his staff  and extend our heartfelt condolences tothe bereaved families.The return of peace and stability to Iraq has nowbecome the responsibility of all States members of theinternational community. If the international communitymust accept and shoulder this important responsibility then we must commit to a greater role for the UnitedNations. We strongly hold the view that stability in Iraqis inextricably linked to the transfer of sovereignty tothe Iraqis  who must have sole responsibility for theirfuture. The coalition forces must give a clear mandateto the United Nations for the creation of amultinational force  led of course by the main troopcontributors  in order to ensure the security of Iraq.While the attention of the internationalcommunity is focused on restoring peace and securityin Iraq  we cannot turn a blind eye to the breakdown inthe Middle East peace process. My delegation supportsthe road map for peace in the Middle East and calls forthe removal of the obstacles that have stalled theprocess. We embrace the two-State solution as the onlymechanism for a lasting peace in the Middle East. TheState of Israel and the Palestinian Authority must bothcommit to a ceasefire and return to the agreedobligations under the road map framework.The fight against international terrorism remainsa priority for Dominica given the horror of 11September. In that regard  we have taken many steps tocomply with the obligations of Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001). This year our Parliamentenacted the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism Act which complements two earlier pieces of legislationrelated to the prevention of terrorism  the MoneyLaundering Act and the Exchange of Information Act.The passage of these pieces of legislation has contributedto significant strengthening of the regulatory regime forbanks operating in our offshore financial sector and toefforts to combat money-laundering.We welcome the assistance of the Commonwealthin a review of our legal system to allow its alignmentwith the global strategy to fight terrorism  as well asthe guidance of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.The numerous terrorist actions this year inIndonesia  Kenya  Saudi Arabia  Morocco and Iraqunderscore the central importance of being vigilant andprepared to manage any crisis from a terrorist attack.We appeal to Member States to continue collaborative14 efforts in this global fight to combat terrorism and toensure that the capacities of small States are enhancedthrough transfer of intelligence information  surveillancetechnology and training in prevention strategies.The United Nations International Year ofFreshwater has helped the world community to focusattention on the millions of poor people who lackaccess to clean sources of water. Dominica is one ofthe islands in the Caribbean blessed with abundantfreshwater resources  largely thanks to our highrainfall. Our experience with conserving our mountainsand forests  which contribute to the maintenance of thewater table  is one of the many experiences that ourpeople are prepared to share with the world community.Mankind faces a great challenge as growingscarcity of freshwater becomes a reality of this century.This is clearly an arena for constructive global actionby the United Nations. Let us hope that concern for andattention to freshwater remain a core part of ourcontinuing commitment to the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.My delegation is indeed pleased at thetremendous progress made by the InternationalCriminal Court over the last year. We have moved onestep closer to punishing war crimes  genocide  andcrimes against humanity.This year is an important year for theCommonwealth of Dominica because we arecelebrating the silver jubilee of our politicalindependence  as well our twenty-fifth anniversary ofour membership in the United Nations. Twenty-fiveyears of nation-building has given us some experiencein the global arena and allowed us to build a foundationfor the next 25 years of national development.As a peace-loving people  we highly value theright to self-determination and the full  fair andunhindered expression of the will of the people. Wereaffirm our commitment to the rule of law  goodgovernance at all levels and deepening of ourlongstanding democratic tradition.Dominica and its sister islands of Saint Lucia Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  Grenada andJamaica are island nations adversely affected by theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) banana regime which will bring to an end preferences and quotas forbananas exported to the European Union. Theimpending abolition of the banana quota at the end of2005 has contributed immensely to an economic crisisin these Caribbean Community States. Thousands ofsmall farmers in these island nations have lost hopeand left banana production altogether. This has led to a60 per cent decline in banana export earnings and has anegative impact on our national savings.In Dominica  this situation has necessitated theimplementation of an austerity program  in tandemwith a standby agreement with the InternationalMonetary Fund. We are  however  working assiduouslyto create the conditions for economic revitalization andtransformation.As we struggle to eradicate the mono-crop natureof our economy  a remaining vestige of the colonialperiod  we are determined to anchor our futureeconomic foundation in the following areas:sustainable agriculture  renewable energy  ecotourism information technology  financial services and waterresource management. Our resolve to build a neweconomic order is based on our assertion of theprinciple of responsibility for our own development.Our efforts at economic re-engineering urgentlyrequire a complement of new foreign direct investment official development assistance (ODA) transfers technology transfer and deepening of cooperation withMember States and global civil society. We remainhopeful that our donor partners will soon translate theODA commitments that they made at Monterrey lastyear into action  since these commitments have becomecritical for economic reconstruction throughout thedeveloping world.Our call for special and differential treatment inthe trade arena continues to resonate loudly. Theoutcome of the WTO meeting in Cancun was notencouraging. We join other developing nations in thecall for an end or drastic reduction of agriculturalsubsidies in the developed world.Let me take this opportunity to commend theUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)for organizing the high-level plenary meeting withrespect to the implementation of the Declaration ofCommitment on HIV/AIDS  which took place onMonday  22 September. This meeting will only besuccessful if it renews the resolve of Member States toaccord a higher priority to national integrated efforts tofight the disease  which is exacting a toll on the youthand adult populations of African and Caribbeannations.15 The Commonwealth of Dominica has developed afive-year plan of action to guide our efforts to managethe HIV/AIDS pandemic  and we are increasing ourefforts to ensure a coordinated and participatorynational response that involves schoolchildren workers  the private sector and the voluntary sector.I also wish to acknowledge the great initiative ofPresident George W. Bush for the global fight againstHIV/AIDS. It is a bold and assertive commitment thatwill contribute much-needed financial resources for theglobal campaign  particularly in Africa and theCaribbean. I also want to pay tribute to the tremendousefforts of UNAIDS  the United Nations DevelopmentFund for Women  the United Nations Children's Fundand the World Health Organization/Pan-AmericanHealth Organization in HIV/AIDS prevention. Theprogrammes of these United Nations organizationsdeserve additional resources from Member States international financial institutions  private foundationsand transnational corporations if we are to expecthigher levels of effectiveness and greater positiveoutcomes in HIV/AIDS prevention.In 2004  the Decade of the World's IndigenousPeople will come to an end. The Decade was importantin that it highlighted  for the first time since Columbuscame to the Americas  the marginalization of theworld's indigenous people. Although the Decade hasfallen far short of expectations  it did have one positiveoutcome  namely  greater awareness on the part of theinternational community about the continuing plight ofthe indigenous peoples of the world. Dominica'sindigenous people  the Caribs  made some importantgains during the decade. These include the building oflinks with other indigenous groups across continents the consolidation of a Caribbean grouping ofindigenous organizations  and the Government'sestablishment of a Department of Carib Affairs.Indigenous peoples around the world continue toface marginalization and to wallow in abject poverty.The world community must demonstrate greaterresponsiveness to improving their condition throughmore generous contributions to the Voluntary Fund.We welcome the first report of the Secretary-General on the New Partnership for AfricanDevelopment (NEPAD) and we are greatly encouragedby the number of African actions to institutionalizeNEPAD along with the incremental steps towardsalignment of United Nations activities with thepriorities of NEPAD. We commend the African Unionand the African nations for all the efforts towardsstrengthening the organization's momentum.Dominica reiterates its continuing support for theefforts of our brothers and sisters in Africa to take fullresponsibility for their own development.Next August  the international meeting for the 10-year review of the Barbados Programme of Actionregarding the sustainable development of Small IslandDeveloping States will be held in Mauritius. Thismeeting will address the future of the world's smallisland developing States and will be a momentousoccasion for Dominica and all the members of theAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) to finally getthe much-needed international support to address therange of vulnerabilities we confront.Dominica is honoured to host next week ameeting of sustainable development experts  who willassess the performance of the indicators of theBarbados Programme of Action. The MauritiusConference is especially important given themarginalization of small island developing States byunfavourable World Trade Organization (WTO) traderules and the trade liberalization process.The international community must pay greaterattention to the social and economic vulnerabilitiesfaced by small island developing States. The suddenadjustment to trade liberalization and the WTO traderegime has contributed to the economic decline inmany small island States. Averting the rapid descentinto a downward economic spiral and social dislocationin SIDS requires a wider embrace and understanding ofour call for special and differential treatment in thetrade arena.The Dominican delegation believes that we havean obligation to be responsible to future generations byensuring that they will have an earth that is safe  secureand can sustain life. Let us not forget the commitmentswe made last year at the World Summit for SustainableDevelopment  especially regarding small islanddeveloping States. We reiterate our concern once againabout all manifestations of climate change  and ouropposition to continuing trans-shipment of nuclearwaste through the Caribbean Sea.We therefore call on all Member States to supportand participate in the Mauritius Conference for the 10-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action next16 August. We also appeal to corporations  privatefoundations  bilateral and multilateral organizations tolend support for significant participation of civilsociety organizations  particularly from the AOSISmember States  at this conference.The delegation of the Commonwealth ofDominica wishes once again to address theparticipation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in thework of the United Nations.Taiwan has demonstrated its willingness toprovide much needed assistance to countries around theworld  including relief to war-torn and devastatedcountries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Article 4 of theUnited Nations Charter invites all other peace-lovingStates to join the Organization and compels us to considerthe participation of Taiwan's 23 million people.The problem of Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome (SARS) ably demonstrated that progresstowards the noble goals of the United Nations is onlyimpeded by not integrating the Republic of China onTaiwan into international efforts to confront globalchallenges. The situation regarding the Republic ofChina must be addressed to ensure a more meaningfulcontribution to global peace  security and povertyeradication.In conclusion  Dominica repeats its call for a newglobal framework to redress the imbalances broughtabout by the galloping forces of globalization. We urgethe international community to rally behind the bannerof multilateralism and to support the bold initiative ofGeneral Assembly President Julian Hunte to makedevelopment and its attendant components  povertyeradication and the Millennium Development Goals the central focus of the fifty-eighth session of theGeneral Assembly.We call also for the leadership role of the UnitedNations in the quest for peaceful resolution to theconflicts in Iraq  Liberia and the Democratic Republicof the Congo  and for the unwavering support of theinternational community to the special needs of thesmall island developing States."
"47",1967,"DNK",58,2003,"﻿I should like at theoutset to express  on behalf of Denmark  the mostsincere condolences to the United Nations and to thefamilies of Sergio Vieira de Mello and of all those whoso tragically lost their lives in Baghdad five weeks ago.I also wish to pay tribute to Swedish Foreign MinisterAnna Lindh. She was taken from us by an evil act thatis beyond comprehension  while carrying out herimportant work. We will all miss Anna; she should behere today.We need the United Nations today more thanever. We need the United Nations to provide a moresecure world  to fight international terrorism  to resolveconflicts and to halt the spread of weapons of massdestruction. We need the United Nations in ensuringfundamental human rights for all people. We need theUnited Nations to establish  implement and develop aninternational legal order based on the rule of law. Andwe need the United Nations in combating poverty andsecuring sustainable economic growth.Iraq has been a key challenge for the SecurityCouncil. A united Council provided the United Nationswith a mandate to assist the people of Iraq in a widerange of areas  including facilitating and supporting thepolitical process. Iraq  the United Nations and theinternational community as a whole suffered a tragicloss in the recent attacks. But it should not make uswaver in our determination to continue working for abetter future for Iraq. Those evil attacks must notinspire other terrorists to threaten the United Nationspresence in Iraq. Sovereignty should be transferred tothe Iraqis as quickly as possible  but the internationalmilitary presence must be maintained until security isfully restored. The United Nations role and presence inthis process must be strengthened.Immense challenges lie ahead of us. Our goal isto ensure that the twenty-first century becomes thecentury in which each and every one of us can live inpeace  stability and growing prosperity   a century inwhich freedom  respect for the individual  human rightsand democracy become daily realities  not just abstractideas  for billions of people.Considered over time  the United Nations has astrong scorecard. We have managed to transform theparalysed cold war Organization into a key forum forinternational discussions and decisions in all fields. Letme highlight three areas where the United Nationscould be even stronger.First  the United Nations is at the forefront of thefight against poverty. By agreeing to achieve theMillennium Development Goals by 2015  we have setourselves measurable targets by which we must allstand and be counted. In Monterrey and Johannesburgthe developing countries acknowledged responsibilityfor their own development  based on good governance democracy and the rule of law. The African effortsmust be especially highlighted and supported. Everyindividual on the African continent must feel theurgency of our collective efforts to improve his or herliving conditions. Only then can the tide be turned on acontinent that has been lagging behind for too long.Denmark's commitment to development speaksfor itself  be it in terms of development assistance or inrelation to trade liberalization. Especially for thebenefit of the developing countries  we need such tradeliberalization. Therefore  the lack of results in Cancunwas a great disappointment. We needed results  bothfor the developing world and for the global economy.We did not achieve those results in Cancun  butDenmark will certainly work hard to achieve them inthe future   not least for the developing world.Denmark supports a high-level event in 2005focusing on the commitments made in the MillenniumDeclaration in order to give new energy to theimplementation of all the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. Denmark stands ready to provide a full accountof its efforts to achieve the Goals  including in thefields of trade and development assistance.Secondly  the United Nations is essential for theestablishment  the implementation and the developmentof an international legal order based on the rule of law.The United Nations was created with a strong purposeand a great vision. The concepts and values of theCharter   of international peace and stability based onequality among nations and respect for theirsovereignty   are universal.The strength of our values and of our principlesmust be measured by our ability to apply them to therealities around us. We must be ready to adapt ourcollective actions to the needs of the world. Attestingto that is the immense work done in the fields of humanrights; the rights of women and children  including theright to reproductive health care and services; the34struggle against terrorism; and the efforts to controlnuclear  biological and chemical weapons.Furthermore  the establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court is the single most important step in themodern history of international criminal law. It sends astrong signal that the international community will nolonger allow the most serious international crimes toremain unpunished.Denmark firmly believes that a democraticsociety based on the rule of law is the best guaranteefor stable development  in terms of both upholdingfundamental freedoms and furthering social justice.Human rights are universal and must be applied by allStates. It is imperative that all States be committed tocooperating constructively with the United Nationshuman rights mechanisms and that they overcometraditional attitudes concerning State sovereignty.Thirdly  the United Nations is at the core ofefforts to tackle old and new security challenges. TheSecurity Council has successfully taken oninternational terrorism  and it should continue to focuson how to deal with weapons of mass destruction.Another pressing issue is how to prevent thebreakdown of societies and to address the root causesof conflicts; and  if prevention is unsuccessful  how todeal with the breakdown of social order. A strategicvision on how to deal with the new challenges isurgently needed.The Security Council still reflects the powerstructures that existed at the end of the Second WorldWar. Consequently  a comprehensive reform is neededto make the Council more representative and  at thesame time  to safeguard the efficiency of the decision-making process. It is of equal importance that theSecurity Council ensure compliance with itsresolutions.The process towards more targeted and smart'sanctions should be continued. We must ensure thatsanction regimes clearly monitor whether the objectstargeted are in compliance with the aims pursued bythe sanctions. Assistance to Member States inimplementing sanctions should also be considered.Accompanying resolutions with incentives or carrot-and-stick measures could be another option.We would also welcome a strengthening of thedivision of labour and cooperation with regional andsubregional organizations. Over the past 50 years  wehave been building strong regional institutions toovercome our divisions and to manage our problems.With the initiative of the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment and the rapid intervention of theEconomic Community of West African States inLiberia  recent developments in Africa are veryencouraging in that regard as well. To further promotethose developments  we must all continue and expandour political and financial support for the strong andprogressive African leadership.Over the years  Denmark has been active in worldaffairs and has been a strong supporter of the UnitedNations. We shall continue to focus on areas where wecan contribute to make the world a better place inwhich to live for all. Denmark is therefore seeking tobecome a member of the Security Council in 2005 and2006. If we become a member of the Council  we shallwork to further develop the Council's efficiency and itsimpact. We shall work for increased synergy among themilitary  political  humanitarian and developmentalaspects of conflict management. We hope we can makea special contribution to solving the various conflictsthat are still not settled around the world  and we shalldo our utmost to prevent new conflicts from arising.Our aim will be to continue to build bridges betweenthe multiple interests of the Members of the UnitedNations.Underpinning our vision of a strong UnitedNations for the twenty-first century is the need tostrengthen and reform the Organization at all levels andin all its aspects. We express strong support for theSecretary-General and for his persistent efforts in thatregard  and we hope that the Secretary-General's high-level panel will provide new inspiration and fresh ideasfor us all. But we  the Member States  must take thelead; the ball is in our court. We must enable theUnited Nations to take credible  efficient action to meetthe challenges of this century and of this millennium;that is our collective responsibility and duty.As a member of the European Union  Denmark isworking actively towards these goals  and I can assurethe Assembly that all the Nordic countries stronglysupport the Secretary-General's proposals and areready to face these challenges. Let us together ensurethat the United Nations is ready  too."
"48",2012,"DOM",58,2003,"﻿The international community iscurrently going through a period of reflection and self-definition. The great transformations that humanityexperienced during the course of the previous decade as well as current challenges  demand greaterresponsibility on the part of our nations in playing anactive role in the search for urgent solutions to theproblems that are affecting us. This new session of theGeneral Assembly presents us with an excellentopportunity to achieve that goal.Today  the Dominican Republic reaffirms itscommitment to peace  the defence of human rights security  sustainable development and thestrengthening of democracy — pillars of indisputableimportance in safeguarding international peace andstability.The issue of the reform of the United Nations hasbeen on our agenda for a long time. Events of recentyears make it clear that this task must be undertaken asa matter of priority. The reform the Security Council isparticularly urgent. Ever since the approval ofresolution 47/62 of 11 December 1992  we have beenengaged in an ongoing debate on the various reformproposals. Now  however  it is time to act to restructurethe Council so as to make it more representative andequitable  as well as more transparent in its decision-making  thereby strengthening its legitimacy as theguarantor of international peace and security.Terrorism has emerged as an ongoing threat tohumanity. Uncertainty and pain have characterized thebeginning of the twenty-first century. Our nations havethe challenge of fighting together  at a global level against the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and in favour of equitable development andfree societies. Security problems call for decisiveaction against international terrorism  organized crimeand the illegal trade in arms and drugs.The Millennium Summit established as one of itsmain goals the reduction of poverty by 50 per cent by2015. Notwithstanding some progress in theachievement of those goals  poverty remains a terriblescourge. The Dominican Government  which considersthat issue to be one of great importance  has created aSocial Cabinet to act as a coordinating mechanism forall governmental institutions for social welfare  and ishelping to ensure that both national and internationalresources are distributed equitably and allocated toregions that require social investment.All countries must join efforts  acceptingresponsibilities  both shared and separate  to guaranteethat growth and poverty do not go together and that  inmeeting the needs of the present generation  we do notcause the destruction of future generations’ capacity tomeet their own needs.The positive outcome of the Fourth MinisterialConference of the World Trade Organization  held inDoha  Qatar  in November 2001  and of theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment held in Monterrey  Mexico  in March2002  was a key element for achieving millenniumdevelopment goals. The Doha Development Agendaand the Monterrey Consensus provided a framework tofacilitate market access  improve multilateralregulations for channelling globalization and increasefinancial aid for development.However  we must mention what happened at theFifth Ministerial Conference of the World TradeOrganization (WTO) recently held in Cancún  Mexico.Although agreement was not reached because offundamental differences in the positions regardingessential world trade issues  we are convinced that thiswill not affect the multilateral system of negotiations.On the contrary  some member states maintain that thisimpasse may even be necessary to shape moreequitable international agreements at the heart of theWTO. What is an important issue is not to lose thedevelopment perspective within the work programmeof the WTO  as set in the Doha Development Agenda because that agenda includes the aspirations of millionsof people around the world  whose hope for progresslies in the opportunities of the global economy.The position of the Dominican Government withregard to the Middle East conflict is based primarily onunconditional adherence to the norms and principles ofinternational law  particularly those related to thepeaceful solution of disputes; condemning the use offorce and terrorism in all its forms; complying in goodfaith with international treaties; and on strictobservance of resolutions of the United Nations and itsdeliberative bodies.Devoted to these principles  the DominicanRepublic has  in response to the humanitarian appeals17of the Security Council  participated in the efforts torebuild Iraq  in order to contribute to the developmentof a secure and stable environment in which thesovereignty of the Iraqi people may be restored.Similarly  our country supports the peace processoutlined in the road map submitted by the United Statesof America and endorsed by the Russian Federation the United Nations and the European Union. Weunderstand that a cessation of violence cannot bepostponed  along with the historic pledges of all partiesto make sacrifices to promote a lasting solution to theconflict and peaceful coexistence.Drawing up sustainable development policiescalls for dealing with problems before they emerge.This implies making headway in achieving themillennium development goals  particularly on crucialissues such as energy and protection of theenvironment. In this respect  our nation reiterates itsrejection of the international maritime transport ofradioactive and toxic waste  a position which has beenexpressed in other international forums. This issue islinked to international security.The importance of guaranteeing women equalrights and equity  and promoting their increasedpolitical participation  has been a continuous concernof the heads of State in various international forums.The International Research and Training Institute forthe Advancement of Women (INSTRAW)  the onlyinstitution within the United Nations system dedicatedexclusively to that end  has its headquarters in SantoDomingo  capital of the Dominican Republic. TheDominican Government calls upon Member States tocontinue supporting the work of INSTRAW in theDominican Republic by providing contributions  to theextent that they can.Our country commends the culture of peace  andis making efforts to ensure that at the primary levelchildren are taught about promoting mutualunderstanding and learn about civics and human rights.Similarly  we believe that a solid and permanentdemocracy is an achievable goal. The challenges hereare clear: growing democracy  more respect for civicrights  freedom of the press; freedom of expression ofpolitical parties and public opinion; dignity andtransparency of all leaders and the moral legitimacy ofall.Deeply concerned about the spread of HIV/AIDSin our nation  the Government has made great efforts tocomply with the commitments entered into in theDeclaration on fighting this terrible disease. We call forincreased international cooperation and efforts toguarantee the availability of drugs at affordable prices based on the Doha Declaration on intellectual propertyand the right to health.The Dominican Republic salutes with optimismthe role played by the United Nations and theOrganization of American States (OAS) in efforts todevelop humanitarian aid programmes for the Haitianpeople. It is imperative to stress here the need forgreater support from the international community forour neighbouring republic of Haiti and its neglectedpopulation.Although we are aware that this issue has beenexcluded from the agenda of the current session   wewish to state our support for the aspirations of theRepublic of China  Taiwan  to rejoin this Organization of which it was a Member for many years. Our positionis in line with the universal principles contained in theCharter  the basis of the rules of international law andthe historical tradition of friendly relations withTaiwan.On behalf of the Dominican Government  Sir may I congratulate you on your election as President confident that your conduct of this session will besuccessful  beneficial for the international communityand a source of pride to your country  Saint Lucia  andthus to our Caribbean community.I also wish to express the DominicanGovernment’s rejection of the barbaric act perpetratedagainst the United Nations Mission in Baghdad on 19August  and to reiterate to the families of Mr. SergioVieira de Mello and of the other deceased colleaguesour most heartfelt condolences.We are all aware of the great challengesconfronting humanity. Our future depends on theactions we take now. We have the opportunity to meetthe expectations of the nations of the world. Let us takeup this challenge with all due responsibility."
"49",2059,"DZA",58,2003,"﻿Mr. President  I would like to congratulate you mostwarmly on your election as President of the fifty-eighthsession of the General Assembly  whose proceedingswill undoubtedly benefit from your personal qualitiesand your skills and experience in internationalrelations. I am also certain that you are an excellentsuccessor to an excellent predecessor.I would like also to pay tribute to our Secretary-General  for his determined efforts and dedication tothe service of world peace and the fulfilment of thepurposes of the United Nations.The current session of the General Assemblytakes place in a complex international situationcharacterized by mounting threats that imperil thepurposes and role of our Organization.Indeed  recent developments have marked theopening of a new phase of instability  uncertainty andapprehensiveness  highlighting the dangers arisingfrom the side-stepping of our Organization in theconduct of world affairs. More than ever before  theOrganization’s irreplaceable role is brought to the fore as a universal forum responsible for maintaining aninternational order based on peace  security andcooperation for development.The international community finds itself squarelyfaced with the duty to restore its cohesion and mobilizeits means and energy towards full rehabilitation of theUnited Nations  through the upholding  by all  of theCharter’s purposes and principles  which constitute theindispensable foundations for a civilized internationalsociety.We have to revive the strong momentum gainedas a result of the Millennium Summit and furtherenhanced and carried forward through the role playedby the United Nations in organizing a collectiveresponse against terrorism in the wake of the wantonattacks of 11 September 2001. Those attacks were trulybarbaric.Peace  security  and development issues are at thecore of the mission of our Organization. Today  theyrequire a renewal of our commitment to internationalcooperation  especially since we live in an increasinglyinterdependent world  where problems are also closelyinterrelated.We strongly support the view that the UnitedNations remains the best place where Member Statesshould join in collective endeavours in their quest forthe common good. We should cooperate within theframework of our Organization and work together topromote development and compliance withinternational law  in order to lay the foundations for astable and secure world rooted in solidarity.13Therefore  strengthening our Organization andimproving its effectiveness stands as a collective task a top priority and a shared responsibility of all MemberStates that seek to prevent crisis situations  addressthreats to international peace and security  and ensurenecessary conditions for sustainable development.Among the challenges that should be confronted by theinternational community  I will dwell on terrorism first because preventing and combating terrorism stillrequires a high level of vigilance  mobilization andmultifaceted cooperation at the national  regional andinternational levels.At the risk of repeating ourselves  we willcontinue to warn against all misconceptions and thetendentious association of terrorism with a particularreligion  civilization or geographical area. Equally  weneed to agree upon an accurate definition of terrorism so as not to affect national liberation struggles and thelegitimate right of peoples to self-determination. Sucha clarification should be provided as part of the draftglobal convention against terrorism  currently on theinternational agenda. Launching a genuine dialogueamong cultures and civilizations will be helpful infostering rapprochement and understanding amongpeoples  by combating prejudiced viewpoints andnarrow-minded perceptions. Situations will still betense wherever peoples are deprived of their rights  anddenied freedom and dignity.This is the case in Palestine  where thePalestinian people are still denied the enjoyment oftheir right to exist  despite the universal recognition oftheir national rights today. The prevarication  delayingtactics and systematic repression used by Israel fordecades to defer the settlement of the Palestinianproblem  have now led to an explosive situation thatseriously threatens regional and global peace andsecurity.The international community should becomeinvolved in a more decisive manner to put an end tothis spiralling situation  and firmly urge Israel to fullycooperate for a global  just and lasting solution whichnecessarily includes the establishment of anindependent and fully sovereign Palestinian State  withAl-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital  and the withdrawalfrom the Lebanese and Syrian territories remainingunder occupation.In this same sensitive region  the Iraqi people’stragic predicament endures. We must emphasize theurgent need to help them establish their ownindependent institutions  to exercise unhindered controlover their economy and natural resources and tomaintain their unity and territorial integrity. In ouropinion  only the United Nations can legitimately andeffectively accompany the institution-building andreconstruction of the country  and its role in theseprocesses is of paramount importance.In our immediate region  in Western Sahara  thepeople of this territory  28 years after withdrawal of theformer colonial Power  are still waiting for the right toexercise in freedom  and without constraint  theirinalienable right to self determination in compliancewith international legality. Algeria has consistently lentits support to the efforts of the Secretary-General andhis personal envoy  as evidenced by its support of theSettlement Plan and the Huston Agreements  signedand accepted by the parties to the conflict  theKingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front.By accepting the peace plan for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara unanimously endorsed by the Security Council lastJuly  and submitted by the Special Representative ofthe Secretary-General  Mr. James Baker  Algeria hasonce again shown its availability to fully contribute tothe settlement of this conflict. This settlement mustcomply with the right of the people of the WesternSahara to decide  in sovereignty  on their destinythrough a fair and free referendum of self-determination  to be organized and monitored by theUnited Nations.The challenges facing the world in the fields ofpeace  security and economic and social developmentare particularly acute in Africa. This continent hasendeavoured over the last few years  with resolve anddetermination  to settle the conflicts affecting severalof its regions  thus generating and encouraging a peacedynamic.In order to achieve its peace and developmentalgoals  Africa must  above all  rely on the support andenhancement of African endeavours. No doubt however  it also needs increased internationalcooperation and support. The strategy of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) aimsspecifically at an optimal mobilization of both Africanand international resources  and the harmonization ofthese contributions through a partnership based on14mutual commitments and balanced interests andresponsibilities.The G-8 countries and European Union memberStates  as well as other countries and organizations thatare partners of Africa  have already taken steps to focustheir Africa-related policies and programmes in supportof NEPAD. Such a partnership should be intensified tohelp Africa  which is still lagging behind  to increasethe pace of its development  to catch up in achievingthe Millennium Development Goals  particularly thatof reducing poverty to half its present level by the year2015.Enhancing international cooperation is also anurgent task  in order to ensure the bases for sustainedgrowth of the world economy  and actual integration ofdeveloping countries into the fields of production technology and trade. Basically  there is a need toensure the necessary conditions so that globalizationwill offer genuine opportunities for all. This impliespromoting equitable rules of the game to advance trade finance  investments and technology transfer.In this connection  we are concerned that therecent World Trade Organization MinisterialConference  held in Cancún  did not manage to draw aframework for negotiations to revitalize the Dohameeting  which was already well behind schedule. Weare still convinced that the reactivation of thesenegotiations and their successful completion  inconformity with the development agenda  holds to alarge extent the key to the growth prospects of theworld’s economy.It is therefore of critical importance to overcomethe remaining difficulties on the basis of an approachthat takes into account the interests and concerns of allparties  as well as the need to restore the multilateraltrading system’s integrity  and effectively implementthe special and differential treatment afforded todeveloping countries. Adequate international action isalso required to address growing phenomena that arebecoming more pronounced  such as speculative flows money-laundering  financing of terrorism  illicitpayments and bribery  as well as harmful practices inthe field of corporate governance. This is needed tostimulate productive investment and ensure sustainedlong-term growth. It is therefore important to tap thehuge investment opportunities available in thedeveloping world  in particular  which eventually willbenefit the world economy as a whole.Significantly increasing official developmentassistance and acting with greater resolve to findsolutions to the problem of the external debt burden ofdeveloping countries  as well as improving access toworld markets for the products of the countries of theSouth would all go a long way towards enhancing theinvestment climate in those countries and towardsincreasing their share of world trade  which remainsthe ultimate goal for achieving sustained financing fordevelopment. At stake is the establishment of a newinternational partnership based on the equitable sharingof responsibilities and benefits.To conclude  let me once again put on record ourfull confidence in our Organization  whose mission infavour of world peace and economic and socialdevelopment for all peoples  remains more valid thanever. We shall therefore continue to call on all MemberStates without exception to contribute to enhancing theOrganization’s authority and to provide it with themeans necessary to fulfil its responsibilities."
"50",2106,"ECU",58,2003,"﻿Ecuador  a country profoundly committed to peace reaffirms its most categorical condemnation ofterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Terroristviolence can never be justified for any reason and mustbe fought with firmness  using all legal measures at thedisposal of States to counter this global threat. The15action of terrorist organizations and networks respectno national or regional borders. The successfuleradication of terrorism depends on internationalcooperation and the concerted action of States inaccordance with the Charter of the United Nations.Since I assumed the presidency of my country and now the presidency of the Andean Community  theissue of Colombia has been at the top of my agenda.My Government  on behalf of the Ecuadorian people has expressed its concern at that conflict because weare linked to our neighbour Colombia by great ties offriendship and deep historical roots.Because of the serious threat that conflict posesfor the entire region  at the summit of the Presidents ofthe Rio Group  held in Cusco in May of this year  Imade the following proposal. I urged Secretary-General Kofi Annan to employ his good offices to givea decisive boost to the peace process in Colombia. Icalled on the guerrilla movements operating in thatcountry to sign a ceasefire agreement and to join anopen and transparent dialogue  accompanied by atimetable with definite deadlines to be discussed andapproved by the parties  in order to reach a lasting andpeaceful solution to the Colombian conflict. Thatproposal was enthusiastically embraced by all thepresidents of the Rio Group.That unnecessary  fratricidal bloodshed is nolonger a problem limited to Colombia or even theAndean nations. It is a conflict that increasinglythreatens the peace and stability of the entire world. Wemust take care and act immediately before the monsterbecomes uncontrollable. Therefore  at this globalforum  I ask for all free nations of the world not toremain passive but decisively to support the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the search for lastingpeace in Colombia.The issue of external debt should cease to betreated as a purely economic matter or as coldstatistics. It must be seriously examined for what it is  agenuine human and social tragedy resulting from theimmense suffering it causes among innocent people. Itis too heavy a burden  preventing the progress of poorbut serious countries such as Ecuador  which managesits public expenditures with great austerity and fiscaldiscipline at a very great social cost  in order to complywith its international financial commitments. Thesepoor but serious countries are making profoundstructural reforms to bring order to salary  labour andtax arrangements. These poor but serious countries arecombating corruption  social injustice and impunity.They are working tirelessly to put an end to theprivileges of a gilded bureaucracy and striving tomodernize their public corporations. But it is notenough: their merciless external debt absorbs the largerpart of those efforts and savings.We are not asking for gifts. We are people ofhonour  and we will continue to honour our obligations.We are only asking for the opportunity to grow  tobecome developed at a faster pace and to pay our debt which otherwise could be perpetuated for eternity.How can we achieve the minimum standards foreducation  health  growth and social welfare that arecontained in the manuals of the United Nations if mycountry  Ecuador  must divert more than 40 per cent ofits budget to servicing its foreign debt?External debt must be dealt with urgently andseriously; the alarming figures in that respect make thisclear. It is imperative that a comprehensive  historicand humanitarian agreement be reached among debtorsand creditors alike to reduce the burden on the budgetsof our countries  so as to increase the availability offunds for social investment  to overcome the obstaclesand budget restrictions that are preventing us frommoving forward with social infrastructure projects.We will continue to meet our external debtpayments; we cannot speak of true democracy if we donot pay the social debt. This is a tragedy and a sourceof weakness for democracy in poor but seriouslycommitted countries such as Ecuador. This realityundermines democracy and democratic stability.On the subject of migration  something importantneeds to be said. Migratory flows along naturalsurvival lines cannot be halted by physical or legalbarriers. In recent centuries  marked by colonialism and during the first half of the twentieth century marked by wars  millions of people left their homesand went elsewhere to seek refuge in new lands  amonggenerous people. That is why they came to America and America lovingly opened its arms to them.Let me say to the people of the First World: nowthat the flow is the other way around  now that yourchildren and grandchildren are going elsewhere  we arewondering why you are not opening your doors toimmigrants. I would ask: if history  with its mysteriousdeterminism  is carrying them again to other lands  will16they able to cite humanitarian reasons  or the need forreciprocity  in order to be welcomed? On behalf ofAmerica  let me say that we will once again receiveothers.My Government  through our Foreign Ministry  iscommitted to preparing the groundwork and creatingconducive conditions for the thousands of Ecuadorianswho want to return home. They will be protected bybroad-based programmes that serve returnees. Withrespect to those who decide to remain outside thecountry  we are endeavouring to secure temporaryprotected status for the undocumented  allowing themto lead a life in conditions of normalcy and dignity.My Government also is making tremendousefforts to secure capital and foreign investments inorder to generate jobs and prevent our citizens fromhaving to leave their country  while at the same timeprotecting family unity.I have the honour of presiding over a Governmentthat is implementing a strategic plan that will allowEcuador to achieve and consolidate sustained economicgrowth. One of the fundamental tasks of myAdministration is the uprooting of corruption  becausethat phenomenon has been enemy number one ofdemocracy  and therefore of development andprosperity  for many people in our region.The fight against corruption is priority numberone for my Administration’s plan. That is what I saidduring my electoral campaign  and I am fulfilling mypromise.A handful of people devoid of morals  takingadvantage of political and bureaucratic opportunities seized Government funds and bank deposits. Now using their political connections  protected byprestigious  well-paid attorneys  and abusing thegenerosity of the countries giving them shelter  they areenjoying with impunity the money they stole from mycountry — a theft that destroyed not only our nation’seconomy but also shattered illusions and crusheddreams and self-esteem  as well as the right to a life inconditions of dignity for millions of Ecuadorians.Therefore  from this rostrum of honour andfreedom  of equality and democracy  I ask all nationsthe world over and the judicial systems of thosecountries where those people have taken shelter fortheir unconditional and immediate support in bringingabout the extradition of individuals wanted byEcuador’s judicial system  so that they can be triedfairly and transparently. I ask also for support inreturning to Ecuador those ill-gotten funds.Within my country  13 million Ecuadorians havemobilized to move forward and  under my leadership have  in eight months  made spectacular strides  asreflected by economic indicators. We have managed tocontrol inflation  ratcheting down inflation from 12.5per cent to 7.3 per cent a year  with forecasts for nextyear of 4 per cent. The trade balance deficit has beenreduced by 62 per cent when comparing the periodJanuary-July 2002 with the relevant period for thisyear.We signed an agreement with the InternationalMonetary Fund that opened to us the doors tomultinational credit organizations  and we havemanaged to open the nation to the world  with theresult that foreign direct investment increased 70 percent between January and July 2003 over the sameperiod in 2002. Oil exports have grown by 25 per cent and non-oil exports by 12 per cent.Confidence in our country is evident because thefinancial system is functioning more smoothly. Totaldeposits are steadily climbing  registering an increaseof 6 per cent over the past six months. Internationalmonetary reserves recorded a 35 per cent increase.External public debt  which amounted to 82 per cent ofgross domestic product in 1999  has been reduced by41 per cent in 2003. Our country’s rating as a risk-fraught country has been significantly reduced. This is without question  an achievement for myAdministration  because  through this indicator  theinternational economic community as a whole is thusshowing confidence in Ecuador.Ecuador has great energy potential  withremaining reserves amounting to some 1.5 billionbarrels and in situ reserves amounting to approximately8.9 billion barrels.Ecuador is opening itself to the world forinvestment in the energy sector. We are working on avariety of large-  medium- and small-scalehydroelectric projects to double our current energypotential.The current Administration is working for thefuture — not just for the period of my presidential termbut for the next 50 years. The mining sector has beenextensively studied in recent years by the world’s17major mining companies  which reached thedetermination that Ecuador has vast potential.Now that my country is regaining its economicstability  my Administration has turned its attention tosocial development. This is an Administration that willpay not only its external debt  but also the socialdebt — the one that has struck hardest at our ownpeople.Ecuador is a country of many resources  naturaland human. It is opening itself to the world  to foreigninvestment. Indeed  investment is on the rebound because foreign capital flows into our nation during theperiod January-July 2003 grew by 189 per cent overthe same period of the previous year. We need moreinvestment in the oil  mining  hydroelectric  agro-industrial  and tourist sectors.Ecuador is a country with a touch of magic  withstunning natural panoramas  cultural diversity andvaried customs. Located at the centre of the world  innorth-west South America  Ecuador has naturaltreasures such as the Galapagos Islands  the exoticAmazon jungle and majestic volcanoes such asChimborazo and Cotopaxi.Finally  let me say that Ecuador’s internationalpolicy is focused on working for sovereignty and isbased on the interests of the people whom I have thehonour to represent  in the framework of unswervingsupport for the rule of law.The future of global society cannot be separatedfrom the well-being of each of the peoples of theworld. If our global society is not just and equitable  ifpeople are not free to fight for their legitimate rightsand to realize their aspirations  there will be no peaceand we will be unable to defeat terrorism or toeliminate poverty — the worst of human rightsviolations."
"51",2151,"EGY",58,2003,"﻿At the outset  Sir  I should like to convey to you  bothpersonally and in your capacity as a representative ofyour country  Saint Lucia  my sincere congratulationson your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am confident thatyou will lead its work with efficiency and skill. Ishould also like to take this opportunity to pay tributeto your predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan of the CzechRepublic  for his remarkable and effective contributionto the results achieved during the last session  resultswe value and seek to deepen further.We meet today at a critical juncture in worldhistory. More than ever before  we need to chart anddefine clearly the path we wish to take to avert theconfusion of concepts and the undermining ofestablished principles. Doubts have been raised aboutthe United Nations and its role; attempts have beenmade to circumvent it and ignore the fact that it wasborn out of the world's tragic experience in the firsthalf of the previous century. From that experience  theworld drew the necessary lessons concerning the needfor collective action to solve problems  to prevent warsand to enable peoples to rule themselves and tocooperate for a better future.I believe that the time is now past for suchdoubts. Everyone has come to realize the importance of17taking action through the Organization in a spirit ofcooperation and solidarity. That is the only way to savethe world from new divisions and scourges. That newdevelopment places new responsibilities on us all tocooperate within the United Nations in a spirit thatseeks unity rather than division  cooperation rather thanconflict  real solutions to problems rather than ways ofaddressing them without justice and respect for theCharter  thus lacking legitimacy and effectiveness.Commitment to the Charter and to internationallaw is the safety valve for the international community.The role of the United Nations cannot be reduced to therole of the Security Council alone and to the questionsthat it can or cannot address. In our opinion  the UnitedNations is much larger than that; its contributionsembrace all the elements of the wide-ranging andcomplex international agenda.In that regard  we reiterate that challenges such asterrorism and illicit drugs  diseases  disarmament protection of the environment  AIDS and achievingsustainable development can be met only throughcoordinated action in which all States  large and small act within an international framework that enjoyslegitimacy and is conducive to the attainment ofcommon objectives.In that connection  I should like to pay tribute tothe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisdistinguished role and his continuing efforts instrengthening the purposes and principles of the UnitedNations to enable the Organization to shoulder itsresponsibilities and to achieve its goals. Kofi Annanplayed a significant role in returning the Organizationto the centre of events. In the course of United Nationsefforts to carry out its noble principles  many of itsstaff members lose their lives. In the recent tragicevents in Baghdad  Egypt lost two of its and bravenationals who had been working ably in the service ofthe Organization's principles.Tragic events have struck many countries andpeoples. Foremost among them were the events of 11September 2001  which afflicted the friendly people ofthe United States of America   events that we fullycondemn and deplore. In the midst of the agony andanxiety generated by such events  inescapableconclusions have been reached: we must unite incombating terrorism on realistic  sound and legitimatebases; we must avoid confusing terrorism with certainlegitimate acts that are inspired by the wish to breakthe shackles of occupation  domination and injustice;and we must understand that the desire to combatterrorism must not become the only yardstick forjudgement.Experience has proven that in combatingterrorism we must not fail to see that it is not a productof one of the world's major cultures. We must notignore the fact that terrorism is not confined to acertain region and that the fight against it must not berestricted to the perspective of security or politicsalone. Terrorism is by nature a multifacetedphenomenon. As such  it must be dealt with in acomprehensive manner that encompasses its political economic  security  legal and psychological aspects  aswell as the conditions exploited by some to justify it.The United Nations has proven its ability tocoordinate international efforts and to achieve tangibleresults in this field. Egypt has participated seriously inall activities aimed at strengthening internationalefforts against terrorism. This has been Egypt'sobjective all along. In 1995  Egypt launched PresidentHosni Mubarak's initiative to convene a high-levelinternational conference under United Nations auspicesto consider ways and means to combat terrorism. Thisinitiative gave expression to Egypt's keen interest insupporting the international efforts aimed at reaching aclear and precise understanding of the fight againstterrorism  including through special negotiations on thecomprehensive convention to combat internationalterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. TheEgyptian initiative must not be construed as a chancefor protracted polemics or disagreement that clouds ourobjective. On the contrary  it is a call to frame adocument that expresses the international political willand reflects the international resolve to eradicate thescourge of terrorism  to restore peace and security along with justice and stability  and to clarify theresponsibilities of each and every member of theinternational community.Our world today is facing numerous challengesregionally and internationally. There are challenges tothe logic of fairness  justice and peace and challengesrelated to the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction and the slow pace of international action inthe field of nuclear disarmament. We are witnessingtendencies to consecrate the right to possess  develop and modernize nuclear weapons. Some States still clingto the obsolete doctrines of deterrence and attempt tofind justifications for the use of nuclear weapons.18Therefore  it has become necessary to widen theestablishment of zones that are free of weapons of massdestruction. In this regard  I recall Egypt's repeatedassertions  in all international forums  that renderingthe Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction particularly nuclear weapons  in a comprehensiveframework that applies to all without exception ordiscrimination  is the only way to spare the region andthe world the dangers that threaten all ourachievements and all that we strive to achieve. It isunacceptable that Israel's possession of such weaponsshould remain a reality that some prefer to ignore orshould prevent the international community in Vienna New York or elsewhere from facing it fairly andsquarely.The Middle East region continues to suffer fromthe absence of peace. There were high hopes that thehistorical reconciliation between the Palestinian andIsraeli peoples was within reach after the Oslo accords the parties' mutual recognition and the subsequentagreements and negotiations. Yet the efforts failedevery time  seemingly because the Israeli party doesnot yet fully share the conviction of all  expressed byPresident George Bush and the Quartet  that thesolution lies in the establishment of an independentPalestinian State  within the 1967 borders  that wouldlive side by side with Israel in peace and security.The Palestinian people continue to be subjectedto oppression  provocation  and aggression. Theycontinue to languish under the oppression of a crueland unfair occupation that generates feelings of despairand frustration and leads to a spiral of violence andcounter-violence whose victims are innocent civilians.It is high time for the international community toreiterate its call to the parties to return to thenegotiating table in order to implement the principlesof international legality and to achieve a just peace inthe entire Middle Eastern region on the basis of acomplete withdrawal to the 1967 borders and of respectfor rights. Egypt has continually made efforts toachieve that objective in Palestine  the Govan and inthe occupied Lebanese territories  confident that thelogic of peace will prevail over the logic of aggressionand that the resolve of the people who yearn for apeace that achieves security and opens the door fordevelopment will prevail over those who continue toharbour ambitions of expansion and aggression andthus put the interests of their peoples in danger. Theywill bear a heavy responsibility for that.The situation in Iraq is cause for grave concern.We reaffirm anew the need for respect for thesovereignty  independence  and territorial integrity ofIraq  as well as the need to create conditions conduciveto the earliest possible withdrawal of the occupyingforces and the assumption by the United Nations of acentral role in assisting the Iraqis in the political andeconomic reconstruction of their State. Egypt affirmsits readiness to contribute to the reconstruction process in accordance with the wishes and needs of the Iraqipeople and in cooperation with the rest of theinternational community  under the aegis of the UnitedNations. We look forward to the day when theaspirations of the Iraqi people are realised and when itbecomes an effective and free partner working with itsArab brothers for a better future.Egypt welcomes the recent agreement betweenthe government of the Sudan and the SudanesePeople's Liberation Movement (SPLM)  an agreementthat paves the way for a consolidated effort towards abetter future for the people of a united Sudan and onethat ensures equality  security and prosperity for all itscitizens. Egypt calls upon the international communityto assist in securing the implementation of thisagreement. The profound and eternal ties and relationsbetween Egypt and the Sudan and our firm belief in thecommonality of the hopes we entertain and the threatswe face impel us to be in the vanguard of action for theachievement of that lofty goal. It alone can guaranteethe maintenance of the interests of the Sudanese peopleas a whole  as well as the interests of the Arab worldand the African continent.Egypt believes that cooperation for developmentis the cornerstone of multilateral international action.The eradication of poverty is a moral  human  andpolitical responsibility shared by the countries of theNorth and the South. It is the shortest route toachieving international peace and security. A fair lookat the international economic situation must concludethat it is impossible to accept the continuation of thecurrent imbalance in the distribution of wealth amongthe peoples of the Earth. Equally impossible to acceptare the lack of democracy in international economicdecision-making  the grave fluctuations in theefficiency of the work of the world financial markets the unfair trade practices against the interests ofdeveloping countries and the policies that lead torecurrent financial crises which eliminate  in a fewdays  the achievements of decades of great sacrifice.19We regret that the Cancun Conference was unable toproduce the desired and previously agreed outcome ofaffording developing countries a real opportunity tobenefit from liberalization based on balanced trade.Instead  it made liberalization an obstacle to the effortsof developing countries to promote growth anddevelopment under difficult and complexcircumstances.Egypt has welcomed the outcome of UnitedNations conferences and summits  including theMillennium Summit Declaration  and has called for fullimplementation of the letter and spirit of the decisionsadopted. Hence  we view with satisfaction the decisionof the General Assembly at its last session to considerin 2005 at a high level the implementation of theoutcomes of international summits and conferences.Globalization  with the hope it brings forinternational cooperation that benefits all  could turn  ifmisused  into an attempt at domination  therebyexacerbating the structural flaws in the internationalsystem at both the economic and political levels.Hence  there is a need for measures to increase theeffectiveness of international institutions and toachieve good governance  which is as necessary on theinternational level as it is on the national level  and tocreate a favourable economic environment. There isalso a need to adopt a comprehensive package ofreforms that includes international finance and formutual respect among cultures and civilizations so thatdialogue and cooperation can benefit all and canpromote understanding between nations and peoples.While urging the United Nations to continue itsefforts in the promotion of international cooperationfor development  Egypt stresses the importance oftaking the cultural diversity of societies into account. Itis also important to seek acceptance of the other as anequal partner in discourse without the imposition ofcertain models. At the same time  we reiterate that thiscooperation must be the fruit of a new philosophy thatposits the common destiny of mankind in a unified andinteractive manner  whereby if one part suffers  the restwill subsequently suffer. The repercussions of theeconomic and social problems in a given country orcontinent can no longer be confined to a single place.Rather  these repercussions now swiftly find their wayto the rest of the world.The United Nations should place the situation inAfrica among its top priorities  in view of the political economic  social  and environmental challenges facingit  as well as the outbreak of armed conflicts  spread ofdeadly epidemics and plunder of the riches andresources of peoples  whether directly or indirectlythrough the imbalance in trade and economic relations.The New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD) constitutes a new starting point to change thestandard of living in Africa. It is an initiative createdby the Africans themselves  based on their own visionof their reality  needs and the great hopes of theAfrican peoples for a better future and their wish to bepartners with the world for the sake of developmentand progress. Egypt reaffirms the need to implementthe resolutions adopted by the General Assembly lastyear  which took NEPAD as a framework fordevelopment in Africa. Egypt calls for the developmentprogrammes of international organizations to beadapted to the priorities set by NEPAD. Egypt urgesdonor countries and economic organizations andinstitutions to provide support to the African countriesfor the implementation of NEPAD and the achievementof its desired objectives.African countries have already established withinthe African Union the machinery required for theimplementation of the initiative. The internationalcommunity is called upon to help bridge the financialgap that impedes the achievement of poverty reductionin Africa. This should be done through a prompt andcomprehensive approach.Egypt's belief in the centrality of the role of theUnited Nations in the world  now and in the future impels it to reaffirm the urgent need to develop andincrease the Organization's effectiveness. This includesthe reform of its main organs  particularly the GeneralAssembly and the Security Council. We all agree thatthere is a need for reform and that this reform is a longprocess. Many of the steps towards reform have beenimplemented. However  much remains to be done tostrengthen collective and international action throughthe revitalization of the General Assembly and reformof the working methods of the Security Council. AllStates should be given ample opportunity to shoulderthe responsibilities of membership in the Council.Therefore  we continue to support acomprehensive approach to the reform of the SecurityCouncil and believe that this process should be basedon two main guidelines: a commitment to the overallconcept of reform and the rejection of a policy of20taking small steps in one direction or another. TheOpen-ended Working Group of the GeneralAssembly   the only open and transparent forumavailable for the consideration of this importantsubject   should also continue its consideration of thismatter and abide by its mandate.The dangers that beset us all make it imperativefor us to rally around the lofty principles establishedunder the Charter of our Organization. We musttranslate our belief in those principles into continuouswork that transcends greedy ambitions  hatreds illusions and the desire for domination and hegemony.Our work must proceed from a belief in the equalrights and duties of peoples. Thus we will achieve thehopes of the peoples of the Earth and spare themhardship and suffering.The path towards that objective lies in thecommitment to United Nations resolutions and thecessation of attempts to ignore  circumvent or adaptthem to serve purposes incompatible with the Charterand with law and justice. If we uphold those principles we will all be victors. The only vanquished ones willbe the forces of evil and aggression  which will bedefeated by our peoples' hopes for a more just andsecure world for all."
"52",2175,"ERI",58,2003,"﻿I shouldlike to begin by extending to Mr. Julian Hunte sincerecongratulations on his election to the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. TheEritrean delegation is convinced that  under his wiseguidance  this session will address  with vision andcourage  the challenging issues that are confronting theworld.My delegation would also like to take thisopportunity to express appreciation and thanks to hispredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session  for the wisdomand skill he displayed in leading the session to asuccessful conclusion. We also pay tribute to theSecretary-General  Kofi Annan  for his steadfastcommitment to the cause of peace and development —the twin pillars of the United Nations Charter.Eritrea pays tribute to and thanks the facilitatorsand guarantors of the United Nations Mission inEthiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) and its partners  thetroop- and observer-contributing countries  as well asdonor countries  for the assistance they generouslyextended to ensure the success of the peace process. Italso urges them not to be discouraged by the recentnegative developments and to continue their assistance which is essential for the achievement of peace andsecurity in our region.Eritrea would like to bring to the Assembly’sattention the dangerous developments that arethreatening to destroy the peace process betweenEritrea and Ethiopia. In a message communicated tothe Secretary-General  on 19 September 2003  Ethiopiaofficially rejected the decision of the BoundaryCommission and threatened to unleash another war ofaggression against Eritrea if the terms and conditions ithad set were not met.It should be recalled that Ethiopia declared waron Eritrea in 1998 because it claimed ownership of thesovereign Eritrean town of Badme. At that time  wemade every possible diplomatic effort to prevent anunwarranted and unjustifiable war — prior to and inthe aftermath of Ethiopia’s official declaration of war.Unfortunately  that sent the wrong signal to Ethiopiaand prompted the regime in power to pursue — withimpunity — its policy of belligerence  and to unleashsuccessive military offensives that that resulted in agreat loss of life and the destruction of property.After a cycle of senseless and bloody militaryclashes  reason prevailed  with the signing of theAgreement on the Cessation of Hostilities and theComprehensive Peace Agreement in Algiers in Juneand December 2000  respectively. A BoundaryCommission  empowered to be the final arbiter for theboundary claims  was subsequently created. TheCommission announced its final and binding decisionon 13 April 2002. Badme was confirmed by theCommission’s decision as being sovereign Eritreanterritory.In spite of its treaty obligations to respect andduly implement the final and binding decision of theBoundary Commission  however  Ethiopia has chosento flout international law and practice. Thus  itsrejection of the entire decision and its denunciation ofthe Commission follow a series of major violations ofthe Algiers Agreements  including the illegaldeployment of troops and the building of settlements insovereign Eritrean territory  the aggravation of thesuffering of over 60 000 Eritrean citizens  who remaindisplaced from their home villages in the temporarysecurity zone  and the delay of demarcation because ofobstructions caused by its tactics to prevent preparatoryfield work. That has resulted in huge financial cost tothe international community.As most Members will have been informed bynow  the Ethiopian Prime Minister declared  in a letterof 19 September to the Secretary-General  that theboundary demarcation process is “in terminal crisis”.The Prime Minister heaped insults on the BoundaryCommission  dismissed its judgement as “totallyillegal  unjust and irresponsible” and called on theSecurity Council to set up “an alternative mechanism”to demarcate the contested parts of the boundary. Hefurther suggested that UNMEE should pack up andleave  and pleaded for international recognition andendorsement of Ethiopia’s occupation of sovereignEritrean territories.Ethiopia’s provocative letter represents nothingless than an unprecedented assault on the fundamentalprinciples of international law and the key tenets of theAlgiers peace agreements  as well as Security Councilresolution 1507 (2003). It is full of blatant lies anddistortions in its account of the legal principles and18findings that the Boundary Commission invoked indetermining the location of Badme.The Prime Minister’s letter contrasts sharply withthe public statement of his Government when theBoundary Commission announced its decision on 13April 2002. At that time  Ethiopia urged theinternational community to put intense pressure onEritrea to accept and implement the decision of theBoundary Commission fully and faithfully. It declaredfull legal victory and even bragged about its“successful litigation strategy that hinged on amaximalist approach” of exaggerating its claims toinclude territories that never belonged to it. Thisblatant revelation  which is in fact true  was repeatedby both the Prime Minister and his Minister for ForeignAffairs in a report to the Ethiopian Parliament asrecently as last month.Let me now briefly address some of the issuesraised in the Ethiopian letter.First  article 4.2 of the Algiers Peace Agreementunambiguously states that:“a neutral Boundary Commission composed offive members shall be established with a mandateto delimit and demarcate the colonial treatyborder based on the pertinent colonial treaties(1900  1902  1908) and applicable internationallaw.”Article 4.15 further states:“The parties agree that the delimitation anddemarcation determinations of the Commissionshall be final and binding. Each party shallrespect the border so determined  as well as theterritorial integrity and sovereignty of the otherparty”.Therefore  Ethiopia cannot thus arbitrarily andunilaterally discard these key provisions of the peaceagreement or urge the Security Council to set up a newmechanism.Secondly  the Temporary Security Zone wasnever intended or set up to create a provisionalboundary. Article 10 of the Cessation of HostilitiesAgreement specifically states that this will notprejudge the final status of the contested areas  whichwill be determined at the end of the delimitation anddemarcation of the boundary. In this regard  it isinstructive to note that the Boundary Commission hadnotified both parties  in its delimitation decision of 13April 2002  to recognize and respect each other’ssovereignty and territorial integrity as determined bythe delimitation decision pending demarcation on theground. The boundary is thus already determined. Thisis reinforced by Security Council resolution 1507(2003)  which calls on both parties to recognize andrespect each other’s territorial integrity andsovereignty. Ethiopia’s ludicrous suggestion of“recognizing the southern boundary of the TemporarySecurity Zone” as the boundary between the twocountries” thus represents a flagrant violation of theAlgiers Peace Agreements and relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions.Thirdly  UNMEE’s mandate shall terminate whenthe delimitation-demarcation process of the border hasbeen completed  pursuant to article 5 of the Cessationof Hostilities Agreement. Ethiopia will again commit agross violation of the Cessation of HostilitiesAgreement if  as it has intimated in its letter  it requestsUNMEE to leave before completing its task.Obviously  Ethiopia’s primary concern is not thefinancial burden that UNMEE’s prolonged presencewould entail for the international community.Ethiopia is  in fact  guilty of a litany ofobstructions and violations that have in the pastprevented expeditious demarcation. It cannot now shedcrocodile tears or preach to the internationalcommunity on ways and means of reducing financialcosts. If this is a thinly veiled threat meant to convey tous its intentions of unleashing war  our response is thatEthiopia will be the sole party responsible forendangering regional peace and stability.As the main guarantor of the Algiers PeaceAgreement  the Security Council has legal treatyobligations to prevent war. Indeed  in accordance witharticle 14 of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement the Security Council should urgently considerEthiopia’s flagrant violations of the Algiers PeaceAgreement and take appropriate measures underArticle VII of the Charter of the United Nations.Fourthly  Ethiopian leaders also argue that“the people of Ethiopia will not accept thedecisions of the Boundary Commission [and that]Ethiopia will be embroiled in a political crisis andcivil war if we accept the decision”.19These hackneyed arguments have been used byprevious Ethiopian leaders to justify their wars ofaggression. The truth is that the people of Ethiopiahave enjoyed internal harmony only when they were atpeace with Eritrea. Whenever it has been at war withEritrea  Ethiopia has become a source of instability inthe region  and its people the victims of recurrentfamines and pestilence. Also  such declarations mustring an alarm bell  because they are similar  if notidentical  to statements made by those leaders whoembroiled Europe in the Second World War.In our view  Ethiopia’s leaders have assumedtheir lawlessness and aggressive invasion policybecause they have been emboldened by past patterns ofunjustifiable tolerance by the international community.No action was taken against Ethiopia when it violatedthe moratorium on air strikes brokered by the UnitedStates and launched its second offensive in February1999. No action was taken against Ethiopia when  inviolation of the technical arrangements forged by theUnited States  the European Union  the United Nationsand the Organization of African Unity (OAU) andconsidered final and binding  it launched its thirdoffensive in May 2000. Ethiopia has now reached theapex of its record of lawlessness  contempt for the ruleof law  treaty obligations and the Charter of the UnitedNations by rejecting the final and binding decision ofan Arbitration Commission. How long will this cultureof impunity continue? When is the world going to say “Enough is enough” and invoke article 14 of theAlgiers Agreement?Article 14 of the Cessation of HostilitiesAgreement states clearly  inter alia  that“OAU and the United Nations commit themselvesto guarantee the respect for this commitment ofthe two parties until the determination of thecommon border on the basis of pertinent colonialtreaties and applicable international law … Thisguarantee shall be comprised of:“(a) Measures to be taken by theinternational community should one or both ofthe parties violate this commitment  includingappropriate measures to be taken under ChapterVII of the Charter of the United Nations by theUnited Nations Security Council”.Should not the United Nations and theinternational community now take these actions in thename of justice and the Charter of the United Nations?The international community has already investedtoo much — in financial and in political terms — tohelp bring about a legal and peaceful resolution of thedispute. The political and financial leverage of theinternational community  as well as the instruments ofpersuasion at its disposal  are also substantial  asEthiopia continues to receive lavish developmentassistance from multilateral and bilateral partners. Yet while all the ingredients and safeguards of success arethere  the danger of failure of the peace process is nowdistinct due to the failure of the internationalcommunity to take seriously its obligations under thisagreement and to take effective preventive measures.Unless appropriate action is taken now  before thesituation explodes  crisis management will be too lateand will not be worth the effort.In this spirit  the Eritrean delegation appeals tothe General Assembly and to the internationalcommunity to take necessary and timely actions toensure that peace and security prevail in our region.The obligations of the international communityare clear  while the measures at its disposal areexpressly spelled out in the Algiers Agreement.Despite international guarantees  Ethiopia haschosen to blatantly violate international law and itssolemnly signed treaty obligations. Since19 September  when Ethiopia wilfully crossed a redline  it has set in motion an irreversible process toscuttle altogether the Agreement on Cessation ofHostilities between the Government of the FederalDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Governmentof the State of Eritrea. That is an affront not only toEritrea but also to the international community as awhole  and in particular to the United Nations and theSecurity Council.In his report (S/2003/257) to the Security Councilearlier this year  Secretary-General Kofi Annanexpressed his concern that the Eritrea-Ethiopia peaceprocess was “at a critical stage”. The situation can nowbe considered explosive  paving the way — asEthiopian leaders seem to wish — to renewed conflict with its attendant horrific consequences  unless theinternational community acts promptly and decisively.The harmful effects of Ethiopia’s lawlessness willnot be limited to Eritrea. They will impinge on thelegitimacy and credibility of the United Nations andmock its core values  if only because they violate thehallowed injunction that States  big and small  need to20observe the basic principles of international law andthe sanctity of legal agreements  and to respect thesovereignty and territorial integrity of States.In conclusion  the people of Eritrea and Ethiopiahave been denied peace for three decades. That has hada devastating effect on their economies. They deservepeace and development  which are now recognized ashuman rights. Yet such peace can be guaranteed onlyby respect for the rule of law  the sanctity ofagreements and the sovereignty and territorial integrityestablished by arbitration decisions made on the basisof legal agreements. Eritrea has always been  and willcontinue to be  committed to such peace. It is now upto the international community  and in particular theSecurity Council  to uphold those principles andvalues. In essence  Ethiopia is no longer in conflictwith Eritrea  but with the Charter  which the SecurityCouncil must uphold as it has done in several similarcases."
"53",2221,"ESP",58,2003,"﻿It isalways a special opportunity for the leader of hiscountry to speak to this General Assembly. My speechwill be brief and may be summed up at the very outsetin very few words as follows: I am speaking to you asthe President of a European democratic countryinvolved in sustainable development. My compatriotsespecially value the existence of freedom and respectfor the law as factors for progress in Spain. We thinkthese two values  freedom in all areas of life andcompliance with the law comprise the best recipe forprogress among peoples.The last twenty-five years of progress in mycountry have fortunately coincided with the change inthe millennium. Freedom of opinion  peaceful politicalchoice and the broadening of fundamental rights havebecome values which enhance us. Of course  this hasnot been accomplished without effort and risks alongthe way. However  I now have the satisfaction ofspeaking of that progress. The culture of communityupon which this democracy is based is openlyexpressed by the Spanish people of the IberianPeninsula and we are celebrating this during thecommemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of ourConstitution. We are an open country  trustedthroughout the world  and we wish the same principlesand situation for others. The determination to increasefreedom throughout the world and the concern toensure that laws of the international community arecomplied with are values that guide our internationalpolicies. We share this position with many countriespresent here.The world would be a better place if the rules wemake for ourselves are complied with and if those whobreach them know that their non-compliance will notprevail. The United Nations embodies internationallegality. Compliance with its resolutions is in theinterest of all. This is the best way to build a world inkeeping with law rather than tyranny  with freedomrather than oppression.It is probably for this purpose that the SecurityCouncil and the Organization require reform. Withoutdoubt  this is a complex issue and we support effortsbeing made in this connection by the Secretary-General. In any case  we bear in mind that increasingthe number of Security Council Members will notnecessarily increase the effectiveness of the Council.But above all  the United Nations needs its ownMembers to respect its resolutions. A resolute effort onthe part of all countries is necessary to ensure a moresecure  yet freer world.Although violations of Security Councilresolutions exist  all of us must ensure that theresolutions are complied with. All of us must lend ahand because it is in the interest of all for the ideals ofthe United Nations to become a reality. Thus  we arecommitted to security  stability and the reconstructionof Iraq. We also are committed to returning sovereigntyto the Iraqi people. We spare no effort and do not wishto dwell on the past. We believe that successful resultsin Iraq will be due to the efforts of the entireinternational community. We think that the pledgingconference to be held in Spain on 23 and 24 Octoberwill be a big stride. I would like  from this rostrum  toinvite all of you to participate in that conference.Allow me to present some more concrete ideas.Our efforts must be directed towards restoring thesovereignty of the Iraqi people in a way which willenable them to freely enjoy their own resources. Forthat purpose there should be an agreement reached toestablish a multinational force with the clear mandateof guaranteeing peace and security. Given the situationtoday in Iraq with its high risk of terrorism  this taskcannot be entrusted to a mere interposed force  butrather to one that will specifically ensure peace security and stability.An additional agreement on the civiladministration of Iraqi resources and public servicesfor the people would be easier to obtain after that. I amreferring to a civil administration directed by theUnited Nations with the participation of the newleaders who would be representing a peaceful andpluralistic Iraq.37Peace  security and freedom have always hadenemies and we cannot close our eyes where suchthreats exist. We have been the victims of blindterrorist violence in this Organization. We cannotforget that vile and cowardly attack in Iraq by whichterrorists hoped to expel the United Nations from Iraqand close it off from the world. The States who floutinternational law are threatening what is dearest to us our lives and our freedom.Proliferation of weapons of mass destructionwould be even more dangerous. I firmly believe thatcommitment and true cooperation between all Stateswill make it possible to win victory over terror. LastMay  Members of the Security Council shared someconsiderations concerning the fight against terrorism towhich I refer now. We will continue to work onpreparing a list of terrorist organizations — thingsshould be called by their proper names — and thereshould be no political or moral quarter given toassassins. Our priorities must be set. We will shut downthe sources of financial support to terrorists and willprevent their access to weapons of mass destruction.The treaties on disarmament with regard to nuclear chemical and biological weapons will help with thistask. To prevent and intercept the trafficking ofweapons of mass destruction  a group of countries hasimplemented the Proliferation Security Initiative whosefirst meeting took place in Madrid last June. I inviteyou also to join that Initiative.We would like to give a voice to the victims ofterrorism and for this  three things are required. Wemust restore truth  regain dignity and pay tribute to thevictims of terrorism. If terrorists have sometimes usedpublic tribunals  it is a moral necessity to give aninstitutional forum to the victims where they can beheard. We must unmask the terrorists and truly listen tothe victims.It has been rightly said  Sir  that the UnitedNations has not been established to create paradise inthe world  but rather to keep the world from falling intoan abyss. There is no paradise on earth. Efforts arebeing made to ensure that the world will be freer andmore peaceful and to distance us from the abyss efforts which make it possible for this Organization tomake its lofty ideas a reality. It is hoped that no effortwill be spared in this undertaking."
"54",2247,"EST",58,2003,"﻿Allow me tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. That isa significant tribute to you and to Saint Lucia. Estonia like Saint Lucia  is a small State  and together we canadmit that the United Nations is an Organization thatallows small States to participate on equal footing withlarge ones in influencing global processes. I alsocommend your predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for hisaccomplishments in presiding over the fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly. I am particularlypleased to do so in the light of the similar histories ofEstonia and the Czech Republic and of our commonendeavours to join the family of democratic nations the European Union and the North Atlantic TreatyAlliance.The fifty-eighth regular session is the first sincethe outbreak of the war in Iraq. This year has been adifficult one  both for the United Nations and for theentire world. Long and emotional debates in theSecurity Council preceded the Iraq crisis. Many thinkthat the war  rising tensions among States and thecountry’s post-war reconstruction have tested theOrganization’s capabilities  its credibility and its role inthe world. I should like to believe  not that the pastyear has undermined the Organization’s morale  but thecontrary. Those ordeals and the Iraq war have served asa lesson and have deepened our conviction that theUnited Nations should be even more decisive andefficient in the future than it is today.Unfortunately  the crisis in Iraq has affected morethan the morale of the United Nations. Although theOrganization has been the target of terrorist attacksbefore — such an attack was planned against UnitedNations Headquarters many years ago — the terroristbombings of the United Nations headquarters in Iraq acouple of days ago and on 19 August — which claimedmore than 20 lives — were unprecedented. Terrorismand violence never choose their victims and it issignificant that the United Nations  as an Organizationfor global peace and stability uniting all States of theworld  was targeted.I would like to emphasize that Estonia hasresolutely condemned the terrorist attack on the UnitedNations mission in Baghdad. Together with allrepresentatives here  the people of Estonia and I are indeep morning over the tragic murder of Sergio Vieirade Mello  Special Representative of the Secretary-General  and others. I deeply sympathize with theirrelatives and colleagues.A terrorist act against people who are committedto assisting the people of Iraq is a painful blow to theUnited Nations and a crime against the people of Iraqand the international community. However  it cannotserve as an impetus for the United Nations to withdrawfrom hot spots. Estonia welcomes the statement madeby Secretary-General Kofi Annan that  despite theattacks  the United Nations will continue its activity inIraq. Terrorists should not determine the future of Iraq8or make the people of that country and the internationalcommunity withdraw from the goal of building up asovereign  democratic and prosperous Iraq.Recent events have even more clearlydemonstrated the need for the presence of stabilizationforces in Iraq. In order to enforce peace and stability inthe Persian Gulf region  enhanced cooperation betweencoalition forces  the United Nations and theinternational community is necessary. Despite its smallsize and moderate resources  Estonia is also activelyinvolved. In May 2003  the Estonian Parliamentapproved the deployment of a unit of the EstonianDefence Forces to peace enforcement operations inIraq and Estonian servicemen joined the mission in thePersian Gulf region in June. Estonia has acceded to all12 United Nations anti-terrorist conventions and isactively cooperating with many States and internationalorganizations.Now I will proceed to a central topic of myaddress — the environment and sustainabledevelopment. I consider a sustainable approach to theenvironment and sustainable development to be one ofthe most significant commitments  both for the UnitedNations and for States. In the long term  the welfareand conditions of peoples will depend primarily on ourability or will to use wisely and sparingly the limitedresources of our planet and to shape the environmentwe live in. With respect to the ever-growing populationof the world  increased production and consumption  aswell as the resulting pollution  the pressure of humanactivity on our living environment is continuouslybuilding. In the circumstances  environmentalprotection and ensuring the welfare of mankind andwildlife are becoming an ever-more important anddifficult task. It is not by chance that the UnitedNations proclaimed the year 2003 as the InternationalYear of Fresh Water and that the year 2002 focused oneco-tourism and mountain regions.Twenty years ago  the General Assembly adopteda resolution establishing the World Commission onEnvironment and Development to define globalproblems and to find ways of solving them. GroHarlem Brundtland headed the Commission. The reportentitled Our Common Future  completed in 1987 defined sustainable development. The main message ofthe report was that economic growth and increasedwelfare of the people should not compromise theability of future generations and the environment tomeet their own needs. Global economic developmentshould take into consideration the tolerance thresholdsof the environment and the need to preserve naturalresources.Sustainable development  as a cohesivedevelopment of the socio-economic field and theenvironment  has become a priority of mostdemocracies throughout the world  especially after theUnited Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. As the head ofthe Estonian delegation to the Conference  I signedAgenda 21 and the Framework Conventions on ClimateChange and Biological Diversity.Eleven years have passed since the Rio de JaneiroConference. Considering developments since then  wesee that some progress in global environmentalcooperation among States has taken place. New goalswere set and interim conclusions made at the specialsession of the General Assembly in New York in 1997and at the World Summit on Sustainable Developmentin Johannesburg in 2002. The General Assemblysession in 2000 agreed on the Millennium Declaration with the main goal set as environmental sustainability.However  we must note that the world’spopulation has grown by 1 billion since the Rio deJaneiro Conference in 1992. In the 1990s  the worldgross domestic product grew by an average of 2.6 percent a year. No doubt  sooner or later these processesare going to influence the living environment of us all.Although we cannot as yet define the actualrelationship between human activity and the climate ofour planet  a glimpse into the climate changes of thelast decade is worrying. Natural phenomena like ElNiño and La Niña have had a lasting impact on humanlife. Floods  droughts  tornadoes and extremefluctuations of temperature have become nearly dailyrealities on our planet. European States have notremained untouched by the climate changes. In 1997 floods devastated Eastern Europe; last summer Western and Central Europe were hit by a heat wave.These facts should convince us that environmentalprotection is a matter of common concern for allmankind.Cooperation readiness is extremely important andEstonia has done its best to collaborate. We haveacceded to all essential environmental conventions andwish all other States in the world to do the same.Estonia ratified the Framework Convention on ClimateChange on 27 July 1994 and acceded to the Kyoto9Protocol on 17 November 1998. In unison with theEuropean Union  Estonia expresses its cleardetermination to enforce the Kyoto Protocol as soon aspossible.Estonia is a small State with moderate resources playing a small role in the world economy and theenvironment. Nevertheless  we adhere to the principle “act local  think global”. Environmental protection isextremely important. Estonia has a long tradition ofnature conservation. As early as in 1297  King ErikMenved of Denmark banned cutting forests on severalEstonian islands. In 1995  four years after regainingindependence  Estonia adopted its SustainableDevelopment Act. In 2001  at the recommendation ofthe Committee on Sustainable Development  theGovernment of Estonia approved a strategy ofsustainable development — Sustainable Estonia 21.More than in any other field  inter-Statecooperation is important in environmental protection and regional organizations play a substantial role inthis regard. The Baltic Sea States have displayedremarkable initiative  which other regions of the worldwould find worth following. The Baltic Sea regionalsustainable development process was launched in 1996.It is unique in the world — an Agenda 21 for the BalticSea States — Baltic 21. The parties to the processinclude all Baltic Sea States and the EuropeanCommission. The process targets the elaboration andthe implementation of sustainable development visionsand an action plan for the entire region and key sectors.The Baltic Sea joins the members of the Councilof the Baltic Sea States (CBSS). It is especiallyappropriate to speak about the protection of the BalticSea in the International Year of Fresh Water. Currently Estonia holds the CBSS presidency  and the protectionof the environment  first and foremost of the BalticSea  is among the top priorities of the presidency.During our presidency  we would like to focus on newhazards arising from the intensifying marine traffic onthe Baltic Sea. Estonia is targeting its efforts towardsachieving an agreement between member States toreduce the oil-tanker-pollution hazard to a minimum.Estonia supports the initiative of the European Unionto ban the traffic of single-hull tankers on the BalticSea  and is committed to having the Baltic Seaclassified as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA).I would like to conclude by stressing that although I have touched only upon terrorism and theenvironment  Estonia fully shares all the priorities ofthe European Union (EU) at the fifty-eighth session ofthe General Assembly  particularly  the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction peacekeeping  the protection of human rights andcombating the HIV/AIDS pandemic.The future of the United Nations is also importantfor Estonia. The United Nations needs to be improvedand restructured. Estonia has favoured the overallstrengthening of our common Organization andwelcomes the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annanto revitalize the United Nations  primarily the GeneralAssembly. In our opinion  reform of the SecurityCouncil should enable the United Nations to participatemore efficiently in problem-solving and crisisresolution throughout the world.The Secretary-General’s recent report on theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration is asignificant and important document that deservesdetailed analysis and serious consideration. Isn’t it timefor the United Nations family to support the Secretary-General in his concern about the Organization now andabout its future? Let us agree — both the large and thesmall Member States — upon what we would like toaccomplish and when  and let us move steadily ahead.Only a strong United Nations  with efficient decision-making mechanisms  can ensure global welfare andbalance. Let that be a goal for us."
"55",2293,"ETH",58,2003,"﻿It gives me great pleasureto extend to Julian Hunte warm congratulations on hiselection as President of the fifty-eighth session of theGeneral Assembly. I wish also to take this opportunityto commend his predecessor for his invaluablecontribution to the success of the fifty-seventh sessionof the Assembly. Allow me also to extend my sincereappreciation to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan for the great effort he has been making to maintain theintegrity of the United Nations in this difficult periodin the history of the Organization. I wish also tocommend the Secretary-General for his invaluablecontribution in enhancing humanitarian assistance fostering development cooperation and strengtheningour esteemed Organization.I wish to preface my brief statement with sincereappreciation for all those who have responded withgenerous support to assist the people of Ethiopia toovercome the consequences of a devastating andextended drought  which put at risk more than a dozenmillion of our compatriots. The responses from theUnited Nations  the United States  the European Unionand many others were indeed as timely  as they weregenerous. The people of Ethiopia are grateful for thisdemonstration of solidarity.We in Ethiopia are the first to realize that thisstate of affairs in our country cannot continue. Ourpeople cannot be allowed to be vulnerable to famineevery other year because of drought. It is a must for us and a matter of national survival and dignity  to ensurefood security for our people in the shortest timepossible. But this can be done only when our peopleare given respite for peace and are able to fullyconcentrate on economic development.We have come to be convinced that  for ourstrategy on economic development and goodgovernance to succeed  we need to enhance ourcapacity in human resources development andinstitution-building. It is imperative for us to focus oncapacity-building and to make it a priority.It has also been found critical that we expandfurther our decentralization exercise  with a view toempowering our people at the grass-roots level.We have embarked on a fundamental shift in thecountry’s foreign and national security policy  focusingon the internal needs of our country and on ensuring itsviability  which can be realized only through rapideconomic development and the nurturing of democraticgovernance.Like many countries in our continent  andperhaps more than most  Ethiopia has suffered at lengthas the result of conflict and war and its consequences.The internal causes of the absence of peace andtranquillity in our country were removed  once and forall  when the military dictatorship came to an end andwhen we embarked upon laying the foundations for ademocratic and just society 12 years ago.Until 1998  Ethiopia made great progress that  ifcontinued  would certainly have made us far moreprepared to withstand the consequences of the extendeddrought last year and the year before. But theAssembly recalls what befell Ethiopia in 1998. Thestrong momentum we had managed to create for rapideconomic development was pushed off track by theaggression we suffered in May 1998  which took ustwo years to reverse. Having reversed the aggression Ethiopia showed its unflinching respect for theprinciples of international law by taking the lead in13ensuring the signing of the Algiers Agreement. Withlittle hesitation  Ethiopia withdrew from territory that ithad seized in a counteroffensive to expel the invadingarmy from its territory and to make room for theTemporary Security Zone  to which the United NationsMission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) wassubsequently deployed.We have now come to the point at which theUnited Nations will have to take greater interest toensure that the hopes and promises engendered by theAlgiers Agreement are fulfilled. The Agreement wasdesigned to lead to durable peace between Ethiopia andEritrea. It was not meant to punish the victim ofaggression. This is why Ethiopia has felt it necessary tocall on the Security Council to help us achieve thehopes implicit in the Algiers Agreement.Ethiopia is committed always to being a peacefulcountry. We have always been second to none in ourcommitment to the principles of international law. Thiswill remain one of our people’s distinguishing features.This is a tradition we will continue to maintain andfoster. This is also how we intend to tackle the presentcomplications in the implementation of the AlgiersAgreement.Few regions of the world have suffered as a resultof conflict as much as the Horn of Africa. We inEthiopia are committed  along with others in oursubregion  to change this existing reality. With theprogress that continues to be made in the peace processto resolve the conflict in Somalia  we are today morehopeful than ever that the long saga of the Somalipeople might be about to end.I wish to seize this opportunity to thank theEuropean Union  the United Nations and others for theinvaluable assistance that they have continued to giveto ensure the success of the peace process in Somalia.Little progress could have been made without thatsupport. The frontline countries of theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)will need even greater support for the success of thepeace process in Somalia  which is now entering intoits most critical phase.We are also deeply encouraged by the peaceprocess aimed at resolving the conflict in the Sudan which has also entered into a very delicate phase. Theparties deserve to be commended for the great resolvethey are demonstrating in addressing the commonchallenges they are facing. The Framework Agreementon Security Arrangements for the Interim Period signed on 25 September between the two parties represents a major breakthrough  which will no doubthelp lay the foundation for more progress in otherareas. We would like to thank all those  the UnitedStates Government in particular  who have madecontributions to the progress that has been made in thepeace process in the Sudan.These developments show that the situation in theHorn of Africa is not hopeless. The challenges we arefacing are nonetheless formidable. We in Ethiopia aredetermined to contribute more than our share to assistin the regeneration of our subregion  which has alsobeen the target of international terrorism. Theachievement of peace and national reconciliation inSomalia is extremely critical in the fight against thisscourge as well. That is why all those who are willingto join in the fight against international terrorismshould be automatically supportive of the peace effortby IGAD in Somalia.As a country from a region that has lost much andhas stayed far behind in development because of theabsence of peace  Ethiopia feels solidarity with all thepeoples of the Middle East who yearn for peace security and justice. As a people very close to theMiddle East  Ethiopia has close affinity with the peopleof Palestine and with the people of Israel. It is our hopethat the suffering of both will end soon and that thehope held up by the road map will be realized.The hope we have for economic development andthe prospect we see for peace in our subregion canhardly be made a reality without internationalconditions that are conducive to countries such asEthiopia to make progress.In this respect  the general situation is not verypromising. Under the circumstances  without greatercommitment by the developed world to the rapideconomic development of Africa  countries such asEthiopia will hardly be in a position to meet theMillennium Development Goals.There is  without any doubt  an urgent need forincreasing the quality and the level of assistance by thedeveloped world to Africa. There is a critical need foraddressing the problems surrounding issues related tosubsidies and the access of products from Africancountries to developed countries’ markets.International solidarity and the promotion of our14mutual interests make it imperative that a lastingsolution is found to the debt burden.Africa is passing through a very difficult andcritical period. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is wreakinghavoc in the continent. As is now widelyacknowledged  this is not simply a health crisis. Thepandemic is also an economic  security and socialcrisis with broad and potentially devastatingimplications. Hence  this is a challenge not only forAfrica  but also for the entire world.But Africa is not asking to be rescued by theinternational community without discharging its ownresponsibilities. What Africa is asking is to be given abreak  as many have been given in the past at somepoint in their history. In fact  what is involved here aremutual obligations. This is the overriding principleupon which the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment (NEPAD) is based. It is Ethiopia’s hopethat NEPAD will be taken more seriously as aframework for expanding the cooperation betweenAfrica and the developed countries in the interest ofensuring success in Africa’s fight for prosperity anddevelopment  and for a safe  peaceful and trulyglobalized world.The United Nations is facing today one of themost difficult periods in its close to 60 years of history.Its legitimacy and credibility is being increasinglyquestioned. Many have also questioned itseffectiveness. Not a few have also wondered on manyoccasions whether they have always been assisted bythe Organization in nurturing and fostering peace. Myown country has also been disappointed in the past. Butwe have never abandoned hope in the United Nationsor in multilateralism  because we know  at the end ofthe day  that the United Nations is indispensable. Thatis why Ethiopia will always be committed to the UnitedNations and its ideals.It is our hope that all Member States  big andsmall  will be fully committed to the United Nationsand its ideals and carry out the long overdue reform ofthe Organization with a view to making it moreeffective."
"56",2339,"FIN",58,2003,"﻿I have the honour to makethe following statement on behalf of His ExcellencyMr. Erkki Tuomioja  Minister for Foreign Affairs ofFinland.Multilateralism and the United Nations have gonethrough a trying time since the last session of theGeneral Assembly began. At the same time thatmultilateralism has been challenged by unilateralactions  it has been proved that multilateralism andmultilateral cooperation — as well as the UnitedNations — are needed  perhaps more than ever before.The discussions at the World Trade OrganizationMinisterial Meeting in Cancún also point to the needfor open and broad discussions on preserving amultilateral trading system based on mutually agreedrules.International cooperation is needed in crisismanagement and prevention  in disarmament and armscontrol  in promoting human rights and internationallaw in general  in enhancing sustainable development in strengthening global governance with regard toenvironmental issues and in creating coherence andcooperation on economic and social issues  amongother things. In order to do this  a more efficient andeffective United Nations is needed. The United Nationssystem must deliver solutions to increasinglycomplicated challenges  be it Iraq  the Middle East coherence between trade and development  or financingfor development. Through their political will  MemberStates should give the United Nations the support itrequires in order for it to be a true actor in worldaffairs. We need to be more efficient and more result-oriented.The development and strengthening of the UnitedNations pose a major challenge at this particularjuncture. United Nations structures — the SecurityCouncil included — require reform  and the wholeOrganization requires better resources. This is aprerequisite also for a comprehensive implementationof the Millennium Declaration  which forms ademanding agenda for the United Nations for years tocome.Despite different emphases and definitions givento freedom of action or joint actions  all theprerequisites exist for strengthening multilateralcooperation. As a member of the European Union Finland is involved in the discussion on thesignificance of multilateralism and on the terms forpromoting global security. This  too  should be one ofthe main topics in this session of the Assembly.In addition to what was said in the Italy’sstatement on behalf of the European Union  I shouldlike to focus on two issues that require multilateralcooperation in particular: the issue of harnessingglobalization and that of weapons of mass destruction.The biggest challenges in the future will be thoseto international peace and security  which becomebroader and broader in their scope  and theglobalization process  as well as managing these twotogether through multilateral cooperation.Globalization affects everyone. Some can benefitfrom it. Some become more marginalized by it.Globalization stems from a countless number ofdecisions made in the private sector and beneath oroutside public institutions. But we must be able toinfluence  through the United Nations and otherinternational organizations  corporate and public sectordecisions that direct globalization. There are manyongoing processes that try to make globalization moreinclusive and allow everybody to share its benefits.The Finnish Government  together with theTanzanian Government  is launching the HelsinkiProcess on globalization and democracy. Ultimately the global governance pursued by the Helsinki Processis characterized by the democratization of international20relations  by the way that globalization and its by-products can be managed through more equalparticipation in deciding on international rules andnorms. One of the key tasks of the process will be todevise and develop new solutions for global problems.We will also focus on the global economic agenda andon human security.The international players in globalization include in addition to States and multinational companies  thecontinually growing network of non-governmentalorganizations. Many of those organizations take acritical or negative stand on globalization  but do nothesitate to adopt procedures that are characteristic ofglobalization or to build networks across nationalborders. Out of a vast array of organizations  I couldname two that are perceived as opposite: the WorldEconomic Forum and the World Social Forum. Both however  are concerned with the same challenges in thesame world. One of the aims of the Helsinki Process isto bring these two processes closer to each other.A global approach to international peace andsecurity and a multilateral security system based oncooperation are largely axiomatic principles forFinland and for our partners in the European Union.But security problems linked to globalization  andsolutions to them  threaten to divide the internationalcommunity. Peace is much more than the absence ofwar nowadays. Development and peace are inseparablyintertwined  and both of them are being affected byglobalization.Another major issue that requires multilateralcooperation is weapons of mass destruction andprevention of their proliferation.Effective global governance requires universallyagreed norms and rules setting standards for behaviourto be followed by all States as well as by non-Stateactors. Proliferation of weapons of mass destructionand their means of delivery is clearly an issue thataffects the international community as a whole. NoState can ignore these dangers. Today more than ever we need to step up our collective efforts to halt theproliferation worldwide. The most effective way toaddress global security threats is the multilateralsystem of binding international agreements. Theexisting system of treaties  built over the decades needs to be strengthened  not weakened. We need toreinforce our commitment to the prohibition ofchemical and biological weapons and to the preventionof the spread of nuclear weapons  with the objective oftheir total elimination.Promoting adherence to multilateral treaties andobligations is not enough. It is equally important toensure that commitments are fully implemented. Theinternational community cannot tolerate precedents ofnon-compliance with the legal undertakings  whichwould put at stake the whole non-proliferation regime.In cases where States have difficulties inimplementing treaty obligations due to lack of legal ortechnical verification expertise  appropriate supportand assistance should be offered by the relevantorganizations and participating States.The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty remains thecornerstone of our efforts to curb the spread of nuclearweapons. In our view  the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty constitutes an essential andirreplaceable building block for containing theproliferation of nuclear weapons  thus contributing tonuclear disarmament. Finland attaches greatimportance to its entry into force. We urge all Statesthat have not yet done so to sign and ratify it as soon aspossible.In combating the spread of weapons of massdestruction  new initiatives and new approaches arecalled for. In order to complement internationalinstruments  we need fresh perspectives on how toconfront the problem of weapons of mass destruction.Finland welcomes new efforts  open to all  such as theG-8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weaponsand Materials of Mass Destruction.The United Nations and in particular the SecurityCouncil have the primary responsibility formaintaining international peace and security. Finland isin favour of enhancing the role of the United Nations inissues related to the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. We agree with the Secretary-General thatthe United Nations and the Security Council shouldlook at the enforcement of regimes against weapons ofmass destruction. The United Nations has valuableexpertise and experience in verification. Finlandbelieves that this verification and inspectioncompetence should be maintained.By focusing on weapons of mass destruction  I donot want to suggest that small arms are any lessdangerous. They need due and growing attention by theinternational community. In some countries and in21some crises small arms are a means of massivedestruction and a major cause of loss of life  mostly ofcivilians.The multilateral institutions should respond tonew challenges. Being multilateral is not sufficient initself. In the work of the General Assembly Finlandunderlines the importance of setting clear priorities tackling the issues that are most relevant in today’ssecurity environment. People throughout the worldmight find it difficult to understand the Organization’strying to resolve the problems of yesterday’s world.Before concluding  let me express myGovernment’s deep satisfaction with the fact that theInternational Criminal Court (ICC) has become areality and is operational. The ICC is the cornerstone ofefforts to enhance respect for internationalhumanitarian law and human rights. We remaincommitted to ensuring the Court’s success and appealto States which have not yet ratified the Rome Statuteto become parties to it."
"57",2383,"FJI",58,2003,"﻿Mr. President  my Governmentand country warmly congratulate you on yourassumption of the Presidency of this fifty-eighthsession of the United Nations General Assembly. Inpresiding over the Assembly  Saint Lucia is setting anhistoric precedent for small island developing States with the able support of its Caribbean Community(CARICOM) neighbours.Fiji fully supports your chairmanship. We alsorecognize the successful leadership of your17predecessor  President Jan Kavan of the CzechRepublic.I wish to express my Government’s deepcondolences to the family of Mr. Vieira de Mello andof all the victims of the bombing at the United Nationsin Baghdad last month. This was a brutal crime  whichrobbed the world of one of its most accomplishedmediators and peacemakers. We hope that at thissession  we can all come together  united  in ourcollective determination to rid the world of terrorism.I come from a part of the globe that is isolated inthe vast South Pacific. But that remoteness does notseparate us from the international perils of the bomb the gun and the hijacker. It does not insulate us againstthose bent on causing death and destruction to defendtheir interests or advance a cause. The fact is that everycountry and region is a potential target.Members of the Pacific Islands Forum are joinedwith the United Nations in the search for a new orderof peace and stability. That might seem an impossibletask set against the tensions  the hatreds  the bloodshedand violence of the times. But  if we abandon it  we sellout the principles of the United Nations. We betray ourcountries  our peoples and generations to come.Are we so inadequate and lacking in ourunderstanding and abilities that we are incapable ofcoming up with new solutions to stop the spread ofterror? It is not enough to simply strike out at theperpetrators. We must spend more effort and resourcesfinding out what turns people towards violence toachieve a goal. We must tell ourselves that there is adifferent way  that the growing culture of violence andkilling is not destined to be a permanent part of ourworld.The United Nations needs to go to the root causesof this terrible phenomenon  which casts a very darkand menacing shadow over the first years of thetwenty-first century. In the Pacific  we areconcentrating on security issues  strengthening law andorder and maintaining stability. A number of initiativeswere taken during the last 12 months when our PrimeMinister served as Forum chair.Foremost among these initiatives was the ground-breaking decision to send a peace mission to theSolomon Islands in response to a plea for assistancefrom that country. The Solomon Islands had beenwracked for several years by civil unrest  lawlessnessand ethnic conflict. We in Fiji had a sympatheticappreciation of the difficulties facing those islandsbecause of our own crisis in 2000. We were more thanhappy  therefore  to contribute to a task force to theSolomon Islands charged with bringing back order andre-establishing peace. A contingent of our troops combined with others from Australia  Papua NewGuinea  Tonga and New Zealand  is now in theSolomon Islands working with the people there. We areencouraged by what our own soldiers and theircomrades have been able to do so far to support aneighbour in distress. Our task is given extrasignificance through the close ties we enjoy with theSolomon Islands.The Solomon Islands mission has inevitablygenerated some controversy and debate aboutAustralia’s expanding involvement in our region. Butlet the record reflect that we endorse Australia’sleading role in this intervention on the invitation of theSolomon Islands Government. One of its notableaspects is that it is multilateral. It was accomplishedthrough the Pacific Islands Forum and has theunanimous support of the members. Beyond this  weknow that the support and encouragement of theinternational community and the United Nationssystem will remain important  as work to build acredible law and justice system  an effectiveadministration and a viable economic base continues.Recent happenings have brought into question thevalue  the relevance and the future of multilateralism.Our position is that we understood the concerns  whichled the United States to act in the way it did over Iraq.The date of 11 September 2001 was a shattering ordeal.It changed history and it changed America.That said  Fiji declares an unwaveringcommitment to the concept of the world communityworking together  seeking the common path forward.We stand by the ideals of a multilateral  cooperativeapproach among nations. We welcome the decision bythe United States to now seek United Nationsinvolvement in Iraq’s reconstruction.In the Pacific  the Nasonini Declaration onregional security  adopted last year in Fiji  is akeystone of joint strategy. It followed the earlierHoniara Declaration on Law Enforcement Cooperation aimed at countering transnational and organized crime.The Forum countries will give higher priority toimplementing legislative provisions to improve our18capacity for dealing with law enforcement and securitychallenges. Underpinning this is an Australiancommitment  also approved by the Forum  to spendapproximately $15 million over three years  tostrengthen regional police forces. New Zealand has additionally  agreed to put in $2 million. This importantproject is to be based in Fiji. A regional academy willprovide training for about 900 police officers annuallyfrom Forum countries.Fiji has been taking part in United Nationspeacekeeping operations since 1978. This has come ata price. But  to us  serving world peace with oursoldiers demonstrates that even the smallest States canplay their part in minimizing and preventing conflicts.Currently  635 Fiji personnel are on active duty inUnited Nations missions  apart from 123 soldiers and15 police in the Solomon Islands. Our commitment toUnited Nations peacekeeping has not changed. It is avital part of our foreign policy.Fiji stresses the importance of strengtheningmultilateral treaties and conventions on disarmamentand non-proliferation. Our country is one of those thatwant to see an effective global strategy for the controlof small arms and light weapons.During our Prime Minister’s chairmanship of thePacific Islands Forum  there was a deepening of theSouth Pacific region’s engagement with developmentpartners and international organizations. Heads ofGovernment from member States enhanced their tieswith France and Japan. They met in Tahiti withPresident Chirac and discussed many topics of commonconcern.At a summit with Prime Minister Koizumi inOkinawa  they were able to reach and agreement on theoutcome of the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  the Millennium Development Goals andour own regional priorities  as a further basis for futurecollaboration.The Pacific Islands Forum now has 12 dialoguepartners  including the United States  Canada  France the United Kingdom  the European Union  Japan China  Malaysia  Indonesia  Thailand  India andTaiwan.China — the emerging giant in world affairs andtrade — has a steadily growing presence in our region.Its involvement and support for our economic andsocial development is welcome. We see definite scopefor trade  investment  cultural and tourism links. China many commentators believe  already has the world’ssecond largest economy. Its present aid programme issignificant and we expect it to grow substantially asbilateral relationships grow stronger.At the same time  we place great value on ourtrade and commerce with Taiwan and value itsassistance to our development. We look forward to theday when China and Taiwan peacefully resolve theirlong-standing differences.We also welcome Japan’s role and presence in thePacific Islands region. Japan is an economicpowerhouse and its increased role and contribution inpromoting international security and developmentshould be recognized by all Member States in allowingJapan a special place in the United Nations SecurityCouncil.I am pleased to report that in Fiji and the region there is more coordination in the effort to curbHIV/AIDS  the most terrible disease of our era.Although we have so far escaped the worst effects ofHIV/AIDS  it is a real danger in the islands.We expect to make substantial progress in ourfight against this affliction  with support from Japanand France and an allocation from the Global Fund toFight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria. A programmefinanced by Australia provides $12.5 million for theregional campaign. Our Government will also make alarger HIV/AIDS allocation in next year’s budget.HIV/AIDS screening was recently at the centre ofdiscussion in Fiji  when a suggestion was made forobligatory testing. Such a move was regarded by ourHuman Rights Commission as a rights violation. Wemust weigh the Commission’s views carefully againstthe competing call for radical response to a nationalthreat.The Fiji Human Rights Commission is a productof our Constitution and its comprehensive bill of rights.The Commission is implementing a public educationcampaign to overcome a lack of awareness on rightsissues. It also monitors Government and statutoryauthorities so that laws and policies conform tointernational human rights principles and therequirements of the Constitution. These generallyreflect the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsadopted by this Assembly in 1948.19As a former colony  Fiji is a late-starter inpromoting human rights and civil liberties. OurGovernment’s strategic plan to 2005 expresses veryclearly where we stand. The plan was endorsed by anational economic summit and by Parliament. Pleaseallow me to quote briefly from the plan:“The guarantee of fundamental rights andfreedoms for every citizen of Fiji and their equalprotection under the law ... is an essential part ofour vision for a peaceful Fiji. A feeling ofpersonal security and of group security comesabout when people have confidence that breachesof rights and freedoms will be dealt withimpartially and speedily”.I quote further:“... Respect for the rights of others is acritical component of our freedoms guaranteedunder the constitution. It is essential for peacefulexistence in our multi-cultural society”.I emphasize these points because sometimes thereare attempts to depict Fiji as a land where rights arehabitually abused. Propaganda against our country hasbeen circulated in some quarters here at the UnitedNations.Much of this stems from opposition to ouraffirmative action policies designed to end social andeconomic inequalities. These are based on principleswell-established internationally and are provided for inour Constitution.It is self-evident that a country cannot grow injustice  harmony and prosperity when more than half ofits population — in this case the indigenous Fijians —are largely outside the economy looking in.All right-thinking people will agree that it is justand fair that this should be changed. But we constantlystress that this is not about taking from one group togive to another. It is about making the economy growso that there is enough wealth to be shared equitablyamong our population. We want to give the Fijians achance to catch up and compete in business andcommerce.Let it be noted that we have brought in laws tohelp the disadvantaged of all communities. This is aconstitutional obligation. No one is being left out. Thatis the commitment we have made to our ownpopulation  and we now make to the internationalcommunity.Disparities and inequalities go to the very heart ofthe dispute which brought about the collapse of theCancún talks. The failure of the talks underscores thedeep differences which separate the poor countriesfrom the rich in the battle to reform international trade.We acknowledge the ideal of free trade  but the starkreality is that there are many dangerous pitfalls fornations whose economies are weak and vulnerable.It will be a long time before most developingStates are ready to compete on that so-called levelplaying field. To them it is not level at all. Bring thebarriers down completely and the full might of first-world commercial power will descend. What will thatdo to home-grown and emerging industries in poorercountries?For the time being  countries like ours needpreferences and special access for our economicsurvival. Think of it as a form of affirmative action toreduce that yawning chasm between the rich North andthe poverty-stricken South. We now need to urgentlyconsider where the World Trade Organization goesfrom here  and what can be done to salvage thewreckage of Cancún.About three and-a-half years ago  my countrycame very close to anarchy. We had an armedinsurrection  hostage-taking and violence. TheGovernment of the day was overthrown. It was a timeof extreme crisis for Fiji.Now  I can stand before this Assembly to tell youthat our nation is being reborn. Order and stability wererestored and the first steps taken on a continuingjourney of reconciliation. We had peaceful  democraticelections. Our Government is on a mission to build aFiji where peace  multi-racial harmony and prosperitywill always reign.Our economic policy is to create moreemployment and wealth through high growth. We haveincreased Government investment in infrastructure andmade a concerted and  to this point  successful effort toattract greater volumes of private capital. Many of theindicators are positive — apart from those relating toour sugar industry. This year  we expect to achieve anoverall growth rate of more than five per cent.This remarkable recovery could not have beenachieved without the encouragement and support of20many friends of Fiji in the international community and especially here at the United Nations.I pay tribute to the role of the United NationsDevelopment Programme  the World HealthOrganization  the Food and Agriculture Organization the United Nations Population Fund  the UnitedNations Children’s Fund  the United NationsEducational  Scientific and Cultural Organization andthe International Labour Organization. The ILO ismaking a particularly valuable contribution at themoment with a plan to accelerate job creation.To conclude  the “special case” of the smallisland developing States is calling for a “specialresponse” of the global community  in furtheradvancing our sustainable development efforts. Theten-year comprehensive review of the BarbadosProgramme of Action in Mauritius next year willprovide the avenue for our development partners tomake further commitments to our cause. Fiji is urgingthe international community to contribute to thesuccess of this meeting.Mr. President and fellow delegates  the UnitedNations is currently experiencing considerable strainand division  but it is for all of us to ensure that thisOrganization comes through the period of difficulty strengthened and regenerated. The world needs theUnited Nations and what it stands for."
"58",2430,"FRA",58,2003,"﻿SergioVieira de Mello was the pride of the United Nations.Murdered on 19 August along with his colleagues  hewill remain in our memories. Let us dedicate thissession to that great servant of the world and of peace.The United Nations has just emerged from one ofthe most serious challenges in its history. Respect forthe Charter and the use of force were at the heart of thedebate. The war  which was launched without theSecurity Council's authorization  has undermined themultilateral system.Having come to terms with that crisis  ourOrganization can now continue to move forward; for itis above all in this forum   the melting pot of theinternational order   that we must exercise ourresponsibilities to the world of today as well as tofuture generations.In an open world no one can live in isolation  noone can act alone in the name of all and no one canaccept the anarchy of a society without rules. There isno alternative to the United Nations. But in order tomeet today's challenges  this fundamental choice expressed by the Charter  requires a far-reachingreform of our Organization.Multilateralism is crucial  because it ensures theparticipation of all in the management of world affairs.It is a guarantee of legitimacy and democracy especially when decisions must be made with respect tothe use of force or to the laying down of universalnorms.15Multilateralism is effective. In Monterrey andJohannesburg  it allowed us to transcend North-Southconfrontation and to open the way to promisingpartnerships  in particular with the African continent.Multilateralism is modern  because it alone makesit possible to comprehend contemporary problemsglobally and in all of their complexity.First  let me touch on the settlement of conflictsthat threaten international peace and security.In Iraq  the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis who must have sole responsibility for their destiny  isessential for stability and reconstruction. It is up to theUnited Nations to lend its legitimacy to that process. Itis also up to the United Nations to assist with thegradual transfer of administrative and economicresponsibilities to the Iraqi institutions  according to arealistic timetable  and to help the Iraqis draft aconstitution and hold general elections.Finally  it is up to the United Nations to entrust amandate to a multinational force  commanded naturally  by the main troop contributor   that is  theUnited States   in order to ensure the security of Iraqand of all those helping to rebuild the country.Thus the international community and the Iraqipeople  united around a common project  will togetherput an end to the tragic decades of that great country'shistory.In the Middle East  ravaged by despair andhatred  only strong political will on both sides toimplement the law as stipulated by the United Nationscan pave the way for a just and lasting solution.The international community must restore adynamic for peace. It must involve itself in theimplementation of the road map. That should be theobjective of the upcoming meeting of the Quartet  to beheld at the ministerial level. France believes that theidea of a monitoring mechanism is as relevant as ever and that the convening of an international conference isa goal to be attained as quickly as possible.Given the present tense situation  France calls onthe parties not to succumb to the temptation of a test ofstrength and of a futile radicalization.Another major challenge is the fight againstinternational terrorism. This fight is well under way under the auspices of the Security Council and withinthe context of our treaties. The horror of 11 Septembercemented our common resolve. This threat strikes atthe very heart of our democracies and our societies. Weare using force to combat terrorism  but that is notenough. It will re-emerge again and again if we allowextremism and fanaticism to flourish   if we fail torealize that it seeks justification in the world'sunresolved conflicts and economic and socialimbalances.Given the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  we reject the policy of fait accompli. Wemust stand united to guarantee the universality oftreaties and the effectiveness of non-proliferationregimes. In order to ensure compliance  we must alsodevelop our means of action. France has proposed thecreation of a permanent corps of inspectors under theauthority of the Security Council. Let us give freshimpetus to this policy. Let us convene a summitmeeting of the Security Council to outline a true planof action of the United Nations against proliferation.At this time  let us demand that North Koreacompletely  verifiably and irreversibly dismantle itsmilitary programme. Let us demand that Iran sign andimplement  unconditionally and without delay  astrengthened nuclear safeguards agreement with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency.Sustainable development poses yet anotherchallenge  because half of humankind is living inconditions of insecurity or extreme poverty. Will we beable to globalize solidarity  as our peoples demand  inresponse to the inevitable globalization of theeconomy?We agree on the objectives. We are bound by theMillennium Goals. But  in order to attain those goals strong political impetus remains necessary. I proposethat heads of State and Government meet in New Yorkin 2005 for a preliminary progress review. I hope thatthis session of the General Assembly will confirm thedetermination of States to overcome the failure ofCancun and to ensure the success of the DohaDevelopment Round.In order to carry out the missions entrusted to itand to remedy its blatant shortcomings  the UnitedNations must evolve. Three watchwords  I believe must guide us: democracy  authority  effectiveness.Thanks to the Secretary-General  progress has beenmade  and new avenues are opening up. It is now up toStates to move forward without further ado and to put16an end to the adverse consequences of the stalemateover reforms.The United Nations is suffering from the currentweakness of the General Assembly. And yet  it is herethat a debate should be organized and a consensuscrafted regarding solutions to major problems. Aculture of confrontation must give way to a culture ofaction aimed at achieving our common goals  which weshould determine together.The primary responsibility for the maintenance ofpeace and security rests with the Security Council. It istherefore essential to its legitimacy that its compositionreflect the state of the world. It must be expanded toinclude new permanent members  because the presenceof major countries is necessary. France  naturally  isthinking of Germany and of Japan  but also of someleading countries of Asia  Africa and America. We alsoneed new elected members  to make the Council evenmore representative. With the decisive impetus of thefive permanent members  we all need to resumediscussions  mindful of the general interest.Such reform should be accompanied by astrengthening of the Council's authority. It is theCouncil that should set the bounds with respect to theuse of force. No one can claim the right to use forceunilaterally and preventively. Conversely  in the face ofmounting threats  States must be assured that theCouncil has at its disposal the appropriate means ofevaluation and of collective action  and that it has thewill to act.We all are very committed to the sovereignty ofStates. But its scope can and should be limited in thecase of serious violations of human rights and ofhumanitarian law. The Security Council is taking stepsin that direction  and France supports this development.Meanwhile  crimes against humanity are beingsuppressed more effectively with the establishment ofthe International Criminal Court  whose jurisdiction isuniversal. This historic step forward must beaccompanied by a strengthening of the Office of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights  under acommission equipped to discharge its duties and itsmission.We now realize that globalization demandsstronger economic  social and environmentalgovernance. To that end  France proposes the creationof a new political forum representative of the presenteconomic state of today's world in all its diversity.That council would be responsible for providing thenecessary impetus to international institutions  forimproving their coordination and for anticipating andtackling global problems more effectively.Effectiveness also depends on increased financialresources. France calls for two changes.First  the trend towards increasing voluntarycontributions at the expense of mandatorycontributions must be reversed. Failing that  we willend up with a pick-and-choose United Nations  whichis an outdated vision and a harmful one.Secondly  we need to make progress inmobilizing funds for development and developmentassistance. France wants to meet the officialdevelopment assistance target of 0.7 per cent by theyear 2012. But this effort  together with that of theEuropean Union  will obviously not suffice to releasethe necessary funds needed to finance the MillenniumGoals each year. France therefore supports theinnovative concept of an international financial facility.I would also like us to give pragmatic  speedyconsideration to international solidarity levies  a kindof tax on the wealth generated by globalization andgiven over to development.To advance on these issues  I completely approveof the Secretary-General's intention to gather aroundhim a committee of independent wise men and womenresponsible for submitting proposals.Against the risk of a world without orderdelivered up to violence  let us work to establish therule of international law. Against the injustice andsuffering of a world of widening inequalities   eventhough it has never been so rich   let us choosesolidarity. Against the chaos of a world shaken byecological disasters  let us call for a sharing ofresponsibility around a United Nations environmentalorganization. Against the barbarity of a world in whichfundamental rights are all too often held up to ridicule where the integrity of mankind is under threat  whereindigenous peoples   the heirs to an irreplaceableheritage   vanish amid silence and indifference  let usuphold the demands of ethics. Against the peril of aclash of civilizations  finally  let us insist on the equaldignity of cultures  respect for diversity and the valueof dialogue.17With the Charter adopted in the name of thePeoples of the United Nations  the founders proclaimedtheir faith in these ideals. Let us seek to be worthy ofthem. Let us establish the United Nations at the heartof this planetary democracy that is so vital in our dayand age."
"59",2455,"FSM",58,2003,"﻿I would like to take thisopportunity to congratulate you  Mr. President  on yourelection. My Government is deeply gratified by therecognition of your accomplishments  especially giventhat you are a fellow islander. We are confident youwill lead the work of this body with the same highcompetence as your distinguished predecessor  HisExcellency Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic.Before going further I must pause in respectfulremembrance of the second anniversary of the terroristattacks of 11 September 2001. We honour the memoryof all who were lost. I must also express our sincerecondolences over the great loss of life recently at theUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad.I am grateful for the privilege of appearing beforethis body for the first time  as President of theFederated States of Micronesia. We feel a deep sense ofresponsibility in joining with nations present here towork toward a better world for all peoples.For the past several years  much of the discussionhere and elsewhere has focused on political challengesaround the world. After 11 September  it is not at allsurprising that these challenges have commanded thelion's share of everyone's attention. We in theFederated States of Micronesia remain committed tothe eradication of terrorism in all its forms  and willcontinue to play the role open to us as the world strivesto reach this goal.However  the challenges of the environment andof sustainable development that occupied so much ofour attention during the 1990s have not gone away.Despite the immediacy of so many pressing demandstoday  those remain challenges that the internationalcommunity cannot afford to put on hold. We cannot putthem on hold because they are part and parcel of theworldwide security challenge  especially over thelonger term.No part of our world is immune to the wide rangeof fundamental security threats. War and terrorism areonly consequences of their deeper root causes: poverty human injustice and  more recently  environmentaldegradation. These are most often discussed in thecontext of the more populous regions of the world  butI ask the Assembly not to overlook the fact that theyalso present themselves to the small island developingStates.The unique vulnerability of our island States toall those scourges is widely recognized. Even so global threat assessments most often are not followedup by a realistic allocation of resources to the moreremote   yet also more vulnerable   places  wherethreats to global security often find their origin or seekrefuge. I submit to the Assembly that the region of thePacific islands has for too long been overlooked in thatway.We welcomed the initiative of the internationalcommunity to address those and related developmentproblems during the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment. But we returned home  and we still findourselves struggling just as much as ever withfundamental needs. As memories of Johannesburg arepushed into the background by seemingly more urgentcrises  our people are beginning to ask questions aboutthis process. They are asking whether repetitiousdiscussion of traditional development strategies at alengthening string of summit venues offers the mostproductive avenue for achieving real development18goals. We must consider these things with a broaderconsciousness. The challenges are enormous  and theyare immediate. I say to the Assembly respectfully thatbusiness-as-usual multilateralism is not getting the jobdone.Before proceeding  I should say that today'sMicronesians do enjoy a much-improved standard ofliving in comparison with the conditions that existedwhen we were introduced to the world economy lessthan 50 years ago. However  we still have very far togo before we can reach the levels of even themoderately successful developing countries  let aloneof the industrialized world.In saying what I do here about my own country'sdifficulties  I must add that we are by no means alone.Therefore  we stand with developing countrieseverywhere  and we fully support the positions to beexpressed here by His Majesty the King of Morocco onbehalf of the Group of 77 and China  and by HisExcellency the Prime Minister of Mauritius on behalfof the Alliance of Small Island States.We must all do more. For our part  the smallisland developing States need to ensure that we meetour obligations and fulfil our undertakings to the globalcommunity. We are not just supplicants; we have rolesto play. My country has made commitments toenvironmental responsibility in line with our capacity.We have pledged increased accountability andoversight of development assistance. We have resolvedto build our capacity to govern more effectively and toincrease regional interaction.I believe that all developing countries shouldexplore how we can mobilize our limited resources individually and collectively  even as we seekassistance. In that regard  I commend to theAssembly's attention the communiquÈ of the PacificIslands Forum issued this year at Auckland  NewZealand. It is illustrative of the kind of regionalcollaboration I encourage here. For example  we in theForum agreed this year to an important andcomprehensive statement of principles fundamental togood governmental leadership and recognized by all. Ithink that it deserves close study by the Assembly.Serious attention was also given by the Forum leadersto the challenges presented by international criminalelements attracted to our region. They are attracted inpart by our out-of-sight  out-of-mind' status. It wasrecognized at the Forum that  given our limitationsindividually  we can confront those challenges onlythrough regional  collective action.We are also now seeing  more than ever before entire regions of the world marginalized in the globaleconomy  as witness the sad breakdown of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) meetings recently. Somecountries have been virtually ignored until social andpolitical conditions have severely deteriorated.We are hearing more frequently the term failedState'. It has no clear definition  but it has been usedon occasion to justify outside intervention. That maybe necessary under certain circumstances  but it is inthe interests of all that such conditions should notdevelop in the first place. I submit that the causes ofany such so-called failure can be traced far beyond theborders of the unfortunate country that is so labelled.The time is ripe for a new way of looking atinternational peace and security. No longer caneconomic  social and environmental issues exist in aparallel universe  divorced from geopoliticalconsiderations. The linkages are becoming all too clear as the alarming findings of this year's United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) report onimplementation of the Millennium Development Goalsconfirm.Despite our best efforts  we still face the fullrange of threats to our natural environment. Thosethreats are not diminishing. In fact  on a global scale progress by the world community has been glacial inthe face of ever more pressing demands for action. Wemay say to ourselves that any disastrous outcomes liewell in the future  but we can act only in the present.We are literally making   or failing to make   lifedecisions for the yet-unborn.One of the most clear and present emergencieshas figured prominently in our statements in thegeneral debate every year since our country became aUnited Nations Member; I refer to the need forimmediate international action to combat climatechange. Regrettably  I cannot speak with any lessconcern this year. If anything  our appeals mustbecome more urgent. At a time when we speak of manywars  there is also the war against climate change   awar that mankind cannot afford to lose.I know you can appreciate better than most Mr. President  that  for my family and me  the issue ofclimate change is a present reality. My island  Woleai 19in Yap State  is an atoll with no point higher than twometers above sea level. The frequency and the intensityof storms in our region have been increasing for sometime.During the last year we experienced three majortyphoons  as well as other destructive storms. One ofthem triggered massive mudslides on the state ofChuuk's higher islands  and 50 people died. In Yapstate  a recent storm washed away a large and very oldcemetery. These and similar recent events in our otherstates are unprecedented. Everything we are  and hopeto achieve as a people  is under grave threat because ofglobal climate change.Having confirmed that the climate change crisisis real  the entire world also now possessesindisputable evidence that its steady progression can belaid at the doorstep of human activity. Yet some of theworst polluters among the industrialized countries seeit as their top priority to protect vested interests. Theyare purposely delaying the immediate action that isrequired to begin to turn the tide of destructive climatealteration.In the Framework Convention  it was agreed byall that those bearing the responsibility for causing thisproblem must take the lead in resolving it. Yet  I mustask today  where is that leadership?It is very sad that the Kyoto Protocol  which is apositive achievement  has been converted by someGovernments into a political target   a rallying cry forthe worst polluters. In fact  it represents nothing morethan a small first step that must be followed up bystrong subsequent actions if the war against climatechange is to be at all effective. The scornful attitudetoward the Protocol shown by some countries willdoom the entire Framework Convention to utter failureif the current situation remains unchanged. The KyotoProtocol must be brought into effect without furtherdelay. The industrial Powers cannot continue to makethe plea of Saint Augustine  Lord  make me thyservant  but not yet awhile.'Since our people live in such close harmony withthe natural environment  we also face a host of otherpressing environmental issues. Our coral reefs aregetting a great deal of international attention partlybecause of their potential for commercial exploitation.We appreciate those possibilities and are determined topreserve our legal rights in any exploitation that takesplace.But we also appreciate the reefs as our naturalbuffers against the sea and the hosts for marineresources far beyond the regular bounty of present-dayfishing. This is more than a resource; it is a lifeline formany island countries. The serious decline in the healthof coral reefs all over the world must be reversed.Stocks of our only substantial economicresource   tuna   have seen a marked decline inrecent years. Other species and key elements of theocean ecosystem are also now imperilled as neverbefore. The Federated States of Micronesia will belobbying for an aggressive oceans resource protectionpolicy in both the regional and international arenas.Water itself  and access to it  is very much athreatened resource in our country  where we aresurrounded by the ocean but have limited fresh water.We rely upon rainwater and its collection in the lensesthat lies beneath our atolls. Every drop is precious. Wesay that a vulnerable life  such as that of a child  is likemorning dew on a taro leaf  to be handled with care sothat it does not slip away.Members may be surprised to learn that islands inthe Pacific Ocean  so often pictured in everyone'sdream of paradise  are more concerned about droughtthan any other natural threat  including typhoons. Notonly do we experience the salt-water corruption of ourfresh water and our food crops  as a result of increasedstorm activity and sea-level rise  we also now must tryto cope with droughts brought on by increasinglyunpredictable El NiÒo activity linked to climatechange.Fortunately  the world in general seems to bewaking up to the universal human requirement foraccess to adequate  clean water. The special exposureof island countries received welcome attention at therecent Third World Water Forum in Kyoto. In addition I wish to point to a very important  first-everinterregional collaboration on this vital subject  in theform of a Memorandum of Understanding recentlyconcluded between our South Pacific AppliedGeoscience Commission and the CaribbeanEnvironmental Health Institute.I have spoken much about my country's concernsbut  of course  we are not alone in these concerns. Theworld's small island developing States face largely thesame set of issues in different degrees.20For that reason  we were grateful for theinternational attention generated by the first UnitedNations Global Conference on the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  heldin Barbados in 1994. The Barbados Programme ofAction  which was the product of that Conference  hasbeen a limited success. The Conference succeeded infocusing attention on the unique set of problems oursmall island nations face. However  it seems that theinternational community has to some extent beencontent to raise awareness of the issues  while showinga waning interest in implementing specific measuresduring the years following the Conference itself.We applaud the decision to hold a follow-upconference in Mauritius in 2004  and we look forwardto a frank evaluation of the progress  or lack thereof  inimplementing the Barbados Plan of Action during thepast 10 years. It is my hope that the Mauritiusconference will afford an opportunity to regain lostmomentum.This is a landmark year for my nation. We havecompleted 17 years in a post-trusteeship politicalrelationship with the United States. By all accounts this has been a success. Never before has freeassociation been attempted on this scale.I am pleased that both my country and ourdevelopment partner  the United States  have seen fit tocontinue this relationship into the future by amendingthe treaty between us known as the Compact of FreeAssociation. As we celebrate the success that thisrenewal represents  it is proper to recall the long andeffective stewardship of our region by the UnitedNations Trusteeship Council.We are grateful for the lasting contribution of theUnited Nations system to the history of Micronesia and we look forward to continuing to work in this bodyand others in the United Nations system to reach ourcollective goals.In closing  I would like to refer to the words ofthe American President  Franklin D. Roosevelt  whoonce said If I were asked to state the great objective whichchurch and state are both demanding for the sakeof every man and woman and child in thiscountry  I would say that the great objective is amore abundant life.'I believe that the President was speaking of trueabundance  not only in a material sense  but also in thesense of the security of mind and body that comes withfreedom  opportunity and human fulfilment.We must ask ourselves whether what we arestriving for here at the United Nations is faithful to thatlofty ideal. This Organization is the greatest forum evercreated on this planet. It cannot afford to allow itsimportant role in conflict management to push asidethe even greater task of managing the conditions thatproduce those conflicts. We bring together here  underthe guidance of the Charter  for the first time in humanhistory  all kinds of resources necessary to leadmankind to a more abundant life. Let it not be said ofus later that we failed in that task."
"60",2498,"GAB",58,2003,"﻿Permit meat the outset to express to Assembly President JulianHunte the congratulations of my country  Gabon  on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly atthis session. Indeed  his election has symbolic value since  through him  Saint Lucia has become — as hehimself said — the smallest country ever to haveoccupied that high office. Is that not a perfectillustration of the universal vocation of theOrganization  which recognizes the equality and rightsof all its Members  small and large  but also theircommon responsibility in the conduct of the world’saffairs? Gabon expresses to him its wishes for successin leading this session  and we assure him of our fullcooperation. We also congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan  whopreceded Mr. Hunte in his office  on the work that heaccomplished. In addition  we thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the self-sacrifice and25courage with which he is leading the Organization atthis time of grave world turbulence.The extreme seriousness of the situation facingthe world today sometimes leads the United Nations when States are unable to carry out responsibilities thatin principle devolve to them  to assume thoseresponsibilities.As the United Nations carries out its difficultmission  its authority  unfortunately  is quite oftensorely tested  and the very lives of its personnel arethreatened. The tragic death of Sergio Vieira de Mello one of the torch-bearers of the ideals of the UnitedNations  and other staff members in Baghdad on 19August is a dreadful reminder of just how fragileinternational peace and security are. Nevertheless despite the delicate nature of the situation  theactivities of the United Nations must be pursued in Iraqto assist in the reconstruction of the country.Beyond Iraq  the future of the entire Middle Eastregion must be at the centre of all our attention. Theroad map remains  despite current threats to itsenforcement  the sole hope to restore peace betweenthe parties to the conflict and sustainable regionalbalance to the Middle East. Gabon urges the twoparties to end the violence and resume their dialogue.Despite the persistence of some hotbeds oftension  the overall situation in Africa has witnessedpositive changes. In the Democratic Republic of theCongo  the peace process has begun to be implementedwith the creation in June 2003 of a TransitionalGovernment  whose chief mission is the establishmentof new democratic institutions and preparations forelections.It goes without saying that the security andstability of the country continues to depend on that ofthe entire Great Lakes region. This is why Gabonardently desires the completion of the Arusha processin Burundi. After a period of uncertainty  the CentralAfrican Republic is also restoring peace  particularlythanks to specific pacification measures taken by thecountry’s new authorities.To complement their efforts  the Central AfricanEconomic and Monetary Community  which met inLibreville in June 2003  decided to make an ad hoccontribution of 5 billion francs CFA to the CentralAfrican Republic.For its part  Gabon has always actively workedfor peacekeeping and peace-building in Africa. Thiswas recently demonstrated again in Sâo Tomé andPrincipe  where the good offices of President Bongo andhis African peers  particularly those from the EconomicCommunity of Central African States  contributed to therestoration of constitutional order in the country.Unfortunately  these welcome events are atvariance with our inability to react promptly to somecrisis situations that jeopardize collective security andcause gross violations of human rights. We mustassume a two-fold duty today: to strengthen ourcollective means of conflict prevention and  whenthose efforts do not obtain results  to have the capacityto react swiftly to contain armed conflicts before theirescalation brings about new humanitarian disasters  aswas recently the case in the Democratic Republic of theCongo and Liberia.African countries have shown their ability tomanage crises on many occasions. But their will ismost often impeded by the scarcity of human resourcesand lack of appropriate logistical means. To facilitatethe prompt deployment of peacekeeping forces in theseregions  should we not establish  under the auspices ofthe United Nation  a partnership between Africancountries and the developed countries that providelogistical support.Because many conflicts are rooted in poverty  anyeffort to resolve them must be based on the quest forefficient solutions to the problems inherent inunderdevelopment. The Monterrey Consensus  reaffirmedduring the Johannesburg Summit  is based on therecognition that financing for development is a crucialelement for an international strategy for sustainabledevelopment. The drop in private internationalinvestment in developing countries is liable to hinderthem from truly recovering. Moreover  many of thesecountries  in particular those known as medium-incomecountries like Gabon  continue to devote hugeresources to repay external debt. Gabon remainsconvinced that only a courageous strategy to defer orcancel debt would enable the economic recovery of thecountries involved.The HIV/AIDS pandemic  which has become adevelopment problem  also deserves our attention. Thedisease is now the leading cause of death amongwomen and the young in Africa. In other words  itsmain victims are our nations’ hope. We welcome the26fact that the high-level plenary debate that took placelast week at United Nations Headquarters itselfreaffirmed the commitment of the internationalcommunity to combat this horrifying disease.The ills that the world is facing should prompt usto identify the structural causes and find the best wayto respond. This is particularly true with respect to thefight against international terrorism. One vital stage inthis process is the establishment of a legal frameworkconducive to effective international cooperation.We must finalize without delay the negotiationsto adopt a universal convention against internationalterrorism in all its forms  including the issue of theacquisition of arsenals of weapons of mass destructionby terrorist groups.The positive forces that drive our world towardsgreater integration and solidarity are increasinglyjeopardized by growing threats. Because the newchallenges of our world have a global impact  we mustrespond collectively. Only close coordination andactive multilateral cooperation will enable us to meetthem. It is within the United Nations  a high-levelforum for dialogue and cooperation  that we canachieve this objective.To do so  as we have stressed during the previoussession  we must strengthen our Organization particularly by restoring the role of the GeneralAssembly and reforming the Security Council. Weagree on the principle. May we thus have the courageand will to harmonize our views to attain this ideal ofchange and strengthen the multilateral dimension ofour Organization."
"61",2545,"GBR",58,2003,"﻿I begin by paying a tribute to Dr.Akila Al-Hashimi  a senior member of the IraqiGoverning Council  who died earlier today.I had the privilege of meeting Dr. Al-Hashimiearlier this year in London and later in Baghdad  and Iwas struck by her courage and her dedication to theIraqi people. Dr. Al-Hashimi was murdered by thosewho would deny the Iraqi people the democratic prosperous future they so richly deserve. The bestservice that we can render her memory is to defeat theterrorists and to ensure that her vision of a peaceful free Iraq prevails.Of course  we owe this service to all those whohave fallen in the cause of peace in Iraq. Sergio Vieirade Mello and the United Nations personnel who werekilled or injured in the blast in Baghdad on 19 Augustwere committed to bringing the ideals of the UnitedNations to the people of Iraq. They paid the ultimatesacrifice for their dedication. We mourn their loss  butwe will not weaken in our resolve to help the Iraqipeople rebuild their country on the principles of justiceand security.What  I think  makes Iraq so important was theway in which it tested the role and purpose of thisinstitution over more than a dozen years. Throughoutthat period  the international community remained inagreement that the regime of Saddam Hussein posed aChapter VII threat to international peace and securityby its proliferation of weapons of mass destructionprogrammes and its unparalleled defiance of the will ofthe United Nations. Yet  earlier this year  sadly  wedivided on when and what action was necessary to dealwith the Iraqi threat.Of course  I acknowledge the controversy overthe military action which the United Kingdom  theUnited States and others took and the heavyresponsibilities we now bear  but I firmly believe thatthe decisions we took were the right ones. Theauthority of the United Nations was at stake. Havinggiven Saddam Hussein’s regime a final opportunity tocomply with the United Nations  what would havehappened if we had simply turned away? Would theworld be a safer place today? Would Iraq be a betterplace today? Would the United Nations be a strongerinstitution today? The answer to each of thosequestions is no. Saddam Hussein would have beenemboldened by our failure to act; every dictator wouldhave been encouraged to follow his example; and theauthority of this United Nations would have beengravely weakened.Yet  whatever the arguments of the spring  wehave now to come together again for a commonpurpose. As the Security Council has recognized in itsthree resolutions 1472 (2003)  1483 (2003) and 1500(2003)  we have a shared interest in helping Iraqicitizens to embrace the rights and freedoms which theyhave been denied so long and for which this institutionwas founded. Yes  the security situation does presentformidable challenges. Terrorists who despise freedomare seeking to plunge Iraq into chaos. They haveinflicted terrible blows on the Iraqi people  coalitionsoldiers and international aid workers  but ultimatelythey will fail.And let us also not lose sight of what has beenachieved and what is taking shape. Saddam Hussein’sreign of terror is over. The apparatus of torture andoppression which claimed hundreds of thousands of31 lives is at an end. Instead  we have the beginnings of arepresentative Government run by Iraqis for Iraqis;new ministries providing daily services to the people; afree press; the freedom for members of all religiouscommunities to worship as they wish; hospitals andschools in operation; bustling traffic on the streets andhighways; and a start to real economic regeneration.We shall stay in Iraq as long  but only as long  asit is necessary to meet our clear responsibilities and torestore sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as wecan in an orderly manner. I hope very much that we canagree a new Security Council resolution to strengthenthe United Nations role in Iraq. In managing thistransition  we should be guided by three centralprinciples: first  the transfer of powers must reflectrealities on the ground in Iraq  particularly the need toensure security; secondly  the Iraqi institutions must besufficiently robust to take on increasing responsibilities;and thirdly  the exercise of executive powers andresponsibilities must be based on good governance involving representative Iraqi authorities and coherentconstitutional arrangements. In other words  the timetableshould be driven by the needs of the Iraqi people and theircapacity progressively to assume democratic control rather than by fixing arbitrary deadlines.Iraq is  sadly  not the only territory in the MiddleEast where the international community faces greatchallenges. Three months ago  we all had high hopesabout the work of the Quartet of the United Nations the European Union  the Russian Federation and theUnited States in Israel and the occupied territories. It istragic that these hopes were blown apart on 19 Augustby the terrorist atrocity in Jerusalem  which came onlya few hours after the terrorist atrocity against theUnited Nations in Baghdad  but the internationalcommunity has to stay united on both the means andthe ends in the Middle East. There are no alternativesto the road map and there can be no alternatives to theoutcome the entire world wishes to see — two States Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace andsecurity. This can be the only fitting memorial to thethousands who have died on both sides since thebeginning of this appalling conflict.The breadth of the issues being tackled by theUnited Nations and its agencies demonstrates thecontinued relevance of this institution. The Counter-Terrorism Committee has given the United Nations afocus for its work following  September two yearsago  but we must now build upon that work  giving theCommittee the expertise and the remit to reinforce thecapacity of Member States to tackle and to overcometerrorism.We also know that proliferation is one of thegreatest threats we face alongside terrorism. Muchgood work on proliferation is being done by UnitedNations agencies  particularly the International AtomicEnergy Agency  but it is extraordinary that the SecurityCouncil itself has not addressed the issue ofproliferation for over 10 years. In our judgement  it istime that it did.Problems of internal conflict  on the other hand are regularly on the Security Council’s agenda. TheUnited Nations has unrivalled expertise and experiencein this area and has achieved great things in countriesas far apart as East Timor and Sierra Leone  but nation-building is a collaborative effort  requiring theresources and commitment of Member States if theUnited Nations peace-building is to be effective. Wetherefore need new mechanisms to help preventconflicts and then to help States before they collapse.We must also make a real success of theMillennium Declaration. We have to overcome thesetback of Cancún and secure a positive outcome to theDoha Round.These and other shared problems requirecollective responses  as our Secretary-General soeloquently said here in his speech on Tuesday. A key tothis is to ensure that the United Nations itself remainsan effective global forum capable of delivering results.The Secretary-General posed some difficult questionstwo days ago. I welcome his initiative to seek theadvice of a distinguished group to make proposals onreform. I welcome  too  his parallel commitment tomodernizing the United Nations and its agencies.For our part  the United Kingdom is committed tomaking the Security Council more representative. Theissue is not whether but how to do this. A bigger andmore representative Council  however  will not of itselfmake it easier to make the tough choices which it hasto face so often. The most important ingredient is thepolitical will and determination of the members of theCouncil to take effective action.The most important part of the Secretary-General’s speech on Tuesday was about the choicesnow confronting the United Nations. He was rightabout those. We have indeed come to a fork in the road.32 Down one route lies a world in which the UnitedNations strengthens its role as the collective instrumentfor protecting our peace and security; down the otherroute lies a world in which collective action becomes asynonym for “inaction”. We must not take this secondroute. The Secretary-General’s speech was a challengeto all of us. We all share a world in which internationalterrorists strike down the innocent  regardless of faithor nationality  and we are all less secure when weaponsof mass destruction are in reckless hands. We do nothave the luxury simply of rejecting unilateralism  whileproposing no multilateral means of confronting anddealing with these threats.The British Government is profoundlycommitted  as it always has been  to the ideals of theUnited Nations. To us  the importance of thisOrganization has always been its ability to put thosehigh ideals into effect. We will work wholeheartedlywith the Secretary-General and the internationalcommunity to ensure that the United Nations retainsand strengthens both its idealism and its effectiveness."
"62",2569,"GEO",58,2003,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. Allow me also to express our heartfeltappreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan for his outstandingleadership during the previous session. I would alsolike to pay tribute to Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello andthe United Nations staff members who fell victim tocowardly and blind rage in Baghdad. The dreadfulterrorist attack perpetrated against those messengers ofpeace once again highlighted the danger we face inmany corners of the world.In recent years  the United Nations and the entireworld community have come up against challenges thatthreaten the very basis of the Organization and ourcollective efforts towards global peace and security.International terrorism  a threat with a globaldimension  affects each and every one of us. However it has become evident that many of the newdemocracies are particularly vulnerable to that threat.Scarce material resources and the lack of qualifiedpersonnel undermine their efforts  highlighting theneed for further intensified global cooperation.Georgia is no exception when it comes to threatsposed by international terrorism. However  despiteexisting difficulties  and with the active support andassistance of our partners  especially the United States we have made substantial progress. Georgiasuccessfully completed its anti-criminal and anti-terrorist operation in the Pankisi Gorge. We have freedthat territory from illegal armed groups and have seizeda considerable number of arms and ammunition. I canunequivocally state today that the Pankisi Gorge  which9has been freed of every illegally armed person  nolonger poses any threat to Georgia or its neighbours.However  unless the root cause of the Pankisi Gorgeproblem is settled  namely  the conflict in Chechnya we cannot consider the problem eliminated. The lessonto be drawn from this experience is that the fightagainst terrorism  in all its complexity  will besuccessful only if carried out through concertedinternational efforts. A single quick-fix operation cancause the problem to resurface at a later stage.Many of the speakers who spoke before mehighlighted the importance of tackling the threat ofinternational terrorism in all its aspects. We cannot butshare that notion. Protracted problems  and inparticular unresolved conflicts that result in thecreation of uncontrolled territories  have become abreeding ground for terrorism. It is only a matter oftime until we witness greater ties being forged betweenseparatist leaders and terrorists.A vivid example of that is the conflict inAbkhazia  Georgia. That territory  which is under thecontrol of a separatist regime  has turned into a safehaven for criminals  traffickers in drugs and humanbeings  illegal arms dealers and terrorist groups. Thenotorious Shamil Basayev  who was recently includedon the Counter-Terrorism Committee’s terrorist list  hasre-established himself as a friend of the separatistauthorities and is maintaining active links with theterrorist groups in Abkhazia. In the near future  we willprovide the Counter-Terrorism Committee withrelevant information on individuals involved interrorist activities in that region of Georgia.The record of the United Nations in reaching acomprehensive settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia Georgia  has been less than satisfactory. After morethan 10 years of United Nations involvement  we havenot come even a single step closer to a settlement.Blatant violations of human rights and ethnic cleansingof the Georgian population in Abkhazia continueunabated. Despite numerous calls  we have failed tocorrect even the fundamental flaws in the entire UnitedNations-led peace process.We welcome the fact that  since the last session ofthe General Assembly  the Geneva process has gained anew dimension. We are hopeful that that will give newimpetus to the peace process. I would like to stress thatthis relatively new development is still fragile and thatit should be aimed at achieving results  and not at theprocess itself. We would also like to underline theimportance of the recently held summit of theCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  whichreinforced the previous decisions of CIS heads ofStates putting forth restrictive regulations on politicaland economic cooperation and contact with Abkhazia Georgia.However  despite those positive steps  very littlehas changed on the ground. In that regard  I amthinking in particular of the illegal unilateral actionsundertaken by representatives of the Russian side  andespecially by leaders of regional authorities  thatsignificantly damage the peace process. The railwaylink between Sochi and Sukhumi is still operatingunhindered. Despite our appeals at the last session ofthe General Assembly  the wholesale granting ofRussian citizenship to the Abkhaz population has neverslowed. Russian passports issued to the inhabitants ofthe secessionist region have already fallen into handsof terrorists  who are making the best use of freepassage in and out of Russia through the Abkhaz andOssetian sections of the Georgian-Russian border where our neighbour unilaterally imposes a visa-freeregime.The illegal acquisition of property — includingpossessions of internally displaced persons — inAbkhazia  Georgia  by State bodies  legal entities andindividuals continues. Needless to say  such acts arebeing carried out in flagrant violation of internationallaw and represent an infringement of Georgia’ssovereignty. They run counter to the Georgian law thatdeclares any transaction with the separatist regime nulland void.The illegal presence of the Russian military basein Gudauta is yet another element that is exacerbatingthe situation in Abkhazia. Georgia insists that thecommitment undertaken in accordance with the Treatyon Conventional Armed Forces in Europe concerningthe removal of that base be implemented expeditiouslyand transparently.But there must still be hope — hope that we willnot again fail the 300 000 internally displaced personsand refugees  whose patience is running thin. Effortsmust be redoubled to persuade the Abkhaz side toaccept the so-called Boden Document  on thedistribution of constitutional competences betweenTbilisi and Sokhumi  as a basis for politicalnegotiations.10We have repeatedly noted the failure of thepeacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States to provide security for returnees. Infact  those forces — which do not even have a UnitedNations mandate — have done no more than sustain thestatus quo  virtually functioning as border guardsbetween Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia. We cannothope for any improvement in the situation unless theUnited Nations takes upon itself the launching  in aninternationalized format  of a full-scale peacekeepingoperation in Abkhazia. It is through an increased roleon the part of the United Nations and through the willof the international community that the unheedingAbkhaz separatists can be forced to compromise.Failing that  the Government of Georgia will have noother choice but to request the Security Council toresort to the measures envisaged under Chapter VII ofthe United Nations Charter.The Secretary-General and many other worldleaders have duly recognized that the United Nations ispassing though one of the most critical phases of itshistory. New global realities have made it clear thatimmediate measures ought to be undertaken if we wantto ensure the sustainability of the United Nations andto strengthen the confidence of Member States in theOrganization.In his statement before the forty-seventh sessionof the General Assembly  in 1992  PresidentShevardnadze of Georgia stated:“There is no need to fear reforms whenreforms are so necessary  especially  in our view in the two interrelated fields of peacekeeping andnation-building in the newly independent States.”(A/47/PV.12  p.36)Those sentiments have been duly echoed during thecurrent Assembly session. We should be courageousenough to recognize that reform of the United Nationsis essential for the interests of each of us  as well as forour collective good.It is our belief that Member States can rallyaround the Secretary-General in his call for the creationof a high-level panel of eminent personalities chargedwith a multitude of tasks aimed at reforming the UnitedNations. I reaffirm Georgia’s support for expansion ofthe Security Council. We join the calls to grantGermany and Japan permanent seats on the Counciland to increase the number of non-permanent members.Moreover  the decision-making process within theCouncil should be made more transparent anddemocratic to ensure that the adoption of necessaryresolutions does not fall prey to special  narrowinterests.As we continue to collectively witness changingglobal realities  the Government of Georgia welcomesthe increasing role of regional structures in achievingthe fundamental objectives set forth by the UnitedNations. The efforts of European and Euro-Atlanticstructures in the Balkans is just one successful examplein that regard. Another vivid example is Afghanistan where NATO has taken a leading role in the peace-building operation. That organization’s role willincrease further as a result of its recent expansion.Security issues have become a serious concern for suchregional organizations as the Black Sea EconomicCooperation Organization and the GUUAMParticipating States — Georgia  Ukraine  Uzbekistan Azerbaijan and Republic of Moldova. Here  we shouldlike to appeal to Member States for support for theGUUAM’s efforts to be granted observer status in theGeneral Assembly.The Millennium Summit and the decisions takenthere remain  in our view  one of the most significantachievements of the United Nations. The consensusachieved both at the Monterrey and the JohannesburgSummits are road maps for the implementation of theMillennium Development Goals. The Government ofGeorgia supports the objectives and strategies set forthin both outcome documents  considering it imperativethat the international community remain on course.Globalization is becoming an everyday reality.Advances in modern technologies are making thatprocess irreversible. However  it is up to the UnitedNations to take a more active role in guaranteeingequitable distribution of resources among all nations ofthe world. It is through increased cooperation  throughthe streamlining of actions within the United Nationsand its bodies  and through the establishment of newpartnerships that the Organization must prevail inachieving global sustainable development.Despite rapidly changing global realities  onething remains constant: there is a greater need and agreater demand for the United Nations. We remainhopeful that common sense and a common vision of thefuture will prevail in this unique international body.For our part  we are prepared to do our utmost towardsthat end."
"63",2616,"GHA",58,2003,"﻿The past two years have beenyears of near apocalyptic ordeal for the world and thisgreat Organization. In rapid succession  the world andthis Organization have been caught in what can only bedescribed as a crossfire of terrorism  violence and wars.The uncertainties resulting from these situations are yetto be dispelled. Much of the world is still in the dark groping for a glimpse of what the future direction ofinternational relations and this Organization will be.The recent unwarranted attacks against the UnitedNations headquarters and personnel in Baghdad  Iraq should be roundly condemned. They should not breakthe will of this Organization to continue to providehumanitarian assistance and relief to the people of Iraq.We in Ghana still believe in the United Nations asthe global repository of humankind’s aspiration. Webelieve that the problems of the twenty-first centurycannot be addressed without universal commitment tomultilateralism spearheaded by the United Nations. Werecommend  however  that fairness  firmness  humanityand a sense of balance must characterize UnitedNations responses to all events of a similar nature irrespective of where such events occur  if thisOrganization is to enhance its credibility and ensure itsrelevance in a sustained manner.Living in the West African subregion  which hasexperienced more than its fair share of conflicts  mycountrymen are familiar with the negative effects ofconflicts  and the pain of insecurity. They also knowthe importance of multilateral efforts in conflictmanagement. Hence  for more than 40 years  Ghanahas demonstrated commitment to international conflictprevention and resolution and peacekeeping missionsaround the world  under the auspices of the UnitedNations  and now the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS). The latest is the country’sparticipation in the ECOWAS Peace Force(ECOFORCE)  in Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia.Africa accepts its responsibility for resolving thecontinent’s internal conflicts. Today  there is no doubtthat the nations of Africa are rising to this challenge.But there is also no doubt that the continent suffersmassive shortcomings in financing and technologicalresources. This is why the international community especially the United Nations  under its Charterobligations  must continue to support Africa in itsefforts to maintain peace. It is therefore hoped thatSecurity Council consideration of Africa’s conflictswill yield adequate  practical and timely support toresolve them.In my current capacity as Chairman of ECOWAS I wish to acknowledge the valuable support of thevarious Governments as well as internationalorganizations  which have contributed to the efforts ofthe Community to achieve peace and stabilize thesubregion. With this help  the Community issucceeding in resolving conflicts that have engulfedCôte d’Ivoire  Liberia  Sierra Leone and other nations.All of them are now  thankfully  on the way to stabilityand normality. I therefore seize this opportunity toexpress the appreciation of the Community and myselfto France  the United Kingdom and the United States ofAmerica  as well as the European Union and the UnitedNations  under the leadership of the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  to name just a few of those who haveprovided substantial assistance.While ECOWAS fully appreciates the support ofour friends  it must nevertheless appeal for some moreresources from this Organization and the internationalcommunity to enable it to consolidate the peace andnormalization process. It might be necessary to stressthat  in some instances within the subregion  post-conflict peace-building efforts have failed  mainlybecause the problems involved were not addressed in asystematic  sustained and holistic manner. In the main such problems include the disarmament demobilization and reintegration of combatants intoregular society. ECOWAS therefore appeals for theassistance needed for their effective management.Yet another serious continuing menace is theprevalent illicit trade in small arms and light weaponsin the subregion. In this regard  we note thecommendable progress made by the internationalcommunity in addressing this menace through theUnited Nations Programme of Action to Prevent Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons. The truth  however  is that morevigorous and resourceful effort is needed to succeed.The Human Development Report 2003 exposesthe tragedy that besets sub-Saharan Africa  and this isthe most suitable platform to highlight it. The reportstates that the rest of the world has left sub-SaharanAfrica behind  and that it will take 150 years for ourregion to achieve the Millennium Development Goalsthat Member States of this Organization had hoped toachieve by 2015. The report indicates that: “Unlessthings improve  it would take sub-Saharan Africa until2129 to achieve universal primary education  until2147” — more than a century later than hoped — “tohalve extreme poverty  and until 2165 to cut childmortality by two thirds. For hunger  no date can be setbecause the region’s situation continues to worsen.”This is the century of the global village. How cansub-Saharan Africa  with more than 400 millionpeople  be condemned to such a fate? Clearly  this mustnot be acceptable for the globalization process. This iswhy the international community  particularly theindustrialized nations  should appreciate the urgency ofthe situation and offer commensurate partnership andassistance to the African Union and its initiative  theNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) to relaunch the continent’s development.The current leadership of the continent hasresolved to nurture Africa back to prosperity within theframework of the NEPAD. Good governance —characterized by democratic constitutional rule; therule of law; respect for human rights and propertyrights; accountable government and its recognition andintercourse with civil organizations; freedom ofexpression; private-sector promotion; religioustolerance; eradication of illiteracy; and promotion ofgender balance and children’s rights — is fastbecoming the order of the day throughout Africa.Indeed  good governance is an article of faith of theAfrican Union today.Economically  the African Union is calling forpartnerships  both within and outside the continent  topool capital  technological and managerial ideas  andalso markets  to promote and fast track thedevelopment of Africa into the mainstream of theglobal market.At this stage  may I be permitted to express somereservations on the topical issue of world trade? It mustbe recognized that even as globalization is engulfing allthe corners of the world  in such a manner that no partcan opt out  free trade and competition  which are thehallmarks of the global market  can prove inimical anddisastrous to most nations  particularly the developingand least developed countries. This will be so unlessthe process of globalization is properly and sensitivelymanaged.The reality of the situation is that most of theleast developed countries are in Africa  especially sub-Saharan Africa. At the current stage of development most of Africa is limited to exporting raw minerals andagricultural commodities. This means that unless thedeveloped parts of the world remove subsidies for theiragricultural and mineral sectors  Africa cannot becompetitive. Indeed  Africa’s equivalent sectors may bedestroyed with dumping from the advanced parts of theworld. It is also being seriously suggested that  even asthe World Trade Organization (WTO) recognizes thatAfrica must be accorded a status of transition  or aspecial status for a carefully calculated period  theWTO does not seem to be propagating this necessityenough to give practical effect to it. The failure ofCancún bears witness to this. The World TradeOrganization must  therefore  do its homework well tocarry the poor nations with it. A combination of tradeand aid must be used to assist the African Union and itscomponent nations and to nurture their economies intocompetitive resourcefulness. This is the way toempower Africa and get it into the mainstream of theworld market  without adding to the hardships of thealready marginalized people of the continent.This being a session devoted to the considerationof the biennial budget for 2004-2005  we hope that allMember States will work together positively to ensurethat adequate funding is provided for all prioritizedmandates for implementation  including those for thedevelopment and stability of Africa. In this regard  wewelcome the recent establishment of the Office of theSpecial Adviser on Africa to the Secretary-General and look forward to the positive contribution which theOffice will make to meet the numerous challenges onthe continent.My delegation is happy with the Secretary-General’s renewed efforts to reform aspects of thisOrganization’s operations and appreciates his challengeto Member States to make a bold effort towards thisend. In this regard  we assure him of our full supportduring this session for the adoption and implementationof his renewed vision  and we endorse his reportentitled “Strengthening the United Nations: an agendafor further change” (A/57/387 and Corr.1).We also wish to reiterate the imperative need forthe Security Council to be reformed  in order to ensurethat it carries out its Charter obligations moreeffectively in the full confidence of Member States. Inthis regard  we subscribe wholly to the Non-AlignedMovement’s position on the question of an increase inthe membership of the Security Council. We also12endorse Africa’s claim to have at least two permanentseats.We sincerely hope that the Organization will beempowered to assume a central role in the currentefforts to normalize the situation in the Middle East especially in Iraq and Palestine. The strengthening ofthe Organization to provide this leadership willreinvigorate it to survive this century and promote thecause of peace and security in the world.Let me conclude by thanking your predecessorfor having ably guided the deliberations of the GeneralAssembly through what was by all accounts aparticularly difficult year. We are also happy to see youin the Presidency. We are confident that the GeneralAssembly could not be in more competent hands andwe wish you well.I thank you and may God bless us all."
"64",2662,"GIN",58,2003,"﻿On19 August 2003  the international community took ablow to the body in Baghdad in odious acts that causedthe tragic loss of approximately 20 United Nationsofficials  including the lamented Sergio Vieira deMello  Special Representative of the Secretary-General. By attacking a symbol as prestigious as theUnited Nations  the forces of evil intended to destroythe firm resolve of our Organization to carry out itsmission of safeguarding international peace andsecurity.Those unspeakable crimes demonstrate onceagain the intensity of terrorism in all its forms andunderscore the vital need for the internationalcommunity to reaffirm its solidarity in order to find theways and means to stamp out this scourge  whichremains one of the greatest threats to humankind’sharmonious development. My delegation energeticallycondemns those vile acts and pays tribute to thememory of the victims. It renews to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  the sincere compassion ofthe people and Government of Guinea  particularly ofHis Excellency General Lansana Conté  President ofthe Republic of Guinea.My delegation also wishes to take thisopportunity to express its deep gratitude to Mr. Annanfor the courage and the effectiveness with which he isleading the destiny of our Organization. The Republicof Guinea will be unstinting in its efforts to make itscontribution to the influence of the United Nations which  it hardly needs to be said  remains the primaryframework for concerted action in the conduct ofinternational relations.I wish to take this opportunity to convey mydelegation’s warmest congratulations to you  Mr.President on your well-deserved election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession. Appreciating your great ability  there can be nodoubt that you will skilfully follow up the work of yourpredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  whose dedication and skillwere greatly appreciated in the course of the previoussession.Africa  where more than one third of thepopulation lives in absolute poverty  continues  alas  tobe the scene of fratricidal wars  whose negative effectsundermine the development policies of its States.Notwithstanding that bitter state of affairs  markedprogress has been made in extinguishing hotbeds oftension. Hope is reborn in West Africa.Sierra Leone is being stabilized  thanks to theactive support of the international community  but also and above all  thanks to the patriotism of SierraLeoneans and the determination of their leaders toclose the book on war. My country  while expressing itsappreciation for the respect shown for the criteria forthe withdrawal of the United Nations Mission in SierraLeone (UNAMSIL)  takes the view that the success ofthat plan also hinges on increased assistance to SierraLeone  as well as the effective restoration of Stateauthority throughout the territory.In Liberia  with the departure of PresidentCharles Taylor on 11 August  a new era is becomingapparent for that country  scarred by 14 years offratricidal war  which augurs well for the subregion asa whole — particularly the Mano River basin  whoseoverall development has long been jeopardized. Wewish to pay tribute to the efforts of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and theUnited Nations that have made it possible to secure aceasefire and to achieve the Comprehensive PeaceAgreement in Accra  thus opening the way for theestablishment of a Government of transition andnational reconciliation. My delegation appeals to theinternational community for effective support for theimplementation of the Accra accord  so that Liberianscan finally be reconciled among themselves and cantackle the reconstruction of their country in reneweddemocracy.7The joint action undertaken by ECOWAS  theUnited Nations and the development partners to deploythe multinational force and ensure the maintenance ofpeace in Liberia should be supported and welcomed.The establishment of this stabilization force has provedvital to facilitate the implementation of theComprehensive Peace Agreement  to make it possibleto carry out a disarmament  demobilization andreintegration programme and to promote the return ofrefugees and national reconciliation.However  my country remains convinced that theperpetrators of hateful crimes must answer for theiracts. That is why we support unreservedly the decisionsof the Special Court for Sierra Leone in its fightagainst impunity. That is a moral and politicalrequirement.In Côte d’Ivoire  my delegation urges all theparties to pursue dialogue to implement effectively theLinas-Marcoussis Agreement  and thus achievenational reconciliation.In Guinea-Bissau  recent developments havemade even more fragile a situation that was alreadyprecarious because of years of political instability andeconomic crisis. My delegation appeals for the creationof better conditions for a rapid return to normalconstitutional life  which is vital to the recovery of thatfraternal country.Guinea attaches great importance to therestoration of lasting peace in our subregion. It haspaid a heavy price in terms of instability  whosenegative consequences have impeded its progress.Despite a particularly difficult economic situationmarked by the drastic drop in bauxite and aluminiumprices and the soaring price of petroleum  Guineacontinues to tackle the burden of refugees anddisplaced persons. I wish to reiterate the GuineanGovernment’s appeal to the donor community forincreased assistance in managing refugees anddisplaced persons and for strengthening the capacity ofour country to pursue its programme to combat povertywhile consolidating its democratic achievements.I would like to address the situation in the GreatLakes region  where there are promising prospects. Inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo  despite thehumanitarian crisis in the eastern part  considerableprogress has been made  particularly in the context ofthe disengagement of foreign armed forces and currentdemobilization and reintegration operations. We hopethat the Transitional Government of National Unitywill do its utmost to preserve the territorial integrity ofthe country and to promote a return to normalconstitutional life.My delegation appeals to the internationalcommunity to support the United Nations OrganizationMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo(MONUC) with the resources necessary to carry out itsmandate  which has been enhanced by Security Councilresolution 1493 (2003).In Burundi  my delegation welcomes theencouraging results in the implementation of theArusha Agreement and calls on all parties to put an endto hostilities to strengthen the peace  which is stillfragile  and to promote humanitarian assistance.In the Central African Republic  my delegationappreciates the commitment of the new authorities topromote the return to constitutional legality in thecontext of consensual management.In the Horn of Africa  the permanent and bindingcommitment of Ethiopia and Eritrea concerning thedelimitation of borders is a prelude to the return topeace between the two countries. With regard toSomalia  my delegation hopes that the MbagathiConference in Kenya will make it possible to overcomepast contradictions and restore comprehensiveeverlasting peace.I cannot fail to address the thorny question of theWestern Sahara  which has mobilized the energies ofthe international community for decades. The Republicof Guinea  which has always advocated a peacefulsettlement of the issue  remains convinced of the urgentneed for a political settlement under the auspices theUnited Nations — the only body that can guarantee afair and lasting solution that is mutually acceptable toall parties.The future of our continent is closely bound upwith international peace and security  and so we willcontinue to express our profound concern aboutconflicts that cause upheavals in other parts of theworld.First  in the Middle East  the appointment ofPrime Minister Mahmoud Abbas  the publication of theQuartet’s road map and the establishment of aunilateral cease-fire by the Palestinian armed groupshad given us grounds for hope. These hopes 8unfortunately  are threatened by the resumption of thecycle of violence. We have together a historic duty tosalvage peace. The international community and theQuartet must do everything to give a fresh impetus tothe dialogue between the parties. For their part Palestinians and Israelis have the obligation to honourtheir respective commitments  in order to win mutualtrust.My delegation is convinced that a comprehensiveand lasting settlement of the crisis in the Middle Eastnecessarily involves tackling the Lebanese and Syrianaspects and the implementation of the relevantresolutions of the Security Council. Guinea  which hasalways been at the forefront in defending legitimatestruggles for just causes  hails the historic role ofPresident Yasser Arafat in restoring the inalienablerights of the martyred people of Palestine. Here wereiterate our firm opposition to any attempt toundermine his political or physical integrity  and onceagain send him our sympathy and support. We alsoencourage the new Prime Minister of Palestine  Mr.Ahmed Qorei  to do his utmost to create favourableconditions for dialogue aiming at a durable resolutionof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.On the question of Iraq  which is going through aphase that is crucial for its future  my delegationencourages the United Nations to continue andstrengthen its peace mission and its mission ofreconstruction and humanitarian assistance so that theIraqis can quickly take charge of their country’s destinyin unity and democracy.With regard to Afghanistan  the internationalcommunity needs to step up its assistance  particularlyin the area of security and development assistance  soas to give support to the Transitional Administration  inimplementation of the Bonn Agreement.My delegation urges on the Korean peninsula theparties to pursue their efforts to achieve the peacefuland independent reunification of the two Koreas and tosettle the nuclear issue by dialogue.The Guinean Government reaffirms itscommitment to the principle of a single China. Itwelcomes the efforts being made by the People’sRepublic of China to safeguard international peace andsecurity.Concerning the crisis in Cyprus  whose resolutionis still bogged down  in spite of the Secretary-General’sdetermination  we appeal to the parties to showpolitical will  so that they may return to the negotiatingtable on the basis of the revised plan.Poverty  armed conflicts  weapons of massdestruction  terrorism  organized transnational crimeand violations of human rights and internationalhumanitarian law  continue to be major obstacles topeace  security and development. Safeguardinginternational peace and security depends on ourcommitment to eradicating the proliferation of smallarms and light weapons  as well as mercenaryactivities  all of which fuel conflicts  particularly inAfrica.This is all the more true since in July  in this veryHall  Member States were able  at the First BiennialMeeting of States to Consider the Implementation ofthe United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Armsand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  were able togauge the devastating effects of light weapons  whosemajor victims  unfortunately  continue to be womenand children. My delegation reiterates the appeal by theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) for adequate financial assistance toeffectively implement the moratorium on small armsand light weapons. It also calls for effectiveimplementation of Security Council resolution 1467(2003)  adopted at the end of the workshop organizedby my country when it held the presidency of theCouncil in March 2003  on the theme “Proliferation ofsmall arms and light weapons and mercenary activities:threats to peace and security in West Africa.”Mindful of their primary responsibilities for therecovery of the continent  African leaders arecontinuing their efforts in implementing the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)effectively. The commitments undertaken at the secondsummit of African Union heads of State at Maputo arepart of this process. Guinea welcomes the support ofthe international community  particularly the G-8countries for the African Union and its programme NEPAD. We also welcome the initiatives taken bydevelopment partners to increase public assistance relieve debt and provide for improved access tomarkets.Guinea welcomes also the useful arrangementsplanned by the United States  the European Union andJapan to combat the HIV/AIDS  malaria and9tuberculosis pandemics  as well as food insecurity.These efforts  which we encourage  were undoubtedlystrengthened by the recent agreement at the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) enabling the poorestcountries to have access to generic drugs and thus totackle the health tragedy of 6 million deaths annuallyas a result of those three pandemics alone.My delegation  however  regrets the lack ofconsensus at Cancún at the Fifth MinisterialConference of the WTO. We remain convinced that theinternational community will continue the debate aiming at further integration of the weaker economiesinto the world trading system. We need to do ourutmost to ensure that globalization is better managedand less iniquitous. The common good must be at theheart of our concerns.The path ahead of us is still long and full ofpitfalls. The midterm review shows that  at least as faras Africa is concerned  there is not great optimism abutachieving the objectives of the MillenniumDeclaration. We hope that the spirit of solidarity whichis still developing at the level of the internationalcommunity can be translated into tangible acts andgalvanize everyone to action  so that future generationswill acknowledge our struggle to ensure thedevelopment of humankind. In order to achieve this we must reaffirm our unity and promote multilaterismto enable our common Organization to tackle thechallenges of peace  security and social and economicprogress.The latest developments in the internationalsituation have demonstrated the extent to which theUnited Nations is still the unique framework forconsultation and concerted action in the managementof world affairs. Strengthening the role and capacitiesof the United Nations is therefore more than everessential in order to provide fair  lasting and equitablesolutions to issues of major importance. My delegationappreciates the efforts to reform the United Nationsand revitalize the work of the General Assembly.In this regard  we support the recommendation ofthe Secretary-General concerning the setting up of ahigh-level panel to propose ways to strengthen theUnited Nations by reforming its institutions.All these steps to help improve the effectivenessof the Organization must of course be underpinned by agenuine reform of the Security Council so as to makeits membership more representative. This will make itpossible to enhance its transparency and give all States large and small  the opportunity to find a voice thereand thus make their due contribution to the building ofa renewed world."
"65",2701,"GMB",58,2003,"﻿Please allow me to conveymy delegation’s warmest congratulations toMr. Julian Hunte on his election to the high office ofPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession. I am sure that his vast experience on theinternational scene will be brought to bear on the workof this session  and help direct it with ease to asuccessful conclusion. The fifty-eighth sessionpromises to be rich in substance  and may also prove tobe a watershed in our bid to make the United Nationsresponsive to the needs of the peoples of the world inthe new millennium. I wish to assure the President ofmy delegation’s fullest cooperation in the discharge ofhis onerous responsibilities.In the same vein  let me also congratulate the out-going President  Mr. Jan Kavan  for his laudable effortsduring the fifty-seventh session. The dynamicSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  also deservescommendation for another productive year of service tothe Organization  a year that was fraught withdifficulties and incredible challenges. Thanks to hisleadership  we have  by and large  been able to weatherthe storm.We were all devastated  however  by the bombingof the offices of the United Nations in Baghdad  whichclaimed the lives of so many people. May it neverrecur — please God — but it shows that we mustremain united in our resolve to fight terrorism. Let meseize this opportunity to express once again toMr. Kofi Annan and his staff  as well as to the relativesof the victims  the heartfelt condolences of thepeople of The Gambia. We pay homage toMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues  who losttheir lives  and we mourn the tragic loss of a highly-acclaimed international civil servant at the hands ofterrorists. In wishing the injured a speedy recovery  wepray that the souls of all those who died rest in perfectpeace. My delegation strongly urges that that cowardlyact should in no way weaken the resolve of the UnitedNations in fulfilling its obligations to the people ofIraq.Resolution 1373 (2001) was adopted unanimouslyby the Security Council following the attacks of11 September  and the majority of Member States including my own  have embarked on implementing itssalient provisions. We have ratified the majorinternational instruments on terrorism and furthermore  have enacted domestic legislation toimplement them. Let me state that  in spite of ourmodest achievements in that regard  internationalcooperation and technical assistance remain critical tothe success of our future implementation efforts.The Counter-Terrorism Committee’s assistanceunit must strengthen the coordination of its technicalassistance portfolio in order to have greater impact. Inthat regard  we welcome the commitment of the G-8 toprovide capacity-building and technical assistance topriority countries. The translation of declarations ofcommitment into concrete action is the only guaranteeof making meaningful headway to counter terrorism.Apart from the recent terrorist attacks against theUnited Nations in Baghdad  other such incidents inIndonesia  Kenya  the Russian Federation  Moroccoand Saudi Arabia  coming in the wake of the attacks of11 September  are reminders of the enormity of thetasks ahead.The fifty-eighth session of the General Assemblyhas been convened at a time when our approaches tothe management of global issues have come undersharp scrutiny. Those issues are the unfinished businessof the preceding millennium. The United Nations —the premier  overarching venue for multilateralism —cannot but be the only vehicle through which theworld’s peace and security problems can be solved.The recent events in Afghanistan  Iraq and elsewhereonly serve to underscore the need for the nations of theworld to strengthen  not weaken  multilateralism. Weshall never achieve global peace  security andprosperity without working together in a forum such asthe one provided by the United Nations  a forum that isall-inclusive and which permits each and everynation — big or small  rich or poor — to expound onmatters of concern to them. The ideals and principlesthat were the basis of the founding of the Organizationare as relevant today as they were 58 years ago. Let ustherefore demonstrate our commitment tomultilateralism by always turning to the United33Nations. My delegation therefore urges all MemberStates to maintain confidence in the United Nationsand to have recourse to the Organization for thepeaceful resolution of conflicts and the settlement ofdisputes.While terrorism poses a real threat tointernational peace and security  other violent conflictscontinue to rage around the world  leaving death destruction and desolation in their wake. The situationin the Mano River Union region remains volatile as Ispeak. Even though former President Charles Taylor ofLiberia has left the scene  as was required of him  andthere appears to be some laudable progress towardsreinvigorating the democratic process in that country we should be under no illusion as to the extremefragility of the situation in Liberia  and indeed withinthe West African subregion. We commend all theparties that recently signed the Peace Agreement inAccra  Ghana  for their determination and patience  andurge them to do all in their power to stay the course.That would also have a salutary effect on the situationin neighbouring Sierra Leone  where we note withsatisfaction the consolidation of the peace process.However  the problem of conflicts in West Africacontinues to be compounded by the illicit flow of smallarms and light weapons  as well as by roving bands ofmercenaries. International efforts could serve theregion best by developing comprehensive disarmament demobilization and rehabilitation programmes thattarget militias and that are region-specific rather thancountry-specific. We must endeavour to address theissue of the illicit trade in small arms and lightweapons with greater determination. An arrangementsimilar to the Kimberley Process in blood diamonds iswhat is urgently required to effectively stem the illicitflow of small arms and light weapons. My Governmentstrongly supports any measure that would treat asaccomplices to war crimes and crimes againsthumanity illegal brokers who knowingly supply armsand weapons to militias and other insurgents in WestAfrica. Conflict zones elsewhere in Africa that tell asimilar story should also be assisted in that manner.We warmly congratulate our brothers in Sudan onthe recent signing of the Naivasha peace accord  whichpromises to bring the long-drawn fratricidal conflict inthat country to an end.Meanwhile  my Government continues to play itspart in the search for solutions to the problems of peaceand security in Africa. We participate actively withinthe context of the initiatives of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) tocontribute to the subregion’s collective efforts in thatarea. My Government  under the wise leadership ofPresident Jammeh  has in the past contributed  and willcontribute in the future  to subregional efforts to keepthe peace in West Africa. We have continuouslyparticipated in the United Nations Mission in SierraLeone (UNAMSIL) since its inception. We stand readyto contribute our own modest share to any other UnitedNations peacekeeping operations designed for theWest Africa subregion  as we are doing now under theECOWAS Military Mission in Liberia (ECOMIL). Inthat regard  we welcome the adoption of SecurityCouncil resolution 1509 (2003)  establishing the UnitedNations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).I just made mention of the unfinished business ofthe preceding millennium. Those are thematic issues ofpolitical exclusion  disenfranchisement  economicexclusion and abject poverty. All affect the greatermajority of humankind. They also give rise to all theurgent situations that the world is faced with today —situations of conflict and civil strife; in short  of theabsence of peace.A peculiar situation of exclusion was created byGeneral Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) on25 October 1971  which relates  through its directeffects  to Taiwan. From 1949 to 1971  the Republic ofChina (Taiwan) was a bona fide member of the UnitedNations  recognized by the comity of nations. If theRepublic of China (Taiwan) could be a member of theUnited Nations then  why could it not be a membernow? The General Assembly adopted resolution 2758(XXVI)  which addressed only the question of therepresentation of the People’s Republic of China at theUnited Nations and related organizations. It did notdecide that Taiwan was  or should be  a part of thePeople’s Republic of China. Nor did it confer on thePeople’s Republic of China the right to represent theRepublic of China (Taiwan) or the 23 millionTaiwanese people in the United Nations and relatedorganizations. Resolution 2758 (XXVI) has since beenmisused to justify the exclusion of Taiwan from theUnited Nations. That runs counter to the claim by theGovernment of the People’s Republic of China that itrepresents the interests of all Chinese  not to mentionthose Taiwanese who are in the Republic of China(Taiwan). If we are to comprehensively deal with the34problems engendered by exclusion in whatever form ittakes  I call on the international community to revisitthat issue urgently.My Government appreciates the special attentionthat Guinea-Bissau has received from the SecurityCouncil  especially through the Council’s Ad HocWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolutionin Africa. We also commend the remarkable efforts ofthe Economic and Social Council’s Ad Hoc AdvisoryGroup on Guinea-Bissau. As Chairperson of the Groupof Friends of Guinea-Bissau  my Governmentacknowledges the groundswell of support and goodwill that Guinea-Bissau enjoys from the Organization.Unfortunately  that has not yet been adequatelytranslated into material and financial forms ofassistance  which the people of that country sodesperately need. The recent developments in Guinea-Bissau should be seen not so much as a constraint  butrather as an opportunity to re-engage the internationalcommunity  in partnership with the people of Guinea-Bissau  in the resolution of their problems ofgovernance and development. Now that concertedefforts are being made by all the major actors to agreeon transitional arrangements for the preparation ofparliamentary and presidential elections in the not-too-distant future  we call on the rest of the internationalcommunity to provide the support necessary tostabilize the situation and keep the process on course toa successful outcome.Problems of security and peace in my part of theworld have not in any way diminished our concernsover similar problems elsewhere. The people of Iraqand Afghanistan need urgent international assistance toshore up security  re-establish the rule of law andembark on an effective programme of reconstruction.My Government welcomes the adoption of resolution1500 (2003)  in the hope that the establishment of theGoverning Council of Iraq will lead towards a realpolitical transition for the Iraqi people. While a speedyend to the occupation of Iraq is both desirable andurgent  as clearly underscored in resolution 1472(2003)  outstanding issues emanating from Iraq’soccupation of Kuwait should be comprehensively dealtwith once and for all.We continue to follow closely the situation in theMiddle East  and we deplore yet again the recent spateof vicious attacks and counter-attacks between Israelisand Palestinians  thus negating hope for an earlysettlement within the framework of the road map. Trustand confidence-building measures must be reinforcedand made to attend to every stage of theimplementation of the road map  if the peace process isto endure. Suicide bombings that target innocentcivilians must be stopped. The occupation of Arablands must come to an end. In reiterating our positionon the Arab-Israeli conflict  we call for the creation ofan independent Palestinian State living in peacealongside the State of Israel.My Government firmly supports the initiativesbeing taken to reduce tensions between India andPakistan  two great friends of The Gambia. We urgethem both to reduce the arms build-up on theirrespective sides of the border and to strive harder toreach a mutually acceptable solution to theirdifferences  in particular with regard to the issue ofKashmir. Similarly  we reiterate our support for apeaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula.Human security is not threatened by conflictsalone. The scourge of HIV/AIDS continues to beelusive  and now poses a serious threat to the viabilityof some societies in Africa. The HIV/AIDS pandemichas slowly evolved from a health and humanitarianissue to a development and security problem. Thepandemic has compounded the problems Africancountries face in the fight against other scourges  suchas malaria and tuberculosis. It is gratifying to notehowever  that the international community is sensitizedto that fact and that initiatives such as the Global Fundto Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria have been putin place. Consequently  more money  resources andattention must be given to research and development.Contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria have slackened  anddeveloping countries are paying a colossal price inhuman and material terms. The initiative of the GlobalAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization equallyrequires adequate funding.The pursuit of justice and the international rule oflaw have never been as pressing as it is today. MyGovernment strongly supports the InternationalCriminal Court as it embarks on its crucial mandate ofdelivering justice. We hail its progress so far  and Iwould like to seize this opportunity to call on all tocooperate with the Court in order that  together allaround the world  we can say no to the culture ofimpunity.35While still on the subject of justice  let mereiterate my Government’s view that the sanctionsbeing imposed on Cuba should now be lifted. They arecounter-productive anyway. Cuba is a peace-lovingmember of the international community whose peopledo not deserve the punishment that has been meted outto them for almost four decades now.Let me now turn to development issues. InAfrica  our efforts to achieve sustainable developmentcontinue to be seriously undermined by a variety offactors  prominent among which are conflicts structural weaknesses  natural disasters and disease.For the international system to successfully addressthose factors of underdevelopment  more seriousattention must be paid to the implementation of theBrussels Programme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries for the Decade 2001-2010  and moreattention must be focused on the attainment of theMillennium Development Goals. We must also giveeffect to the commitments made at Doha  Monterreyand Johannesburg.There is no shortage of blueprints fordevelopment. What is in short supply  and what needsto be urgently mobilized  are resources. So far  there isstill a big gap between commitment and action.Africa’s development partners must make good on theirpledges to support Africa’s development. Mydelegation welcomes the Africa Action Plan of the G-8 the African Growth and Opportunity Act of the UnitedStates of America and the “Everything But Arms”initiative of the European Union  all of which committheir sponsors to well-defined forms of support forAfrica’s development.There are  however  many barriers to theimplementation of those initiatives  which are causedby certain protectionist policies pursued by ourpartners  as well as other policy and structuralconstraints. The problem of farm subsidies just will notgo away. Agricultural economies in our part of theworld must be allowed to compete if the global tradingsystem is to function in favour of the eradication ofpoverty. The debt issue is far from being resolved andthe procedures for accessing the benefits of the HighlyIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) are toocumbersome for many poor countries to follow. Theonly realistic approach to the debt problem as a majorimpediment to development is to cancel itunconditionally for HIPC countries and for low-incomecountries under stress.We have just ended at Cancún another attempt atnegotiations on world trade. My delegation deeplyregrets the failure of the talks  as well as the fact thatthe developed world could not see eye to eye with theGroup of 21 on the issue of subsidies. It is in ourcollective interest to dismantle global trade barriers andallow markets to expand  for incomes to rise in thedeveloping world and poverty to be reduced. Strongerearning power in the developing world would stimulateworld trade in ways that would be most beneficial torich countries. My delegation calls on all concerned toensure that we return to the negotiating table as soon aspossible  and with greater determination on both sides to reach a just and fair agreement on all the issuesinvolved.Official development assistance (ODA) still fallsshort of the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per centof gross domestic product. We commend the countrieswhose ODA has risen to that level  in particularDenmark  Norway  the Netherlands and Sweden.My delegation urges all of Africa’s developmentpartners to address those issues with sincerity andcommitment  with a view to meaningfully assisting inkick-starting the sustainable human developmentprocess in African countries.It is gratifying to note that the HumanDevelopment Report 2003 is devoted to the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. In that way  the fight againstpoverty is kept high on the international community’sagenda  because we still have a very long way to go.For instance  as stated in the report “Regionally  at the current pace Sub-SaharanAfrica would not reach the Goals for povertyuntil 2147 and for child mortality until 2165. Andfor HIV/AIDS and hunger  trends in the regionare heading up — not down.” (HumanDevelopment Report 2003  p. 2)It is indeed true that sub-Saharan Africa is beingleft behind. That state of affairs is alarming and  as theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) hasrightly stated  the Millennium Development Goals willnot be realized with a business-as-usual approach. Theparadox  in our view  is the fact that  while the meansto attain the Goals are available  it would appear thatthe political will to do so is lacking. Let me againquote from the Human Development Report 2003.36“Today’s world has greater resources andknow-how than ever before to tackle thechallenges of infectious disease  low productivity lack of clean energy and transport and lack ofbasic services such as clean water  sanitation schools and health care. The issue is how best toapply these resources and know-how to benefitthe poorest people.” (ibid  p. 3)In The Gambia  my Government’s focus is on theattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. Thestrategy we have designed to that end is detailed in ourpoverty reduction strategy paper. In a resource-strapped economy such as The Gambia’s  getting allthe relevant indicators to perform well towards povertyreduction is a daunting challenge. It is  however  achallenge my Government is prepared to take up. Ourspecial focus is on the empowerment of our people  andwe seek to do so by giving priority to our education health and agricultural sectors  as well as by buildingcapacity among our women  who are the architects ofstable and strong nations. That strategy has so faryielded dividends  as evidenced by my country’sshowing on UNDP’s Human Development Report2003.In the education sector our goal is to achieve fullenrolment well before the Millennium Declaration’starget year of 2015. As of now  we have taken the grossenrolment rate from 44 per cent  eight years ago  toover 90 per cent today. We have  at the same time increased non-formal  adult and distance educationprogrammes throughout the country. The net result hasbeen a dramatic drop in illiteracy nationwide.Transition rates from primary to secondary levels havebeen significantly improved  from 12 per cent  15 yearsago  to over 77 per cent today. Six years ago there werehardly any tertiary level institutions to speak of. Todaythey abound  and include the new University of TheGambia. That has been made possible by the visionaryleadership provided by Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh President of the Republic of Gambia.Recognizing the important role women play inthe family  in the community and in the nation  myGovernment has sought to pay special attention to theempowerment of our women through education training and special income-generating projects. Inorder to increase opportunities for the girl child in theeducational system  we have created a trust fund entitled “The President’s Empowerment of GirlsEducation Project”  to provide full scholarships to girlswho would otherwise not be able to go to school forlack of resources. That and other measures gearedtowards assisting women have helped to close thegender gap in education in Gambia.Empowering the rural dweller is another priorityof my Government. We seek to do so through measuresthat lead to an increase in access to resources infrastructure and services  as well as to knowledgeand skills. Most villages now have a primary school and clusters of villages share secondary educationfacilities.Our efforts have also been geared towards theimprovement of the health of our people. Significantlyimproved child health care  especially through anextensive and comprehensive immunizationprogramme  has contributed immensely towards aconsiderable reduction in infant mortality in the lastfew years. Infant mortality rates have been reduced byone third. Primary health care programmes have beenstrengthened across the board. Overall  access to healthfacilities and services have equally been greatlyimproved  with the construction of hospitals  healthcentres  clinics and dispensaries throughout thecountry.For all these achievements  however  we arehumbled by the challenges that still remain. Theprevalence of diseases such as tuberculosis  malariaand a host of respiratory illnesses  is part of anunfinished agenda. Malaria  in particular  remains amajor problem. It is the leading cause of mortality anda major cause of morbidity among pregnant women contributing to anaemia and low birth weight. Today with the cooperation of a Cuban medical and healthteam  The Gambia is number one in Africa as far as itsmalaria control programme is concerned  according tothe World Health Organization.In the area of agriculture  our objective is toachieve a total transformation of the sector. Ourpriority is to reduce the drudgery of production andincrease productivity through a systematic programmeof mechanization. Added to this is our bid to reduceour dependence on rain-fed methods of production  infavour of greater irrigation  using the abundant waterresources that the Gambia River and its tributariesprovide. A third plank of our programme ofempowerment in the agriculture sector is to diversifyactivities away from the traditional crops by placinggreater emphasis on food production as well as on37other non-traditional crops for export. Finally  with allof these objectives already well on the road to success we are beginning to increase market access  bothlocally and abroad  for our producers.Attaining the Millennium Development Goalswill depend to a large extent on how well poorcountries perform in the areas I have just referred to. Itwould also depend on how far they themselves areempowered  and made capable of performing  throughthe requisite support measures from the internationalcommunity. The United Nations system as a whole canbe mobilized further to broker such support for poorcountries  and especially for those among them thatshow promise and positive signs of progress.My Government has been increasing its efforts todeepen democracy and strengthening good governancein The Gambia. To that end  our intent is tocontinuously bring improvements to the performanceof all arms of government. Our multiparty democraticsystem forms the backbone of our politicaldispensation. We continue to conduct free and fairelections at all levels of popular representation. Ourcourts operate independently. We have encouraged themass media to grow and expand  with increasinglyhigher levels of private participation. The internationalcommunity must have been satisfied with our effortsand achievements in this domain  since the WorldEconomic Forum  meeting in South Africa  decided toclassify The Gambia third in Africa  for itsperformance on good governance. We are indeedhonoured by this recognition  and feel encouraged inour resolve to do even better.Advances in information and communicationtechnology have come to make our world a truly globalvillage. This is indeed remarkable. However  we mustnot lose sight of the fact that even in this area there is agreat deal of catching up to be done by the developingworld. Global initiatives geared towards bridging thedigital divide between the developed and developingworlds should be pursued with unrelenting vigour.Scientific and technological research must beconducted in support of the essence of life. In thecourse of this year  we have heard several claims as tothe successful cloning of human embryos. Theseclaims  whether genuine or not  are indeed a wake-upcall for all of humanity. The international communitymust close ranks to address them in a manner thatensures that no one is allowed  for whatever reason  totinker with science and technology in ways that mayupset or threaten nature’s fragile balance.The phenomenon of illegal  unregulated andunreported fishing remains a challenge to coastalAfrican States such as The Gambia. It has generatedenormous concern at the international level  as isevident from the adoption of various internationalinstruments to combat it. My delegation would like toexpress its gratitude to the Governments of Japan andLuxembourg and the Food and AgricultureOrganization for the assistance that they provide to ourfisheries sector  and to fully endorse the Secretary-General’s recommendation that technical and financialassistance to developing countries for the conservationand management of fisheries resources should beprovided in a comprehensive manner. We call forgreater assistance and cooperation in our efforts topromote sustainable practices in the fisheries sector ofour economies.On the crucial topic of United Nations reform  mydelegation welcomes the efforts aimed at therevitalization of the General Assembly and the reformof the Security Council. After more than a decade  littleprogress has been made in our attempts to reform theSecurity Council so that it is truly reflective of therealities of the international system in the twenty-firstcentury. My Government reiterates its stance — indeedthe stance of the entire African region — that thecomposition of the Security Council has to berevamped and democratized. Membership of theCouncil must be expanded  with Africa occupying atleast two permanent seats and five non-permanentseats. We therefore wholeheartedly support the timelyproposal of the Secretary-General to establish a high-level panel of eminent personalities to make concreterecommendations  inter alia  on the reforms of theOrganization.As we move into the business of the fifty-eighthsession of the General Assembly  my delegation praysthat the Almighty Allah crowns our endeavours withsuccess. We pray that this session proves to be theturning point in our efforts to render the UnitedNations more relevant  more effective and truly all-inclusive. We pray that at this session  any doubts as tothe utility of the United Nations to each and every oneof us be put to rest once and for all. We pray that by theclose of this session  we shall all have emerged securein our conviction that only through fuller recourse tothe United Nations can we expect to have our global38problems of conflict  peace and security and  indeed development  frontally addressed  fully contained andcompletely resolved."
"66",2741,"GNB",58,2003,"﻿You have assumed the presidency of the GeneralAssembly  Sir  at a particularly critical time  when theapplicability of rules  the reliability of mechanisms andeven the authority of institutions have been called intoquestion. We are now living through a period ofuncertainty and questioning — uncertainty regardingthe validity of certain fundamental principles that havebeen taken for granted and questions about the path tofollow and the actions to be taken. Against such adifficult backdrop and at a time that is  to say the least unpredictable  it is encouraging to know that we cancount on your experience and myriad talents to guideour work. Guinea-Bissau is gratified by your electionand congratulates you most warmly.Our programme of work is a heavy one becauseonce again we have been unable to draft an agenda thatis more streamlined and less repetitive. As in the past we will therefore be confronted by claims that are allequally legitimate; unfortunately  however  as always rancour will occasionally raise its head. Thisdemonstrates the extent to which you  Sir  will requirethe contribution of each and every one of us in ordersuccessfully to complete your mission. In this respect  Inote with satisfaction that all delegations that havepreceded us at this rostrum have assured you of theirfull support. You may rely on the full cooperation ofthe delegation of Guinea-Bissau. This is all the moretrue since you have established your mandate under thesign of action  for it is clear that it is indeed vigorousaction that we shall need to convince those who todaydoubt the ability of the United Nations to meet theirexpectations.We need resolute action to ensure respect for theprinciples and implementation of the objectives of theCharter. We need collective action to strengthen theUnited Nations capacity to resolve such urgent issuesas poverty and hunger throughout the world  theHIV/AIDS epidemic  the right to full enjoyment ofhuman rights  control of weapons of mass destruction and the deterioration of the environment  our mostprecious heritage  to name but a few. We needconcerted  multilateral and vigorous action againstterrorism and all those practice  finance  instigate orare involved in it and commit such cowardly anddastardly crimes as the attack on the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad. We also need action topromote the adoption of urgent measures to guaranteethe security of the Organization’s personnel.We need urgent and consistent action  too designed to extinguish hotbeds of tension  resolve23conflicts and restore peace wherever it is threatened.We need thoughtful  participatory and realistic actiondesigned to improve the functioning of the UnitedNations system by introducing the necessary structuralreforms and more democratic  transparent and rationalpractices in the Security Council  in particular  andhere in the General Assembly as well. We needequitable and united action to redress inequality intrade  which was recently denounced at the WorldTrade Organization Conference in Cancún  and toadvance socio-economic development in the mostdisadvantaged countries.Each of us is aware of the daunting nature of theintricate task facing us. All these objectives and manyothers require of us the steadfast will to harmonize ourpoints of view while keeping in mind the crux of thematter — our shared responsibility to work together inthe interests of all Member States. This collectiveendeavour can and must succeed  without  however obliging us to renounce our principles or ignore thoserules  the relevance and utility of which we are wellaware. To that end  we have a unique and irreplaceableframework — the United Nations  the sole truly globalforum.To be sure  our Organization is far from perfect but how could it be otherwise in a world as complexand unequal as ours? Moreover  we are the UnitedNations  as was so well recalled by the Secretary-General before this Assembly. Thus  it is notunreasonable to believe that  if we agree and if we sodecide  our Organization could be restructured andbetter adapted to the rapid transformations we arewitnessing and  in response to the hopes of all  morecapable of meeting the growing challenges. Thenecessary reforms are possible so long as MemberStates have the genuine and unflagging political will toimplement them.We have undeniably been sorely tried and testedthis year. The tragic events of 19 August are still vividin our memories  along with the bitterly painfulmemories of our late colleagues and friends  who werekilled in a cowardly manner and cruelly wrested fromtheir families. We will never be able fully to expressour debt to Sergio and all the others who lost their livesin the service of the United Nations and the noble goalsand ideals that we champion and shall continue tochampion together. We must emerge from this ordealmore resolute and more united. Circumstances requireno less and we are ethically compelled to do so.I wish here and now to congratulate theSecretary-General on his leadership and dedication tothe cause of peace and to hail the dignity  compassionand humanism that he demonstrated in the face of sucha tragic ordeal as the brutal  wrongful and unforeseendeaths of colleagues and personal friends.The United Nations  for the first time in a longwhile  has been bypassed — indeed  forced to take aback seat — in the management of a crisis  the natureand gravity of which required it to play its due roletherein. Beyond the differences that emerged within theinternational community  and in particular among themembers of the Security Council  regarding the rightway to deal with an outlaw  recidivist and dangerousregime  the issue of Iraq once again highlighted thelimitations of an Organization that  while universal nevertheless depends on a small number of itsMembers. That is one of the reasons behind the manyfrustrations voiced year after year from this rostrum.Our continent  Africa  still faces difficulties of allkinds. Poverty and endemic malnutrition arecompounded by the agonies of HIV/AIDS  whichcontinues to kill millions of individuals. There is alsothe growing number of conflicts and the proliferationof small arms  which pose an ongoing threat to thepeace and stability of the countries of our continent.This unfortunate picture is particularly accuratefor West Africa  where several armed conflicts haveerupted in recent years  with Liberia as their epicenter.Everyone is now aware of what some of us  theRepublic of Guinea in particular  have been saying foryears: The civil war in Liberia is contagious and thetrigger of a series of crises and armed conflicts in thesubregion. It has now touched countries that were onceheld up as examples of political stability and economicgrowth and were believed to be immune to suchdisasters.My delegation should like to welcome theprogress recently made in Liberia. The people of thatcountry deserve finally to live in peace. It is a peoplethat  as we all know  has suffered greatly from manyyears of war and destruction. We were also totallyshocked to see all those children being used as cannonfodder in a war that was unjustified and unjustifiable.We also note with satisfaction the progress made inSierra Leone. There  too  it was high time for peace tobe restored. We are also pleased that our friends in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo have finally24committed themselves on the path to progress andnational reconciliation.My country  Guinea-Bissau  has undergone somechanges  the nature of which and the methods used toeffect them have been subject to criticism  running thegamut from simple regret to formal condemnation.These are positions of principle that we understand andaccept  for we have never ceased to proclaim ourdevotion to democracy and the rule of law. I recall herethat my country was one of the first in Africa to wagean exemplary liberation struggle on behalf of freedom human rights and democracy.However  the sad realities of life  particularlywhen they are characterized by chronic and dangerousconstitutional instability  can unfortunately lead to theoverthrow of an existing regime specifically to preventthe exacerbation of social and political tensions in thecountry that could lead to confrontation or even civilwar.In Guinea-Bissau  a military committee decidedto reflect in action the hopes for change of the majorityof the population. Not a single shot was fired. No onein Guinea-Bissau has been arrested and I welcome thefact that the military has rejected any consideration ofexercising power. In such circumstances  it is hardlysurprising that the people have adhered to thismovement  which has effected the changes theydesired. Indeed  the people’s support was total.The members of the military committee for therestitution of the constitutional and democratic orderwere in fact acclaimed as genuine liberators. InGuinea-Bissau  we had been in an untenable situation.Our people  whose courage and dignity cannot beoveremphasized  had had enough. They had reachedthe limit of what one can decently ask someone to putup with. I cannot sufficiently reiterate the extent towhich our people deserve to be encouraged  supportedand assisted.Now that we have decided to turn the page  tolook towards the future and to determine how we  thecitizens of Guinea-Bissau  can be reconciled  unite ourforces  create synergy and act together for the well-being of our people  the international communityshould intercede on our behalf and to provide thefinancial assistance we need. It is indeed financialassistance that we need  because our country and ourState are destitute. We need international assistance torecover  to meet our challenges and to ensure that ourpeople can eat. We need to see to it that those whochose freedom some 30 years ago can finally see itflourish  enjoy its benefits and understand why theyfought and why they have a right to a decent and betterlife.I should like to say here that  right now in ourcountry  a process is under way that is bringingtogether all the vital forces of our nation. The politicalparties  the military committee and civil society —everyone has come together to meet the challenge asone and to answer the call of the people to join forcesand work together. As I speak before this Assembly the membership of the Government is under discussion.Thanks to concerted action and a professional andintensive analysis of the situation in our country  wehave been able to adopt an interim charter thatspecifies all the stages required to restore as soon aspossible the constitutional and democratic order thatwe and the international community wish to see returnto Guinea-Bissau.An Interim President has been chosen byconsensus. This President is dedicated to working forthe unity of the country. He intends to strengthennational unity and to serve as a catalyst so that we canreturn to our ideal of progress and freedom.In conclusion  I should like to thank our brothersand sisters of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States (ECOWAS) subregion  who have strivento help us get back on our feet  discuss and find themost appropriate solutions to our problems. I thankfirst of all the Heads of State of Ghana  Senegal andNigeria  who have visited Guinea-Bissau  as well as theECOWAS ministers  who have never failed to supportGuinea-Bissau. I also wish to note the assistanceprovided to us by the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries  which dispatched the Minister forForeign Affairs of Timor-Leste to advise us and tovoice the solidarity of that linguistic community  towhich we belong.A country’s national unity is its most preciousasset. I cannot overemphasize that fact and I hope that Ishall soon see democracy fully restored in my country.Above all  however  I wish to see the people of Guinea-Bissau happy. It is a proud and dignified people thathas suffered in silence — a most eloquent silence —and that deserves the trust and assistance of theinternational community.25"
"67",2780,"GNQ",58,2003,"﻿The delegation of the Republic of EquatorialGuinea joins preceding delegations in congratulatingthe President on his election to preside over the workof the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly ofthe United Nations. We know that it is a very difficulttask  Sir  because it is your task to organize the debatesof this the greatest deliberative organ of the UnitedNations at a time when the Organization   and theinternational community   are experiencing a crisisunprecedented in its history.However  Sir  we have confidence in yourpolitical and diplomatic ability and in the maturity andprudence of your country in dealing with internationalproblems; thus we are optimistic that our deliberationswill meet with the greatest success.We also congratulate Secretary-General KofiAnnan on his tireless efforts to ensure that the UnitedNations fulfils its mission of peace in the variousarmed conflicts  its humanitarian action in response tothe disasters affecting many countries and its efforts topromote peace negotiations and multiple forms ofcooperation in order to achieve sustainabledevelopment in the world.The Republic of Equatorial Guinea expressesbefore the Assembly its serious concern at the currentinternational situation  which is manifestly affectinginternational peace and security  which the UnitedNations was created to safeguard. Indeed  since the endof the cold war  which gave rise to hope for a moreunited  cooperative  integrated and peaceful world ofgreater solidarity  it has seemed that the principle rulesgoverning international relations have been steadilylosing force  with the risk that each State will actaccording to its own will.The concepts of democracy  human rights andtechnical cooperation and assistance are being misusedto the detriment of some  and are being exploited to thebenefit of others. The concept of democracy  which isunderstood as governing according to the will of eachpeople  has today been transformed into a demandimposed by certain States in violation of the universalprinciple that every State is free to adopt the politicalsystem that best suits it. Furthermore  the principles ofState sovereignty and non-interference in the internalaffairs of other States  enshrined in international law have been violated in recent years under the pretext ofthe need for humanitarian intervention  which are oftenconducted without United Nations approval.The efforts to establish a new internationaleconomic order that ensures cooperation for globaldevelopment have ended in the division of the worldinto North and South  and political conditions are nowbeing imposed on the cooperative assistance that is17offered. Efforts towards the globalization of economicpolicies have not recognized the weak position ofunderdeveloped countries  which suffer gravedisadvantages in participating and competing in the so-called globalization of the world. We believe that thepolicy of globalization needs to include a specialprogramme for the sustainable development ofdeveloping countries in order to help them attain thelevel of maturity necessary to benefit from such anintegration. In all these efforts to achieve internationalcooperation for global development  there are goodintentions  but the decisive will needed to build a fairerand more equitable world has been lacking.Meanwhile  the situation of the weakest countriesdeteriorates  the economic crisis worsens  politicalupheaval spreads and Governments are taking a harsherstance to protect their power.Internal warfare  mercenaries and terrorism aretaking root because  as occurred in the Middle Ages the people cannot bear hunger and poverty and aredriven to civil disobedience. At the same time  theUnited Nations is losing its authority because itsdecision-making organs are not democratic  and itscapacity for humanitarian assistance falls short becauseof the proliferation of disasters caused by wars and actsof terrorism.In our opinion  and most regrettably  humanity isalready dehumanized and the United Nations has lostits authority. We must now shoulder the responsibilityof rebuilding our policies and of morally rebuilding theOrganization and restoring its authority. It is the onlyworld body capable of representing humanity withauthority and the only one in which we can achieveuniversal consensus.It is here that we can fight terrorism andorganized crime  because everything is listened to andeverything is discussed in this forum. The use ofweapons against terrorism could turn us into terroristsourselves. Thus my delegation naturally andenergetically condemns the terrorist attack against theUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad  which causedthe death of the Special Representative of theSecretary-General  Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  andthose of some 30 staff working in the service of peace.We express our deep condolences at the loss of thosenoble workers in the service of humanity. We thereforebelieve that now is the time to adopt strategies so thatUnited Nations peacekeeping missions will not beconfused with any interests other than the peacefulsettlement of hostilities.As for my country  Equatorial Guinea is faithfulto its commitments as a full-fledged Member of theUnited Nations and a member of the African Union committed to the maintenance of peaceful relations offriendship and cooperation with other countries. Werespect the sovereignty  national unity  territorialintegrity and inalienable rights of other States withintheir borders  and we favour the promotion of thesocio-political development of nations.In that connection  Equatorial Guinea is a party toall international conventions that protect the political economic and sociocultural rights of peoples.Democracy  as the consensus of the people  is a realityin which our country is immersed  with the coexistenceof the 13 political parties that constitute it  observingthe commitments of the binding national political pactbetween the Government and the opposition.Undoubtedly  today the formation of a broad-basedGovernment is the greatest exponent of peace andpolitical stability that my country has ever known.In order to ensure such internal politicalconsensus and cooperation with other countries andinternational organizations  we believe thattransparency is absolutely necessary  because itbenefits all parties. Equatorial Guinea offers open andunrestricted cooperation to everyone  on the basis oftransparent action  for everyone's mutual benefit.Nevertheless  we are aware that our possibilities arevery limited as far as acquiring modern technology andlaying the foundations for sustained and sustainableand development are concerned. Therefore  we requestinternational cooperation in that regard from friendlycountries and from international assistanceorganizations.I conclude by expressing the hope that the UnitedNations will recover its leadership in promoting thepeace and development of our world."
"68",2826,"GRC",58,2003,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating you  Mr. President  on your election tothe presidency of the General Assembly. You areassuming your duties at a difficult juncture in25international affairs. I am sure that  under yourguidance  the Assembly will make a positivecontribution to fostering peace and progress in theworld. Allow me also to extend my warmest thanks toyour predecessor  our good friend Mr. Jan Kavan  forhis commitment and diligence.We fully subscribe to the statement delivered byMr. Frattini on behalf of the European Union  as wellas to the priorities of the European Union that he haslaid out before the Assembly.When I held the presidency of the EuropeanUnion  just a few months ago  I had the honour to workclosely with the Secretary-General at a very crucialtime. Secretary-General Kofi Annan often has to wagean uphill battle in his efforts to safeguard the moralauthority of the United Nations and to carry out itsmandate. His tireless efforts to promote peace andsecurity worldwide deserve our fullest support.Indeed  this year the United Nations hasundergone one of the most testing periods in its history.During the Iraqi crisis the world's citizens put greatfaith in the power of the United Nations to respond tothe potential threat of weapons of mass destruction while at the same time preserving peace and thelegitimacy of international law. The leaders of theinternational community failed to unite around globalpublic opinion  and a war ensued. As Kofi Annan toldthe Assembly  a new doctrine of pre-emptive force andunilateralist actions has called into question our longtradition of global consensus on collective security.Paradoxically  despite that crisis  our citizensexpect more today from the United Nations  rather thanless. Whether we are dealing with poverty  inequality human rights violations  terrorism  pollution orweapons of mass destruction  the world looks to us forleadership. We are expected to transform today'sinsecurity into tomorrow's opportunities. That mayseem like a tall order  but it is possible. It is possibletoday  as we are witnessing a growing consciousnessabout the need to think seriously about globalgovernance. That consciousness has to do with themagnitude and complexity of the issues with whichhumankind is grappling. It also has to do with the factthat  in an era of globalization  a problem in anothercorner of the world can have major effects in our ownneighbourhood of the global village.The legitimacy of the United Nations is at theheart of that debate. If we are to convince the morepowerful of the world that unilateralism does not pay we need to show that multilateralism is effective. Weneed to prove that organizations such as ours can dealeffectively with threats to our peace and security. Weneed to rethink our institutions  which must befinancially and politically viable. We must ensure thatour institutions derive their legitimacy not only from theaction we take and the just decisions we make  but fromthe fact that they are truly democratic and that they arerepresentative of global consensus as far as possible.All that is possible  but it requires courageouschanges   certainly the courage to open up a sinceredialogue between citizens  countries  continents andcivilizations. We therefore fully endorse the Secretary-General's proposal for the reform of the UnitedNations. By the time the Assembly meets next year  weneed to have achieved realistic targets and tangibleresults  and to have re-evaluated the role of the variousbodies of the United Nations and of their respectivemissions. The role of the Security Council isparamount  and its composition must be morerepresentative in order to ensure full trust in itsauthority and legitimacy. The United Nations canbecome central in safeguarding humankind's security peace and prosperity. Greece will work towards thatgoal if the General Assembly honours us by electing usto the Security Council for the 2005-2006 term.From the corner of the world I come from  I canseriously state that the prospect for peace is real. In thelast century Greece lived through two World Wars  twoBalkan wars  a major war with Turkey  a famine  a civilwar  numerous dictatorships and confrontation withTurkey over Cyprus. We also became a major recipient ofrefugees from the crises  ethnic cleansing and wars in ourregion of South-Eastern Europe and the Middle East.Today there is hope in the Balkans that peace canbecome permanent  that democracy can flourish andthat human beings can live together in dignity irrespective of their religious  political or ethnicaffiliation. Greece and Turkey have emerged from along period of over 40 years of tension and suspicionwhen there was little contact and no bilateralagreements were ever signed. Twice in recent decadeswe went to the brink of war. Today I can stand beforethe Assembly and state that Greece and Turkey haveratified 14 agreements in areas ranging from tourism toagriculture and education to security. We have alsoagreed on 10 confidence-building measures and although fundamental differences remain on specific26issues  we are now working cooperatively to try to dealwith some of the most contentious and controversialquestions that have divided us for decades.Further testimony of that improvement is the factthat  with my Turkish counterpart  Abdullah G¸l  wesimultaneously submitted yesterday in this building ourratification instruments for the Ottawa Treaty banninglandmines. In Cyprus  an island divided after Turkey'sinvasion and occupation in 1974  we perceive thecommon desire to build a democratic  united Cypruswhere Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots can livetogether in peace. Last April  following the lifting ofrestrictions on free movement  thousands of Cypriotsseized the opportunity to cross the so-called GreenLine to meet with one another and to demonstrate thatit is possible for them to share a common future.However  that easing of restrictions is not asubstitute for a comprehensive settlement to theisland's political problem. Over the years  Greece hasactively supported the efforts of the Secretary-Generalto achieve a comprehensive settlement in conformitywith the relevant resolutions of the Security Counciland the principles on which the European Union isfounded  namely  the Acquis Communautaire. Thoseresolutions must be implemented. We will not give uphope until all Cypriots can live together in harmonyand security in a federal State with a single citizenshipand without foreign troops on its territory. On 1 May2004  Cyprus will be a full member of the EuropeanUnion. We hold out the hope that the Annan plan willbe used as a basis for negotiating  and that a solutionwill be found  so that the Turkish Cypriot population willalso enjoy the security and prosperity that accession to theEuropean Union will bring. It is possible.Yet all those sustained efforts for peace in theregion would not have been possible if it were not forthe creation of a viable  stable and sustainableframework of shared values  principles  visions andinterests  as well as a deep commitment to respect ofour citizen's rights and including a vision in which  asPericles said in his Funeral Oration  one is free ofsuspicion of the other. That framework  vision andcommon values can be summed up in one phrase: ourEuropean Union.Fifty years ago  Europe was shattered by twoworld wars and countless regional conflicts. Throughour common values of respect for the rule of law democracy  freedom  and solidarity  we have overcomewars and the Holocaust and have seen the fall of theBerlin Wall. Today the European Union is a model ofmultilateralism  a system of collective governance thatadvances the shared interests and addresses thecommon problems of a coalition of nation-States thatall aspire to peace and security in a common union.Europe may not have a magic wand that can solve allcrises  but we have proved that it is possible to build astable and democratic continent. It is that prospect thatnow unites us in the Balkans  gives hope to Greek-Turkish relations and creates a common vision forGreek and Turkish Cypriots. The United Nations canlearn from our experience as it prepares to undertakenecessary reforms. What the European Union hasprovided is not a magic wand. We have simply saidthat matters of war and peace are so important forhumankind that they cannot merely be left up toleaders  no matter how great they may be. They cannotbe left up to negotiators  no matter how skilful theymay be. They cannot be left up to earthquakes apocalypses or inspirations  however momentous theymay be. What is needed is a stable  sustainable  secureenvironment of common values  international law accepted practice and purpose. It is within that secureenvironment that we can work out roadmaps benchmarks  milestones  target dates and goals that canbecome both credible and powerful tools for thepeaceful resolution of conflicts and the establishmentof lasting institutions of stability and conviviality.That is why the United Nations has become soimportant for Iraq and its people. That is why theUnited Nations and the Quartet are so important for theimplementation of the road map to solve thePalestinian conflict and the wider Middle East conflict.If we differed in Europe on the means of dealing withIraq  we remain united in our conviction that the UnitedNations has a vital role to play in the reconstruction andstabilization process. Indeed  I would argue that thecurrent predicament in Iraq is a stark reminder thatmultilateral cooperation is an imperative for worldpeace and security. It will only be possible to bringlasting peace to Iraq if we all work together.In referring to the importance of the role of theUnited Nations in Iraq we are simply stating theobvious need to create a stable internationalenvironment within which solutions can be nurtured and where they can mature  in order to stabilize theregion. It is within that context that it must be possibleto realize a Palestinian State by 2005  a State that lives27side by side with a secure Israel. It is also within thatcontext that during our presidency of the EuropeanUnion we placed great emphasis on engaging in ameaningful dialogue of cultures that could hopefullyheal the deepening rifts with regard to how differentcultures view our changing world. We also devotedconsiderable efforts during Greece's presidency tostrengthening Europe's relations with the Arab world.We hope that that dialogue can continue to be aninvestment in  and an instrument for  furthering peace democracy and prosperity.Iraq challenged Europe to think globally. Werealized that in order to safeguard our citizens' securitywe had to develop stronger foreign and defencepolicies. We took the initiative during our presidencyto launch the first European security strategy. We arenow creating more clearly defined defence policies andgreater military and crisis-management capabilities.Last June  the European Union adopted its first strategyagainst the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  as well as a joint-action plan on terrorism.That was quickly followed by a framework agreementon weapons of mass destruction between the EuropeanUnion and the United States.Similarly  problems such as terrorism  traffickingin drugs  arms and people  and the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction all point to a world whereconflict is not confined to national frontiers. It is onlylogical to conclude that most problems can only beproperly addressed through multilateral action andpolicies in our global village. Sustainable developmentwill bring about sustainable peace. But sustainable peacealso depends on the freedom of our citizens: freedom ofchoice  freedom to participate  freedom fromoppression and freedom from fear and discrimination.Democracy bodes well for security  becausesecurity cannot be achieved without the legitimacy ofour institutions and decisions. But democracy cannotbe imposed  it must be nurtured. That is the difficulttask ahead  namely  to create democratic processes in atrans-national way. That is becoming a globalchallenge that we cannot afford to ignore. It must bepossible  otherwise we will always be prey to extremistforces that resort to violence  often exploiting the senseof exclusion among our citizens  many of whom feelexcluded from prosperity and human rights.This year  such forces were responsible for theuntimely deaths of three champions of democracy.Allow me to mention their names: Zoran Djindjić Sergio Vieira de Mello and Anna Lindh. Their tragicdeaths pose a critical challenge to the very freedom anddemocracy they fought so hard to defend. We must notallow the threat of violence  intolerance and fear tohold our democratic societies hostage. We must not letinsecurity blind us to the simple truth that democracyholds the key to a world without violence.In our global village today  our challenge is to seeto it that we have an international system that trulygoverns democratically. We must ask ourselves toughquestions. How representative and accountable are ourinternational institutions? Who decides on global rulesand regulations? Who implements those decisions?Whose interests do they serve? Why do so many of ourcitizens feel moved to stage protests outside internationalsummits? How can we address their grievances andinclude them in the decision-making process? If we canfind satisfactory answers to these questions we willhave come a long way towards replacing today'sinsecurity with tomorrow's opportunities.Building on our long history of democracy Greece is committed to supporting and developing newdemocratic practices. One way to do so is through theInternet  which has created radical new possibilities forreinvigorating and enriching democratic dialogue. Wecreated an on-line experiment during our presidency ofthe European Union that is called e-Vote  an electronicpilot project through which citizens can participate inongoing debates. Three months from now  we willassemble at Geneva for the first phase of the WorldSummit on the Information Society. There Greece willhost a special conference on the promise of electronicdemocracy. I invite the entire Assembly to attend.Finally  in this global village we also need tohave global festivals  even with our many difficulties to celebrate humankind and our common values. TheOlympic Games are one such festival. Greece will havethe honour to host a great homecoming on the occasionof the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.We have introduced in the General Assembly anew draft resolution on the subject of building apeaceful and better world through sport and theOlympic Ideal. We want to encourage the notion that itis possible to create lasting peace from a pause inhostilities. The United Nations and  in particular  theSecretary-General have long championed the value ofpeaceful cooperation through sport. Since 1993  the28Assembly has unanimously adopted six resolutionscalling for a truce during the Olympic Games. Thisdraft resolution  like the ones before it  calls on allMember States to observe the Olympic Truce  the longestpeace accord in ancient history. I urge the Assembly tosupport that draft resolution. Let us reaffirm ourcommitment to the spirit of peaceful cooperation uponwhich the Olympics were founded. Let us send asymbolic message from this international body of peacefor a peaceful Olympics and  ultimately  for a morepeaceful world. Let us prove that that too is possible."
"69",2867,"GRD",58,2003,"﻿It is with a deep sense ofpride and pleasure that my delegation congratulatesyou  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidencyof the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. Youhave done the entire Caribbean region proud. Your owncountry  Saint Lucia  one of the smallest StatesMembers of this Organization  can feel especiallyproud. We are confident that  given the combination ofyour vast experience  solid leadership skills andcharismatic personality  this session will go down inhistory as one of the most dynamic and constructive forall States  large and small.My delegation pays tribute to your illustriouspredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic  forhis enlightened and innovative conduct of this bodyduring the previous session.My delegation also expresses profound sympathyto the Government and the people of Saint Lucia on therecent passing of your predecessor  Sir  as Minister forForeign Affairs  The Honourable George Odlum.Each succeeding President of the GeneralAssembly inherits an agenda of recurring resolutionsand outcome documents adopted at the manyinternational summit-level conferences during the past4decade. My delegation remains confident that youradministration  Sir  will put implementation concernshigh on the development agenda.When the United Nations was founded 58 yearsago  the focus was basically on world peace andsecurity in the aftermath of the devastating effects ofthe Second World War. Security concerns have onceagain taken centre stage in current international affairs but they should not displace the consideration ofimportant issues on the economic and social agenda.My Government remains totally committed to theglobal fight against terrorism and the perpetrators ofviolence. In this regard  it will certainly take allnecessary actions to ensure that Grenada is an activepartner in this common struggle.The proliferation of transnational criminalactivities is the most vivid example of the negativeeffect of open borders in a globalized world. The illicittrade in weapons and drugs  money-laundering andtrafficking in women and children clearly need to betackled in a more organized manner. A truly effectiveglobal response to these and other threats requires thatall States act in concert with each other. In this regard my Government  despite its limited resources  isfulfilling its commitment.Since the events of 11 September 2001  Grenadahas ratified or acceded to all relevant internationaltreaties and conventions on terrorism and relatedactivities. All the appropriate domestic legislation hasbeen enacted.My delegation is convinced that the eliminationof terrorism alone will not guarantee social andeconomic stability. It will not solve the many problemsassociated with underdevelopment  poverty  hunger disease  illiteracy  and unemployment — all of whichgive rise to hopelessness and pose a threat to peace andsecurity.The holding of the recent meeting here at theUnited Nations to assess the implementation of theDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS made clearthat the pandemic is continuing to take a heavy toll especially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean.As the many leaders who took part in the debatesaid  much remains to be done in the fight against thisdreadful scourge if the Declaration of Commitmenttarget is to be met by 2005. Thus  certain critical areasin this fight  such as education on prevention and caretargeted especially to young people  mobilization ofresources by engaging civil society including thebusiness sector  and access to affordable medicine areabsolutely essential.Fighting HIV/AIDS is both a medical and a socio-economic problem  with far-reaching implications forsmall developing countries such as my own. Caring forthe ever-increasing numbers with the virus  togetherwith educating and sensitizing the general public onprevention issues and responsible behaviour  hasbecome burdensome  in terms of both human andfinancial resources. Partnership and support from thedeveloped countries will be welcomed.My delegation is convinced that the eradicationof poverty and its related ills is central to social andeconomic stability. Poverty will not simply disappearthrough passionate pleas and eloquent statements  butthrough genuine collaborative and cooperative efforts.My Government is acutely aware of our responsibility as a sovereign and independent nation to provide forour citizens.The efforts of the Caribbean Community(CARICOM) to establish a single market and economywith a view to harnessing and efficiently utilizing thelimited resources of the region  improvingcompetitiveness  productivity and general cooperation must be applauded.The more developed countries must speedilycome to the rescue of the needy developing countriesby providing tangible and meaningful technical economic and other forms of assistance — assistancethat will have a positive impact on the lives of millionsin the developing world.It is for this reason that we will continue toclamour for reforms within the global trading system and especially within the framework of the WorldTrade Organization (WTO)  particularly as it relates totrade in agriculture and in other services.My delegation calls for a substantial reduction ofthe subsidies afforded to farmers in the more developedand industrialized economies  and also for the removalof non-tariff and other technical barriers to the exportof our commodities.In our efforts to diversify our economies and toenhance our revenue-earning options  we need theflexibility to develop our service sector free frompressures and conditionalities  to add value to our5primary products  and to be able to export our exoticfruits and vegetables.Our small and vulnerable economies can becomeviable if the right conditions are created to facilitate thetrade of our products on the world market.The failure of the recently concluded WTOMinisterial Meeting in Cancún  Mexico  to reach acompromise on issues of extreme importance is a causefor concern. The outcome has confirmed  inunequivocal terms  that the divide between rich andpoor nations continues to widen.My country endorses the idea that the UnitedNations must continue its work to ensure thatdemocracy and respect for basic human rights prevailin all civil societies. However  this body should  as amatter of principle  also seek to ensure that fair  justand morally correct actions and decisions are taken onequally important matters.The people of the Republic of Cuba continue tolive under a unilaterally imposed financial  commercialand economic blockade  as they have for more than 40years. This has resulted in great human and materiallosses  and in many personal traumatic experiences.Grenada joins the overwhelming majority in the UnitedNations and calls for the unconditional lifting of thosesanctions.We believe that universally accepted norms andvalues and economic growth and prosperity canflourish only under normal circumstances. The peopleof Cuba need that chance.The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues toescalate  and every effort must be made to return to theroad map  as it remains the best hope for the resolutionof the problem.Similarly  my delegation is concerned about thenegative effect of civil unrest and tensions around theglobe  particularly in Iraq  Liberia and the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo. My Government supports allefforts  actions and initiatives to ensure that normalcyreturns to the countries and regions concerned. We urgepatience  understanding and tolerance in dealing withthese difficult situations.The United Nations has been seized with thereform of the Security Council and with therevitalization of the General Assembly for a number ofyears. When the United Nations was founded 58 yearsago  the membership was 51; today there are 191Member States.Much has changed in the geopolitical dynamicsof the world  which the United Nations represents andreflects. Therefore  there is a need for structural andfunctional changes in the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly  two of the main organs of greatestimportance in the world body.At the beginning of this intervention  I alluded tothe tardiness in the implementation of collectivedecisions  particularly on the subject of the sustainabledevelopment of small island developing States. A totalof six summit conferences have been held over a periodof 11 years to address the issues of the environmentand development in those vulnerable island States.Donor countries have not fulfilled their end ofthat partnership. Official development assistancecontinues to fall  and multilateral aid has droppedsignificantly. Ten years later  another high-levelmeeting is scheduled to take place in Mauritius in 2004to review the Barbados Declaration and Programme ofAction.My delegation is hopeful that the occasion will beused to ensure that the priority issues facing smallStates will be addressed in a way that gives optimismto the millions whose lives depend on a commitment tothe following issues: improving their preparedness for and recovery from  natural and environmentaldisasters; addressing the problem of climate changeand sea-level rise  which could submerge low-lyingnations in the Caribbean and the Pacific; preventingworsening shortages of potable water; developing solarand renewable energy to lessen dependence onexpensive imported oil; and managing growth intourism to protect the environmental and culturalintegrity of our nations.My delegation’s appeal to this session of theGeneral Assembly is for all stakeholders  including themultilateral financial institutions  demonstrate theirtotal commitment to the entire process in order thatefforts to implement outstanding importantcommitments can be finalized.Despite the uncertainty over adequate funding forimplementation  my delegation remains confident  Mr.President  that  with your ability to lead and buildconsensus  this fifty-eighth session will become knownas the General Assembly of implementation.6As Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently stated:“We all live on the same planet  buffeted by thesame winds  influenced by the same currents ofchange. But instead of acting on what unitesus … we allow a chasm to persist between us …We need to mend this great divide with a newfabric of solidarity”.My delegation is convinced that we have theopportunity to build and develop this new kind ofsolidarity and partnership between rich and poor  bigand small  powerful and weak  at this session of theGeneral Assembly. The opportunity is ours to embraceor to lose."
"70",2914,"GTM",58,2003,"﻿Icome before this parliament of humankind to presentmy final report as a Head of State who believes ininterdependence and for whom sovereignty is not aclosed door separating nations  but rather an openwindow affording a glimpse into the identity of eachone  furthering the respectful interchange ofexperiences and the quest for understanding andsolidarity among peoples.My presence here reflects Guatemala’scommitment to the United Nations  whose presence inmy country has been crucial to the implementation ofthe Peace Agreements concluded in 1996. It also givesme the opportunity to participate in the debateconcerning the main subjects that make up theinternational agenda  while at the same time allowingme once again to express our solidarity with theinhabitants of the great city of New York over thetragic events of two years ago.I wish to reiterate our energetic repudiation of thetreacherous attack against United Nations headquartersin Baghdad that took place just a few weeks ago. Weespecially regret the loss of valuable officials of theOrganization  including the esteemed Sergio Vieira deMello.I also wish to express our gratitude to Mr. JanKavan  of the Czech Republic  for his enlightenedleadership of the previous session. At the same time  Iwould like very sincerely to congratulate Mr. JulianHunte on having assumed the presidency of theGeneral Assembly at this session. We are pleased to seea distinguished representative of our own regionoccupy such an important post. We have no doubt that with his proven abilities and his well-knownexperience  he will be quite successful in conductingour deliberations.Guatemala  just like its brotherly countries inLatin America  has experienced a dramatic period atthe close of the twentieth century. That time has beencharacterized by a complex agenda involving variouschallenges  including those of entering into theglobalization process  building peace with justice andconsolidating democracy in a way that includes goodgovernance.13In that regard  during the last four years we havesought to make progress in opening up Guatemala tothe world and in making it part of globalization’stechnological  financial and cultural currents. Wepromoted the democratization of institutions mechanisms  practices and values capable ofcommingling freedom with authority and effectivenesswith equality. We have also nurtured the concept ofpeace based on justice and respect for human rights.Guatemala is a country where several historicaltasks remain to be completed or have been permanentlypostponed. When I assumed the presidency  in January2000  I resolved to thoroughly address some of thosepending issues. We have freed our country from itscaptivity by powerful economic interests. There are nolonger tax exemptions that favour individuals. Tradepolicy is no longer manipulated to the detriment of theproduction of small farmers. Economic policy is nowseen as an instrument of social development. After acentury of captive markets  local monopolies are nowexposed to competition.The Peace Agreements bestowed on Guatemala aprogramme for democratization. With an eye towardsthe twenty-first century  the Agreements constitute aproposal for a wide-ranging reinvigoration ofcoexistence between Guatemalans. But the Agreementshave also presented us with the challenge ofsimultaneously completing various tasks pertaining todifferent historical processes that other societies havecarried out in stages.I am pleased to say that we have made progress invarious substantive areas. However  I must also admitthat we have fallen short  or inadequately addressed other areas.Against the opposition of powerful interests  wemade a determined effort to increase the tax rate. Weachieved a historical level in the collection of taxes but without attaining the goal that had been set.We carried out the most significant financialreform since 1945 in order to modernize the bankingsystem  reduce the risks of speculation and restore tothe system its true mediation function.We modernized the labour law  which since 1944had suffered a series of setbacks. We consistentlyraised the minimum wage in real terms at anunprecedented pace. On average  workers in thecountryside now earn 50 per cent more than they didfour years ago.Our illiteracy rate has historically been shameful.We therefore adopted plans that made it possible toreduce that rate by almost half. Special attention hasbeen devoted to young girls. Through scholarships andschool feeding programmes  we have removed tens ofthousands of children from child labour. We have alsoreformed curricula to include the philosophy of thePeace Agreements. And we have considerablyincreased school enrolment.With regard to basic health care  we haveconfronted structural weaknesses in the critical areas ofchild and maternal mortality rates and nutrition.However  much more remains to be done. We arein an unfavourable economic environment. Thetraditional engines of growth and employment haveweakened  and the necessary changes in production aretaking place slowly. We have therefore undertaken amassive effort to stabilize the economy and haveimplemented emergency measures  such as providingsmall farmers with agricultural supplies so that theycan sustain their productive capacity.The issue of transforming the production processis so sensitive that it was a contributing factor in thecivil war that raged for almost 40 years during the lastcentury. Recognizing the urgency of the issue  Iintroduced reconciliation mechanisms in which allsectors participate in an effort to define the country’sstrategic policies  including in the areas of economicand rural development.Our people have made significant advances in thearea of participation in the past three years. We havecarried out the country’s most significant reform bydecentralizing our institutions  strengthening localdevelopment councils and granting greater powers andfunctions to municipal governments. Indigenouspeoples are now recognized as such and are able toparticipate in defining a new institutional landscapegrounded in their own cultures. Women also have anincreased public role and are developing innovativeways of organizing.All those efforts are aimed at reweaving oursocial fabric  which had been torn apart by the war.Reconciliation is an essential task in that regard  andthe Government must foster a favourable climate for itto take place. That is why I assumed international14commitments to counter violations of human rights.That is also why we have begun a nationalcompensation programme that includes reparations forthe families of the more than 200 000 victims of thewar  most of whom were indigenous persons. We alsotrust that the High Commissioner for Human Rightswill establish an Office in Guatemala.Nevertheless  impunity continues to be a difficultissue to overcome. Judicial bodies continue to be weak which is what led me to put forward an unprecedentedtemporary measure to strengthen local institutionalcapacity. I asked for the support of the United Nationsin immediately establishing a commission toinvestigate illegal groups and clandestine securitymechanisms  as several repressive groups of the pastthat are now in league with organized crime arethreatening and intimidating human rights activists judges and journalists.Civilian authority must be strengthened if we areto restore all aspects of democracy. Our efforts in thatregard have been clear. We have established a civiliannational intelligence agency  as well as a civilian bodyresponsible for presidential security. We now have adefence policy in keeping with the principles ofdemocratic security that was the product of an opendebate among the members of our society. We havedesigned laws to provide for free access to information the declassification of secret State archives and theestablishment of civilian controls over securityfunctions  which includes an advisory council onsecurity. Those efforts are well under way and shouldbe fully implemented during the next few years.Promoting a culture of peace has not been easy.The trauma of war continues to hamper trust in oursociety. Political polarization also exists  as a result ofpowerful economic and military groups defending theirprivileges. However  human life is less endangered andthe democratization process continues to moveforward.I will fulfil two other basic commitments in theremaining 114 days of my presidency. One of them willbe to ensure that Guatemalans are able to take part in afree and transparent electoral process that is closelymonitored by the international community and inwhich all political forces participate without exception.Such an event will be taking place for only the secondtime in our history during the past century.The second commitment involves carrying out anorderly transition of power that safeguards the reformsbegun in the context of the Peace Agreements. To thatend  I have worked with my Government team to comeup with a basic transition agenda that includesproviding for continuity in programmes and policiesand the strengthening of institutions involved in thepeace process.I would now like to turn briefly to some of theissues we will be dealing with during this session. Inparticular  I would like to respond to the challenge thatthe Secretary-General put before us this morning namely  how to rethink the United Nations in thesetimes of fundamental changes.As I have already said  we fully support theUnited Nations as the highest proponent ofmultilateralism. We also firmly support the stewardshipof Secretary-General Kofi Annan. We concur with hisview that it is imperative that we adapt theOrganization to the exigencies of globalization. Wewill also support efforts aimed at improving themanagerial capacities of the Secretariat and atpromoting the reform of intergovernmental bodies.We therefore believe that we should not delay ourefforts to make the Security Council morerepresentative  and its procedures more transparent.Moreover  we think that it is necessary to strengthenthe General Assembly and the Economic and SocialCouncil in order that the three principal organs of ourOrganization mutually support one another.We reiterate our opposition to all forms ofterrorism and we support the collective efforts of theinternational community to combat that scourge.We believe that the United Nations shouldcontinue to give priority to the essential issue ofdevelopment. Along with multilateral financialorganizations  our Organization should dedicate itselfto the task of ensuring that the benefits of globalizationare widely shared among all the inhabitants of theworld. We also stress the singular importance of theMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan ofAction.We express our disappointment at the lack ofprogress made at the recent meeting of trade ministersheld in Cancún. As part of the G-21  we commitourselves to working constructively to bring togetherthe positions of all parties to produce a more open and15transparent international trade regime that providesmore opportunities for developing countries.We also underscore the need to give greaterimportance in the international agenda to the situationof immigrants and migrant workers while focusing onundocumented immigrants  who constitute a vulnerablegroup vis-à-vis the need to protect human rights.I would especially like to refer to the subject ofchildren and to the obligation of States to guaranteetheir rights and protection. A case in point is the effortthat is taking place in the context of the Convention onthe Rights of the Child to re-establish links betweenthree Guatemalan children and their mother  GabrielaArias.We support all efforts to put an end to the tragicspiral of violence afflicting the Middle East and toachieve a just and lasting peace in that long-sufferingregion.We associate ourselves with efforts aimed atrestoring peace  security and the rule of law in Iraq  aswell as to reinstate that country’s sovereignty. We sharethe view that the United Nations should play asignificant role in that undertaking.We support the heartfelt aspiration of the 23million citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan tobe represented in international organizations such asthe United Nations. Guatemala  like all of CentralAmerica  believes those aspirations to be a positiveforce for peace and democracy in the world.We are making our best effort to strengthen thebonds of friendship and neighbourliness with Belize without prejudice to the search for ways to peacefully honourably  equitably and permanently resolve ourterritorial dispute. We express our complete willingnessto continue to seek a negotiated solution to that disputewithin the framework of the Organization of AmericanStates.We reiterate our devotion to  and support for Central American integration  as well as our solidaritywith  and commitment to  all of Latin America and theCaribbean.We live in exceptional times that affect each andevery one of our countries  as well as the UnitedNations as a whole. Such critical moments createopportunities for re-evaluation and change. I hope thatGod will grant us the wisdom to take advantage ofthose opportunities  thereby making it possible for usto overcome the obstacles that have served to distracthumankind from a future of solidarity and commonwelfare."
"71",2957,"GUY",58,2003,"﻿It is a great pleasure for me toaddress the General Assembly under the presidency ofa fellow citizen of our Caribbean Community. Allowme to extend our warmest congratulations and goodwishes to you  Sir  as you discharge the functions ofyour high office.I offer our esteemed Secretary-General ourappreciation for his astute and steadfast leadership inthese times of great challenge to the Organization. Iwould also like to pay tribute to his dedicated staff many of whom have lost their lives in service to theUnited Nations.In 1953  the people of Guyana were allowed forthe first time to exercise their democratic franchiseunder universal adult suffrage to elect the Governmentof their choice. Today  50 years later  my country haslearned  through the painful experience of misrule andmismanagement  the vital importance of democracy toour future as a nation. We recognize that to fosterdevelopment  reduce poverty and safeguard humandignity  democracy must be allowed to grow and takeroot. Having laid the basic foundation for goodgovernance through free and fair elections  we nowface the task of building a more prosperous and justsociety.4 To that end  my Government has embarked on aprocess of consultation and collaboration with allsectors of our population  including political parties the private sector and non-governmental organizations.Through the recent reform of the Constitution provisions have been made to enhance fiscaltransparency  provide greater inclusiveness andguarantee the fundamental rights of our people. Thosemeasures include six independent commissions onhuman rights  ethnic relations  women and genderequity  indigenous peoples  the rights of the child andpublic procurement.Moreover  in an effort to foster greater socialcohesion in Guyana  we recently invited the UnitedNations Special Rapporteur on Racism to visit andengage the various sectors of Guyanese society so thatthe international community can be informed of thebroad perspectives of our multicultural society and ofthe several measures which the Government has put inplace to promote interracial harmony.In further consolidation of the democraticprocess  my Government has embarked upon aprogramme to reform the justice and security systemsin our society by building capacity for the prevention investigation and resolution of crime and for theimprovement of the administration of justice. Much hasbeen accomplished in that area  but much more remainsto be done.At the same time  we have taken severaldevelopment initiatives that will ultimately lead to abetter life for all our people. Among them are thenational development strategy and the povertyreduction strategy. We have worked hard to providebetter housing  health and education facilities for ourpeople and have managed to make signal progress inreducing poverty. And by stimulating investment  weare creating new opportunities for development. Wenow look to the future with the renewed hope that wewill be able to overcome the many challenges to ourpolitical  economic and social progress.However  in the face of a persistent debt burden drastically reduced development assistance and everpresent protectionist barriers  and in the prevailingclimate of international tension and uncertainty  manydeveloping countries  Guyana included  are made morevulnerable  and prospects for growth are severelyimpaired. The failure of the recently concluded CancunConference does not make us sanguine about thefuture. The international community is now hardlylikely to reach the Millennium Declaration targets thatwere set by this Assembly three years ago.The fate of nations  especially of those as smallas ours  lies not in our hands alone. The process ofglobalization has made us acutely aware of the need forgreater interdependence and international cooperationif we are to survive the many threats to our welfare.That interdependence is the basis for multilateralismand for the United Nations.The Charter of the Organization reflects ourcollective commitment to cooperate to promote peaceand development. However  we have yet to fullyhonour that commitment. Regrettably  the world inwhich we live now  while placing a high premium ondemocracy at the national level  fails to live up to thatideal in the international councils that shape ourcommon destiny. We are concerned at that doublestandard  as the aspirations of humankind for peace security and development cannot be fulfilled withoutthe effective participation of all States in global affairs.Especially disconcerting is the practice by somecountries and international financial institutions to relyon anecdotal or partial information   often fromquestionable sources   to assess the performance of agiven country. Needless to say  that can be verydamaging to the particular economy concerned  as iteffectively deters further aid and investment. Similarly we are concerned by the inordinate delay in the releaseof development funds. The Heavily Indebted PoorCountries Debt Initiative  which was conceived as ameans of assisting seriously indebted poor countries has been unconscionably delayed. Meanwhile  the poorof our countries must face continuing hardship andsuffering. They cannot be held hostage for much longer.The success of international cooperation  andindeed of the United Nations system  will be determinedby how well they respond to the interests and concerns ofnot only the powerful but also the powerless  and notonly of the rich but  most urgently  of the poor. If truthbe told  their record thus far leaves much to be desired.It is therefore imperative that a credible and effectivesystem of global governance be established as quicklyas possible. That will require a more fundamentalreform of the United Nations  and indeed of the entiremultilateral system  than we have seen so far.After several crises in the decade of the 1990s there was a strong call for reform of the international5 financial architecture to provide greater macroeconomicstability. The urgency of the campaign appears to havediminished  however  even though the threat of furthercalamity remains. Attempts to strengthen the role ofthe United Nations in the development process now lagbehind  denying our countries a greater say in thedecision-making process pertaining to issues that affectour welfare. Nor have we been able to develop aneffective security system to protect countries particularly the weak and small  from encroachmentson their sovereignty and territorial integrity.Our world continues to be subject to a wide arrayof threats to international peace and security. Werecently witnessed a series of terrible human tragedies.Many thousands have died as a result. If there is onelesson to be learned  it is that violence accomplishesnothing. Only through dialogue and negotiation bolstered by social justice  can lasting solutions tothose problems be found. It is therefore imperative thatthe United Nations  the multilateral Organization towhich we all belong  be strengthened to effectivelypromote peace and development.It is time that the United Nations SecurityCouncil  which has the primary responsibility under theCharter for international peace and security  be mademore representative of the wider internationalcommunity. The Council must be expanded  and therole of developing countries in that body appropriatelystrengthened. To that end  Guyana is prepared tosupport the candidacies of Brazil  India and an Africancountry for permanent seats on the Council  as well asa suitable number of non-permanent seats for otherdeveloping countries. That expansion will no doubtenable it to better cope with the challenges thatconflicts  both old and new  pose to global peace anddevelopment.Neither the many speeches that we make nor theseveral strategies that we occasionally devise in thehope of building global peace and development willever accomplish much unless they are followed up byappropriate action. Sad to say  our frequentdeclarations of intent are not matched by deeds  afailure that can be explained only by the lack of seriouspurpose on the part of many Member States. We haveyet to transcend selfish national interests to reach ahigher plane of interdependence and multilateralism. Iurge the international community to rethink its policiesand to seriously consider the advantages of a morebalanced and equitable system of relations.The world in which we now live calls for greaterinternational solidarity and cooperation  not less. Wemust therefore ensure that those ideals are at theforefront of our deliberations at the General Assemblyand that we take practical steps to ensure andstrengthen our common home  the United Nations."
"72",3003,"HND",58,2003,"﻿This is the first time that I come the house of thepeoples of the United Nations. This is also a crucialtime in history  as it is for the Organization. A fewyears ago  the international community met in this Hallto restructure the agenda for the new millennium. Weplaced pressing issues and commonalities on thatagenda  as well as the vision and goals necessary toguide our work. In fact  that agenda became our guideto ensure international peace and security  democraticgovernance and the joining of efforts to combat themost serious scourges afflicting the peoples of theworld. That notwithstanding  a condemnable terroristattack changed the course of our common agenda andforced all nations of the world to make adjustments tothe priorities that had been set. Security then becamethe key  most pressing and compelling focus ofcollective action.Honduras rejects and condemns terrorism in allits forms and manifestations  regardless of where ittakes place and regardless of its material andintellectual authors. In that regard  our Organization wherein reside the hopes and desires of all the peoplesof the world  also suffered the backlash of that newthreat that sows terror and suffering. From this rostrum I wish to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello  a victimof injustice and fratricidal hatred.4Aware of our responsibilities as a member of theUnited Nations  Honduras and the Government overwhich I preside have fully assumed their commitmentto the challenges before us. It is for that reason thatHonduras today is party to a greater number ofinternational conventions aimed at guaranteeing thesecurity of the inhabitants of the planet. Despite ourmodest resources  we have responded to SecurityCouncil resolutions by sending a clearly humanitarianmission  comprised of a contingent from the Honduranarmed forces  to Iraq in order to contribute to thereconstruction  stability and democratization of afriendly people. In the same spirit  Honduras hasrenewed its commitment to the United Nations Missionfor the Referendum in Western Sahara.In addition  along with our sister republics inCentral America  we have worked arduously to developa plan to prevent and combat terrorism  as well as aplan to fight organized crime in all its manifestations. Ihave also proposed to the heads of State andGovernment of Central America timely initiatives toincrease the exchange of information and to establish aregional regime for arrests that will keep criminalsfrom enjoying impunity simply by crossing the bordersof Central America. I am also pleased to report that weCentral Americans have moved forward with an agendato ensure adequate limits and a balance in weapons.That will make it possible for us to invest the resourcesfreed up in priority social areas.We have done all of that without forgetting orsetting aside the extraordinary declaration of solidarityand commitment that we have all undertaken toeradicate poverty and hunger. Our commitment andfocused efforts have been appropriately reflected in theHuman Development Report  which was recentlypresented in the Latin American and Caribbean regionby the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP). My Government and people were extremelyhonoured to have been selected as the site of thatpresentation. It is clear from the UNDP report that compared to averages in other countries  Honduras hasbeen able to considerably reduce inequality vis-‡-vis itseconomic growth. In other words  although relativelylow  economic growth in Honduras during the reportingperiod was rather equitable. We have also made verysignificant progress in social spheres and in the area ofinstitutional reform  and we have benefited from thesupport of the United Nations in that regard.We would like to express our gratitude for ouraccess to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosisand Malaria  which has made it possible to considerablyincrease our focus on those diseases to historical levels.Again with the support of the Organization  wehave greatly expanded our school lunch programme. Injust 20 months  from an initial figure of 16 per cent  wehave succeeded in reaching 80 per cent of the childrenwho were going to school hungry. That programme isbeing carried out with the support of the World FoodProgramme (WFP). It also serves as a model for a WFPprogramme that purchases ingredients for town mayorsand mothers of families that are then used to distributeprepared meals. Meal costs in that programme amountto $.09 per meal  which means that it costs $18 to feeda child during 200 school days.We have also achieved considerable progress inthe area of institutional reform  thanks to an agreementsigned during the last electoral process by all politicalparties in Honduras  under the aegis of the UnitedNations Development Programme (UNDP) office inHonduras. At the centre of that agreement is the factthat an independent superior court of justice has beenestablished. In addition  the main State monitoringbody is now more independent  electoral bodies arebeing made more professional and other reforms ofgreat importance for democracy are being carried outto strengthen the trust of citizens in their institutions.The UNDP has also been involved in ourprogramme to reduce corruption. We have establishedan aggressive programme to delegate much of theState's procurement to UNDP and other non-governmental organizations in order to ensure honestyand avoid the temptation of corruption.My Government has therefore come to this worldforum with facts testifying to our desire to followthrough with our commitments to reduce inequality andexclusion. However  Honduras is also here in the hopethat the slow pace of human development in the worldcan  because it must  be overcome with increased andheightened international solidarity. I therefore appealthat the opportunities and benefits of globalization bemade more equitable and just for all peoples and nations.In that regard  I should like to refer to theOrganization. The United Nations must increasingly bethe meeting place for cultures and civilizations.Common effort is essential to achieve the purposes weagreed upon in San Francisco  and which we enshrined5in the Charter. We need a more efficient Organizationto meet the challenges faced by peoples and to be ableto channel our differences towards the peaceful causeswe have agreed upon.Undoubtedly  there are pressing situations thatrequire our attention. The situation in the Middle Eastis of great concern to us. As in other countries  peoplewhose ancestors came from that part of the world livepeacefully in our country. They  along with allHondurans  want peace to be a reality for the Palestinianand Jewish peoples  as well as for others in the region.Hanging by a thread  peace in the Middle East isprecarious. It is our clear duty to strengthen that peace.We are also concerned by clashes on the Africancontinent and by the hotbeds of tension that occasionallyflare up in Asia  whose consequences  were they todevelop further  could jeopardize the entire world.Good sense must always prevail. It is for thatreason that we look forward to promising results fromthe negotiating table. Peace in the world is our peace.We are therefore committed to respecting andpromoting human rights. While respecting humanrights  Honduras is also committed to combating thevarious scourges besetting our societies.Today in Honduras we have a very seriousproblem with juvenile crime  which has reachedalarming levels that affect all of our citizens. In thatregard  I would like to highlight one aspect of thatviolence. A number of years ago  criminal activity ledto the tragic deaths of a number of young people underthe age of 18. Given that tragic situation  myGovernment established a presidential commission forthe physical and moral protection of young people. Italso ordered an investigation of this phenomenonwhose results were published in September 2002. Inaddition  we have set up a special unit to investigatethe death of minors  which ensures that suchreprehensible crimes are punished. In that connection Honduras has adopted the recommendations containedin the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial summary or arbitrary executions of the Commission onHuman Rights  which has already begun to producevery positive results.The time is ripe to categorically reiterate that theState of Honduras does not in any way tolerate  acceptor promote the killing of children and young people.We have committed a considerable amount of ourlimited resources to mitigate  and if possible eradicate this affront to human dignity. It is inconceivable for aviolent minority to take hostage and threaten thepeaceful and honest majority. Organized civil society isworking on behalf of the majority of Hondurans in thateffort  and together we are succeeding in reducing thelevel of crime in its various forms.In order to deal with that evil   which is closelyrelated to other forms of international crime  such asdrug trafficking and terrorism  whose causes extend farbeyond my homeland   my Government requiresunderstanding and brotherly support from theinternational community. We also require thatunderstanding and support in order that we can reachsatisfactory agreements with the International MonetaryFund  thereby making possible the comprehensiveimplementation of the Stockholm Agenda for theReconstruction and Transformation of Central America.Foreign debt relief must not continue to be mere words; itmust become a reality. With the resources freed up bydebt relief  my Government and the Governments tofollow will have on hand extremely valuable capital tocontinue to combat poverty  illiteracy and HIV/AIDSand to meet other goals of the Millennium agenda.Cooperation and solidarity is an obligation  notcharity. It is an assumed commitment. Honduras hopesthat greater and immediate efforts will be made so thatthe percentages agreed upon for cooperation willbecome a reality. We also recognize the fact thatglobalization  and specifically with regard to increasedinternational trade  holds out the promise of growth forour peoples. We are involved in negotiating a free tradeagreement with the United States and Canada  and willdo the same with the European Union and others nextyear. However  we would ask more developed countriesto allow our products access to their markets  whichnow benefit from outdated protection schemes.We also ask for the elimination of agriculturalsubsidies  as well as for better benefits for ourproducers  who today receive only a minimal part ofthe value of the fruits of their labour. I would like torefer to the case of coffee as an example of the lack ofequity in the added value of basic goods from ourregion. The recent crisis in the price of coffee beanshas led to the unemployment of 600 000 persons inCentral America. Over 80 000 small producers  most ofwhom are poor people from rural regions  carry outcoffee production in Honduras. That is an enormousadvantage during times when prices are good  becauseit provides a very efficient mechanism for the social6distribution of income. However  the contrary is truenow that prices are at historical lows.Six years ago  in 1997  it was estimated that thetotal value of the retail coffee market was $30 billion.Forty per cent of that amount  which is to say  $12billion  was returned to producers. Today that marketprice has more than doubled  to $65 billion. However producers are now getting less than half of what theyhad been getting  namely  $5.5 billion; which means thatonly 9 per cent of the final market value goes toproducers. I wish to reiterate that it is essential that weredistribute the benefits of globalization and that weincrease solidarity.That situation is not limited to just one of ourexport products. The actual terms of trade for our mainexport products conspire against democratic governance but the Honduran people require  as I have said  clearactions to redistribute the benefits of globalization andincrease levels of solidarity.International peace and security require all ourefforts. The attitude adopted on conflicts is veryimportant. Hence  Honduras is taking part in two casesbefore the International Court of Justice. In both cases Honduras has come forward in peace to seek justice.We are certain that in the case of El Salvador  therewill be a positive outcome to the 1992 ruling of theCourt. In the case of Nicaragua  we are also certain thatthe definition the International Court adopts regardingour respective maritime claims will be fully respected.Honduras has always faithfully and strictly compliedwith international rulings. Rest assured  Sir  of our firmdetermination to respect in both these cases thedecisions of the International Court of Justice.I cannot leave this rostrum of universalconscience without expressing my congratulations toyou  Sir  on your election and wishing you everysuccess in your sensitive tasks."
"73",3027,"HRV",58,2003,"﻿Seldom has the world'sattention been so focused on the United Nations;seldom has so much been expected of thisOrganization. The question now being askedthroughout the world is: Is the United Nationsexperiencing the deepest crisis in its history  and doesit still play a fundamental role in internationalrelations?'Today  at the beginning of the twenty-firstcentury  the main reason for the existence of ourOrganization is the same as it was 60 years ago: tomaintain world peace  reached at the cost of millions oflives; and to contribute  in an ongoing manner  to thewell-being of humankind all over the world.We live in a world where no one can go it alone without the help of others  however big and powerfulthey may be. Global solutions require the concertedand united efforts of all countries and of all theinhabitants of our planet.Our Organization is a joint effort by the worldcommunity that is persistently searching for solutionsto the ever-growing problems of our time. I emphasizethe phrase our Organization'  for sometimes it seemsthat we expect the United Nations administration aloneto solve our problems. We tend to forget that the27United Nations is not some abstract institution with awill of its own   one that we depend on   but that theUnited Nations is the will of each and every one of its191 Member States. We alone are responsible for thewill  the decisions  the work and the activities of theUnited Nations.There is no doubt whatsoever that the UnitedNations needs to be reformed. In this connection Croatia welcomes and fully supports the Secretary-General's September report on the implementation ofthe Millennium Declaration. When discussing ourOrganization's reform  especially reform of theSecurity Council  but also that of the GeneralAssembly  we must be aware that this is a matter of ourown political will and readiness to accept change.Unfortunately  and this should be openly stated so far there has not been enough political will to movefrom debates on the subject to actual reform. Croatia isconvinced that reform of the Security Council isnecessary and should no longer be put off. In fact  weourselves decided in the Millennium Declaration thatwe would intensify joint efforts to achievecomprehensive reforms of the Security Council in allits aspects. We have an opportunity to do this at thissession of the General Assembly.Croatia has never been a member of the SecurityCouncil. However  in the 1990s Croatia acquiredconsiderable experience in the work of that organ andlearned about its good points and its shortcomings  itsimportance and its true scope. Therefore  unless itadapts to the new realities in international relations  theCouncil will not be able to maintain its credibility andauthority in all parts of the world. What is required isadherence to the principle of equitable representationof all United Nations Members in the Security Council.Croatia is prepared further to intensify itsactivities as an active promoter of regional and worldpeace. With this in mind  Croatia has presented itscandidacy for membership in the Security Council forthe 2008-2009 mandate. Croatia's membership in theSecurity Council would represent a great tribute to mycountry and a recognition of all that has been achievedin bringing peace to South-eastern Europe  which hasfound the strength  after many years of war  to embracethe path of good-neighbourly relations.The fight against international terrorism is highon Croatia's list of priorities. Two years after the 11September terrorist attacks on the United States  westand firmly by our American allies and all those whorefuse to accept terror  fanaticism and killing as ameans of resolving problems between peoples andcountries. Our collective duty to maintain internationalpeace and security  which stems from the Charter of theUnited Nations  provides an international frameworkfor a decisive response to terrorism in the twenty-firstcentury.Croatia's forces are participating in bringingpeace and stability to Afghanistan. Croatia is aware ofthe fact that concerted action by all democraticcountries is the best response to terrorism. The fightagainst terrorism requires not only action by thedemocratic coalition at a global level  but also that ofeach of its members at the national and regional levels.It is equally important that we intensify our activitiesto assist countries lagging behind in economicdevelopment and other areas. Inequality  injustice andignorance are fertile breeding grounds for the seeds ofterrorism.Croatia is still dealing with the consequences ofthe war imposed on it and does not have the economicresources to participate as a donor in the action for thereconstruction of Iraq. However  Croatia stands readyto offer its wealth of experience in post-warreconstruction  especially in construction work  as wellas the knowledge and operative capacities required fordealing with post-war confidence-building strengthening the country's stability  normalizing life and mending the tears left by the war in the fabric ofcivil society. I am thinking in particular of theknowledge and experience acquired in civil policetraining and activities.Events in the Middle East confirm that greatercourage is required to reach a compromise and ensurecoexistence than to wage battles; Croatia knows this alltoo well. We are also aware of the importance of timelyresolutions of the Security Council and GeneralAssembly  which must be fine-tuned to meet thechallenges and needs of the peace process  keepingabreast of realities in the field and encouraging agreatly needed agreement. We hope that in itsforthcoming work the General Assembly will take thisinto account when adopting new resolutions on theMiddle East.The importance of United Nations peacekeepingoperations has been recognized on many occasions.The mandate and character of peacekeeping operations28have been significantly transformed  from operationsaimed primarily at disengaging warring parties intocomplex missions for building democratic systems protecting and promoting human rights  strengtheningcivil society and establishing the groundwork for thesustainable development of independent States.This complexity  and the frequent overlapping ofmandates  requires a high degree of expertise invarious areas: from holding democratic elections anddeveloping judicial systems to establishing police andmilitary forces that meet international standards andbasic international legal regulations.The United Nations is the only global institutionthat can respond to the challenges of simultaneouslyestablishing regional stability  introducing post-warreconstruction and building a democratic society.The United Nations has paid a high price in itspeace efforts. I would like to take this occasion to onceagain express Croatia's condolences to the families ofthe victims of the recent barbaric attacks on UnitedNations headquarters in Baghdad  and to re-emphasizethat such attacks strengthen our belief that thedevelopment of collective security systems and globalsolidarity must continue.Croatia is currently participating in five UnitedNations peacekeeping missions   in Ethiopia andEritrea  India and Pakistan  Sierra Leone  Timor-Lesteand Western Sahara.We are determined to further intensify ourparticipation in United Nations peacekeeping missions in line with our physical and financial capabilitiesregarding the composition and number of troopsdeployed  as well as theatres of operation. Croatia feelsthat as a country that received United Nationspeacekeeping forces at a time when its sovereignty andterritorial integrity were attacked  and as a countrywhich hosted one of the United Nations most extensiveoperations  it now has a moral obligation to contributethis experience to securing peace and prosperity inother parts of the world.I would particularly like to stress the importanceof closer cooperation between the Security Council andtroop contributing countries. We welcome the positivechanges that have so far occurred in this respect. It isalso important to ensure the necessary exchange ofviews between the Security Council and the countrieson whose territory the peacekeeping operations arebeing conducted. This is not only a question of duerespect of those countries' sovereignty  but it is also away of acquiring full insight into its needs andpriorities.I also believe that there is the need for theestablishment of closer links and better coordination inthe work of the United Nations main bodies  especiallybetween the Economic and Social Council and theSecurity Council. The Economic and Social Counciland its commissions possess exceptional knowledgeand experience important for the building of post-conflict societies  something we were able to see forourselves last year when Croatia presided over thisbody. The establishment of working groups for Guinea-Bissau and for Burundi were steps in the rightdirection  and we hope that this experience will be usedto further the involvement of the Economic and SocialCouncil in processes of maintaining and buildingpeace.The Millennium Declaration  this joint vision ofall United Nations members for a more just and betterworld  is a beacon we must follow. Not only must wefollow it  we must ensure that its goals are fullyimplemented. In this context  Croatia would like to seethe Economic and Social Council play a greater role inthe general implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration. Therefore  Croatia supports the idea of ahigh-level dialogue on the achievement of the Goals setout in the Millennium Declaration taking place at thenext General Assembly session.As a member of the United Nations Commissionon Human Rights  Croatia supports the universalratification of international instruments in the field ofhuman rights. The Commission should continueunhindered in its activities while carrying out itsmandate. In an effort to promote and protect the humanrights of all people  Croatia is devoting specialattention to the human rights of women  children refugees and disabled persons  and to the human rightsof members of national minorities.Although much has been done in the past periodto improve the position of women in society andpromote principles of gender equality  the internationalcommunity still has an obligation to intensify efforts toprevent all forms of violence against women  and musttry to include women in decision-making processes ensuring empowerment of women at all levels. Againstthis background I am proud to say that Croatia has29provided the first woman participant in the UnitedNations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.Apart from terrorism  one of the biggest securitythreats in the world is the proliferation of nuclear andother weapons of mass destruction. TheComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is  webelieve  particularly important in ensuring that the goalof nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament isattained. We are concerned by the fact that although theTreaty was opened for signature and ratification sevenyears ago  it still has not entered into force. Theuniversal character of this Treaty is of greatsignificance and we call on all States that have notacceded to the Treaty to do so as soon as possible.Croatia welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General and the United Nations to raise the level ofawareness throughout the world of the importance ofthe rule of law and of acceding to internationalinstruments in this area. As a member State of theRome Statute of the International Criminal Court Croatia has actively participated in the pioneeringendeavour of setting up a new international ordersymbolized by the International Criminal Court  whichhas rightly been termed the embodiment of ourcollective conscience.Croatia is firmly set on the path of accession tothe European Union. Croatia  whose strategic nationalgoal is to join the European Union  remains dedicatedto the continual promotion of friendly relations with allits neighbours and to the policy of open borders allowing the flow of people  goods and services  butalso to that of keeping its borders firmly closed to allforms of transnational crime and illegal migration.Croatia will continue to actively participate inregional  European and worldwide initiatives andorganizations  respecting all its internationalobligations. For us  the United Nations remains acentral point for resolving problems in internationalrelations and for promoting the interests of mankind. Iam certain that this year's General Assembly sessionwill reconfirm the importance of the United Nationsand open a new chapter in our organization's activitiesin building peace and security."
"74",3072,"HTI",58,2003,"﻿It is myhonour to greet the President on behalf of the people ofHaiti  and I congratulate our dear friend and brotherMr. Julian Hunte  President of this session of theGeneral Assembly.After having celebrated in 1992 500 years ofIndian  black and popular resistance  the Republic ofHaiti will celebrate on 1 January 2004 the bicentennialanniversary of its independence. From this moment on the first black republic of the world most warmlywelcomes you to that celebration of freedom. Auniversal value  that freedom  won in 1804 by ourancestors  must direct us  day and night  towards peace.Because of the genocide inflicted first on theIndians  then on 15 million Africans  wrested fromtheir native land and thrown in chains of slavery ontothe soil of Haiti in 1502  there could be no peace.During those three centuries of genocide  our continentprovided 70 per cent of the entire world's gold  or2 849 tons of gold  valued at $36 billion.Of course  slavery is a crime against humanity. Itis therefore the binding obligation of our generation toenshrine in the museum of civilization the gold bookdedicated to reparation and restitution.Yesterday there was trafficking in blacks. Tomorrowwill be the celebration of blacks   of blacks who are freeand free forever so that peace will finally reign.Therefore  1 January 2004  will be a celebrationfor all freedom-loving blacks and whites; a celebrationand a holiday for all peoples who thirst for freedom andpeace. Thus  we wish to proceed from this bicentennialof freedom to achieve a millennium of peace.7In that context  the Republic of Haiti is aiming atsustainable development  to make it possible to achievethe Millennium Development Goals adopted here in2000 by the world's heads of State and Government.The reduction by half  by 2015  of the percentage ofthe world's population whose income is less than onedollar a day is indeed an enormous challenge. Yes  it isan enormous challenge to be met  given theacceleration of economic globalization.In this vast space of freedom  where unfortunately  it has not yet been possible to break thechains of abject poverty  four fifths of the world'sinhabitants are users of only one fifth of the planet'sentire resources. While global production of basic foodproducts represents 110 per cent of global needs  30million people die of hunger every year. To achieve theMillennium Development Goals in Haiti  the exerciseof power entails respect for fundamental freedoms tolerance and good governance; a war on the evils ofcorruption  drug trafficking and impunity; investmentin human beings  security for all  and the holding offree  honest and democratic elections.For the birth of a new Haiti and the advent of abetter world  we are opposed to the extinction offreedom  as well as to that of our species andecosystems. In the Caribbean and in Latin America  thedeterioration of the environment is affecting 300million hectares of land and nearly 30 per cent of coralreefs. Over the past three decades  of 400 millionhectares of natural forest that have perished throughoutthe world  40 per cent are in the Caribbean and LatinAmerican regions. It goes without saying that thepoorest segment of our peoples consequently suffer and their suffering is our pain.While scientists at the Stockholm summitemphasized the extermination of 150 species of birdsand the threat of extinction of 1 000 others  the burningissue today focuses on life or the gradual extinction ofthe human species. That is demonstrated by theHIV/AIDS pandemic. There are 42 million infectedpersons throughout the world; 3.1 million deaths; 13million orphans whose parents have been decimated bythe virus; and 6 000 young people who are infectedwith HIV every day.The attempt to effectively combat this pandemicmeans opting inevitably for the eradication of poverty.The First Lady of the Republic has written that theburden of the foreign debt and economic sanctions areobviously not paving the way for such eradication.Indeed  in the Caribbean and in Latin America the foreign debt entails an average net transfer of 25billion dollars annually to the North. In other words the aggregate value of that debt exceeds half of thegross domestic product (GDP) of the region.Throughout this collective and historic marchtowards the Millennium Goals  we hope that thecontribution of the rich countries to sustainabledevelopment will rise from 0.2 to 0.7 per cent of theirgross national product (GNP).Numerous observers have expressed theirgratification at observing the reduction in globalmilitary spending on a worldwide scale during the lastdecade of the twentieth century. From 1985 to 1998 those expenditures declined from 1 210.5 billion to803.7 billion dollars. The drop in military spending andthe rise in spending for human development will  webelieve  promote both human and economic growth.The Republic of Haiti will continue  unceasingly  tofight against violence and terrorism. It hopes  however that this uncontrollable need will not lead to steppingup an arms race or the proliferation of deadly weaponsthroughout the world.Terrorism and bio-terrorism are by no meansmere hallucinations. To live in freedom and to live inpeace there is a need to eradicate violence wherever itmay come from. May we finally see the dawn of an eraof peace in the Middle East  in Afghanistan  in Africa in Asia and in Iraq  wherever wars are inflicting untoldsuffering on mankind. Since 1989  the end of the coldwar  there have been more than 60 armed conflictsclaiming the lives of hundreds of thousands ofindividuals and creating more than 17 million refugees.Violence and slavery are sources of darkness.Peace and freedom are sources of light. Our world isseeking that light. That light  like freedom  isabsolutely indispensable for life on earth.Impoverished  but aware of its human  cultural andhistoric riches  Haiti shines beyond the darkness ofcolonization like a beacon of freedom.Let us humbly say:The first black republic of the worldIs and continues to be the geographical axis offreedom for blacks.8(Spoke in Haitian Creole)Haiti is the mother of liberty Her sons and daughters are the fruits of humandignity.(Spoke in French)Haiti is the mother of liberty Her sons and daughters are the fruits of humandignity.May it shine  may it shine day and night  thatlight of freedom! Thanks to Albert Einstein  we knowthat light is made up of particles and therefore impliesa flow of photons. Thanks to Toussaint Louverture  weknow that liberty is a radiant source of light  giving offphotons of dignity  justice and peace. May the blazinglight of liberty shine throughout the world.Our ancestors and your ancestors freed the slavesfrom their chains. Today  let us unite to free the worldfrom the chains of inhuman poverty. Then we shall seea reign of happiness  justice and peace at the heart ofall nations and in Haiti  where you will be all warmlywelcomed to celebrate the bicentennial of ourindependence."
"75",3118,"HUN",58,2003,"﻿Allow me to extend toyou  Sir  our sincere congratulations on your electionas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession. You may rest assured of my delegation’s fullsupport in the discharge of your importantresponsibilities.It is my painful duty to pay  along with so manyof us  a tribute to the memory of Sergio Vieira deMello and his associates  who sacrificed their lives forthe people of Iraq in the service of peace and theUnited Nations. Our heart goes out to the families ofthe victims of that cowardly terrorist act.The world was shocked and saddened when amost respected colleague  and a close friend of mine the late Anna Lindh  the Swedish Foreign Minister  fellvictim to a senseless act of crime in Stockholm. Hervision of the world and her deep commitment to theprinciples and purposes of the United Nations willcontinue to be a source of inspiration to all of us.4Hungary aligned itself with the statementdelivered by the presidency of the European Unionduring the general debate and fully supports it.We live in a world of great opportunities andserious challenges. It is in this context that globalproblems require global and concerted solutions. Tothat effect  we must use the potentials of the UnitedNations to make the best use of opportunities at hand.In that respect  maintaining or restoring peace andstability  non-proliferation  development and humanrights are in the focus of attention of the internationalcommunity. International terrorism  the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction  grave armed internalconflicts  poverty and illegal migration constituteenormous challenges to all of us.Hungary remains strongly committed tomultilateral institutions. We are firmly convinced thatthe United Nations can and should play a major role inmeeting the multifaceted and ever growing challengesof our contemporary world. We  for our part  are deeplydevoted to assisting that role. Along with our partnersin the European Union  we are more than prepared tostrengthen the United Nations as a unique instrumentof a strong multilateral system to tackle global andregional issues for the sake of a safer and more secureworld. We will spare no effort to take an active part inmaintaining peace and security  enhancing the non-proliferation regimes  protecting and promoting humanrights and fundamental freedoms  and establishinginternational standards.The global fight against international terrorismmust remain a major priority of the United Nations. Inthis context  we support the full and effectiveimplementation of the relevant Security Councilresolutions. Hungary is keenly interested in wideningthe scope of multilateral instruments in the fightagainst terrorism.After the success of the coalition forces inbringing freedom and the opportunities of democracyin Iraq  we have to turn our attention to thereconstruction and development of that long-sufferingcountry. Hungary is strongly committed to supportingthe Iraqi people. Our fellow Hungarians are servingwith the coalition forces. We will also attend thedonors conference in Madrid later this fall.We are closely following developments regardingthe United Nations assumption of an ever-increasingrole in Iraq. I would like to stress that the UnitedNations has to assume its share of the work both inrestoring the sovereignty of Iraq and in thereconstruction process. I believe that our Organization with ample experience elsewhere  can play asignificant role in the establishment of democraticinstitutions  the rule of law  respect for human rightsand election-monitoring. We are studying intensivelyour possible contributions to this process. For the timebeing  though  our priority must be the stabilization ofthe security situation in Iraq and the normalization ofday-to-day life.Hungary is deeply concerned by the grave anddeteriorating situation in the Middle East. We believethat the implementation of the road map is the onlyframework for reaching a political settlement. Aneffective and credible monitoring mechanism is ofcritical importance to that effect. The Quartet shouldcarry on with its mission in the peace process. We callupon both the Israeli Government and the PalestinianAuthority to dedicate all their efforts to the full andunconditional implementation of the road map.The security situation in Afghanistan remainsfragile. The Government of Afghanistan deserves ourassistance and attention. Terrorist acts and illicit drug-trafficking are causes for serious concern. I amconfident that  with the unwavering support of theinternational community  Afghanistan will soon be abetter place for the Afghan people.The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction together with the means of their delivery  is a growingand serious threat to international peace and security.The danger of nuclear  biological and chemicalweapons in the hands of terrorist groups and States —which are a menace to our world — represents newmajor security challenges  against which we must acttogether in a resolute manner  both regionally andglobally.Earlier this year  the European Union (EU)adopted a very important and far-reaching Declarationon Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction.Hungary will work hard with its partners in the EUtowards the effective implementation of that newinstrument and of the recently agreed EU Action Plan.In the current world security environment  theTreaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(NPT) needs to be reinforced. We call on the Statesremaining outside the NPT to accede to it5unconditionally and to accept the nearly universalnorms of nuclear non-proliferation.Revelations about large-scale nuclearprogrammes and the failure to provide sufficientexplanations as to their purpose and nature have givenrise to legitimate concerns on the part of theinternational community. There is a growingrecognition — shared by Hungary — that thoseprogrammes imply serious proliferation risks as well.We view the first follow-up meeting of the Statesparties to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) held at Geneva in August this year  as encouraging.The participants rightly focused on practical actions.We look forward to seeing further progress instrengthening national implementation of the BWC atthe next meeting  in November.Hungary remains strongly committed to theinternational protection and promotion of human rightsand of fundamental freedoms  including the rights ofminorities. The United Nations is the only universalOrganization dealing with worldwide standards-setting protecting human rights and addressing violations ofhuman rights in individual Member States. All thoseefforts deserve our unqualified support.Hungary continues to attach particular importanceto the protection of the rights of minorities. Regionalinstruments aimed at improving the situation ofnational and ethnic minorities have already beenadopted to that end without major difficulties. Auniversal instrument on the rights of minorities has yetto be elaborated. We believe that  given the necessarypolitical will on the part of Member States  the UnitedNations will be able to fill that gap through aninternational minority protection system. The moreeffectively we act  the more beneficial the service thatwe will be able to provide with respect to protectingvulnerable minority groups through standards andnorms.Hungary stands ready and is willing to join othersin redoubling our efforts with regard to strengtheningthe United Nations system. Multilateral institutions arein serious need of reform  if they are to live up to theexpectations of the fast-changing political andeconomic landscape of our times. The United Nationscannot be an exception to that."
"76",3165,"IDN",58,2003,"﻿Allow me to begin bydrawing the General Assembly’s attention to the factthat  despite all its deficiencies and weaknesses  it mustbe admitted that the United Nations has demonstratedits merits and contributions  not only for humanity ingeneral but also  in particular  for its Member States.This world body has maintained minimum standardsthat every State must meet regarding the protection andpromotion of the human rights of all its citizens. TheUnited Nations has developed  and strived toimplement  international laws binding upon each andevery member. It has also instituted and put intopractice an array of legal instruments that are veryuseful in preventing and settling conflicts amongStates  as well as in promoting a framework ofcooperation among nations.I would therefore like to take this opportunity toconvey the gratitude and appreciation of my country tothe United Nations for the invaluable work it has donefor our benefit. The contributions of the Organizationto our political and economic development are wellrecorded in our history. Those contributions range fromits mediating role during the period of our struggle topreserve our national independence  from 1945 to161949  to its active participation in our efforts to employour independence wisely in our pursuit of nationaldevelopment.Our national State — which may not only be themost heterogeneous but also the largest archipelagicState in the world — is built upon racial  ethnic religious and cultural pluralities. Our people still livepredominately traditional lives  dispersed along theequator throughout over 17 000 islands. The mostdevastating financial crisis in Indonesia’s history notonly ignited conflicts between ethnic groups  but alsorevived separatist movements in several regions. Weare doing all we can to contain and defuse thoseseparatist movements. In the process  we havediminished our capacity to strengthen our economicrecovery.Beginning in 2002  while we were contendingwith those difficulties  terrorism began to inflict itsbrutality upon our homeland. We believed for quitesome time that international terrorism would spareIndonesia because we had a tradition of tolerance forhuman differences. However  we must now face thereality that Indonesia has become a target of terrorism and as a result has suffered enormous losses in humanlives. We have been wondering why those terrifyingacts were carried out. What were the underlyingreasons  motives and arguments for them? How werethey related to international terrorist networks? Whatcourse of action should be adopted to effectivelyprevent  deter and eradicate them?We have adopted a strong set of laws to preventand eradicate the threats posed by terrorism. Equippedwith those reinforced legal instruments  we havedismantled terrorist cells in the country  andprosecutors have brought members of those cells tojustice. Several of them have already been handedsentences that befit their crimes.The people of Indonesia  who are predominantlyof the Islamic faith  support that national policy. Largeand active Islamic organizations  such asMuhammadiya and Nahdlatul Ulama  as well as theIndonesian Ulemas Council and prominent Islamicfigures  are one in condemning those terrorist acts. Itshould be noted that the terrorists — who are few innumber  but fanatical — often claim that they arefighting in the name of Islam. They must be a mereminority  as Islam — which teaches equality  justiceand the kinship shared by all humankind — cannotpossibly endorse the indiscriminate killing of innocentindividuals. As in other Muslim countries  adherents ofmainstream Islam in Indonesia practice moderation andare strongly opposed to violence. Although they are asmall splinter group in the large Indonesian communityof Muslims  the perpetrators of those terrorist actsrepresent a branch of international terrorism. Themotives and justifying arguments of their movementapparently stem from the prolonged unjust attitudeexhibited by big Powers towards countries whoseinhabitants profess Islam  particularly as regardsresolving the Middle East conflict.We should truly be prudent and sensible in theface of such a long-outstanding issue. It is difficult torefute the impression that the policy on conflictresolution in the Middle East is not only unjust but alsoone-sided. Clearly  the Middle East problem is not aconflict of religions or of religious adherents  althoughsome religious nuances may be part of the issue.We are very much aware of the background ofthat situation. Whatever the reasoning espoused by anyone of us  we must all admit that the absence of a justattitude  exacerbated by a feeling of being sidelinedand ignored  in addition to the lack of a formal meansto channel aspirations  has fostered a climate forviolence and made it grow. In our view  those areactually both the seeds and roots of a problem that hasa tendency to grow and expand. Among other things that problem has also even led to devastating and tragicacts of terror.At this distinguished forum  I would like toappeal to world leaders to open the doors of their heartsin dealing with that issue  which is crucial to worldpeace  the welfare of humankind and the destiny of thehuman race. I believe we will be able to carry out thatnoble task if we are prepared to look into the problemwith clear hearts and minds. Indeed  we cannot be the“most just”; but it is necessary to have a just mind andattitude.It is depressing to observe that we have been veryslow in understanding the root causes of the problem.The war in the Middle East a few months ago is justanother reflection of the situation. The war has createdmany more problems than it was supposed to solve. Ido believe that a great many lessons can be learnedfrom the Iraq war.In order to prevent  deter or eradicate the problemof international terrorism  I should like to propose that17the countries whose citizens have been the main targetsof terrorist groups should review their conventionalanti-terrorism policies  particularly in dealing with theArab-Israeli conflict. They should adopt a policy thatensures that all parties involved are given just andequal treatment. Indeed  many eminent Muslims inIndonesia believe that once the major Powers behave ina more just manner and make clear their impartiality inthe Middle East  most of the root causes of terrorismperpetrated in the name of Islam — which cannot bejustified under any circumstance — will be resolved.As the Head of State of the largest Muslim country inthe world  I sincerely invite all world leaders to payparticular attention to that issue.Let us prevent the root causes of terrorism fromspreading and triggering the emergence of otherunsatisfactory aspirations  including in the social andeconomic spheres. The failure to reach consensus at therecent meeting of the World Trade Organization andthe continued slow progress — not to say stalemate —in the implementation of various social and economicglobal agendas will only complicate and proliferateexisting global problems.We are all interested in making the world a morepeaceful  stable  prosperous  just and humane place.Were those not the noble objectives explicitlystipulated in the Charter of the United Nations at theinception of the Organization  in June 1945? We are allaware that the world has undergone rapid changes.Technology has transformed the world and turned itinto an open and almost borderless place. Human lifeand its inherent value system have been developingvery fast  and any institutional and procedural regimesand instruments require adjustment and improvement.Forty-three years ago  in 1960  our first President Mr. Soekarno  spoke clearly about that issue. In hisaddress to the General Assembly entitled “To build theworld anew”  he referred to the need to reform both theinternational order and relations among nations of theworld. We now all realize and recognize the truth of hiscall. We are indeed in need of fundamental reform. If to that end  the performance of the Organizationrequires improvement to enable it to contribute moreconstructively to the attainment of a more peaceful stable  just  prosperous and humane world  then wemust have the courage to review  revitalize andempower its institutions and working methods.We must strengthen international cooperation andreinforce regional engagement. In South-East Asia  weare continuing to enhance the role of the Association ofSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Next month  atthe ASEAN summit that Indonesia will host in Bali  weexpect to take concrete steps towards forming anASEAN security community that will support andcomplement our efforts at becoming an ASEANeconomic community. I believe that a stable  peacefuland prosperous ASEAN will significantly contribute tothe realization of the objectives of the United Nations.There are no easy tasks. But building a betterregion and a more democratic world is worth all ourpatience and hard work. After all  that is our basicresponsibility. From Indonesia’s own experience instriving to become a more fully democratic country  Iknow how difficult that kind of work can be. We aretherefore aware that building a more democratic worldis even more difficult. Nevertheless  I wish to reiteratethat my country remains committed to fulfilling itsinternational obligations and that we will continue towork with other members of the United Nations tobuild the new world we dream of."
"77",3212,"IND",58,2003,"﻿Mr. President  wecongratulate you on your election to the presidency ofthe fifty-eighth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. We wish you every success in our sharedendeavours. You will have our fullest cooperation inyour efforts.As we gather here  in the wake of the manymomentous events over the past year  it is inevitablethat we should ponder some fundamental questionsabout the role and relevance of the United Nations.The United Nations was charged by its Charter“to save succeeding generations from the scourge ofwar.” The Charter also speaks of our collectivedetermination “to unite our strength to maintaininternational peace and security.” There was an implicitconviction that the United Nations would be strongerthan the sum of its constituent Member States. Itsunique legitimacy flows from a universal perceptionthat it pursues a larger purpose than the interests of onecountry or a small group of countries.This vision of an enlightened multilateralism hasnot materialized. There have been difficulties anddeficiencies in ensuring a world free from strife  a worldwithout war. The United Nations has not always beensuccessful in preventing conflicts or in resolving them.During the past year  the United Nationsencountered new challenges. We saw the extraordinaryinability of the five permanent members of the SecurityCouncil to agree on action in respect of Iraq  in spite ofcomplete agreement on basic objectives. Most recently the brutal terrorist attack on the United Nations Officein Baghdad struck a body blow at the United Nations’humanitarian efforts there.Looking back at events over recent years  we cananalyse the successes and failures of the UnitedNations in this or that crisis. But it would be morepurposeful to reflect on our own commitment tomultilateralism  the extent of its applicability in thereal world of today  and the manner in which it can beexercised through the United Nations. The reality isthat an international institution like the United Nationscan only be as effective as its Members allow it to be.Our reflections on the United Nations shouldfocus on three key aspects:First  we need to introspect on some of theassumptions that have been made over the yearsconcerning the will and reach of the United Nations. Inthe euphoria after the Cold War  there was a misplacednotion that the United Nations could solve everyproblem anywhere. Its enthusiasm and proactive stanceon many issues reflected laudable intentions. But wesoon realized that the United Nations does not possessmagical powers to solve every crisis in all parts of theglobe or to change overnight the motivation of leadersand communities around the world. //We need toclearly recognize  with a sense of realism  the limits towhat the United Nations can achieve  and the changesof form and function required for it to play an optimalrole in today’s world. We need to clearly recognize with a sense of realism  the limits to what the UnitedNations can achieve  and the changes that it needs tomake to its form and function to play an optimal role intoday’s world.Secondly  the Iraq issue has inevitably generateda debate on the functioning and the efficacy of theSecurity Council and of the United Nations itself. Overthe decades  the United Nations membership has grownenormously. The scope of its activities has expandedgreatly  with new specialized agencies and newprogrammes. But in the political and securitydimensions of its activities  the United Nations has notkept pace with the changes in the world. For theSecurity Council to represent genuine multilateralismin its decisions and actions  its membership mustreflect current world realities. Most United NationsMembers today recognize the need for an enlarged andrestructured Security Council  with more developingcountries as permanent and non-permanent members.The permanent members guard their exclusivity. SomeStates with weak claims want to ensure that others donot enter the Council as permanent members. Thiscombination of complacency and negativism has to becountered with a strong political will. The recent crisesshould serve as a warning to us that until the SecurityCouncil is reformed and restructured  its decisionscannot truly reflect the collective will of thecommunity of nations.Thirdly  even after such reform  the SecurityCouncil would have to develop suitable decision-making mechanisms that ensure better representation ofthe collective will of the international community. Howcan multilateralism be genuinely implemented? Asingle veto is an anachronism in today’s world. On theother hand  the requirement of unanimity can sabotageimperative actions. A simple-majority vote may not be15 sufficiently representative for major and serious issues.Should we aim for the highest common factor  orshould we settle for the lowest common denominator?Democratic countries could use their nationalexperience to provide feasible models for mechanismsand determine the extent of support required based onthe impact of action to be taken.The Secretary-General has rightly emphasized theurgent need for reform of the institutions and processesof the United Nations. We encourage his efforts in thisdirection. We should seek to implement these reformswithin a specified time frame.The Iraq issue continues to present a majorchallenge to the United Nations. At this point in time it is not very productive to linger on the past. Ourthoughts and concerns should be about the suffering ofthe people of Iraq. It is imperative that the people ofIraq should be empowered to determine their ownfuture and to rebuild their nation.The immediate priorities are ensuring securityand stability  restoration of basic facilities andinfrastructure and a road map of political processes fora representative Iraqi Government. It is clear that theUnited Nations has a crucial role to play in the processof political and economic reconstruction of thatcountry. This has been acknowledged both by thosewho had opposed military action and by those who didnot seek specific United Nations endorsement for it.One issue on which the United Nations showedremarkable unanimity after 11 September was globalterrorism. Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001)and 1456 (2003) were unequivocal in condemning allforms of terrorism and in calling for united actionagainst support  shelter  sponsorship  arming  trainingand financing of terrorism or terrorists.Unfortunately  the solidarity that was voiced hasnot translated into coherent and effective action.Terrorist acts continue to shatter our peace  fromMombasa to Moscow and from Baghdad to Bali. Indiahas had more than its share of terrorism in variousparts of the country. The global coalition againstterrorism has registered successes in Afghanistan  buthas not been able to extend this elsewhere. Some of itsmembers are themselves part of the problem. We aresometimes led to enter into semantic arguments overthe definition of terrorism. The search for root causesor imaginary freedom struggles provides alibis forkilling innocent men  women and children.There is much that the United Nations can do tocarry forward the war against international terrorism.The Counter-Terrorism Committee should developmeasures to ensure compliance by Member States oftheir obligations under Security Council resolutions1373 (2001) and 1456 (2003). We should have crediblemultilateral instruments to identify States thatcontravene these resolutions. Multilateral mechanismsmust be created to detect and choke off internationalfinancial flows to terrorists and terrorist organizations.A much better international system ofinformation exchange and intelligence sharing needs tobe devised to prevent terrorists from evading capturesimply by crossing national borders. No State shouldbe allowed to profess partnership with the globalcoalition against terror  while continuing to aid  abetand sponsor terrorism. To condone such doublestandards is to contribute to multiplying terrorism.Yesterday  the President of Pakistan chose thisaugust Assembly to make a public admission for thefirst time that Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism inJammu and Kashmir. After claiming that there is anindigenous struggle in Kashmir  he has offered toencourage a general cessation of violence within Kashmir in return for reciprocal obligations and restraints.We totally refuse to let terrorism become a tool ofblackmail. Just as the world did not negotiate with alQaeda or the Taliban  we shall not negotiate withterrorism. Were we to do so  we would be betraying thepeople of Jammu and Kashmir  who defied a mostferocious campaign of violence and intimidationsponsored from across our borders and participated inan election  which has been universally hailed as freeand fair. This was an unequivocal expression of bothdetermination and self-determination.When the cross-border terrorism stops  or whenwe eradicate it  we can have a dialogue with Pakistanon the other issues between us.While on this subject  I would also like to pointout to the President of Pakistan that he should notconfuse the legitimate aspiration for equality of nationswith outmoded concepts of military parity.We should be particularly concerned at thevarious recent revelations about clandestine transfers ofweapons of mass destruction and their technologies.We face the frightening prospect of these weapons andtechnologies falling into the hands of terrorists. Surely16 something needs to be done about the helplessness ofinternational regimes in preventing such transactions which clearly threaten international security. The sameregimes expend considerable energy in imposing avariety of discriminatory technology-denial restrictionson responsible States.Our preoccupation with terrorism should notdilute our commitment to tackle the non-militarythreats to human and international security. We have tosustain the fight against trafficking in narcotic drugs human beings and small arms  the pandemic ofHIV/AIDS  diseases like malaria and tuberculosis thatbeset developing countries and the degradation of ourcommon environment. Food security  energy securityand health security are important goals.The countries of the North and of the South —the developed  developing and transition economies —must resume their dialogue to build a better world forthe present and future generations. For the agenda ofglobalization  Cancún was a disappointment.Significant progress was made at Johannesburgtowards the realization of sustainable development  butthe entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol on climatechange remains stalled and the Convention onBiological Diversity has not yielded any tangiblebenefits to the world’s poor.International economic relations continue to becharacterized by inequities and inequalities.Globalization has helped sections of the internationaleconomy  including some developing countries; however large communities have been left outside its pale. It hasengendered economic crises and instability in severaldeveloping countries and sharply increased poverty.Poverty is multidimensional. It extends beyondmoney and income to education  health care  skillsenhancement  political participation at all levels fromthe local to the global  access to natural resources clean water and air  and advancement of one’s ownculture and social organization.Poverty alleviation requires resources on a fargreater scale than now available. Globalization itselfplaces constraints on Governments of developingcountries in raising public resources for povertyalleviation. The promise of the climate change andbiodiversity treaties to raise significant resources forinvestment and technology transfer is as yet unrealized.The resources of multilateral and bilateral developmentagencies are limited by the failure of industrializedcountries to enhance development budgets.Therefore  if the current regimes of globalizationand sustainable development are to be expanded — oreven to survive — they must be directly harnessed toprovide the necessary resources for poverty alleviation.In fact  all international agreements and initiativesaffecting developing countries have to be evaluated bytheir impact on poverty.Developing countries need to coordinate theirpositions in international negotiations to promote theadoption of regimes which would help alleviatepoverty. The India-Brazil-South Africa DialogueForum  which was established earlier this year  is aneffort in this direction.We in the developing countries do not have theluxury of time. Political compulsions force us to meetthe aspirations of our people quickly  even as wesubject ourselves to newer and more rigid internationalstandards and norms. We owe it to our future generationsto make strong efforts to meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. There is a mutuality of interest inthis between the developed and the developingcountries. Global interdependence today means thateconomic disasters in developing countries couldcreate a backlash in developed countries. We hope theworld will act in this spirit of enlightened self-interest."
"78",3258,"IRL",58,2003,"﻿For the United Nations andthe system of collective security that it represents  thepast year has been a traumatic one.Our Organization could ill afford the loss of thededicated and experienced members of staff who werekilled by an act of terrorism in Baghdad on the 19August. I do not diminish the contribution of each andevery one of those who lost their lives in the cause ofhumanity if I give individual mention to Sergio Vieirade Mello. I would like to pay particular tribute to hiswork in bringing to birth the new State of Timor Leste which has become the latest Member of the UnitedNations.We are living in a period of great insecurity. Weare stalked by fear — fear of war  terrorism  weaponsof mass destruction  famine  disease  ethnic andreligious hatred  and organized crime. Governments areacting  individually and in groups  to shield theirpeople from these threats. However  the nature of thechallenge requires coordinated global action.Fortunately  we have the United NationsOrganization  which brings together the nations of theworld in the service of international peace and security.If we did not already have such an organization  wewould surely have to invent it. The tragedy formankind is that we do not make the most effective useof it. We are frequently told by commentators that theUnited Nations has failed. All too often  it is difficultto disagree.So  who is to blame? To answer that question wehave to ask: what is the United Nations? The answer isto be found in the Charter. This Organization wasestablished in the name of the peoples of the UnitedNations. When the United Nations fails  it is becausewe  the Governments that represent the peoples of theUnited Nations  have failed  individually orcollectively  to meet our obligations.Our most common failing  I would submit  is thatwe frequently overlook the fact that this Organizationwas created to serve not just our own nation  but allmankind. Too often  Members seek to use this20 Organization to pursue their national interests byseeking to have it adopt resolutions that are partial orbiased; by ignoring its resolutions when these do notsuit them; and by encouraging action on certain issuesand conflicts while blocking action on or evenconsideration of  others. All too many of us have beenguilty of such an approach.We simply cannot afford to continue with thisattitude. The world is fast changing. Every day brings anew awareness of just how interdependent we all are.The option of shutting ourselves safely away behindprotective walls no longer exists. We have to learn tolive together  to share the resources of this planet andto look after each other. We can retain our national cultural and religious identities  but we need torecognize that we are  first and foremost  all membersof the human race  and we must act accordingly.We need a viable system of global governancethat can ensure international peace and security. To beviable  such a system must possess two essentialqualities: effectiveness and legitimacy. To be effective it requires the unambiguous support of the entirecommunity of nation States. Its decisions must berespected and  where necessary  we must be ready andable to act to secure such respect. To retain legitimacy the system must be seen to work in the interests of theentire international community.I appeal  therefore  to the Governmentsrepresented at this session of the General Assembly fora change in our attitude to the United Nations. Let uscease treating it as a tool useful only to the extent thatit can deliver on our national agenda. Instead  let us usethe United Nations to harness our collective resourcesin the interests of each and every member of mankind.To adapt the words of President John F. Kennedy  let usask not what the United Nations can do for us  but whatwe can do for the United Nations.The United Nations needs reform. We all acceptthat. Our institutions are not sufficiently effective and in some instances  are not adequately representative oftoday’s membership. We have discussed these issues atgreat length  but we have balked at taking the harddecisions. The time has come to put the interests of thewider international community before narrow nationalconcerns.We are fortunate  at this moment  to have asSecretary-General a man of the stature of Kofi Annan;a man who is held in universal regard and who is seento stand for the interests of the entire internationalcommunity. He has not shrunk from grasping the nettleof reform  and in his address to this Assembly he calledon the Members of this Organization to grasp it withhim. We must find the courage and generosity to takeup this challenge.The past two years have been a particularly soberperiod in the history of mankind. There has been somuch death and destruction across the globe. Howmuch of this might have been avoided if the UnitedNations had been better able to fulfil the noblepurposes set out in the Charter?I do not claim that it is possible to eradicateman’s capacity for evil or to totally eliminate thetendency to seek to resolve disputes through violence.But I do submit that a stronger  more resolute  morerespected and more active United Nations might haveprevented some of the suffering of the past two years.The world today is very different from that whichexisted when the Charter was drawn up. It is smaller more crowded  more combustible. Isolated pockets ofhuman habitation have been brought together by apopulation explosion  migration  faster and cheaper airtravel  television  the Internet  the growth of free tradeand the development of weapons of mass destruction.What happens in one part of the world can increasinglyhave an instant and dramatic effect in another part.This evolution has raised questions concerningthe interpretation of two important provisions of theCharter. The first is paragraph 7 of Article 2  which ineffect excludes the United Nations from intervening inmatters that are essentially within the domesticjurisdiction of any State. Yet the problem arisesincreasingly in our global society as to whether andwhen a matter can be considered as falling entirelywithin the domestic jurisdiction of a State. Somesituations are clearer than others.In my view  when events within a countrythreaten international peace and security  they becomethe legitimate interest of the international community.Similarly  I cannot accept that the internationalcommunity should stand by and accept the large-scale flagrant and persistent violation of human rights. Wehave received sharp lessons in the past. The trigger forintervening to prevent an attempted genocide shouldnot be the moment that refugees begin to flood acrossthe border.21 At the same time  international intervention raisesserious questions. It can also pose serious risks to theinternational regime. Clearly  intervention isobjectively called for in some extreme cases. But thereis a need to work carefully through this concept with aview to forging an international consensus around it.Another issue that has recently come to the foreand was highlighted by the Secretary-General is that ofArticle 51 of the Charter and the conditions underwhich Member States have the right to act in self-defence. The development of weapons of massdestruction in the period since the signing of theCharter  and the appearance of non-State actors withthe capacity for mass destruction  raise seriousquestions as to the point at which a State mightconsider it necessary to act in self-defence. This is alsoan issue that requires serious reflection.My Government would be deeply concerned atthe widespread acceptance of a doctrine of pre-emptivestrike. Given the ever more lethal nature of modernweapons  the risk of large-scale death  destruction andescalation are enormous.More effective than striking pre-emptively  ofcourse  is to pre-empt the risk of conflict through awide range of steps in the diplomatic  economic humanitarian and other areas.We should devote more attention to dealing withthe root causes of conflict. We must seek to identifypotential conflicts as early as possible and deal withthem before they get out of hand. Where conflictnevertheless becomes a possibility  we should act moreassertively to head it off. We simply cannot afford toaccept the existence of so-called forgotten or ignoredconflicts. Any conflict that threatens international peaceand security is the United Nations legitimate business andshould be on the agenda of the Security Council.I would now like to touch briefly on a number ofspecific issues that are of concern to my Government.The conflict between Israel and the Palestinianpeople continues to pose a serious threat to worldpeace. My own country’s difficult national experienceshows that there is no such thing as a straight line topeace. Our experience in Ireland clearly demonstratesthat farsighted leaders cannot allow their efforts to beheld hostage by terrorists and extremists. They musthave the wisdom to look beyond the politics of the lastatrocity.What is more  leaders must be prepared to dealwith each other. As the Nobel Laureate John Humeonce said  “you make peace with your enemies  notyour friends”. President Arafat has a responsibility tolead his people away from violence and back to thenegotiating table. It is a responsibility that he mustassume. Threats to expel or assassinate him are deeplymisguided and dangerous and can only further delayefforts to achieve a settlement.Lasting peace can only be achieved throughnegotiation. Palestinians must realize that violence hasfailed. Terrorism is wrong and has brought nothing butmisery to both Israel and Palestine. It has madecompromise more difficult than ever.Israel must see that repression and attempts atphysical separation will not deliver long-term security.The most effective means for Israel to secure apeaceful future would be to accept the Palestinianpeople’s right to a viable State of their own on the basisof the 1967 borders. Israel should immediately reverseits policy of building settlements  settler-only roadsand a security wall on Palestinian territory.It is imperative that the parties re-engage in thetask of implementing the road map  leading to a two-State solution based on the vision enshrined in SecurityCouncil resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 1397(2002). They need the support of the Quartet. But suchmediation will not succeed if it is  or is perceived to be one-sided. We must be careful to ensure that ourdemands are balanced and that we hold both sidesequally to account.The people of Iraq are suffering from events thatin most cases are not of their making. We want to seethis suffering brought to an end as soon as possible.The Iraqi people can only play a part in that byrejecting those who engage in violence and industrialsabotage. The occupying Powers must be scrupulous inmeeting their obligations under international law.The Iraqi people need and deserve the support ofa united international community in the political andeconomic reconstruction of their country. The UnitedNations  with its unique experience and legitimacy  isessential to efforts to help the Iraqi people recover theirsovereignty as soon as possible and to forge a new Iraq at peace with itself and with its neighbours. We look tothe members of the Security Council at this crucialmoment to assume their responsibilities and to reach anagreement on a new resolution that reflects the interests22 of the people of Iraq and that can enjoy the necessarysupport of the region and of the broad internationalcommunity.The proliferation of nuclear  chemical andbiological weapons poses a serious threat to internationalpeace and security. We must recommit ourselves tocontrolling the spread of such weapons  and workingtowards their complete elimination. This can only beachieved through a comprehensive and rigorous systemof international treaties and obligations that areverifiable and universal.Ireland  with its partners in the New AgendaCoalition  will continue its efforts in respect of nucleardisarmament during this year’s General Assembly.Ireland calls on all States who are concerned about theissue of weapons of mass destruction to becomeconstructively engaged in the multilateral disarmamentand non-proliferation process. There can be no roomfor double standards.We must also remain resolute in ourdetermination to counter the threat of terrorism. Weowe it to the victims of 11 September  and to thevictims of terrorist atrocities before and since then. Themeasures put in place by the Security Council havemade it more difficult for international terroristnetworks to organize and to finance their activities.These organizations  however  do not stand still. Wemust remain vigilant and redouble our efforts to makeit impossible for the agents of international terror tooperate.In doing so  however  we must be clear that the needto act against terrorism offers no license for actioncontrary to the United Nations Charter  or against thebody of international human rights and humanitarianlaw that we have so painstakingly constructed.We must also seek to deal with the causes ofterrorism. Terrorism is not some kind of original sin.No child is born a terrorist. At some point in theirlives  some people become terrorists. We have toidentify how and why.And if we find that young people are beingindoctrinated into terrorism  we have to deal with thosewho seek to incite hatred and terror. If we find thatthey act  however wrongly  in reaction to real orperceived injustice  we have to confront that fact and as far as it is possible  seek to eliminate the reality orperception of that injustice. To seek to understand thecauses of terrorism should not be misunderstood asbeing soft on terrorism. On the contrary  it is anessential step in its elimination. I can speak fromexperience of developments in my own country formany decades.The Government and people of Afghanistan faceimportant challenges in the coming year  in particularthe adoption of a constitution and the holding ofnational elections. Severe difficulties stand in the way especially the precarious security situation. Thesustained and wholehearted support of the internationalcommunity is required if Afghanistan is to recoverfrom its long ordeal. For Ireland’s part  it has deliveredon its pledges to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.In Africa  encouraging progress has been made inthe past year towards the resolution of some long-standing and intractable conflicts. We urge the parties tothe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo toimplement the commitments that they have entered into.Neighbouring States must abide by their commitmentsand their obligation not to interfere in the area.Sierra Leone remains on track  with the help ofthe United Nations  towards a future and peacefuldevelopment. And progress has been achieved inLiberia. I want to pay tribute to the efforts of thoseMember States that have contributed to this positivedevelopment. Their continued engagement  along withthe United Nations  will be indispensable in helping thepeople of Liberia to consolidate what has beenachieved and to build peace in their country. I ampleased to inform the Assembly that my Government inthe next few days will recommend to our Parliamentthat Ireland’s Defence Forces participate with asizeable contingent in the forthcoming Unitedpeacekeeping operation in Liberia.Respect for human rights is an essential foundationfor peace and security. Lack of respect for human rights isat the root of many conflicts  internal and international.The promotion of human rights is rightly the concernof the international community as a whole. It mustremain a central task of the United Nations and must beintegrated into all United Nations activities.There is no room for complacency. We must allrecognize that no country  including our own  isperfect. We can all do better.I pay tribute to the many brave individuals aroundthe world — defenders of human rights — who risk23 discrimination  imprisonment or worse to ensure thatGovernments live up to their human rights obligations.The establishment of the International CriminalCourt was a clear signal of the determination of theinternational community to bring to justice those whoare involved in genocide  crimes against humanity andwar crimes. Ireland  together with its partners in theEuropean Union  will continue to offer firm support tothe International Criminal Court  as its work gets underway. I urge those who have not signed or ratified theRome Statute to do so  and I urge all States to adherefirmly to the principles on which it is based.The peace process in Northern Ireland remains amajor priority for the Irish Government. Regrettably due to diminishing trust between the political parties the devolved political institutions in Northern Irelandwere suspended nearly one year ago. Since then  we havebeen working to re-establish the trust and confidencenecessary to restore and sustain these institutions.This involves both ensuring that all vestiges ofparamilitary activity are consigned to the past and thatall parties commit themselves to the full and stableoperation of the democratic institutions of the GoodFriday Agreement. Following intensive negotiations we came tantalizingly close in April to making therequired breakthrough but unfortunately did not getmatters fully resolved at that time.After one of the most peaceful summers on thestreets of Northern Ireland  the process is now enteringanother decisive phase of challenge and opportunity.Developments over the next few weeks will have acrucial bearing on whether elections — which I believeshould take place before the end of the year — will beheld in an atmosphere that is conducive to forming aworking administration on the other side of the pollingday.For this to happen  all of the pro-Agreementparties must show leadership and courage  face up totheir responsibilities and take the decisions they knoware right  and encourage their constituencies to reachout to others. As partners in this process  PrimeMinister Blair and I — and our two Governments —are working closely together to support and encourageall those political and community leaders who aretaking risks for peace.From other areas around the world struggling toescape from a legacy of violence  we in Ireland knowall too well that a process of conflict resolution cannotrest still. Either it continues to move forward or it losesmomentum and direction and falters. To complacentlyassume that current opportunities for progress can bedeferred until a more politically convenient moment isboth wrong and dangerous. In the case of NorthernIreland  the moment of opportunity is now and it is myhope that in the weeks and months ahead all of theparties who subscribed to the Good Friday Agreementwill collectively rise to that challenge.Poverty and insecurity go hand in hand. Theefforts of the United Nations to promote internationalpeace and security must be closely aligned with itswork in tackling the root causes of poverty.When I launched the United Nations HumanDevelopment Report in Dublin last July  I noted howpowerful a reminder it was that the world is becominga more unequal place. According to the report  54countries — the great majority of them in Africa — arepoorer now than they were in 1990. A world wheremore than 1.2 billion people continue to live on lessthan a dollar a day  where 14 million children areorphaned because of HIV/AIDS and where women inthe poorest countries are 175 times more likely to diein childbirth than women in rich countries is inherentlyunjust and hence insecure.At the United Nations special session onHIV/AIDS in 2001  I said Ireland would increase itscontribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS by anadditional $30 million per year. Last year  our spendingon HIV/AIDS programmes exceeded $40 million — aten-fold increase over the past three years.The Millennium Declaration called for a globalpartnership for development  and as in any partnership there are responsibilities on all sides. Undertakings onofficial development assistance  debt relief  andgovernance must be achieved. We must be rigorous inassessing our progress in 2005  as we committedourselves to doing.At the Millennium Summit  I committed Irelandto reaching the United Nations target for officialdevelopment assistance of 0.7 per cent of grossnational product by 2007. Since then  Ireland hasincreased its official development assistance to 0.41per cent and remains committed to reaching the targetby 2007.24 Fair and open international trade is essential forglobal peace and prosperity. It is an integral part of themultilateral system that we are pledged to protect. Iregret that it did not prove possible to reach agreementat the recent World Trade Organization talks inCancun. I understand the frustration of those whoconsider themselves unfairly treated in global markets.But if we turn our back on the multilateral tradingsystem and allow trade and investment to be divertedand distorted by bilateral and regional arrangements we will damage — perhaps irreparably — the best toolavailable to us to make serious inroads into povertyand to raise standards of living on a global basis. Let usredouble our efforts to achieve an agreement that offersfair market access and at the same time allows all of usto preserve the essence of our unique cultures andenvironments.The past year might have been a difficult one forthe United Nations  but events have demonstrated thatfor the people of the world it is the indispensableOrganization at the centre of our system of collectivesecurity. We have invested it with unique legitimacyand authority. People around the world look to it inhope and expectation. Let us work together to makesure that the United Nations is an organization worthyof the ideals enshrined in its Charter  worthy of thetrust of those who rely on it for help and protection worthy of the idealism and dedication of those whowork for it and worthy of the sacrifice of those whohave given their lives in its service.As the Secretary-General made clear when headdressed this session of General Assembly: we are ata fork in the road. Let us be sure to take the right road."
"79",3305,"IRN",58,2003,"﻿Iwould like to express my cordial congratulations to thePresident for presiding over this important session ofthe General Assembly. I wish also to express mycongratulations to other members of the Bureau ontheir election.Less than 60 years ago  our founding fathersestablished the United Nations  with the aspiration topromote peace and security through cooperation and tomake our world a better place. The creation of thisOrganization was in fact the manifestation of theinternational community's determination to prevent thescourge of war  which had inflicted tremendous lossand damage upon humankind. The United Nations wasalso designed to promote economic  social and humandevelopment and assist Member States to eradicateinjustice and poverty.These objectives and concerns remain as valid asever and perhaps are even more relevant today. Webelieve it is time to take stock of recent developmentsand the utility and record of the United Nations  with aview to promoting the authority  efficiency andeffectiveness of the United Nations  and recognizing itscentral role in addressing the challenges of our time.The United States waged an unsanctioned waragainst Iraq with three expressed objectives: to findweapons of mass destruction  to fight internationalterrorism and to bring democracy to the Iraqi people.The first is yet to be realized. The second hasbackfired. And  as far as the third is concerned  thecollapse of a dictatorship is a highly welcomedevelopment in the region  but  as history has shown social change  including the democratization of asociety  can only be brought about from within  andcannot be imported in tandem with tank columns. Inour view  callous indifference to the negative28 consequences of the invasion of Iraq to the conduct ofinternational relations and a lack of full understandingof the post-war situation in Iraq  particularly the socialand the cultural complexities of Iraqi society  havecreated both an international predicament and a sourceof instability at our borders.As a neighbouring State  Iran adopted a policy ofself-restraint during the war in Iraq and has continuedto adopt a constructive approach to the current situationin that country by calling on the occupying Powers toallow the immediate transfer of Iraqi sovereignty to theIraqi people and to withdraw their troops. We welcomeand support the establishment of the Iraqi GoverningCouncil and the Council of Ministers and call forgranting a central and clear-cut role to the UnitedNations in the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty and theconstitutional process. We wish to promote unity andgreater respect for stability and security among variousethnic and religious groups in Iraq  and encourage andsupport the swift setting in motion of a constitutionaland institutional process  with a view to establishing ademocratic and fully representative Government by andfor the people of Iraq. We urge respect for the nationalunity  independence and territorial integrity of Iraq andthe provision of relief emergency assistance to thepeople of Iraq.Pending the restoration of sovereignty andauthority to the people of Iraq  the occupying Powershave the legal responsibility under applicableinternational law to provide for the welfare of thepeople under occupation  particularly their security. Inthis context  the United Nations should be allowed toplay a central role in laying the ground work  on anurgent basis  in assisting the Iraqi people to establish ademocratic and representative Government and insupervising the transfer of authority to them. Theinternational community  in general  and Iraq'sneighbours  in particular  will undoubtedly lend theirfull support to the United Nations in this endeavour.I would like to express once again mycondolences to the Secretary-General and the UnitedNations community as a whole for the loss of a braveservant of the nations  Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  andother United Nations personnel in the terrorist bombingof the United Nations headquarters in Iraq. The peopleand Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran alsosympathize with the people of Iraq over the loss ofanother man of peace  Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer al-Hakim  in a separate terrorist bombing in Iraq.The violence against and the killing of innocentPalestinian people by the Israeli Army have become adaily occurrence  and prospects for a viable peace aresteadily diminishing. The Palestinian people live underbrutal occupation and oppression with no hope forrelief  let alone peace and prosperity. The policy of theSharon Government of reoccupying Palestinian citiesand using military force to further terrorize thePalestinian people has exacerbated the situation andadded to the despair and frustration of ordinary people.The international community has a major responsibilityto take effective measures in alleviating the sufferingof the Palestinian people.The recent decision of the Israeli regime to expelPresident Arafat from his homeland has outraged theinternational community  in general  and the Muslimworld  in particular. I am confident that the free andcivilized world will continue to reject and condemnsuch a move by Israel. It is regrettable that the UnitedStates  last week  once again and for the thirty-sixthtime  resorted to the veto to block the adoption of adraft resolution.On behalf of the people and the Government ofthe Islamic Republic of Iran  I wish to take thisopportunity to express our satisfaction over the steadyimprovement of the situation in Afghanistan under theleadership of President Karzai and his Government. Atthe same time  we are concerned about problems suchas the regrouping of remnants of the Taliban and AlQaeda  the paucity of international assistance and theincrease in opium poppy cultivation. Unless theinternational community is more forthcoming inassisting the Afghan people and Government  recentachievements in Afghanistan may be jeopardized.We have a great stake in the return of fullnormality and stability to Afghanistan. In this area  wehave strongly supported the central role of the UnitedNations in helping the Afghans to rebuild their owncountry  and we believe that the United Nations shouldcontinue to play this role for the foreseeable future.Terrorism is a global phenomenon that requires aglobal response. Fighting terrorism requires amultifaceted approach that goes well beyond a simplefocus on law and order and also addresses itsunderlying causes. A unilateral and one-dimensionalapproach  based merely on the use of force  mayneutralize some threats and bring some psychologicalcomfort to those who seek revenge in response to29 terrorist acts  but few would regard that as a seriousmethods of uprooting international terrorism.Any attempt to link terrorism to a specificreligion or culture is prejudicial  politically motivatedand thus unacceptable. No religion authorizes itsadherents to kill innocent people  whatever theobjective of such acts might be.The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns terrorismin all its forms and manifestations. Iran has done morethan its fair share to effectively combat terrorism. Inthe heat of the military intervention in Afghanistan andin the wake of the Taliban collapse  thousands ofindividuals were denied entry into Iran; more than2 300 individuals with false or no travel documentswere deported and hundreds of suspects were arrested interrogated and handed over to their countries ofnationality or residence; and lists of such persons werebrought to the attention of the relevant United Nationsofficials and bodies. Iran continues to cooperate inserious and long-term efforts to combat terrorism in acomprehensive  non-discriminatory and non-selectivemanner   efforts that do not pick and choose betweengood and bad  or useful  terrorists.Weapons of mass destruction are among the mostpotent threats to peace and security at the regional andglobal levels. The Chemical Weapons Convention Biological Weapons Convention and the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) are theresults of our collective wisdom in our efforts toeliminate the threat of chemical and biologicalweapons and the spread of nuclear weapons. Webelieve that more needs to be done. We should do moreto make these basic international instruments universal.We should also do more to strengthen verification oftheir implementation. Finally  we should all workcollectively  as mandated by the International Court ofJustice  to move towards the total elimination ofnuclear weapons.By adhering to all of these three instruments as anoriginal party  my country has shown its determinationto work towards the complete eradication of weaponsof mass destruction from the Earth. Our commitment tointernational regimes on weapons of mass destructionlies not merely in our contractual obligations but  moreimportantly  in our religious convictions and historicalexperience. No country has suffered as acutely as minefrom the tragic scars left from being victims of suchweapons  particularly against the backdrop of acomplacent international environment. We areconvinced that the pursuit of nuclear weapons andother weapons of mass destruction will not only fail toprovide deterrence or enhance security and influence but will only increase vulnerability. Thus  I can statecategorically that for all these reasons  weapons ofmass destruction have no place in the defensivestrategy of my country. We believe the only option is towork actively towards a global and regional ban onthese weapons  and we have thus spared no effort inthis regard.However  the efforts to ban  or strengthen theban  on weapons of mass destruction should notprovide any excuse for denying States the right todevelop technology for peaceful purposes.Unfortunately  the political pressure against the IslamicRepublic of Iran to relinquish its inalienable right todevelop peaceful nuclear technology is mounting while some nuclear weapon States continue to test anddevelop advanced tactical nuclear weaponsprogrammes. Furthermore  in defiance of internationalcalls to adhere to the NPT  Israel is continuing  withimpunity  its clandestine development of sophisticatednuclear weapons and their delivery systems. All NPTReview and Extension conferences have called for thesuspension and freezing of Israel's tactical weaponsand nuclear programmes  which are the real threats tointernational peace and security. They are bothconsidered to be in contravention with the letter andspirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.Iran's nuclear programme is solely for peacefulpurposes  specifically for the planned production of7 000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 for Iran'seconomic development. Iran will vigorously pursue itspeaceful nuclear programme and will not give in tounreasonable  discriminatory and selective demandsthat go beyond the requirements of non-proliferationunder existing International Atomic Energy Agencyinstruments. At the same time  Iran does not have anuclear weapons programme  nor does it intend toembark on one. Thus  we have nothing to hide  and inprinciple have no problem with the Additional Protocol.We are eager to ensure that this step will be utilizedsolely to enhance confidence and remove all doubtsabout the peaceful nature of our nuclear programme. In facing global challenges  no possibility otherthan mutual cooperation through the United Nationswill be conducive to lasting and effective solutions.The democratic process advocated at all levels withinthe international community needs also to be reflectedwithin the United Nations system. The GeneralAssembly should play a more active role in globalaffairs. A more representative and democratic SecurityCouncil would mean a more efficient United Nations  the kind of organization we should all want andwork for."
"80",3352,"IRQ",58,2003,"﻿Today Istand before the Assembly representing the voice of theIraqi citizen who long suffered from cruelty within andoutside his homeland. Those within his countryinflicted on him the worst kinds of torture: theyattacked his honour  assaulted his family  humiliatedhim  shackled him  oppressed him and forced him intomiserable wars. His brothers and his friends in theregion not only remained silent  ignored him andturned a blind eye to his catastrophe  they alsocriticized and faulted him the moment he dared tospeak up. And throughout the world  those who stoodto benefit scrambled to do business and cooperate withhis torturer.Very few accepted and spoke the truth; very fewconsidered the catastrophe of their fellow human beingand declared that he was a victim. He heard noresponse to his appeals. So the Iraqi citizen remainedlost and doubly persecuted — first  with the injusticeof the sword with which the dictatorial regime attackedhim at home  and then with the injustice of criticism —a more painful affliction — from many abroad. But theIraqi citizen did not give up. Rather  he was persistentand patient  and he continued his struggle through histhoughts  words and actions to achieve liberation  theideal for which he had always yearned most.I stand today before the Assembly expressing toMembers to the best of my ability the voice of thisIraqi individual  declaring with him and on his behalfthe end of silence. I ask each Member present here tolisten to him.28I come today to present the Assembly with fouressential truths and to demonstrate  through thosetruths  two fundamental rights.The first truth is that Iraq’s long  dark night hasended. The bitter experience of humiliation oppression  suppression  and dictatorship that the Iraqisendured for more than three decades has ended. Itended with the fleeing of the head of the regime  alongwith his cronies  and with the collapse of the symbolsthat he had erected in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.The second truth is that the liberation of Iraq —and what took place was indeed liberation — could nothave been achieved had it not been for the resolve ofPresident George W. Bush and the commitment of thecoalition  headed by the United States of America andthe United Kingdom. The Iraqis will never forget theirsacrifices and the courage they displayed in Iraq’sliberation. If today we hear the voices of those whoquestion the intentions of the Governments of theUnited States and the United Kingdom in undertakingthe liberation  we invite them to come to visit the massgraves  the drained marshes and the gassed city ofHalabja  and to examine the list of the missing whoseright to life was taken from them by the regime.The third truth is that the liberation embodied auniversal Iraqi national resolve. The liberation came asa result of vigorous Iraqi efforts to oppose the deposedregime during many long years when hundreds ofthousands of martyrs were sacrificed. The martyrAyatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim and hiscompanions — may God rest their souls — were notthe last victims; they added another page to the annalsof Iraqi bravery on 29 August  the day of the Iraqimartyr. Nor was death by treachery spared the martyrAkila al-Hashemi.The fourth truth is that the removal of the regimewas only the prelude to the birth of a new Iraq. Thebirth that has been prepared for by so many faithfulIraqis  both at home and abroad  is at hand.A unique experience awaits us in Iraq today. Wewill succeed through our desire to do good  to achievedevelopment and to let freedom spread and flourish. Istand here today to confirm that  with God’s help  wein Iraq will accept nothing short of success. Iraqis arecapable of succeeding  and they want to succeed. Wewill not allow a gang of mercenaries and terrorists todeprive the Iraqi citizen  the Iraqi society and the Iraqination of a bright tomorrow.The land of the two rivers  the cradle ofcivilization  the land of Sumer  Akkad  Babylon andAssyria  the land of peace  the land of the caliphate andthe house of wisdom  the home of the Code ofHammurabi and the storehouse of accumulatedknowledge  literature  poetry and intellectualachievement is dependent  first and foremost  on itshuman resources more than on its natural and oilresources.On the basis of its human resources  Iraq canundergo a qualitative sea change  moving it from thegrip of totalitarianism and fear to stability  prosperityand tolerance. What the international community putsinto Iraq will be returned many times over. Put yourconfidence in Iraq and receive from it stability andprosperity. Not only would stability and prosperity beIraq’s but they would spread to the rest of the regionand the entire world.The Iraq that we want to see is the Iraq of theinnovative individual. More than 60 per cent of Iraq’spopulation is below the age of 20. Our first priority inpreparing those young people for the twenty-firstcentury is to give them cultural and educational valuesthat will enable each of them to prove themselves andtheir particularities in a new Iraq.In the past in Iraq  as in other nations thatsuffered under the ideologies of the twentieth century the individual was suppressed by the masses  themasses by the revolution  the revolution by the party and the party by the leader. The result was that thehuman being was lost under continuous layers ofnegation that obliterated his individuality  making himan object for consumption in an ostensible defence ofthe nation and in the name of the revolution  or to besacrificed  body and soul  for the leader. The concernsof Iraqis are no different from those of all other peoplesof the world. Iraqis are eager to define themselves andto project their singularity. The Iraq of tomorrow mustrecognize the individual citizen as the basis ofsovereignty and the starting point for legislation.The rights of the individual are fundamental; therights of the group derive from them. Iraqis  like otherpeoples  insist on their right to dignity  freedom  justiceand peace. The assertion of such rights will build thefoundations of tomorrow’s Iraq. The dignity of everyIraqi  without exception  must be guaranteed  withoutconsideration for social status  political position oreconomic situation. An accused person will not lose his29dignity  even if found guilty. We will begin withdignity because the previous regime worked futilely toconvince Iraqis that their dignity was an endowmentfrom the ruler. Today  we stress that the dignity of theentire nation stems from the dignity of each citizen.As with dignity  so with freedom. Freedom is nota gift from the ruler or the State. Rather  it is a basicprinciple  the essence of a human being. Responsiblefreedom that does not impinge upon the liberties ofothers is the core of the social contract. Despite theexcesses of outsiders and infiltrators since the fall ofthe repressive regime  Iraqis have proved to themselvesthat freedom means neither chaos nor the law of thejungle.The individual has an instinct for freedom  andthus he demands justice. The previous regimeundermined justice and transformed it into a tool of theState to oppress and suppress the people. The new Iraqwill be based on a firm justice system that ensures theindependence and integrity of the judiciary. After thesenseless wars that destroyed innumerable lives leaving disaster in their wake  the new Iraq will adopt anew defensive policy based on peace. Iraq will be anactivist for peace for the region and the world. Theaforementioned four truths will form the foundation ofIraq’s political future.Iraq will abide strictly and explicitly by allhuman rights instruments  beginning with theDeclaration of Human Rights  guaranteeing the right ofman to life  property and the pursuit of happiness.We pledge that Iraqi laws and legislation applyequally to all the people. No person will be above thelaw for any reason  regardless of merit or individualresponsibility. Indeed  there will be no distinction onthe basis of religion  sect  race  language  ethnicity gender  class or tribe. The defunct regime exploitedthose divisions for its own ends. The new Iraq will relyon justice and fairness.Iraqi women are capable of innovative excellenceand productivity and can take on all the responsibilitiesof the nation. It is the duty of society and the State toremove any obstacles in their way.The constant dialogue that is required betweenIraqi citizens and the State that represents and servesthem will take place on the basis of an honest democratic and representational system. This system isbased on the principle of the separation of powers  andfirmly upholds elections as the ultimate arbiter. We arenot concerned with the dressings of democracy  butwith the safety of the political system as theincarnation of the democratic spirit.The pillars of this system are  first and foremost the separation of powers in the framework of a writtenconstitution that avoids duplication in the judicial legislative and executive powers. That will provide asound basis for each to oversee the other. Secondly accountability will be ensured as a result of suchsupervision and by means of elections that will providefor the participation of individuals in politics. Finally civil society will be empowered by means of a freepress  unions and independent institutions  which willact as monitors and critics and represent the plurality ofpolitical forces in the country.The third pillar is the upholding of transparencyas a fundamental principle  based on the sovereignty ofthe individual citizen. The State exists to serve  and isanswerable to the citizen  who is entitled to inquire intoits affairs. The State does not have the right to withholdinformation on its affairs. The fourth pillar isrecognition by the minority of the right of the majorityto assume power  and the respect by the majority of therights of the minority. Here  it is important todistinguish between a political majority and minorityand a factional majority and minority. Politicalmajorities and minorities are determined by the ballotbox  not by a population census or random correlations.No one has the authority to arrogate to himself apolitical right on the basis of a presumed factionalmajority. We do not want a political  sectarian ornational allocation in Iraq. A sound representative federal political system can best express the interests ofall Iraqi citizens in a manner that reflects their religion creed  ethnicity or language.The previous period was characterized byrestricting all power to an abusive few in Baghdad  buttomorrow’s Iraq will be based on the principle of localauthority in the context of a federal union. Federalismas construed by Iraqis is not based on the division ofthe homeland; rather  it is a way of empowering andrehabilitating those living in different regions to takedirect responsibility for their affairs in their ownregions  without constant interference from the centralGovernment.Our constitution charts the relationship betweenintegrated and continuous local and national30authorities. We rely on the federal system  as we do onthe democratic system  because we have a clearunderstanding of the relationship between the State andits citizens. This relationship is not one ofguardianship  because the Iraqi citizen is not a minorand is therefore not in need of the State’s interferencein all his affairs. Our concern is to ensure that thisrelationship is based on care  with the State being thevigilant servant of the citizen  and on nurturing in someareas  especially with regard to the provision ofeducation and social and health services for youngpeople.Complementing our belief in federalism  and incontrast with the vain and false nationalist excesses ofthe previous regime  we declare that Iraq is one nation permanent and whole.Nothing in this declaration belittles the continuityof our Arab and Muslim heritage  or contradicts thesentiments of many Iraqis about their own culture andnational identity. Rather  it confirms that all theterritory of Iraq — from its mountains in the far northto its marshes and the Gulf in the extreme south including its rivers  plains and deserts — is a lasting indivisible unit. This is an expression not only of thetrue beliefs of most Iraqis  but also of a key politicalprinciple and point of reference that will help thecountry recognize realities on the ground and avoidfurther upheaval.While we seek to strengthen the rule of law andinstitutions of governance  we wish to make clear thatauthority emanates from the citizen who occupies thepolitical position not from the political post itself.There must be a legal foundation in this respect  anddecisions must not be taken because of the whims oropinions of a person in authority. The previous regimeissued many arbitrary rules  regulations and decisionsbased on one man’s views. The alternative intomorrow’s Iraq will be the application of the rule oflaw through sanctioned legislative authority thatreflects the will of the Iraqi people  through anindependent judiciary and under the supervision of anelected legal body.Last but not least  let me touch on the relationshipbetween religion and State in the new Iraq. Islam is thereligion of the overwhelming majority of Iraqis. It isvital to the Iraqi identity as well as to the State and thenature of governance. In any case  the greatcivilizational heritage and rich cultural repository ofIslamic jurisprudence is  no doubt  one of Iraq’s assets and we will benefit from it through a judiciary that isbased on equality and pluralism.Let me point out a truth that is often overlooked:that the State  during the previous century  usedreligion for its own ends and took from it what suitedthose who had usurped power. They rejected theindependence of institutions and of religious centres taking over the Awqaf and imposing a religiousterminology that suited their own interests  at theexpense of those of others. In Iraq  religion is one ofthe most important assets of the individual and ofsociety. We will not abandon it in any area  or reject itsjudicial  intellectual  behavioural or daily implications.We call for the rehabilitation of all religiousinstitutions by enabling them to reassume theirresponsibilities in protecting Iraqi citizens who seektheir moral and spiritual guidance without hypocriticalpolitical involvement.These are the main guidelines for what we wantfor our country.Our right today is to demand help and assistancefrom the world  thanking all those who stood by theIraqis in their darkest hour and forgiving those whoinadvertently did not stand with us. It is important forall nations of the world to acknowledge that whathappened in Iraq — past atrocities and today’sreconstruction — reflects an ongoing and dramatichistorical event. The international community muststand shoulder to shoulder with us. That is what weourselves want and what we want from others on theroad to a free  just and peaceful Iraq.We want an Iraq in which unity and plurality aretwo sides of the same coin. We want an Iraq thatreturns sovereignty to the individual citizen  not to theleader. We want an Iraq that is secure in its cultural andreligious identity and engaged in open dialogue withthe world. We want an Iraq that embraces its past whilelooking to the future — an Iraq that is at peace withitself  its neighbours and with the world. We want anIraq that will eradicate all Ba’athists once and for all bring all their officials to justice and prevent them fromassuming power again.(spoke in English)I stand before the Assembly as the representativeof a free Iraq. To all those here who helped us in ourstruggle for liberation  we extend our gratitude. Our31liberation would not have been achieved without thedetermination of President George W. Bush and thecommitment of the coalition  at the forefront of whichstand the people of the United States of American andGreat Britain. The Iraqis will never forget their courageand sacrifice on our behalf.To those who stood with the dictator and whocontinued to question to intentions of the American andBritish Governments in undertaking this liberation —we invite you to come and visit the mass graves wherehalf a million of our citizens lie. Come and visit thedried-up marshes  come and visit Halabja  wherechemicals were dropped on civilians. Come andexamine the lists of the disappeared  whose right to lifewas taken from them by Saddam Hussain  and we  theIraqi people  will ask you why you chose to remainsilent. We are here today to declare that a new Iraq hasbeen born — an Iraq in which dignity  justice andhuman rights are assured for all citizens  an Iraq atpeace with its people  its neighbours and the world  anIraq that stands ready to regain its rightful place in theinternational community of free and proud nations."
"81",3399,"ISL",58,2003,"﻿Allow me at theoutset to congratulate the President on his election tothe presidency of this General Assembly. The role ofthe President in providing overall leadership to theAssembly is crucial and I am confident he will guide uswisely through the complex tasks ahead of us.A month from now  a group of young people willgather at the University of Iceland to take part in amodel United Nations conference. It is good to seesuch enthusiasm for the ideals of the United Nationsamong young people — as well as a desire toexperiment with how the United Nations machineryworks in practice. But I wonder whether their modelwill accurately reflect how our United Nations works. Iam concerned that  if it does  will it increase or dampentheir enthusiasm?If they were to model the General Assembly  Isuspect that their model would contrast in a number ofways with the real thing. Their agenda would be moreconcise. They would concentrate on pure and moreimmediate issues of urgency. They would have littletime for often-repeated resolutions whose relevance ischiefly historical. They would not allow such items tocrowd out more immediate matters. They wouldaddress the world as it is  not the world of yesteryear.To be honest  I am worried that the more accurately theirUnited Nations model reflected the real thing  be it theGeneral Assembly or the Security Council  the moredifficult it would be to explain to those young idealistsour purpose and convince them of our effectiveness.As already stated by my Danish colleague  onbehalf of the Nordic countries  I would very much liketo welcome the proposal of the Secretary-General toestablish a high-level panel of eminent personalities tomake recommendations on issues ranging from peaceand security to reform of United Nations structures.The General Assembly has tremendous achievementsto its credit. It is  as we affirmed in our MillenniumDeclaration  the chief deliberative policy-making andrepresentative organ of the United Nations. Theachievements of the General Assembly in internationalnorm-setting and in the establishment of aninternational legal framework is undisputed. Itspotential is great but  as the young people at our UnitedNations model would bluntly point out  it needs fixing.If we believe the General Assembly is wheredeliberation should be carried out  let us ensure that theagenda and procedures allow debate and deliberation totake place in an interactive manner. If we believe that itis the chief policy-making body  let us ensure that itdevelops policy  perhaps by linking debate moreclosely with the decision-making process. Policy needsto be followed-up; we need to do more onimplementation. My delegation will contribute activelyand constructively in the forthcoming deliberations onreforms of the General Assembly during this session.Our young people at the United Nations modelnext month will in fact be modelling the SecurityCouncil. I suspect that they will raise some questionsabout the composition of that body. Iceland is seriously27concerned with the slow progress in the open-endedworking group. Though it provides  for the time being the appropriate forum for continued dialogue  Icelandwould welcome any additional initiatives to furtherintensify the process towards satisfactory resolution ofthis important matter.The Icelandic position on the reform of the SecurityCouncil is on record. It is essential that the membership ofthe Council better reflect the membership of the UnitedNations as a whole. At the same time  the efficiency ofthe Council must be preserved. Further steps should betaken to increase transparency in the decision-makingprocess  in order to build on the welcome steps alreadytaken by the Council.Iceland supports an increase in both permanent andnon-permanent seats at the Council. New permanentmembers should have the same rights and obligations asthe current permanent members. The veto right shouldbe restricted and an obligation to state the reason for itsuse should be established  including why a permanentmember considers a matter to be of vital importance.Iceland has  for the first time  put forward itscandidacy for membership of the Security Council forthe years 2009 and 2010. We see participation in theSecurity Council as a logical expression of ourdetermination to fulfil our responsibilities within theUnited Nations and contribute as an active member ofthe international community.The promotion and protection of human rights mustbe a central concern of all United Nations activities. Inthis regard  much more needs to be done to implementour commitment regarding the rights of women and therights of the child. Iceland has signed the UnitedNations Protocol to Prevent  Suppress and PunishTrafficking in Persons and has enacted legislationagainst trafficking in human beings. Iceland is workingagainst the trafficking of women through a commoncampaign with the other Nordic countries and theBaltic States. The Icelandic campaign will focus oninforming and increasing awareness among the publicabout this issue.We should be especially aware of the implicationsfor human rights of new threats and new policies. Inparticular  we must ensure that fundamental humanrights are not violated in our counter-terrorist effort  ashas been underlined by the Secretary-General.In Iraq  the United Nations itself has recentlybeen the target of two terrorist attacks. I would like touse this opportunity to express the most sincerecondolences on behalf of the Icelandic Government tothe United Nations and the families of the UnitedNations officials who lost their lives. I would also liketo wish those who were wounded full recovery.The United Nations and the Security Council inparticular must address the issue of Iraq. Iceland  alongwith many other Member States  is contributing toIraq’s reconstruction and will continue to do so. Thesituation will demand all our resourcefulness and aconcerted effort at cooperation by all parties in theSecurity Council to ensure that the people of Iraq areassured the destiny they deserve. This destiny shouldencompass peace and democracy  affording equal rightsand justice to all Iraqi citizens.On terrorists  renewed efforts must be made toreach an agreement on a universal definition duringthis General Assembly. Such a definition would makethe fight against terrorists more effective.It is estimated that close to 90 per cent of victimsin today’s armed conflicts are civilians  the majority ofwhom are women and children. Women and girlsexperience conflicts differently than men because oftheir status in society. Their rights must be protected insituations of armed conflict and we must ensure thatwomen play a central role in conflict prevention peacekeeping and peace-building. United NationsSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) lays theground rules for this to happen and must beimplemented in all of its aspects.It is our role to ensure that globalization benefitsall countries  not least through targeted developmentcooperation. Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to be thefocus of our bilateral development cooperation while wewill also increase our contribution and involvement inmultilateral development cooperation  especially throughthe United Nations Development Programme  the UnitedNations Population Fund  the United Nations Children’sFund  the United Nations Development Fund forWomen and the World Food Programme.I just returned  like many others  from Cancún where we had difficult discussions on correcting the traderules so that developing countries can operate on a morelevel playing field in world trade. This work is vital andwe must push on with it. With determination we canbreak through the impasse that we reached in Cancún.28Iceland is one of the many island States in theworld whose well-being and development is cruciallyaffected by the state of the marine environment.Sustainable harvesting of living marine resources is themainstay of our economy. Resolution 57/141  onOceans and the Law of the Sea  which was adoptedduring our last session  provides for the establishmentof a regular process for the global reporting andassessment of the state of the marine environment commonly referred to as Global Marine Assessment  aconcept that was initiated by Iceland in 1999.An intergovernmental meeting should beconvened in 2004 to decide upon the modalities of thisprocess and negotiate an agreement between UnitedNations agencies. It is our sincere hope that such ameeting could turn out to be fruitful in the process ofthe establishment of the Global Marine Assessment.We must craft for ourselves a United Nationswhich is task-oriented  representative  focused andcoordinated. I believe strongly that the United Nationsshould not only be a place where we can talk aboutwhat we want to do  it must also be the place andinstrument to get things done. We have taken note ofthe Secretary-General’s call for changes in ourinstitution by 2005.There are varying opinions on how the UnitedNations should operate  but I believe there is a generalrecognition that the United Nations is  and mustremain  the key forum in which we exercise ourcollective responsibility. At the Millennium Summit heads of State and Government reaffirmed their faith inthe Organization and its Charter as indispensablefoundations of a more peaceful  prosperous and justworld. They defined our priorities for this century andresolved to make the United Nations a more effectiveinstrument for pursuing all of these priorities. It is upto us  the Member States  to make it possible for theUnited Nations to realize these objectives."
"82",3446,"ISR",58,2003,"﻿I would like to congratulateHis Excellency  the Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia upon his assumption of the Presidency of the GeneralAssembly  and wish him much success.Until just one month ago  every person in this halland every Member of this Organization joined us in thehope that the Middle East peace process might finallybe back on track  and that a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict might be on the horizon. Theestablishment of a new Palestinian Governmentpromised an end to terror and a new beginning.This glimmer of hope was darkened on 19 Augustby the extremists who blew up a bus full of Jewishfamilies on their way home from prayers at the WesternWall  the holiest site in the Jewish religion. Twenty-three people  young and old  mothers and babies intheir cradles  were slaughtered in that attack. Thatattack was carried out by Hamas  a terroristorganization  which  under the road map  should havebeen dismantled by the Palestinian Authority. Failureto dismantle Hamas and other extremist organizationshas brought our diplomatic efforts to a standstill.Rather than acting to fulfil its obligation  thePalestinian Authority has chosen the route of inaction and complicity in terror.We cannot allow this to continue. We must restorehope that we can build a better future for our children.The infrastructure of terror must be dismantled so thatwe can put our peace efforts back on track. There is notime other than now. There is no other way.For many years it was thought that terrorism inthe Middle East was Israel’s problem  not the world’s.Today  the world knows otherwise. Today  it is not onlyIsrael that mourns the loss of its loved ones  includingwomen and children and babies  at the hands of theterrorists. Sadly  we have been joined by peoples fromacross the globe — from Mombassa to Casablanca andfrom Moscow to Bali. Even the United Nations  whichfor so many has been a symbol of peace and goodwill is not immune.28 Gathered here today in New York  just two shortyears after 11 September  the community of nationsknows that those who seek to advance their politicalagendas through killing innocents are ready to strike atanyone or anything that represents the values offreedom and human life.Terrorism has declared war on us all. Israel hasoften stood alone in this battle. A country that hassuffered more than any other from terrorism  we havealways understood the danger it poses to democracyand freedom everywhere  even when others refused tosee this  and condemned us for our actions. We havealways understood that terrorism  no matter what cause itclaims to serve  seeks only to destroy  rather than to build.There can be no neutrality in the war againstterrorism and there can be no immunity for those whoengage in it. Abstaining is not an option. This is not awar of choice. Terrorism will not be eliminated untilthe world unites against it. Our only choice is to win.Every member of the international community musttake concrete and proactive measures to cut off allchannels of financial  moral and political support tothis common enemy.States Members of this institution that sponsorterrorists and give them shelter are accomplices in theacts of terror themselves. They must be heldaccountable for their crimes. It is no coincidence thatStates that sponsor terrorism  like Iran and Syria  arealso striving to acquire weapons of mass destruction.Their hostility to freedom and the rule of law puts thevery future of humanity in jeopardy.I know that many in this place see Yasser Arafatas the symbol of the Palestinian struggle. Tragically for his people and for ours  he is one of the world’sicons of terror. In the 10 years since Arafat made acommitment to Israel and the world that he would nolonger use terror  1 126 Israelis have been killed andthousands wounded in 19 000 separate Palestinianterrorist attacks. In relative numbers  this would be thesame as 11 000 French or 56 000 Americans dyingfrom terrorism in the same period of time.This carnage must stop. Its impact on bothsocieties is devastating. Yasser Arafat bears directresponsibility for this terrible suffering. He has led hispeople along the path of terror — from hijackings tosuicide bombings — for more than 30 years  alwayspreferring Israeli pain over Palestinian gain. He hasbeen — and he remains — the greatest obstacle topeace between our peoples. For as long as he controlsthe levers of power  no moderate leadership canemerge. To vote for Arafat  like we saw in thisAssembly just last week  is to vote against thePalestinian people. When Arafat wins  terrorism wins and we all lose. Instead of rallying around Arafat  theinternational community must rally around the genuineinterests of the Palestinian people. They must do sonow  before he leads them even further down the pathof terror and destruction.When a responsible and empowered Palestinianleadership finally emerges — a leadership ready to jointhe war on terror — it will find us a willing partner forpeace. Israel is committed to the vision for Middle Eastpeace laid out by United States President George Bushon 24 June 2002. Israel will not compromise on thesafety of its citizens  but we will go the extra mile  aswe have proven before  to bring peace and security toboth our peoples.We are ready to work with the Palestinians andwith the international community to make this vision areality. For this to happen  the Palestinian leadershipmust take the moral and strategic decision to abandonterrorism once and for all  and make peacemakingpossible. They must guide their people to build theirown society  rather than seek to destroy ours. They too  must understand that it is not poverty that breedsterror but terror that breeds poverty.We cannot stop only at dismantling theinfrastructure of terror. We must also build aninfrastructure of peace. It is up to political and moralleaders everywhere to foster an environment whichrejects extremism and empowers the peacemakers. Thisis particularly so in the Arab and Muslim world  whereincitement against Israel closes hearts and minds to thepossibility of peace.Leaders must guide their people away from theculture of hate  and replace it with a culture oftolerance. Concrete expressions of cooperation andexchange must be built in media and government education  science and business  to reinforce themessage of tolerance and acceptance.For the sake of our collective future  voices ofmoderation must be heard. For the sake of ourcollective future  Israel and the Arab nations must learnto live together side by side  to overcome our conflictsjust as the nations of Europe have learned to overcometheirs. Israel is living among its Arab neighbours. We29 believe in a common future of peace and prosperitywith them. My many meetings with Arab leaders overthe last few days have encouraged me to believe thattogether we can make our region a better place.This culture of peace must permeate not only theborders of the Middle East  it must permeate the wallsof the United Nations as well. In the past  the UnitedNations has shown us that it can play a positive role.This Assembly was key to the founding of the State ofIsrael  55 years ago. Security Council resolutions 242(1967) and 338 (1973) are our guideposts tonegotiations and peace.To play such a constructive role in the future  theUnited Nations must reform. It must move away fromthe partisan hostility that has taken over its Middle Eastagenda. For more than three decades  this Assemblyhas passed every year a litany of resolutions designedto discredit Israel  challenge its interests  and promotethe will of its greatest enemies.In my hand I am holding a collection of thedecisions of the fifty-seventh General Assembly on theMiddle East — 175 pages filled not with hope  but withthe negative agendas of the past. No other country hassuffered such unjustified attack and consistentdiscrimination within the United Nations system. Thetime has come to end this campaign of diplomaticincitement. For the sake of Israelis and Palestinians —for the sake of the United Nations and peace itself — Icall on this body to rise above the tired politics ofyesterday  and adopt a new  courageous agenda fortomorrow.I call on the General Assembly to abandon theautomatic adoption of anti-Israel resolutions and tofind ways of making itself relevant once again to theinterests of the people it claims to serve. I call on thisAssembly to fulfil its historic mission and helppromote what unites us  not what divides us.On the morning of 1 February of this year  Israellost its first astronaut in the Space Shuttle Columbiadisaster — a skilled and courageous pilot whom I knewpersonally  a child of Holocaust survivors  a nationalhero. Colonel Ilan Ramon embodied the spirit of ournation. He was a man of courage and action  dedicatedto the well-being of his people. Just as he sought tocontribute to the advancement of his fellow man  hemet his death  together with colleagues from the UnitedStates and India  on a scientific mission in the name ofhumanity as a whole.Israel’s place in such endeavours of internationalcooperation and accomplishment is no coincidence. Inthe 55 years since the State of Israel was established recognized and welcomed into the family of nations our achievements in the fields of science andtechnology  the arts and literature and agriculture andmedicine have come to rank with the best in the world.Our international cooperation programme is celebratedin over a hundred countries around the globe  sharingskills  experience and knowledge for the benefit ofmillions of people. We extend this hand of friendshipto all the nations of the world. We welcome ourimproving relations with Europe  just as we remaincommitted to promoting closer ties with the nations ofAfrica  Asia and the Americas.The Zionist vision of Israel’s founders was tobring into the world a State in our ancient homeland toserve as a haven from persecution for our people  aplace where the Jewish people could fulfil its right toself-determination in the modern era and a bastion ofdemocracy and opportunity for all its citizens. Ourfounders also made a promise not just to the people ofIsrael  but also to the people of the Middle East as awhole — to pursue peace and to work for the commonadvancement of our region.I know personally the profound meaning of thishistoric undertaking. I came to Israel as a youngrefugee from Tunisia. I serve as one of hundreds ofthousands of immigrants to whom Israel has grantedpromise and protection  freedom and opportunity through the values and institutions of democracy.I stand here today to reaffirm  before the nationsof the world  the commitment of my country to peace.Peace for the people of Israel is both a moral andhistoric imperative. “Shalom” — the word for peace inHebrew — is central to our language and our heritage.It is how we say “hello” and it is how we say“goodbye”. It is a name we give to our children. It ismy own family name.It was our prophet Isaiah  who brought thismessage of peace to the world centuries ago  when hesaid: “And they shall beat their swords intoploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks.Nation shall not lift up sword against Nation  neithershall they learn war any more”.Israel’s historic record is clear. Whenever a truepartner for peace has emerged  he has been met withIsrael’s extended hand. This was true when President30 Anwar Sadat of Egypt came to Jerusalem in 1977 and itwas true when King Hussein of Jordan signed thePeace Treaty with us in 1994. The same is true today.Israel stands ready to complete the circle of peace withall its neighbours — real peace  not just peace for theheadlines  but peace which brings an end to violenceand hostility and positive change for the citizens of ourregion.From this great rostrum — a rostrum shared byall humanity — I call on the leaders of Syria andLebanon  of Iran and of the Palestinian people toabandon once and for all their hostility towards us andto join us in building a better future for our children.This evening  I shall return to Jerusalem  theeternal capital of the Jewish people  to join with themin celebrating Rosh Hashanah  the Jewish New Year.According to our tradition  this is a time when Goddetermines the fate of each and every individual for thecoming year. These are days of reflection and prayer.May all our prayers for peace and for life be answered and may the actions and deeds of all the States andpeoples represented here in this Hall bring to mankindpeace and all the blessings that life can offer."
"83",3493,"ITA",58,2003,"﻿I have the honour toaddress the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly on behalf of the European Union  over whichItaly presides until 31 December 2003. The associatedcountries  Cyprus  the Czech Republic  Estonia Hungary  Latvia  Lithuania  Malta  Poland  the SlovakRepublic and Slovenia  align themselves with thisstatement.On this occasion  I cannot forget the sacrifice ofSergio Vieira de Mello and the other United Nationsofficials who recently fell victim to blind indiscriminate hatred in Baghdad. Allow me also topay a tribute to the memory of the Foreign Minister ofSweden  Anna Lindh  the victim of a brutal act ofviolence. In their memory and in the memory of allthose who gave their lives in the service of freedom democracy and human rights  the European Union paysa heartfelt tribute.Two weeks ago  we commemorated the secondanniversary of 11 September. The European Unionremembers with great sorrow the victims of thoseattacks  when the horror of terrorism struck this city the United States and the world.The European Union welcomes the Secretary-General's recent report on the implementation of thedevelopment goals indicated in the United NationsMillennium Declaration and its conclusions. We sharehis view that the multilateral institutions should be32updated and strengthened  and we are ready tocontribute actively to the goal of building aninternational order based on effective multilateralinstitutions and within the fundamental framework ofthe Charter.We are all convinced that two of the greatestthreats to peace and security today are terrorism andthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.The European Union condemns all acts ofterrorism  which are threats to democracy  humanrights and economic and social development. We mustbe firm in our determination to destroy this virus andfree present and future generations from its attacks.Efforts to combat terrorism must respect human rightsand the fundamental freedoms  the rule of law andhumanitarian law.In this struggle  we are working in closecollaboration with and give our full support to theUnited Nations. It is a battle that must be conducted forthe sake of freedom and democracy   the universalvalues enshrined in the Charter  which should bedeeply rooted in the lives of all the peoples of thisglobalized world.We must show the same commitment to stop theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and theirvectors. We cannot shirk our responsibilities. TheEuropean Union has doubled its efforts to put an end tothis threat to international peace and security. Afterhaving recently agreed to an action plan  we are nowbusy with its implementation. Universal subscription tothe main multilateral agreements is at the heart of theEuropean Union's policies.World peace and security are indivisible. Thepeoples of Europe are well aware of the need toaddress both the military and the humanitarian aspectsof the North Korean situation. The European Union isclosely watching the six-party talks aimed at resolvingthe current crisis relative to North Korea's nuclearprogramme. The European Union sends a firm appealto North Korea to completely dismantle its nuclearprogramme in a prompt transparent  verifiable andirreversible manner  in compliance with the obligationsderiving from international non-proliferationagreements.The European Union reiterates its request to Indiaand Pakistan to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to act incompliance with Security Council resolution 1172(1998). We forcefully encourage India and Pakistan topursue a process of political dialogue that will lead toan agreement that is satisfactory to all the parties on allthe controversial points  including Kashmir: a problemthat cannot be resolved through violence or terrorism.The European Union expresses its growingconcern over the development of the Iranian nuclearprogramme and the risks of proliferation that itinvolves. We reiterate our expectation that Iran willdemonstrate accelerated cooperation and fulltransparency with the International Atomic EnergyAgency (IAEA) by acceding to its requests. Urgent andunconditional acceptance  signature and theimplementation of an IAEA additional protocol onsafeguards are of the utmost importance. Theinternational community would consider it a sign ofIran's commitment to the non-proliferation frameworkand a step toward the desired reforms.The non-proliferation of weapons of massdestruction is a priority. It requires constant politicalpressure and the use of every political and diplomaticinstrument available as the first line of defence. Wecannot allow weapons of mass destruction to end up inthe hands of terrorists or regimes that represent a threatto world peace.In that context  another grave danger isrepresented by the increasing spread of light andportable weapons and by the expansion of armedorganized violence  whose toll in human lives hasbegun to exceed the lives lost in wars.With regard to non-proliferation  the EuropeanUnion is firmly committed to supporting the UnitedNations  particularly the Security Council  in pursuit ofthe following common objectives: strengtheninginternational agreements; increasing support for themonitoring agencies; and intensifying controls overillegal trafficking. Finally  should all political anddiplomatic measures fail  recourse to coercivemeasures provided for by the Charter cannot be ruledout.However  recourse to force can be avoided if allthe instruments of international law  including humanrights safeguards  come to prevail in all their effects.We are all persuaded that that is the proper thing to do.To that end  the European Union considers theInternational Criminal Court a new instrument with33great powers of deterrence and reiterates its fullsupport for the Court and its universalization.The EU is and will always remain committed tothe promotion and protection of all human rights andall fundamental freedoms. In that context  we reiterateour strong support for achieving universal abolition ofthe death penalty. In recent years  important progresshas been made in that direction  thanks in part to civilsociety. Abolition is our primary goal. Where capitalpunishment continues to exist  however  we arerequesting that its application be impeded through ageneral moratorium on executions.Conflict prevention and crisis management areessential components of the EU's contribution tosafeguarding international peace and security. Morethan 40 000 men and women of the European Unionare currently deployed on United Nations-ledor -authorized peace operations in the world.The Union is directly involved in missions in theformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  Bosnia andHerzegovina and  until a few days ago  the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  where it demonstrated its willto contribute to the international community's efforts torestore peace and stability in Africa  including bymilitary means.In light of this concrete commitment  theEuropean Union reaffirms its support for reforming andstrengthening United Nations peacekeeping activities.The decision by the Council of the EuropeanUnion to strengthen cooperation between the EuropeanUnion and the United Nations in the area of crisismanagement reaffirms the Union's strategic relationswith the Organization. The Union is now draftingguidelines on the protection of civilians in Union-ledpeacekeeping operations that will fully reflect UnitedNations principles.Democracy is the only system of government thatcan fully guarantee respect for human rights whilefostering development  prosperity and peace. TheEuropean Union plans to increase cooperation withcountries that share the values of freedom anddemocracy. In a spirit of openness towards the entireinternational community  the European Union states itswillingness to give support to all States that intend tocomply with those principles.The European Union continues to consider itsrelations with Africa a priority and recalls the commoncommitment to strengthen this dialogue. The EuropeanUnion has expressed a special interest in strengtheningAfrican peacekeeping and conflict-resolutioncapacities  and has also targeted its initiatives in thosefields on Africa. We are committed to supporting theefforts of the African Union to establish a regionalsecurity mechanism.The European Union will continue to work forinter-African peace and will support the efforts ofAfrican States to end the many conflicts that afflict thecontinent. Stable conditions for peace cannot becreated  however  without a strategy to eradicate thecauses of poverty and the social exclusion that fuel somany conflicts in Africa and other regions of theworld.On the long road towards managing globalizationand spreading its benefits to all  Europe will remainfirmly committed to Africa  and the European Union'sprivileged partnership with African countries shallcontinue. In this framework  we reiterate our supportfor the New Partnership for Africa's Development andfor the hopes that it represents for Africandevelopment.The European Union's special commitment toAfrica should also be seen in the framework of theMillennium Development Goals  primarily designed toeradicate poverty  hunger  disease  social and genderinequality and environmental degradation. In thisregard  we reaffirm our commitment to fight AIDS tuberculosis and malaria with a view to eradicatingthem.The European Union expresses its deep regretover the failure to achieve substantial progress at theCancun Conference organized by the World TradeOrganization (WTO)  especially with regard toagricultural products. We remain convinced thatincreased liberalization of world trade  together withdevelopment cooperation activities  can play a crucialrole in achieving the Millennium Development Goalsfor a better world. This is why the European Unionbelieves that it is important to continue the negotiationsin the WTO framework with the determination andflexibility needed to honour the commitmentsenshrined in the Doha Development Agenda.The European Union has made a financialcommitment  in line with the Monterrey objectives  toincrease official development assistance to 0.39 percent of gross national product by 2006.34Our commitment does not stop at financialcontributions. We also intend to join our developmentpartners in a process that integrates the fight againstpoverty and disease with progress in the field ofsafeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms good governance and environmental protection. Theprotection of our environment  including throughimplementing the commitments undertaken by signingthe Kyoto Protocol  is the benchmark of our ability tofoster sustainable development that reconciles thedemands of economic and social progress with the needto protect natural resources. Those two goals are notalternatives but rather the pillars of the JohannesburgDeclaration.The European Union appreciates the progressmade since the fifty-seventh session of the GeneralAssembly following the presentation of the Secretary-General's report on reform  Strengthening of theUnited Nations: an agenda for further change'(A/57/387 and Corr.1). It continues to support theSecretary-General's efforts to implement the reformsneeded to bring about efficient management capable ofachieving the objectives established for the UnitedNations by the international community. We will workfor the adoption of a budget plan for the 2004-2005biennium that supports the implementation of theMillennium Declaration and the reform process begunduring the Assembly's fifty-seventh session.Safeguarding international peace and securityrequires a strong commitment to address regionalconflicts. A lack of such a commitment could entailincreased destabilization  to the detriment of the entireinternational community.In the Middle East  the European Union is deeplyconcerned by the deterioration of relations between theState of Israel and the Palestinian Authority andreiterates its strong support for the road map  the onlyhope for lasting peace and for paving the way towardsstability and development in the region. The EuropeanUnion will lend its efforts to this end within theQuartet. To implement the road map  it is alsoimportant that the European Union and the Group ofEight countries have a specific and generouscommitment to a plan for the comprehensive economicreconstruction of the area. Both Israel and thePalestinian Authority must act urgently to implementthe commitments contained in the road map.In Iraq  the European Union has welcomed theend of Saddam Hussain's regime  whose power wasbuilt on fear and the violation of human rights. Theformation of the Iraqi Governing Council was the firstmajor step towards a representative government of theIraqi people. The European Union stresses theimportance of the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty andthe establishment of a fully representative IraqiGovernment through democratic elections. The UnitedNations has a vital role in this process. The upcomingdonors conference in Madrid provides a welcomeopportunity for all those who share our concern forIraq's future to make a positive contribution to thepolitical and economic regeneration of Iraq. Werecognize that  for the reconstruction process to besuccessful  it will need to be accompanied byimprovements in the security situation.In Afghanistan  the European Union wishes toexpress its full appreciation for the work done by theUnited Nations within the framework of the Bonnprocess.We will continue to assure our support for theprocess of democratization also through assistance tothe reconstruction of the country. The European Unionunderlines the importance of an effective reform in thearea of security as the basis for lasting security andstability in Afghanistan and throughout the region. Thepreparations for the 2004 elections to choose agovernment and parliament that are representative ofall components of Afghan society are of primaryimportance.In accordance with the conclusions of theEuropean Council of Thessaloniki  the European Unionwill continue to work tirelessly in support of theSecretary-General's efforts to achieve acomprehensive  just  viable and functional solution tothe Cyprus problem  consistent with the relevantSecurity Council resolutions.Relations between the countries of Europe andLatin America are rooted in history and provide thebasis for intense collaboration and for the EuropeanUnion's strong interest in the region. The EuropeanUnion is committed to further improving the overallarrangements of its relations with the countries ofCentral and South America.Lastly  the European Union will continue tosupport the processes of stabilization  democratizationand development in the western Balkans. At the35European Union-Balkan Summit in Thessaloniki  theEuropean Union reaffirmed its full consensus on thefuture European perspective of the region. Therealization of those hopes will depend on the ability ofthe individual countries in the region to implementinstitutional  governmental and economic reforms  andon the fulfilment of the political criteria of theEuropean Union  including full cooperation with theInternational Criminal Tribunal for the FormerYugoslavia and progress in the field of respect for therights of minorities.The events of recent decades have profoundlychanged the world order. Today the conditions exist forthe democracies of the world to unite in order to spreadthose values that are the unavoidable premise for allothers: freedom and democracy.In the Millennium Declaration we promised food water  health and education to the greatest possiblenumber of citizens. Now the democracies must committhemselves to providing  also and above all  theintangible values from which the other  more tangibleones spring  because without the prerequisites offreedom and democracy there can be no hope forlasting peace and development  nor can there be anultimate defeat of the challenge of poverty."
"84",3539,"JAM",58,2003,"﻿Your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession  Sir  is a source of great pride and considerablesatisfaction to Jamaica and the entire Caribbean. Weregard it as a tangible acknowledgement of the region’sactive engagement on the global stage. I am confidentthat your combination of long political experience outstanding diplomatic skills and commitment toglobal comity will enable all of us to benefit from yourguiding hand at a time when the United Nations  thevery cornerstone of global security and economiccooperation  faces its most severe test and the Charteritself is exposed to its greatest challenge. We also wishto commend the Secretary-General for his work duringa very difficult year and in trying circumstances for theUnited Nations.It may eventually prove to be a fortunate quirk ofhistory that  by virtue of the rotation system  adistinguished representative of the Caribbean nowoccupies the presidency. For  by virtue of our history location and size  we who fashioned the CaribbeanCommunity thirty years ago recognized that we wouldnever be able to acquire the economic power ormilitary might to stand alone. Multilateralism therefore  affords us our only source of protection.Therefore  from its inception  our Community hasremained resolute in upholding the sovereign equalityof States and the maintenance of an international orderthat protects the weak and powerless from domination.The international situation today is filled withuncertainty and fear. There is a prevailing climate ofdistrust and insecurity. Humankind faces the dangers ofterrorism  nuclear proliferation and weapons of massdestruction. We witness outbreaks of war and violenceand a worrying escalation of confrontation and conflict.There are new doctrines and policies that threatenpeace everywhere.The pillars of international law and respect forsovereign rights are being steadily eroded. Injusticeand abuses of human rights still remain manifest. Theseare real concerns that underscore the need to strengthen2multilateralism  to restore confidence in the UnitedNations system  to buttress its centrality in decisionsthat affect us all and to thereby enhance its capacity toenforce.The multilateral process will collapse unless theinternational community asserts a strong collective willto review the structures  mandates and procedures inour global system.In relation to efforts to strengthen multilateralism I wish to emphasize four requirements:First  multilateralism must be equitable. This iscritical for its credibility. It should promote policiesthat provide full opportunity for all States to benefitfrom the global system and that take into account theneeds  aspirations and welfare of the entire globalcommunity. It should be non-discriminatory andproceed from the principle that the lives of humanbeings cannot be differentiated on the basis of race nationality or religion.Secondly  multilateralism must be democratic.This is critical for its acceptability. Its decision-makingshould be based on a fully inclusive process  in whichall States have a voice and where dialogue and equalparticipation are encouraged and promoted.Thirdly  multilateralism must be principled. Thisis critical for its legitimacy. It must be based oncommon rules and standards devised and enforced bythe international community  standards withoutselective application or double standards.Fourthly  multilateralism must be effective. Thisis critical for its efficiency. Decisions  once taken should be implemented. Member States must exercisethe political will to guarantee that policies anddecisions that are agreed upon and taken are supportedand upheld.Adequate resources must also be provided wherenecessary. In order to promote the interests of allStates  the United Nations and multilateral institutionsmust facilitate the creation of new opportunities foreconomic development  through the expansion of tradeand investment flows and through technicalcooperation assistance.In order to strengthen multilateralism  we needreform and rebuilding to improve the work of theUnited Nations in areas such as developmentcooperation  humanitarian affairs and disarmament.No one  not even the five permanent members dares to dispute the compelling urgency of altering thedesign and function of the Security Council if it is tofulfil  in the realities of the world today  the mandateconferred by the Charter of 1945. The case forexpansion of membership is irrefutable  as is the needto redesign decision-making to correspond with theprinciple of the sovereign equality of States.Let me make it clear: reform must extend beyondcomposition and geographical balance. The SecurityCouncil  as presently constituted  makes no pretence atrepresenting democracy in the global system. This mustbe changed if we are to not fall into a dangerous abyss and it must be changed in a way that deters arrogantdeviation from the most basic elements of the rule ofinternational law. We have been talking for longenough; the time has come to cut the talk and walk thewalk.In 2001  from this podium  I called for a UnitedNations renaissance. Unless we undertake it now  onlythose who believe in a resurrection will still be present.None of us will then be able pretend that we are notresponsible for the demise of the Organization  nor willwe be able to exonerate ourselves from thecondemnation of history.With regard to the General Assembly  what isneeded is a resuscitation in the use of its powers andassertion of its role as the principal organ of the UnitedNations. This Assembly is a forum of equals. Itspronouncements and policy decisions must carry thestamp of legitimacy as it is the voice of theinternational community.But while we emphasize the importance ofinstitutional reform  there should be equal focus on theresponsibilities of membership. There is need for arevitalization in the commitment and political will ofMember States to support the multilateral system andprovide it with adequate resources. Irrespective of theinstitutional arrangements we may devise  it is  in thefinal analysis  the Member States alone who can makethe system work. We cannot afford to fail.The critical problems facing us concerning warand peace are compounded by the proliferation ofweapons of all kinds. Globally  military expendituresnow amount to over 800 billion dollars annually.Experience has shown  however  that military powerand massive investment in weapons do not bringsecurity and lasting peace. The force of arms cannot3impose a lasting peace. Instead  it breeds a climate ofinsecurity and feeds violence  war and terrorism withincreasingly destructive capacity.At the same time  the arms industry fuels arapidly growing underworld of trans-national organizedcrime  which jeopardizes law and order and impedeseconomic growth and social stability within ournational boundaries.It is tragic and painful to witness the continuedcycle of violence and carnage and the massivedestruction of property in the Middle East. No solutioncan result from the continued military subjugation ofthe Palestinians or from violence against the Israelis. Apolitical settlement has to be found to provide securityfor the Israeli people  to establish an independent Statefor the Palestinians and to make suitable arrangementsfor the security of all States in the region.We cannot begin to speak about the situation inIraq without noting the atmosphere of fear  disorderand insecurity which now prevails in that country. Wedeplore the recent bombings of the Jordanian Embassyin Baghdad and the United Nations office  whichresulted in the deaths of United Nations officials including that of the Special Representative of theSecretary-General in Iraq  and the bombing of theShi’ite mosque.We must all learn from what has happened in Iraqover the past year. The immediate question is how toformulate interim arrangements for the recovery andreconstruction of that country and the restoration of itssovereignty and independence  under a Governmentchosen by the Iraqi people. Efforts to re-engage theUnited Nations must ensure that it assumes ameaningful role in the peace-building process and thetransition to democracy.The situation in Africa has not been given thelevel of attention that is needed  particularly by theSecurity Council. The continued turmoil within parts ofthe continent shows the need for stabilization throughconciliation and dialogue between contending partiesto end further fighting and bloodshed. We commendthe role being played by regional organizations like theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS) and by African statesmen to mediate andbring peace to those areas of current concern. But moreshould be done.Additional resources are needed to assist toensure that societies disrupted by conflict can be re-established and stabilized. The obstacles to eliminatingpoverty and disease can be overcome by providingmaterial assistance  and we are convinced that Africahas the indigenous resources  the human potential andthe leadership to prevail over adversity.Within the global economy  the pattern continuesof a widening gap between developed and developingcountries. Wealth is increasing but poverty is alsogrowing in critical areas of the world. Although wecontinue to raise our voices to warn of the dangers ofthis global trend  our partners in the developed worldhave given little indication of a change in policies thatmight reverse it. We are continually told that prosperitywill come with policies of liberalization  a minimalistState and deregulation. In turn  these policies willunleash free enterprise to take advantage of economicopportunities that will lead to development and growth.But it has become painfully obvious that this modeldoes not succeed everywhere  particularly in thedeveloping world.As you know so well  Sir  the countries of theCaribbean Community (CARICOM) have for a longtime been a region where democracy flourishes and therule of law prevails. The strengthening of civil andpolitical rights in our countries has been our passionsince we gained our freedom.We know that no country is above improvementin any of these areas  but there is a fashion in theindustrial world — including countries that are newconverts to these values — to imply that their adoptionis the solution to all the problems of development.Were that so  Jamaica and all our countries of theCaribbean would have been havens of prosperity longago.What much of the developing world needs goesbeyond sermons about the precepts of democracy about obeying the rule of law and securing respect forhuman rights. The help we need is help in preservingthose rights from erosion by the instabilities that derivefrom underdevelopment and from the steadydeterioration in the global political environment.In the international community  those same valuesare being systematically discarded and destroyed  as ifour world society deserves less than our nationalcommunities. The persistence of underdevelopment —the denial of people’s full rights as human beings — is4the major challenge that poor countries face. We makethis clear  because it has become all too easy for richcountries to excuse themselves from any meaningfuleffort towards poverty alleviation and economicdevelopment by asserting that salvation lies simply insecuring civil and political rights. This is exactly whatthey did at Cancun to the poorest countries in theworld — to those who live in abject poverty — bydenying their plaintive petition for a better deal incotton.As the current Chairman of the CaribbeanCommunity  I assert that for us in the Caribbean  thefuture of our democracies lies in the strengthening ofour economies  in a more favourable tradingenvironment for our products  in more rapid andeffective debt relief  in the protection of legitimateareas of economic progress like our financial servicesindustry and in tailoring globalization and the dogmaof liberalization to the needs of small economies. Ourfuture lies  in short  in escaping the trap of poverty.That some are poorer does not make us less poor thanwe are; that some are less developed than we are doesnot alter our state of underdevelopment.Trade and competitiveness are not everything. Indeveloping countries there are weaknesses inproduction capacity and deficiencies at the micro levelthat can be helped through programmes of developmentcooperation. Regrettably  in recent years  donorresources for such cooperation have been shrinking.Where commitments have been given  there have justbeen too many promises broken. But we still remainhopeful that the pledges of Monterrey and the targets ofJohannesburg will be taken seriously as commitmentsto be implemented.Partnership should not be used as a vehicle forthe imposition of conditionalities to promote bilateralpolitical objectives. In our view  true partnership mustrespect the concept of ownership by recipients and thenational priorities as determined by them. Decisionsaffecting development are being taken in differentareas  in different forums and by different agencies.Increasingly  there is the need to ensure coherence inpolicies and programmes.The international system currently does not havean effective mechanism for conducting such anexercise. We reiterate our belief that one of the urgenttasks of the moment is to create a mechanism withinthe international architecture  which will focus ontrade  finance  technology and development policy inan integrated manner.We want to draw attention to the BarbadosProgramme of Action  which deals with thevulnerability of small island developing States (SIDS).We call on the donor community to support the reviewof international economic arrangements  when theinternational conference meets in 2004 to review theBarbados Programme of Action.We in Jamaica fully recognize that globalizationhas the potential to advance human developmentthroughout the world. But this is not automatic. Forglobalization has also increased our vulnerability insecurity and the possibility of marginalization. Smallcountries like Jamaica and groups like CARICOMcannot and should not be expected to follow the samepolicy prescriptions applied to larger  more advancedcountries. Special and differential treatment of ameaningful kind is important  as we require policyspace for our productive sectors. It cannot be expectedthat countries such as ours will abandon localproduction in agriculture and manufacturing  althoughwe fully recognize the growing importance andpotential of the service sector in both the regional andglobal economies.In the aftermath of Cancun  we in the globalcommunity need to accept that trade rules must beasymmetrical in recognition of the diversity in levels ofdevelopment and the size of economies. Trade rulesmust also recognize the right of all countries to protecttheir development priorities and vulnerable groups especially their small farmers. Development issues asthey relate to the World Trade Organization (WTO)agenda must be defined by developing countriesthemselves and not by others for us. The worldcommunity must recognize these principles to ensurethat the global trade architecture can bring meaningfulbenefits for all.Globalization may bring a more integrated world but there will always remain significant variations innational systems  cultures and national priorities. Thereis no single sustainable model for politicaldevelopment or economic success everywhere. We livein a diverse world where different ideas  cultural normsand standards exist. These should all be respected inthe framework of agreed principles within the UnitedNations. In a world of such diversity and pluralism there should be tolerance  understanding  non-5discrimination  self-determination  respect for equalrights and justice for all. Those  for us  aretranscendental values to which we in Jamaica andthroughout the Caribbean will always fully subscribe.The United Nations should continue to promoterespect for diversity while promoting the commonprinciples and ideals that form the foundations ofinternational law and order and internationalcooperation. This provides the only key for the pursuitof enduring peace  harmony and real development inthe global village to which we all belong."
"85",3585,"JOR",58,2003,"﻿Let mebegin by expressing warm congratulations to Mr. JulianHunte on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I can assure him ofthe full cooperation of the Jordanian delegation toensure the fulfilment of his mandate for the benefit ofall peoples and nations. I should also like to take thisopportunity to express our thanks and appreciation tohis predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for his remarkablestewardship of the previous session.A special tribute is due to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his efforts dedicated to upholdingthe lofty goals of the Organization. Mr. Annan has beenquite dynamic in his work to enhance this world body’seffectiveness and to revitalize its functions  especiallyin the areas of international peace and security  human26rights and social and economic progress throughout theworld.I wish to express our heartfelt condolences to theSecretary-General as well as to the family of Mr.Sergio Vieira de Mello and to those of all hiscolleagues who lost their lives as a result of theterrorist bombing of the United Nations headquarters inIraq  a barbaric act that we all condemn.The sad collapse of the Oslo processdemonstrated that a revival of the Middle East peaceprocess under the previous terms was no longer aviable option. Peace-making in the region requires anew modus operandi  as all transitional arrangementshave failed to establish and build mutual confidencebetween the two sides and to meet the envisionedgoals. Thus  the time has indeed come for a shift inapproach. Instead of managing the conflict in a waythat has led thus far to a perpetuation of the cycle ofviolence  our focus should be redirected onto the finalobjectives of the negotiations. Furthermore  it is nolonger useful to concentrate only on security aspectswithout realizing that the problem is essentiallypolitical in nature and not only a question of security.It was against that backdrop that George W. Bush President of the United States  launched in June 2002his vision for peace in the Middle East. On the basis ofthat initiative  the road map was formulated andannounced. Jordan contributed to the development ofthe road map  which generated a real turnaround in theregion’s political landscape. It established a frameworkof mutual obligations  whose aim is to end the Israelioccupation and to establish an independent Palestinianstate on the basis of relevant United Nationsresolutions and the Arab peace initiative. The road mapset forth a specific three-year time frame for the birthof a Palestinian State. Furthermore  it provided for thecreation of a monitoring and assessment mechanism toensure viable implementation according to specifictimelines.It was on the basis of that vision that theHashemite Kingdom of Jordan welcomed the road mapwhen it was formally announced by the Quartet. At thetime  we expressed the hope that that impetus wouldhelp to restart the peace process on a solid foundation.However  Jordan also made it clear that the declarationin and of itself would be insufficient to create forwardmovement towards our objectives. What wasadditionally required was a genuine commitment on thepart of the United States and the internationalcommunity to implement that vision. True to ourexpectations  we sensed such a genuine commitment atthe two recent Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba summits.Jordan  in the meantime  fully recognizes thatrecent developments on the ground — especially thecollapse of the ceasefire  or hudna  arrangementbetween the Palestinian groups and Israel — createsevere and real risks and threats for the road map.Nonetheless  we should stay the course with a view toimplementing the road map and putting an end to theoccupation and the tragic killing of civilians on boththe Palestinian and Israeli sides. The hard work that weare investing in this exercise is worthwhile given thepotential risk of failure and the absence of politicalopportunity again. Such failure would make for a moredangerous and complex scenario than before and wouldjeopardize the interests and security of all actors.On behalf of Jordan  I wish to urge from thisworld podium all stakeholders — especially themembers of the Quartet — to pursue their efforts toensure scrupulous implementation of the road map without any modifications and in a way that guaranteesby 2005 the establishment of a Palestinian State  withJerusalem as its capital  and the termination of theIsraeli occupation of all Arab territories occupied in1967. All that would be in keeping with the relevantUnited Nations resolutions and the Arab peaceinitiative  which is a key component of the road mapand provides a framework for peace — a peace that isacceptable to all peoples of the region and fulfils theirlong-standing aspirations.Along the same lines  we urge acceleration in thecreation of an effective political and securitymonitoring mechanism to be operated by the Quartet.That is essential to ensure strict implementation of  andcompliance with  without modifications  the respectiveobligations of both parties as set forth in the road map.To us  such a mechanism is an essential component onwhich we must insist  because we consider it to be atrue point of departure that would enable us to takeadvantage of the historic window of opportunity andbring about comprehensive  just and lasting peace inthe entire Middle East.Regarding suicide attacks  I wish to reiterate thatJordan took a principled position repudiating andcondemning such acts on both moral and politicalgrounds. We maintain that those operations have done27harm to the Palestinian cause and have resulted in theerosion of international sympathy for it. Furthermore they have shifted the global focus away from the corequestion of the Israeli occupation of Palestinianterritories and the pressing need to end that occupation.Along the same lines  we condemn Israel’sextrajudicial killing of Palestinian citizens. Let mestress once again that the prevailing atmosphere ofviolence will only play into the hands of extremists onboth sides of the divide. Therefore  it is high time toimplement the road map as accepted by all parties andto take bold and expeditious steps to place the entirepeace process back on an irreversible track.We call upon Israel to change its current securitypolicy  which has failed to ensure security for theIsraelis. Rather  Israel should move towards restorationof confidence with the Palestinian side partner side sothat both can focus on the political process by engagingin a serious implementation of the road map. To thisend  Israel must ease the suffering of the Palestinianpeople by lifting the closures on Palestiniancommunities  removing the restrictions imposed on thePalestinian leadership and by withdrawing its militaryforces from the cities occupied since September 2000 in compliance with Security Council resolution 1402(2002).In the same context  my Government condemnsthe decision taken by the Government of Israel toremove  in principle  from the occupied Palestinianterritories  the Palestinian President  Yasser Arafat who was legitimately elected by his people. In ourview  this decision seriously imperils the peaceprocess. We call on the Government of Israel to reverseits decision  which otherwise will plunge the entireregion into a dangerous tunnel.Jordan condemns the Israeli settlement activitiesthat take the form of unabated construction ofsettlements on occupied Palestinian land. Israel mustend these activities  which breach the basic norms ofinternational law and  not least  impede ongoing effortsto put the peace process back on track. We demand thatthe Government of Israel start dismantling allsettlements erected since March 2001. This is  after all a binding obligation of Phase I of the road map.We also condemn the separation wall  whichconsolidates Israeli occupation of Palestinianterritories  devours further Palestinian land  aggravatesthe suffering of the Palestinian population andanticipates as a fait accompli  the future shape of thePalestinian State. While we demand that Israel ceaseforthwith the construction of the wall  we stress theneed to respect the status of the 4 June 1967 line.Iraq has now entered a new phase during whichthe brotherly people of that country are facingenormous hardships and challenges. The eyes of allIraqis are now set on the international community inthe hope of receiving every possible assistance thatwould enable them to lay a solid foundation forbuilding a promising future that would includereconstructing their country and regaining its status asan active member in the Organization and of theinternational community.While we emphasize the need to safeguard theunity  territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq  toensure the withdrawal of the foreign occupation forcesas quickly as possible and to enable the people of Iraqto determine their future by themselves  we welcomethe formation of the transitional Governing Council asa first and important step towards a broad-based IraqiGovernment that represents the full spectrum of theIraqi population  to be elected by the people of Iraq asexpeditiously as possible on the basis of a constitutionaccepted and endorsed by them. Against this backdrop we decided to deal positively with the GoverningCouncil and with all political groups in Iraq. Let meelaborate that my Government has accepted theassumption by the representatives of the transitionalIraqi Government of the seat of Iraq in the League ofArab States on a temporary basis  based on theunderstanding that Iraq will subsequently movetowards drafting its constitution and holding electionsleading to the formation of a representative IraqiGovernment.We must also emphasize our condemnation of theviolations of human rights and international lawcommitted by the previous regime in Iraq  especiallythe crimes of assassination  mass killings and massburials  including the execution of Kuwaiti prisonersand detainees.At this juncture  I wish to underline the centralrole the United Nations must continue to play in Iraq.The United Nations should remain an active player inthe forthcoming political process; its role should not berestricted to humanitarian issues only. OurOrganization must assume the leading role inoverseeing the political process in the forthcoming28stage  including the finalization of the drafting of theconstitution and supervision of the elections to be heldin order to form a sovereign Iraqi Government.Jordan condemns in the strongest possible termsthe cowardly terrorist attack against the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad. Despite the immense tragedysuffered by the United Nations  we do have trust in theresolve and ability of the United Nations system tomaintain its operations and assistance to the Iraqipeople.As you are all aware  the Jordanian Embassycomplex in Baghdad was also a target of a viciousterrorist attack that claimed many innocent lives.Nonetheless  that appalling act reinforced our resolveto continue to reach out in every possible way to helpour brothers in Iraq  in order to enable them toovercome the overwhelming odds they have beenenduring.Terrorism has proved to be a global phenomenonthat cuts across national boundaries and is notexclusive to a particular region  language  religion orrace. It is therefore imperative for all members andinstitutions of the world community to combat it anderadicate it. Let me assure the Assembly that theGovernment and people of Jordan are determined toconfront this phenomenon which our citizens andinstitutions have suffered from for several decades.Once again  let me reiterate our firm commitment tocooperate with all countries and international efforts inthe joint fight against terrorism.We would like to express our full backing for theefforts aimed at achieving meaningful progress in thecurrent negotiations in the General Assembly to adopta comprehensive convention on combating terrorismand a convention on combating nuclear terrorism. Wehope that these endeavors will prove successful in theformulation of a legal and specific definition of theconcept of terrorism which would set it apart from therights protected under international law andinternational humanitarian law for States  peoples andindividuals.For out part  Jordan repudiates all viciousfalsehoods and sinister campaigns to smear Arabs andMuslims with the label of terrorism. This phenomenonis in complete contradiction of the true nature andmeaning of the Islamic faith  which is anchored in thevalues of justice  tolerance  peaceful coexistence andreverence for humankind. Thus  we feel a pressingneed to pay due attention to the role that the dialogueamong civilization plays in consolidatingunderstanding and coexistence among peoples andnations. It also helps in eliminating the causes ofextremism that emanate from a lack of genuineknowledge and comprehension of the essence ofreligions and cultures that are based on disseminating amessage of peace  understanding and acceptance ofothers.The political and economic developmentsunfolding in this era of globalization and informationtechnology prompt us to accelerate the process ofpolitical and economic openness in the developingcountries. That will help in the evolution of strongerincentives for achieving further progress and stability.Such an environment will be more amenable toeconomic growth and will generate a strongermomentum to eradicate poverty and human suffering aswe strive towards the fulfilment of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.In that context  democracy assumes a specialrelevance  especially since it is essentially an inherentprocess that evolves from the cultures and specificcharacteristics of societies. Therefore  it is virtuallyuntenable to impose this concept on others inprescribed forms that might not be in concert with thecultural structures of those communities.In Jordan  however  we are committed to pursuethe path of democratic reforms and development of thenational political process in all its aspects. In fact  thatissue is quite high on our national agenda  and ourexpectation is that further progress will be made in theenhancement of our democratic institutions.Bearing this in mind  Jordan will be guided by theconclusions outlined in the extremely valuable UnitedNations Development Programme report on ArabHuman Development. We are grateful to the UNDP andits team of Arab experts for their analytical methods inidentifying and profiling some pressing challengescurrently facing the Arab world. Jordan views thispublication with great interest and perceives it from anextremely positive perspective  given its merits interms of data  analytical approach and practical andspecific objectives as well as its valuable science-basedconclusions and recommendations.Our primary purpose should be how to improvethe role and performance of the United Nations in allspheres of its operations. More specifically  that should29include strengthening its role in the areas of preventivediplomacy  the management of humanitarian crises conflicts and wars  human rights violations  and thechallenges associated with globalization and thedevelopment of humankind.In that regard  Jordan welcomes the fact that theInternational Criminal Court is entering a new phase interms of the election of its Judges and Prosecutor which is a further step in the establishment ofinternational justice and in how violations ofinternational humanitarian law are treated. As theGeneral Assembly is well aware  Jordan had theprivilege of working hard to make significantcontributions in support of the Court’s creation and ofthe entry into force of its Statute.In the same vein  Jordan takes pride in theelection of Her Majesty Queen Rania Al-Abdullah tothe Board of Directors of the Victims’ Trust Fundestablished for the victims of crimes falling under thejurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. TheFund is expected to have a tangible impact inalleviating the anguish of the victims of the mosthorrifying crimes and of their families.With regard to United Nations peacekeepingoperations  Jordan continues to attach great importanceto this area of activity by the United Nations system.We are proud and privileged to participate with otherMember States in those global operations in areas thathave been afflicted by war  conflict and instability.However  to ensure the effective and completefulfilment of the lofty objectives of the mandate ofeach peacekeeping operation  adequate budgetary fundsmust be ensured for the operations’ smoothfunctioning  including on-time reimbursement ofpayments due to troop-contributing countries.In closing  allow me once again to thank thePresident. I wish this session of the General Assemblyevery success as I pray to Allah  our Lord  to enable us one and all  to live up to the responsibilities entrustedto us."
"86",3632,"JPN",58,2003,"﻿I would like to extendmy heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Julian RobertHunte  Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia  on hisassumption of the office of President for the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I would alsolike to commend Mr. Jan Kavan  former Deputy PrimeMinister and former Minister for Foreign Affairs of theCzech Republic  for his devoted efforts during histenure as President of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly.First of all  I would like to touch upon the terribletragedy that occurred last month. SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General Mr. SergioVieira de Mello and other United Nations staff working diligently to facilitate the reconstruction andstabilization of Iraq  sacrificed their lives as a result ofthe cowardly bomb attack in Baghdad. On behalf of theGovernment of Japan  I take this opportunity to paytribute to Mr. Vieira de Mello and his colleagues.Much of our time and energy since the generaldebate last year have gone into the discussion of theIraq situation. In that process  questions have beenasked about the role of the Security Council and theUnited Nations with respect to the Organization’sprimary role of maintaining international peace andsecurity. On the occasion of this general debate  weonce again need to earnestly explore the meaning ofthis matter.There is no organization on earth more universalthan the United Nations. No other organizationaddresses so many diverse issues as comprehensivelyas it does. I strongly believe that the United Nationswill continue to play an important role that no otherinternational organization can fulfil. The UnitedNations role should be enhanced through reform inorder to restore the confidence that was shaken in theIraq situation. All Member States are called upon inour joint effort to strengthen the Organization.38Today  we face a situation in which theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and thethreat of terrorism affect not only particular countriesor regions but the world as a whole  presenting a newthreat to our lives and our livelihood. It is imperativefor each country to regard the issue as its own and totake action in concert with the countries facing suchimminent threats.In order to establish an Iraqi Government run bythe Iraqis themselves as soon as possible  theinternational community must join hands for securingpeace and promoting reconstruction  and the UnitedNations must play an even more prominent role inthose efforts. Japan strongly expects that a newSecurity Council resolution will be adopted  that thepath towards Iraqi self-governance will be clarified andthat the international partnership will be strengthenedto promote reconstruction and security. Together withthe international community  Japan continues to makeevery effort towards the restoration of security and thereconstruction of Iraq and in particular towards thesuccessful conclusion of the Madrid donors conferencefor the reconstruction of Iraq to be held next month.With respect to peace in the Middle East  I amdeeply concerned that the road map has reached acritical stage. I call upon both sides to exercise theutmost restraint in order to restore calm on the ground.The Palestinian Authority must resolutely disavow theuse of terror  work expeditiously to establish a newcabinet and take action to control the extremistfactions. Israel  in turn  must act with prudence andcaution  mindful of the consequences of its ownactions. In particular  the expulsion of Chairman YasserArafat can only result in a deterioration of thesituation. Japan once again urges Israel not to proceedwith the implementation of measures which wouldresult in Chairman Arafat’s removal.From the perspectives of peace and security inNorth-East Asia and international non-proliferation  thedevelopment and possession of nuclear weapons byNorth Korea must never be tolerated. Japan once againurges North Korea to immediately and completelydismantle all of its nuclear development programmes ina verifiable and irreversible manner. This issue shouldbe resolved peacefully by diplomatic efforts includingthe six-party talks process. Based on the PyongyangDeclaration between Japan and North Korea  Japanseeks the resolution of various outstanding issuesbetween Japan and North Korea  including the nuclearissue  the missile issue and the abduction issue  whichwas addressed explicitly by the Assembly lastDecember in its resolution on the question of enforcedor involuntary disappearances (57/215). Upon thecomprehensive resolution of those issues  Japan islooking to effect the normalization of its diplomaticrelations with North Korea.With regard to Iran  Japan calls upon Iran to takeseriously the resolution adopted at the 12 Septembermeeting of the Board of Governors of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran must appease theconcerns of the international community regarding thenuclear issue. It must comply immediately with allmeasures prescribed in the resolution  which includecooperating fully with IAEA to rectify problem pointsby the end of October of this year. Iran must also ratifythe IAEA Additional Protocol immediately andunconditionally and implement it in its entirety.The very urgency of those issues reminds us ofthe importance of the crossroads at which we nowstand with respect to the Nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty regime. The horror and devastation caused bynuclear weapons should not be repeated. Japan isredoubling its efforts to maintain and fortify thenuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime with this treaty as its core. At the fifty-eighth sessionof the General Assembly  Japan will submit a draftresolution entitled “Path to the total elimination ofnuclear weapons” and aim to secure adoption of theresolution by an overwhelming majority of MemberStates. Furthermore  Japan considers the early entry-into-force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-BanTreaty to be of extreme importance as a concrete meansof strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treatyregime.Despite the serious efforts of the internationalcommunity to combat terrorism in the wake of theterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001  precious livescontinue to be lost by terrorist attacks in Jakarta Baghdad and many other locations around the globe.Insofar as improvements in the terrorism-relatedresponse capabilities of all nations are required for theeradication of international terrorist organizations Japan continues to provide capacity-building assistanceto developing countries  with special emphasis onAsian countries. In addition  Japan calls upon allMember States to work to bring about the earlyconclusion of the counter-terrorism conventions as wellas the implementation of Security Council resolution391373 (2001) in order to deprive terrorists of the meansfor their activities and safe havens.In the twenty-first century  we cannot address thedangers and threats now confronting the world withmilitary and political measures alone.Our responses must be well thought out  detailedand sustained  addressing every facet of the issues weface  including the social aspect  humanitarian andhuman rights concerns  and the question of economicreconstruction. Furthermore  we must strive toguarantee human rights  democracy and goodgovernance by creating a social environment thatenables each and every human being to realize his orher maximum potential.On the basis of this realization  Japan has madethe consolidation of peace and nation-building one ofthe pillars of its diplomacy and its internationalcooperation efforts  and it is contributing actively in avariety of areas  including peacekeeping operations.Moreover  in the conceptual framework of humansecurity  Japan has made efforts to enhance bothprotection and capacity at the individual  human level.Japan will continue to work for the realization of therecommendations made in the report submitted by theCommission on Human Security in cooperation withthe United Nations  Member States and non-governmental organizations  through diplomaticmeasures such as official development assistance.Specific examples of Japan’s efforts includeassistance in nation-building  such as the deploymentof Japan’s Self-Defence Forces in Timor-Leste; thedisarmament  demobilization and reintegrationprogramme it is now implementing jointly with theUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan; andsupport for the peace process and for reconstructionand development in the form of efforts such as theTokyo Conference on Reconstruction and Developmentof Sri Lanka.Measures against infectious diseases are alsocrucial in ensuring human security. The example ofSARS demonstrated to the world yet again theimportance of international cooperation in themitigation of such diseases. Japan welcomes the resultsof yesterday’s General Assembly High-level Meetingon HIV/AIDS  which reconfirmed both thecommitment of every nation to the goals set forth in thePolitical Declaration and the importance of the GlobalFund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria.With regard to Africa  Japan has been cooperatingfor its development on the basis of the principles ofownership and partnership  aiming at povertyeradication through economic growth  as well asproviding assistance in conflict prevention in order tosecure the peace and political stability which areprerequisites to development. The Tokyo InternationalConference on African Development (TICAD) processis now in its 10th year. TICAD III will convene on 29September. In response to the ownership of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) TICAD III intends to expand partnerships withinternational organizations and the countriesconcerned  and particularly with civil society andAsian countries which have successfully realizeddevelopment  in order to share the wisdom andexperiences of the international community in the areaof African development.As the representative of an Asian country  Iwould like to take this opportunity to highlight twoissues that relate to peace and security in the Asianregion.The first is the detention of Daw Aung San SuuKyi by the Government of Myanmar. Japan iscontinuing to make serious diplomatic efforts to bringabout the expeditious resolution of this worrisomesituation and to facilitate concrete progress towardsnational reconciliation and democratization.The second issue concerns the Khmer Rougetrials in Cambodia. Japan believes that it is necessaryfor each country to extend considerable cooperation inorder to ensure that these trials take place and that theyexhibit an unswerving application of the principles oflaw and justice of the international community.In the community of nations  diversity is bothrespected and cherished. For that reason  theformulation of a set of common rules under which theentire global community can act as one is of extremeimportance. The United Nations has made significantprogress in this area to date. I would like to explainsome of the agenda items which Japan will be pursuingat the United Nations  here in the General Assemblyand elsewhere  in order to formulate such rules. Suchrules will constitute the basis for well-thought-out detailed and sustained responses to a broad spectrum ofissues  including socio-economic  environmental andhuman rights issues.40In the field of the environment  it is imperativethat the international momentum for climate changenegotiations be maintained. I appeal to therepresentatives of all nations who are gathered here torecognize the importance of the early entry into forceof the Kyoto Protocol and of the formulation ofcommon rules which will facilitate participation by allcountries  including the United States of America anddeveloping countries.The protection and promotion of the rights ofdisabled persons is also of great importance. Japanwelcomes the decision taken in June of this year toestablish a working committee which will draft aninternational convention on the promotion andprotection of the rights of persons with disabilities;Japan will actively participate in this process.With regard to the United Nations Decade ofEducation for Sustainable Development  Japan looksforward to the adoption of a resolution promoting thecreation of an implementation plan in which the UnitedNations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO) serves as the lead agency.Disaster prevention is an indispensable elementfor a safer world in the twenty-first century  not merelybecause of its role in the follow-up to the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  but also as anessential prerequisite for achieving much of thesustainable development agenda. Japan proposes tohost the World Conference on Natural DisasterReduction in order to develop new strategies ondisaster prevention.For the United Nations to fulfil the role ofbringing about a world of peace and prosperity basedon common rules embraced by the entire internationalcommunity  the reform of the United Nations particularly that of the Security Council  as its core must be urgently addressed.Today’s conflicts have become more diversifiedand increasingly complex  as evidenced in cases wherea civil war escalates due to the dysfunctional conditionof a State. To respond to these new challenges  theSecurity Council has taken on new tasks  such as thedeployment of multinational forces  when necessary  torestore order. Such tasks also include the expansion ofthe role of peacekeeping activities from military andpolice activities such as ceasefire monitoring tohumanitarian activities  including assistance for therepatriation of refugees  as well as assistance fordemocratic elections and reconstruction efforts. TheSecurity Council must take on a variety of these tasksin working for the resolution of today’s conflicts.For the Security Council to address thesechallenges comprehensively  there is a need tostrengthen the functioning of the Council by includingcountries that are both willing and able to shoulderresponsibilities at the global level as permanentmembers. Japan continues to work diligently for therealization of Security Council reform and would liketo assume greater responsibility as a permanentmember in a reformed Council.The issues about which I am speaking today arehardly new. Discussions on the reform of the SecurityCouncil have been under way for 10 years now. Yet despite a series of exhaustive discussions about howthe Council should be reformed  we are still unable tosee progress in any concrete terms.It is no exaggeration to say that  if we continuealong this path  the ability of the United Nations torespond adequately to new and complex challengeswill be seriously brought into question. We must takeconcrete action now. The Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  makes a strong case for United Nations reformin his report (A/58/323) entitled  “Implementation ofthe United Nations Millennium Declaration”. Heproposes that we set 2005 as a deadline for reachingagreement on the changes that are needed in ourinternational institutions if we are to meet the newchallenges  because 2005 not only marks the sixtiethanniversary of the founding of the United Nations butis also the year in which a review of progress on theMillennium Declaration will take place. I am of theview that a political decision should be taken on theoccasion of that review at a meeting of heads of Stateor Government regarding the reform of the UnitedNations  in particular the Security Council.With regard to the “enemy State” clauses in theUnited Nations Charter  a General Assembly resolutionwas adopted in 1995  recognizing them to be obsolete.Those clauses have not yet  however  been deletedfrom the Charter. This is an extremely regrettablesituation. Japan will work to find appropriate solutionsto this issue  in view of the progress on United Nationsreform.Administrative and budgetary reform of theUnited Nations is also necessary in order to increaseboth its effectiveness and its efficiency. With regard to41the size of the United Nations budget  it is necessary togive careful consideration to the financial burden onMember States. Japan calls on the United Nations bothto conduct a strict prioritization of its activities and toeliminate those activities which are neither essentialnor urgent. We must also consider appropriate methodsto make the scale of assessments for all Member Statesmore balanced. Finally  equitable geographicaldistribution among Member States for the number ofstaff members of the Secretariat has yet to be attained.The present situation is of concern and needs to beimproved.Japan believes that international peace andprosperity can be achieved only through cooperationamong nations  with the United Nations playing animportant role. Japan has used all means at its disposalto contribute to United Nations activities  so that theobjectives contained in the United Nations Charter mayultimately be realized. Let me make it clear that Japanwill continue to be actively engaged in United Nationsactivities. However  the perpetuation of the same basicSecurity Council structure of 60 years ago leads manyto question the legitimacy of the system under whichthe United Nations operates. The legitimacy of theUnited Nations is at stake.In closing  I would like once again to urge allMember States to take concrete actions to strengthenthe functions of this Organization and restore itslegitimacy in the eyes of the nations and citizens of theworld."
"87",3657,"KAZ",58,2003,"﻿Allow me  Sir  toexpress my confidence that  under your able leadership the general debate of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session will be successful and fruitful.At the turn of the millennium  the internationalcommunity is living through changes of epicproportions. The process of transition to a new worldorder is facing unprecedented global threats: inter-ethnic and inter-confessional conflicts; internationalterrorism and organized crime; natural  man-made andhumanitarian disasters; diseases and epidemics; andenergy and environmental problems.These threats are in addition to globalizationprocesses. All States now share in not only economic technological  information and management issues  butalso must face the numerous problems looming overhumankind like a dark cloud.We in Kazakhstan believe that the time has comefor the entire international community to join togetherto ensure broad and effective cooperation to addressglobal threats. Today  it is becoming increasingly evidentthat States' involvement in globalization processes is animportant factor in their economic prosperity.It is our conviction that there is no alternative toKazakhstan's political and economic openness. In thepast four years  our country has had one of the fastesteconomic growth rates in the world. Kazakhstan isleading the Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS) in main economic indicators. As a country with amarket economy  Kazakhstan is an integral part of theglobal economy and an active participant in theglobalization process. Its early admission to the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) is a top priority forKazakhstan.Our country's efforts to create a comprehensivesecurity system in Asia are well known. The process ofthe Conference on Interaction and Confidence-BuildingMeasures in Asia  initiated by President NursultanNazarbaev  serves this purpose and also provides foractive cooperation between regional States in such animportant area as the combating of internationalterrorism. Further support for this process by theUnited Nations and all of our partners will undoubtedlygo a long way towards creating a climate of trust andgood-neighbourly relations on the Asian continent.We are firmly committed to strengtheningregional integration. Kazakhstan is actively involved inwork within the Eurasian Economic Community. Wehave great expectations regarding the creation of asingle economic space in the territories of four CIScountries. A significant contribution to counter-terrorism efforts and trade and economic cooperation inthe Eurasian region could be made by the ShanghaiCooperation Organization. We are taking steps todevelop cooperation with the Central Asian States. Weintend to further promote the activities of the EconomicCooperation Organization.Kazakhstan backs United Nations action tostrengthen the efforts of the international community insupport of the dialogue between civilizations andreligions. Kazakhstan  a unique State in terms ofreligious tolerance and inter-ethnic harmony  conveneda congress of representatives of world religions andconfessions  which  in the unanimous opinion of itsparticipants  revealed a considerable peacemakingcapacity of our country.An unprecedented attack against the UnitedNations office in Baghdad in August was the cruellestand largest-scale terrorist act in the entire history ofour Organization. Together with the rest of theinternational community  Kazakhstan pays a specialtribute to the late Sergio Vieira de Mello  the UnitedNations High Commissioner for Human Rights andSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General forIraq  and his colleagues.In our view  it is imperative to ensure that effortsto restore peace and stability in Iraq are carried outwithin the legal framework of the United Nations. Thepost-war reconstruction of the country and assistanceto the Iraqi population should be provided only underthe umbrella of the United Nations. Kazakhstan hasalready made a practical contribution to this process bydeploying in Iraq a group of its military officers.The Iraqi crisis has become a serious test for theUnited Nations and has highlighted the urgent need tocarry out the institutional reform of the Organization.26 Kazakhstan reaffirms its commitment to theconcept of a multipolar world as a political philosophyof modern international relations. At the same time  wedo not reject unipolarity if its means joining togetherthe efforts of all States in the world in a bid to avertglobal threats.Given its authority  universal character andunique experience  the United Nations continues toplay an indispensable coordinating role in all globalaffairs. Its effectiveness  however  is dependent on ourwill  and we should  through joint efforts  reform theOrganization with a view to democratizing internationalrelations. In this context  it is essential to strengthen therole of the Security Council in the settlement of crisissituations and to provide it with appropriate mandatesand means for conflict-prevention. We call for makingit a more representative body by co-opting five newmembers  including Germany and Japan  as well as  onthe basis of rotation  African  Asian and Latin AmericanStates. In order to facilitate consensus  which is greatlyneeded  new Security Council members might exercisethe veto power  with certain exceptions  subject tofurther discussion in the high-level panel which theSecretary-General intends to establish. We believe thatit will also be necessary to increase the number of non-permanent members  with due account being taken ofthe interests of the Asian region.In our view  coordination between the UnitedNations and regional organizations should bereinvigorated. In this context  Kazakhstan proposes toestablish a permanent council of regional organizationsunder the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General.It is time to combine  in practical terms  theefforts of the United Nations  the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  the WTO and other leading economic andfinancial organizations to address poverty and socialdevelopment. Kazakhstan believes that close attentionshould be paid to the proposal to establish an economicand social security council.Kazakhstan supports the Secretary-General'sproposal   to which I referred earlier   to establish ahigh-level panel to examine current challenges to peaceand security and to strengthen the United Nations system.We believe that issues of environmentalprotection in the framework of sustainabledevelopment should be considered as a key item on theUnited Nations agenda. In this context  PresidentNazarbaev's proposal  made last year in Johannesburg to create a United Nations register of globalenvironmental problems is especially relevant. Such aregister would provide an opportunity to ensure acontinuous exchange of information among UnitedNations Member States about trends in the globalenvironmental situation  which is extremely importantfor the prevention of natural disasters. With regard toenvironmental issues  I would like  from this rostrum once again to urge the international community to paydue attention to the search for practical solutions to theproblems of the Aral Sea and the Semipalatinsk region.The current surge of terrorist acts throughout theworld has made clear the transnational nature ofterrorism. We must recognize that terrorism is wellorganized  financially self-sufficient and bolstered bypowerful ideological dictums that are poisoning theconsciousness of an ever-greater number of people.Against that background  the strengthening of theinternational legal framework of counter-terroristcooperation is especially relevant. Kazakhstan supportsthe adoption  without further delay  of a comprehensiveconvention against international terrorism.Kazakhstan  which has drug routes runningthrough its territory  calls for joint efforts by States toeliminate the evil of drug trafficking  which seriouslyerodes international security. Increasing drug productionin Afghanistan demands special attention. In order toeffectively counter the existing drug threat  it isnecessary to apply an integrated approach on the basisof an agreed international strategy with the UnitedNations Office on Drugs and Crime playing acoordinating role.Kazakhstan has put forward an initiativeregarding the establishment in Almaty of a CentralAsian preventive diplomacy and conflict managementcentre and calls for its support. Such an institutionwould strengthen the United Nations activities in theregion  which should be in the interests of all countriesconcerned.As a State that has voluntarily renounced itsnuclear heritage  Kazakhstan is concerned about thecontinued proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.The desire of a number of countries and some extremistorganizations to possess nuclear weapons and othertypes of weapons of mass destruction poses a seriousthreat to global security. The well-known British writerAldous Huxley was prophetic when he said:27 Technological progress has merely provided uswith more efficient means of going backwards.'Let us face the facts: today  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty do not work in practice. The mainreason for this state of affairs is weakened internationalcontrol.There are already 39 States in the world capableof producing a nuclear bomb or a nuclear device and atleast 8 countries with significant nuclear capacity. Inaddition  there are at least another 4 countries whosenon-nuclear status is highly questionable.The United Nations and its institutions shouldhave the last word in solving the problem of nuclearnon-proliferation. There is actually one way out:tighten control and improve transparency with regardto weapons development and testing.Existing international agreements in this areashould be adapted to new realities. We can no longeraccept the fact that the international community lackseffective means to discipline States violating non-proliferation regimes. Here we witness the absence of asingle standard: some countries are punished bymilitary force  while others are simply urged to give uptheir nuclear programmes.Kazakhstan has welcomed the initiative of theGroup of Eight regarding a global partnership againstthe proliferation of nuclear materials and weapons ofmass destruction  and it hopes for fruitful cooperationon the issue with that group of States.Our country considers it important to implementthe Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat andEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and LightWeapons in All Its Aspects.The International Ministerial Conference onTransit Transport Cooperation  held in August inAlmaty  has become a turning point in the efforts toachieve the Millennium Development Goals. TheAlmaty Declaration and the Programme of Actionadopted as an outcome of the Conference have laid asolid foundation for global partnership designed to putin place effective transit transport systems. Occupyinga vast stretch of land in Eurasia  Kazakhstan is keenlyinterested in the practical implementation of the goalsin these documents so that it can better tap its owntransport potential.In conclusion  I would like to reiterateKazakhstan's commitment to the United Nationsreform process in order to ensure a safer and more justworld order. I fully share the Secretary-General's senseof urgency when it comes to structural changes withinthe United Nations. Indeed  history would beunforgiving to us if we were to squander anopportunity to reform our Organization."
"88",3704,"KEN",58,2003,"﻿I am pleased to take thisopportunity to address the General Assembly. In thepast year both Kenya and the United Nations have beenstruck by terrorism. On behalf of my delegation  I wishto convey to the Secretary-General  through you Mr. President  our profound condolences following theheartless and senseless attack on United Nationspremises in Baghdad last August. Several UnitedNations personnel  including Mr. Sergio Vieira deMello  the Secretary-General’s Special Representativein Iraq  lost their lives during this attack. Mr. Vieira deMello — an elegant  highly intelligent man — was acalm voice of reason in a sea of troubles. As anassembly of nations  we may have lost his voice  butwe should not lose sight of his vision and hopes.Terrorism has become a disturbing trend. We wholive in Kenya know this all too well  as we do not havethe option of ignoring the threat of terror. The peopleof Kenya have been targeted by terrorists on tworecent  separate occasions — in 1998 and in 2002.After the 2002 attacks in Mombasa  Kenya’s economywas almost brought to its knees because of the variousunhelpful measures from without that discouragedtravel to our country. As a result  we have been doublyvictimized. Against this backdrop  Kenya is totallycommitted to the fight against terrorism  as we havebeen subjected to the loss of innocent lives  untoldhuman suffering  loss of property and social andeconomic hardship. We empathize with others including the residents of this city and  indeed  theAmerican people  who bore the brunt of unprecedentedterror in the September 2001 attack.We are convinced that this fight can be won onlyby collective action by the community of nations. Weshould all address terrorism under the rubric of theUnited Nations and develop measured  long-termstrategies to eliminate terrorism once and for all. Self-interest and unilateral action do not provide a firmbasis for a global alliance against terrorism. Onlyprincipled international solidarity will defeat terrorism.My delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-General for the efforts made in enhancing theutilization of the United Nations Office at Nairobi. Inote with satisfaction that construction of additionaladministration and social facilities at the United10Nations Complex at Gigiri has commenced. Further following the elevation of the United Nations Centrefor Human Settlements (UN-Habitat) to a fully fledgedUnited Nations programme  in accordance withGeneral Assembly resolution 56/206  it is the desire ofthe Government of Kenya to see maximum utilizationof those facilities through the hosting of additionalmeetings and conferences in Nairobi. This will be aclear demonstration of our support for the relevantGeneral Assembly resolutions on this issue.The proliferation of small arms and light weaponshas contributed to the conflicts raging in many parts ofAfrica. Kenya has been actively involved in efforts toaddress this issue and hosts the Nairobi Secretariat onSmall Arms and Light Weapons  a regional initiativeinvolving 10 countries of the Great Lakes region andthe Horn of Africa. In addition  at the Biennial Meetingof States on small arms and light weapons  held in NewYork in July 2003  Kenya presented a report on theactivities of the Nairobi Secretariat as well as on themeasures undertaken by the Government of Kenya atthe national level to curb that menace. In this regard we call upon the international community to providethe requisite resources in our joint effort to fight theproliferation of such arms.Wars and conflicts continue  and peace  stabilityand socio-economic development remain elusive particularly in Africa. Kenya therefore continues togive priority to the prevention  management andpeaceful resolution of conflicts. We have spearheadedthe Inter-Government Authority on Development(IGAD) peace processes on the conflicts in southernSudan and in Somalia. Negotiations on a peacefulsolution are ongoing in both Naivasha and Nairobi respectively.It is with profound satisfaction that we recall thehistoric event that occurred on 22 September of thisyear  when the warring parties in the Sudan signed atruly landmark agreement in Naivasha  Kenya. Thatagreement  which addresses transitional securityarrangements  will no doubt provide the basis for abright and prosperous future for the people of theSudan. The parties will reconvene in the next twoweeks to discuss power sharing  wealth sharing and thestatus of the three disputed regions of the Sudan.Indeed  the peace process in the Sudan has becomeirreversible.I therefore wish to pay tribute to the Governmentof the Sudan  the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement(SPLM)  the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army(SPLA)  IGAD and the international Partners Forumfor their concerted efforts and dedication to the peaceprocess. This historic event is a concrete example ofmultilateralism at work. It is indeed a beacon of hopeand a manifestation of the fact that  with goodwill andpolitical will  peace is achievable. I am happy to saythat not all news emanating from Africa is all aboutdoom and gloom.However  in order to consolidate and guarantee along-lasting peace  it is vital for the internationalcommunity to play a greater role in the process. In thisconnection  I would like to urge the United Nations toplay a leadership role in the post-conflictreconstruction of the Sudan and to request MemberStates to support that reconstruction.On the Somali peace process  I am happy to notethat there is encouraging progress in the negotiations and we are hopeful that there will be a fruitfuloutcome. Just two weeks ago  representatives adoptedthe charter  and elections will soon be held. Kenyatherefore encourages the parties concerned toconsolidate and take advantage of the gains made sofar. We emphasize that the peace process should be all-inclusive  and we call upon the President of theTransitional National Government  Mr. Abdikassim  toreturn to the negotiating table in Nairobi and on theother faction leaders to accept his participation. By thesame token  we call upon our partners and theinternational community to continue supporting bothpeace processes.We commend the efforts made by the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) torestore normalcy in Liberia. While appreciating theimportant role the United Nations plays inconsolidating peace and stability in the world  Kenyaadvocates greater United Nations participation inAfrican initiatives  such as the peace processes led byIGAD and ECOWAS.We are concerned at the continuing deteriorationof the situation in the Middle East. Kenya notes withregret that a lasting solution to the question ofPalestine remains elusive despite the various initiativesundertaken and efforts made to address the problem.We should not lose sight of the objective ofestablishing a viable Palestinian State  as envisaged inUnited Nations resolutions. Similarly  it should berecalled that  in order to ensure a durable solution tothe conflict  it is important to take full account of theright of Israel to exist within safe and secure borders.We therefore reiterate our call to the parties to theconflict  as well as to the other players involved  toexercise restraint and to give priority to dialogue.Another area of concern in the Middle East isIraq. The people of that country have yet to find peaceand stability  without which any hope of nationalreconstruction will be in vain. It is  however encouraging to observe that the internationalcommunity now shares the common view that theUnited Nations should play a greater role in rebuildingthat country. It is our hope that that consensus will betranslated into action soon.For peace and stability to flourish  goodgovernance is a necessity. This challenge is one thatKenya has been able to meet. In December 2002 Kenya saw a historic moment  when we held generalelections which were universally recognized as free fair and  indeed  democratic. Every citizen of Kenyawas provided an opportunity to have a voice indetermining his or her Government  successful andstrong evidence that Africans can and will embracedemocracy and that we  the proud descendants of theoldest civilizations in history  are ready to determineour destiny. I would like to recall the words of a greatson of Africa  the late Patrice Lumumba:“History will one day have its say ... Africa willwrite its own history  and it will be to the northand to the south of the Sahara  a history of gloryand dignity”.We are prepared as a country  under theleadership of President Mwai Kibaki  to play our partin promoting development and democracy.The New Partnership for Africa’s Development(NEPAD) commands the support of all of us and  ifimplemented in a holistic manner  it will guaranteesustainable development for the African continent.NEPAD is a symbol of renewed commitment by theregion’s States  and should thus be accorded thenecessary support by the international community. Weappreciate the warm reception accorded to NEPAD byboth the United Nations and our development partners.We are committed to the successful implementation ofthis arrangement. For its part  Kenya  which is amember of the Steering Committee  has established aNational NEPAD Secretariat and will host a regionalsummit on NEPAD for East Africa  the Great Lakesand the Horn of Africa next month to take stock of itsimplementation.The United Nations conferences and summits ofthe 1990s  particularly the Rio Summit  the MillenniumSummit  the special session of the General Assemblyon HIV/AIDS  the Monterrey Conference and  finally the Johannesburg Summit  have equipped us withnumerous ideas and commitments to tackle theproblems facing the world today. Despite this wealth ofideas and commitments  we have continued to slipbackwards in the fight against poverty  disease illiteracy  environmental degradation and hunger.My message to all of us today is that we mustrecommit ourselves; let us implement what we haveagreed on to make the world a better place for all. Wewelcome the adoption by the Assembly of resolution57/270 B on the integrated and coordinated follow-upto the implementation of United Nations conferencesand summits in the economic and social fields. We urgeall stakeholders identified in this resolution to playtheir part to ensure its full and speedy implementation.The majority of African countries are among thepoorest in the world. The situation has beencompounded by the HIV/AIDS pandemic  which hasravaged the continent and reversed the socio-economicgains made since independence. To counter the ravagesof the pandemic  the Kenya Government has put inplace various measures to curb further spread of HIV/AIDS. As a result of these efforts  prevalence rateshave been significantly reduced in the last four years.However  much still needs to be done in this area.Last month  Kenya hosted the thirteenthInternational Conference on AIDS and Sexually-Transmitted Diseases. This forum brought togetherover 6 000 delegates from all over the world to discussurgent measures that we all must take to combat thepandemic. We call upon the international community tointensify its efforts in fighting the scourge by  amongothers things  the provision of adequate financialresources  as well as enhanced access to antiretroviraldrugs  for those infected.We welcome the recent agreement arrived at inthe World Trade Organization (WTO) enablingdeveloping countries to import HIV/AIDS genericdrugs. We urge developed countries and drugmanufacturers to respect the decision of the WTO and12to cooperate with developing countries to facilitateaccessibility of antiretroviral drugs to all HIV/AIDSsufferers.Kenya regrets the collapse of the WTOMinisterial Conference in Cancún last month.However  we in the developing world are ready tocontinue with negotiations as long as our partners areprepared to work with us as equal players.In conclusion  I wish to extend to AssemblyPresident Mr. Julian Hunte  on behalf of my delegation congratulations on his unanimous election as Presidentof the fifty-eighth regular session of the GeneralAssembly.The challenges that I have addressed today haveno respect for boundaries or sovereignty or  indeed historical realities. They represent a collective problemfor this Assembly and one that we must face togetheras an international organization. It is my hope that thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly willaddress with courage the issues before the internationalcommunity. I wish to assure the Assembly President ofthe full support of the Kenyan delegation."
"89",3728,"KGZ",58,2003,"﻿First ofall  I would like to congratulate you  Sir  on yourelection to the presidency of the General Assembly andto wish great success to the work of the fifty-eighthsession under your wise guidance. I also take thisopportunity to extend deep appreciation to Mr. JanKavan for his insightful leadership of the fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly.This is my second successive participation in thework of the General Assembly. In my statement lastyear  I supported the resolute actions of the anti-terrorist coalition in eliminating the Central Asiancentre of international terrorism in Afghanistan  as wellas the other measures taken by the world community toaddress global challenges to international peace andsecurity.As life has demonstrated  the United Nationsplays a highly positive role in organizing the commonstruggle against international terrorism. In this regard the idea of giving the United Nations the lead role inguiding the global anti-terrorist coalition deservesgenuine support. One of the primary objectives of mystatement last year was to appeal to the United Nationsto recognize  as a great event in the history of mycountry  the two thousand  two hundredth anniversaryof Kyrgyz Statehood  as an event of internationalstatus.The resolution of the General Assembly onKyrgyz Statehood was a powerful force in raising thenational spirit of our people. For that  we are sincerelygrateful to our Organization. Indeed  whenever anyproblems emerge at a global level  we turn to theUnited Nations and unfailingly get support.Recently  there have been heated discussionsconcerning the role of the United Nations. Somehotheads even allege that the United Nations hasexhausted its potential. I believe that such ideascontradict the interests of the world community although on the whole  I see nothing wrong withdebates on this theme. Such discussions aredemonstrations of democracy  to the development ofwhich the United Nations has significantly contributedworldwide.The development of democracy at a national levelinvolves differences of opinion and criticism of theauthorities. Something similar takes place in theframework of the world community. Here  too  a2polarization of opinions is occurring  but in this case itis our common offspring — the United Nations — thatis coming under attack. Attempts to jeopardize its roleare perceived  especially by small countries  asundermining that international body which embodiesthe interests of all mankind. There is a wise saying:“Small countries must have big friends”. The UnitedNations is just such a big reliable friend.However  it is difficult to deny that the work ofthe United Nations is not yet ideal. Certainly itsefficiency needs to be enhanced. We understand theSecretary-General’s concern for the situation of theUnited Nations  and we fully share his assessment ofthe current world situation.In this regard  the attention paid to the work ofthis current session of the General Assembly by manyheads of State is impressive. The statements made byMr. George Bush  the President of the United States;Mr. Vladimir Putin  the President of the RussianFederation; Mr. Jacques Chirac  the President ofFrance; Mr. Gerhard Schroeder  Chancellor ofGermany  as well as other heads of State  despitecertain differences in approach  clearly have shown thedesire to have a definite role for the United Nations inbuilding the new world order  one that is better inkeeping with the aspirations of all people on Earth.The most efficient way of overcomingdisagreements in political practice is to search forcompromise. We are pleased to note that the techniqueof compromise is playing a positive role in resolvingdisagreements on such a key issue for the world as thesettlement of the problem of Iraq. This is anencouraging sign.We would like to stress  again  that any measuresto improve the United Nations should be based solelyon the idea of improving the work of the Organization.The Kyrgyz Republic is ready to support reasonableproposals on this subject  including measures toincrease the efficiency of the work of the SecurityCouncil.I believe that alongside the search for ways toimprove the United Nations  we should concentrate onthose specific problems which will need to be resolvedagain in the foreseeable future. In this regard  we maylook at the results of the Millennium Summit  to thosevital problems that were highlighted at that time in thediscerning report of the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan entitled  “We thePeoples” (A/54/2000)  and also contained in theMillennium Declaration. These last three years havehighlighted even more the importance of the issuesraised at that time.Since then  the fight against internationalterrorism was added as one of the major challenges tointernational peace and security. The report ofSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan to the presentsession of the General Assembly focuses the attentionof Member States on the need to increase their effortstowards implementing the Millennium Declaration.This approach deserves very broad support.I believe that only such a universal  globalorganization as the United Nations is able to cope withthe challenges faced by the world community. But theUnited Nations needs help  and we  through our jointefforts  particularly with the support of the big Powers can accomplish this. If we do not  then we would beacting at cross-purposes and could expect a grim result.Besides common problems shared by the worldcommunity  each country has its own specificproblems. Kyrgyzstan is determined to resolve its ownproblems through reliance on its own efforts.Addressing this Assembly  I cannot fail to stress theconcentration of our efforts on advancing thedemocratic process. In particular  last year I putforward a national idea entitled  “Kyrgyzstan — acountry of human rights”. For the development of thisidea  a Democratic Code was elaborated and a PublicCouncil of Democratic Security was established.Following the outcome of a national referendum  a newConstitution was adopted which more fully reflects thelevel of democracy attained as well as new challengesto its development. These measures have given apowerful stimulus to the progressive movement of ourcountry towards a democratic system.We also attach great importance to theestablishment of fair  open and responsible governanceand to enhancing the effectiveness of the anti-corruption policy being pursued. This year Iestablished the National Council on ConscientiousGovernance to strengthen the work being conducted inKyrgyzstan to create an anti-corruption atmosphere inour society.We are focusing our main efforts on the fightagainst poverty  but the Republic cannot resolve thisproblem without external assistance. We highlycommend the role played by the United Nations in the3fight against poverty  and the measures undertaken byour Organization. Again  we appeal to the worldcommunity and to the developed countries not toreduce their efforts in providing assistance to thedeveloping countries for the purpose of overcomingpoverty.In the autumn of 2002  under the aegis of theUnited Nations  the Global Mountain Summit was heldin our capital  Bishkek. The Bishkek Global MountainPlatform adopted at the Summit has  in essence become the outcome document of the InternationalYear of Mountains  observed by the United Nations.The document has defined key tasks for sustainabledevelopment of the mountain regions of our planet. Toaddress them  Switzerland has initiated creation of theInternational Partnership for Sustainable Developmentin Mountain Regions. This is only the beginning; wehave just set in place the first building blocks for thefoundation of an institutionalized home for themountain regions.Kyrgyzstan hopes to receive assistance from theUnited Nations and its family of organizations towardsthe establishment of an international information andeducational centre for mountain States  as well as for anetwork for developing mountain States  with itssecretariat established in Bishkek. I believe that theKyrgyz Republic is the best possible location for thiscentre since most of our country is mountainous.The United Nations faces an abundance ofproblems. One of the most important challenges is thefight against international terrorism. Other globalchallenges include political and religious extremism territorial separatism  drug trafficking and the fightagainst fatal illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and others.It is becoming increasingly urgent to prevent thespread of weapons of mass destruction. The KyrgyzRepublic supports taking decisive measures in thisrespect. We believe  however  that force should be usedonly on the basis of Security Council decisions and inaccordance with international law so as to preventconflict and discord within the internationalcommunity.Not only must global measures be taken in thisrespect  but efforts must be made at the regional andnational levels. One good example of such efforts is thework done by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization with the lead role being played by Russia and China actively relying on the Central Asian participants.In conclusion  I should like once again to stressnot only my full confidence in the United Nations  butalso the determination of the Kyrgyz Republicresolutely to strive  together with our partners in theinternational community  for the preservation andstrengthening of this Organization  which we believemost fully reflects our interests. May the Almightyhelp us in this work  and let all good peoples of theworld join in our prayers for the success and prosperityof the United Nations."
"90",3771,"KHM",58,2003,"﻿First of all  Iwish to extend my warmest congratulations to you Mr. President  on your election as President of thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I amconfident that  under your wise leadership  the work ofthis great Assembly will further strengtheninternational cooperation and will thus contribute to themaintenance of peace  stability and security in thisglobalized world. The international environment todayremains  no doubt  uncertain  as the world continues toconfront constant change and turbulence.On the global stage  at least three key challengescontinue to occupy the attention and remain a priorityof the international community.The first challenge is the global situation. First the current situation in Iraq is a serious predicament.While the war is over  the situation in the countryremains critical. Peace  security and stability have notreturned to Iraq. Although the number of internationalcontingents deployed in Iraq has been increased  theoverall environment in the country is very fragile andhighly unstable. I think that United Nations shouldassume a greater and more responsible role in returningnormalcy to the country during the transitional period.The road to normalcy means that Iraq should beallowed to govern itself as early as possible  which canbe done in several ways  including the holding of freeand fair elections.Cambodia strongly condemns the criminal attackagainst the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on19 August  and it wishes to pay a tribute to all thevictims  especially to Sergio Vieira de Mello  SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General. Let us pay ourrespect to the memory of that great servant of peace.We in Cambodia always remembers his noble actionsin Cambodia in the early 1990s in the framework of theUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.Secondly  regarding the Middle East quagmire  itis important that all parties to the conflict  particularly14Palestine and Israel  as well as the internationalcommunity  continue to pursue a peaceful solution tothe Middle East conflict on the basis of the agreed roadmap of the Quartet. At the same time  I believe that itis vital for the leaders of both sides of this conflict torenounce the cycle of violence and overcome feelingsof animosity and myopic interest. Instead  they shouldconsider the broader collective interests of peacefulcoexistence  a peaceful life for their peoples andstability in the region. There is a need for all sides tohave a sense of political realism and shareddetermination to make peace possible.I believe that today peace in the Middle East willcome only when both Palestine and Israel reasonablyrecognize in every way that they must coexist side byside  living in peace and harmony with each other andlooking after the interests of one another. Peace tolerance and harmony are the only way forward forthe people of Palestine and Israel. In that regard  theinternational community must remain fully committedto continuing to support the Middle East process to itsend.Thirdly  terrorism is still a very serious threat tohumanity as a whole. Since the attacks of 11 Septemberand the international reaction to fight terrorism terrorists have been strengthening their worldwidenetworks. They also continue to kill innocent peopleeverywhere in the world. In Asia and in South-EastAsia  Jemaah Islamiah  which is linked to al Qaeda  hasbeen responsible for a number of terrorist attacks in theregion. The Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN) has been actively responding to terrorism bystrengthening cooperation at all levels  issuing variousstatements and taking concrete measures. Nevertheless Jemaah Islamiah remains a significant threat to theregion today  despite the progress in anti-terrorismaction thus far.Fourthly  regarding global poverty  we recall theMillennium Summit held in New York and the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg the International Conference on Financing forDevelopment in Monterrey and the recent G-8 Summitin Evian  France  where the overriding theme was thefight against poverty  which calls for concerted effortsfor poverty alleviation and sustainable development.However  poverty remains a severe problem for theworld  particularly the developing countries  with 1.2billion people still surviving on less than one dollar aday. Despite clear messages from all those summits especially from the developing countries  on the needto reduce poverty  the actions so far have not beendecisive enough.I believe that  without concrete measures and theprovision of adequate resources  it will be impossiblefor the least developed countries to overcome thecurrent challenges of poverty  aggravated by the speedof globalization  which has contributed to the wideninggap between the haves and the have-nots.Fighting poverty is not the responsibility of theleast developed countries alone. It is the sharedresponsibility of the international community  in whichthe developed world has an important role to play.Poverty prevails today in many forms and dimensions.For the developed countries to share resources with thedeveloping countries is not only an act of generosity  itis also a requirement for living together in a world ofpeace  security and harmony. In that regard  I amconvinced that the international community must actcollectively and in a spirit of responsibility andsolidarity to end this alarming situation of poverty bytaking concrete steps to reduce it gradually.The second major challenge involves regionaldevelopments. Regarding the regional situation  therehave been many developments. Some have beenpositive; others negative. I wish to note severalimportant developments since last year. First  theeighth ASEAN Summit and other related summits inPhnom Penh  Cambodia  have successfully advancedASEAN integration by moving the region ahead interms of establishing the ASEAN EconomicCommunity (AEC)  deepening cooperation betweenASEAN and China  Japan and the Republic of Korea and strengthening cooperation with India. With thosefour countries  ASEAN has enhanced close andproactive cooperation among a combined population ofmore than three billion people that has enormouseconomic potential and opportunities for developmentand growth. In addition  during that ASEAN Summit its leaders also held  for the first time  a summitdialogue with Africa through President Thabo Mbekiof South Africa  the current Chairman of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development  NEPAD.Secondly  the situation in the Korean peninsulacontinues to evolve and give rise to concerns forcountries that are directly involved. Cambodia fullysupports the peace talks in Beijing and believes thatonly dialogue and compromise can provide the way out15of the present quandary. Although a number ofoutstanding issues need to be mutually resolved  I thinkit is important for all the parties concerned to reducetension by avoiding hostile actions that would escalatethe situation. I believe that one way of enabling thesituation on the Korean Peninsula to move aheadpositively is to negotiate a road map for a nuclear-freeand secure Korean Peninsula. I believe that  if such aplan could go ahead  steps towards the normalization ofthe situation on the Korean Peninsula could be taken.Thirdly  I would like to refer to recentdevelopments in Cambodia. The situation in Cambodiais continuing to improve significantly. The recentelections were held in a free  fair and democraticenvironment  as many international election observersnoted in their statements. This year’s election marksanother important milestone in Cambodia’sdemocratization  which has been strengthened at thegrass-roots level through the successful local electionsto communal councils last year. At the same time Cambodia’s gross domestic product growth continuesto show positive signs  with an approximate growthrate of 6.7 per cent per annum over the past five years despite natural calamities and the impact of otherregional and global developments  such as terrorismand Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.In addition  the Government’s strategy gives toppriority to poverty reduction. In March this year  theCambodian Prime Minister  Samdech Hun Sen officially launched the campaign for povertyalleviation aimed at reducing the poverty rate by 1.2per cent every year. By 2015  the poverty level wouldbe reduced to 19 per cent. In order to achieve that end a budget of $1.5 billion has been projected.The third challenge is the reform of the UnitedNations. Every year  representatives of everydelegation advocate to the Assembly the necessity ofreforming the Organization  in particular the SecurityCouncil. I  too  believe that without sufficient reform inthis world body  the United Nations cannot be aneffective and efficient global Organization that is ableto respond collectively to the complex globalchallenges affecting humanity in the twenty-firstcentury. The world has witnessed a wave of democracysince the end of the cold war more than a decade ago. Ibelieve  however  that democratization needs to startright here at the United Nations  which should respectthe will of the community of nations. Any furtherinaction on the part of the United Nations with regardto the call for reform will mean a continuing decline inits credibility  as well as increasing loss of confidencein this universal institution.I believe that one of the key issues of UnitedNations reform is the need for the expansion of theSecurity Council. Cambodia calls once again for theexpansion of the membership of the Security Councilto include Japan  the Federal Republic of Germany andIndia as new permanent members  given the crucialrole of these three countries in international politicaland economic affairs today.Moreover  the General Assembly  as the highestbody of the United Nations  should play a moreimportant role  in accordance with the Charter  for themaintenance of international peace and security.Furthermore  in the context of United Nations reform  Ithink that we should look beyond the conventionalagenda of international peace and security  given thatthe glaring poverty in the world today is  withoutdoubt  a peace and security issue. I believe that theUnited Nations should play a more meaningful role within the broad framework of human security  in theworld’s collective efforts to fight poverty.As the world marches on  I believe that we mustperhaps devise new ways to deal with a myriad ofchallenges that menace the whole of humanity. We willhave to close the gap between the poor and the rich andbetween the developed and developing countries. Wemust fight poverty and HIV/AIDS  which are affectingmillions of people in the developing countries. Weneed to tackle together the growing impact oftransnational crime. At the same time  we must paygreater attention to hotbeds of tension around the worldin order to ensure a peaceful and secure world for all.Finally  we must continue to ensure that theUnited Nations is truly a democratic global institutionthat reflects the reality of the world today. We need toadvance together in peace  security  stability development and prosperity in building a better placefor all peoples on the Earth.In conclusion  I believe the way forward for theworld will depend largely on international cooperationand the need to share global resources more equitably.Growing interdependence and increasing globalizationmean that every nation must work collectively inaddressing the current challenges in the most effectiveway.16"
"91",3785,"KIR",58,2003,"﻿Allow me at the outset tooffer Mr. Julian Hunte my warm congratulations on hiselection as President. We are confident that he willguide our deliberations during this fifty-eighth sessionto a productive conclusion. Let me also express mydeep appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan for his effective guidance of the work of the Assemblyat its fifty-seventh session.Four years ago Kiribati joined the United Nationsas one of its youngest Member States. Our membershipof the United Nations was an affirmation of our faith inand support for the noble principles enshrined in theUnited Nations Charter.Since then  events have occurred to test theresolve of this Organization. Indeed  the UnitedNations has faced many challenges. The recent brutaland calculated attack on United Nations personnel inBaghdad  which resulted in a tragic loss of life andmany injuries  are to be condemned. We mourn the lossof the Secretary-General’s senior representative  SergioVieira de Mello  and the others who perished in theattacks.Kiribati commends the Secretary-General for hisunwavering determination to ensure that the UnitedNations continues to perform the role we expect of it inthe international arena.We have followed with increasing alarm theglobalization of terror. No longer can we in the Pacificclaim immunity from terrorism. The consequences ofterrorist acts are abhorrent. Kiribati condemnsterrorism and all acts of terror directed against innocentpeople. We cannot condone acts of terror  regardless oftheir purported objective.Even though we have not been  and may never be directly subjected to horrors such as that of 11September 2001 and the terrorist acts in Riyadh Jakarta and Baghdad  we realize that terrorism knowsno boundaries or limitations. It is a crime againsthumanity and against the international community as awhole  and we must therefore work collectively todefeat it. To do so will require an internationalresponse backed by concerted regional and nationalefforts.At the international level  Kiribati fully supportsthe relevant Security Council resolutions againstterrorism. The Pacific Islands Forum is activelyaddressing security issues at the regional level. Despitefinancial constraints  Kiribati is pleased to havecontributed  within the framework of the 2000Biketawa Declaration  police personnel to the RegionalAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands. MyGovernment decided to contribute to that initiativebecause of our firm belief in the strength of regionalcooperation. The Regional Assistance Mission to theSolomon Islands is a clear demonstration of the abilityof Pacific Island Forum member countries to respondswiftly and cooperatively to requests from fellowmember countries for support in restoring law andorder.While Kiribati appreciates the recognition of thisregional initiative by the United Nations  we hope andurge that further assistance will be forthcoming tostrengthen and ensure the success of this undertaking.At the national level  Kiribati has introducedvarious bills and taken other measures as part of itseffort to address security challenges. This is anongoing process that will progress at a pace dictated byour financial situation  personnel and other constraints.We are confident that  given our commitment  and withappropriate assistance from the internationalcommunity  we will in time achieve our goals.Kiribati supports the idea that terrorism must beeliminated. We must all fight against those who rejectdialogue as a means of securing their objectives andinstead resort to terror. We would like to associateourselves with the many speakers who advocate that18we exercise restraint. We must ensure that in our fightagainst terrorism we continue to uphold the principlesthat are the cornerstones of this esteemed body — theprinciples that we cherish and in which we firmlybelieve.Kiribati fully supports efforts to address thesecurity challenges facing the world today. We are however  mindful that the magnitude of the securitychallenges facing Member States differs.In the case of Kiribati there are many challengesand problems that threaten our people and country.Kiribati is one of the least developed countries and isalso a small island developing State located in themiddle of the Pacific ocean. Our remoteness andinsularity  narrow economic base  small population andhigh population growth rate are factors that we have toaccept.Being a small island developing States posesmany challenges to national efforts in terms ofsustainable development and beneficial integration intothe world economy. These unique characteristicswarrant special consideration for sustained andenhanced cooperation from development partners.Kiribati has benefited  and continues to benefit from the various programmes offered through the manyUnited Nations agencies. In acknowledging withgratitude the support extended by the United Nations inthis regard  I would also like to record our appreciationto our development partners for their continuingsupport for our efforts at increasing and enhancing theequitable distribution of development benefits to ourpeoples.We realize that a lot more needs to be done.Kiribati has a vast exclusive economic zone rich infisheries and marine resources. We are activelypromoting the sustainable exploitation of theseresources  and consider the establishment of an onshorefish processing facility to be an appropriatedevelopment.Kiribati comprises low-lying coral atolls and istherefore very vulnerable to climate change  climatevariability and sea-level rise. This is an issue of highpriority for us  as it is for other low-lying countries. Itis also an issue that requires an international response.Political commitment and a high level of cooperationby the international community are called for inaddressing this challenge.There is a need for immediate reductions in andlimits on greenhouse gas emissions to bring them intoline with the objective of the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change. We callupon the major emitters of greenhouse gases to ratifythe Kyoto Protocol in a timely manner.We recognize the need to develop and implementappropriate adaptation response measures  and call forsupport in this respect from international sources including the Global Environment Facility.International support will similarly be required inthe joint implementation of the vulnerability andadaptation Pacific type 2 initiatives  launched last yearat the World Summit on Sustainable Development.We look forward to the 2004 internationalmeeting to be held in Mauritius. This will provide avaluable opportunity to the international community totake stock of what has happened since Rio andBarbados. We certainly hope that Mauritius willprovide a road map of concrete and practical actions which are required to achieve the objectives of theProgramme of Action. While we accept primaryresponsibility for our own development  we also realizethat the achievement of such aspirations will be beyondour reach if we have to work alone. We require theassistance of our partners in development.These have been turbulent times for the UnitedNations. Recent events have brought to the fore theneed for the United Nations to adapt. The rapidlychanging global environment in which the UnitedNations operates demands adaptations if theOrganization is to continue to be of relevance toMember States.Kiribati joins previous speakers in welcoming thereform initiatives outlined by the Secretary-General.We realize that Member States must direct and activelysupport the adaptation process. The direction andsupport thus accorded to the United Nations will enableit to become more responsive to the aspirations of itsMember States and those of the communities andpeoples they represent.Kiribati fully supports the view that the UnitedNations and its major organs should be morerepresentative and more democratic in order to reflectthe expanded membership of the Organization. Therules so appropriate to situations in the 1940s cannot be19applied practically and effectively in the twenty-firstcentury.To conclude  we are faced with new challenges.We must commit ourselves to tackling these emergingchallenges meaningfully. We must therefore be ready tointroduce and accept changes appropriate to our times."
"92",3816,"KNA",58,2003,"﻿MyGovernment is pleased that the General Assembly’spresidency at its fifty-eighth regular session is in thecapable hands of my distinguished colleague  theForeign Minister of Saint Lucia  Senator Julian Hunte whose election bears witness to the importance that thisOrganization holds  not just for the Government ofSaint Lucia  but also for the Governments and peopleof the Caribbean Community. I trust that as he tacklesthe critical United Nations agenda over the comingyear he will incorporate into his work the lessons ofour successes as a Caribbean Community. As with hispredecessor  whose steady leadership was tested duringa year of unprecedented challenges  he  too  can counton my Government’s continued support.I take this opportunity to pay tribute toSergio Vieira de Mello  Special Representative of theSecretary-General  other staff of the United Nationsand the citizens of Iraq who lost their lives or sustainedinjuries in the tragedy of Baghdad last August. We15share the sorrow of the Secretary-General and his staff and extend our profound condolences to the bereavedfamilies.I intend to focus our attention on the criticalimportance of strategic partnership. Lest my statementbe misconstrued  I hasten to assure the Assembly fromthe outset that my Government is neither oblivious norindifferent to the multitude of concerns and problemsthat attend and threaten our quest for internationalpeace and security. I will be pleased to share myGovernment’s perspective on them later. But allow mefirst to share with the Assembly our nationalphilosophy and policy as they relate to improving thehuman condition.“How does one do that?” you ask. Improving thehuman condition is achieved by working towardshuman security. Notwithstanding the recriminationsand blame  at the core of the failed World TradeOrganization round in Mexico earlier this month wasthe issue of human security. Clearly  countries wantguarantees as Governments struggle to meet the needsof their citizens. For my Government  human securitymeans that each citizen has the right to liberty education  employment  an improved standard of livingand economic development. We believe that humansecurity is a comprehensive and holistic concept thatencompasses all aspects of the human condition.Obviously  there is much that we in the Caribbeancan and must still learn from the rest of the world. But equally  there are many valuable lessons that the rest ofthe world can draw from our experiences and successesin the Caribbean. In many areas  the Caribbean is atestament to the practicality and efficacy of functionalcooperation  and of how  despite the many issues thatdivide us  we continue to work together on matterscommon to us. Be it at the subregional level of theOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) orwithin the broader Caribbean Community(CARICOM)  the progress we have made in forgingconsensus and in building common institutions toaddress our shared problems allows us to be able toshare best practices with the United Nations anddemonstrate how  by working together throughcooperative partnerships  each of us can achieve more.For nearly four decades  for example  theUniversity of the West Indies has cultivated manydistinguished academics and other notables. Today  itstands as a beacon of hope for our young people intheir quest for quality higher education. To its credit the University continues to work with severalinternationally recognized institutions and agencies inthe areas of peace and security  health care andscientific research  to name but a few. The CaribbeanExaminations Council has responded adequately andwith requisite standards of excellence to the growingeducation needs of the English-speaking Caribbean.When our students complete their education  they standshoulder to shoulder with their counterparts around theworld. It is not my intention to boast  but for us it is amatter of national and regional pride. Further  as theAssembly’s President is aware  many of our countrieshave adopted policies that allow nationals of othermember States to travel to and work in their countrieswithout the hassle of visa requirements and workpermits. Although we are divided by the sea  thebridges of commitment and recognition of our commonchallenges and the benefits of shared approaches arebringing us ever closer together.The Caribbean Development Bank and theEastern Caribbean Central Bank are models of howfinancial responsibility and cooperation with andamong member Governments in executing fiscal andmonetary policies can facilitate stability  underpinaccountability and engender progress. For decades  theEastern Caribbean dollar  the currency of the countriesof the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States  hasremained the bedrock of monetary stability. We arealso especially proud of the success of the OECS Courtof Appeal  which has worked effectively and dutifullyin dispensing justice throughout the territories overwhich it exercises jurisdiction. Further  the prudent andpositive steps toward a Caribbean Single Market andEconomy (CSME)  provide evidence of thedetermination of Caribbean Governments to cooperatein almost all endeavours to advance the human securityof our citizens. These are but a few examples offunctional cooperation. In every case  membercountries are better off because they work togetherrather than unilaterally.We continue to incorporate in our nationalpolicies many of the agreed principles of sustainabledevelopment. Additionally  our regional campaign tofight the spread of HIV/AIDS and treat its victims haswitnessed encouraging results under the Pan-CaribbeanPartnership against HIV/AIDS. My Government wishesto commend the World Bank and the William J. ClintonPresidential Foundation for their pledges of support for16our work in this regard. We hope that our cooperationefforts will be a model for future partnerships in ourregion and beyond.I promised earlier that I would share myGovernment’s perspective on some of the decisiveissues that confront us internationally. I preface myremarks with a reminder that just over a decade earlierwe stood on the threshold of a new era of opportunity.We celebrated the collapse of major ideologicalconflicts  which previously held us captive  even  Idare say  on the brink of nuclear Armageddon. As oneleader remarked  nations and peoples quietly harboureddreams that the last decade of the twentieth century andthe advent of the twenty-first century would herald newopportunities to address and redress asymmetricalissues that had frustrated our collective aspirations andindividual potential. None of us  I am sure  wouldlikely admit that we may have squandered suchprospects. However  a little more than a decade later ideological rifts seem to have been replaced bypolitical chasms and new dangers.Consequently  we must re-evaluate our concept ofsecurity. The Organization of American States  in itsmeeting of foreign ministers last year in Barbados took the bold and timely step of redefining securitywithin its hemisphere. Security  the foreign ministersdeclared  is diverse in scope and multidimensional innature  requiring multifaceted approaches to addresspolitical  economic  social and environmental issues.This concept clearly recognizes that we cannot separatenational  regional and international security issues frompolitical  economic and social stability and theirsecurity implications.We in the Caribbean recognize that  whereasglobalization is a viable instrument of growth andprosperity for some  it has become the vehicle of ruinand despair for many of the already poor people aroundthe world. While countries that prosper praiseglobalization and free trade  countries that suffer seethemselves as no more than the guinea pigs  the passiveobjects of globalization  with very little hope ofadvancing human security for their poor citizens.How do we encourage our citizens to have faithin a system that punishes their legitimate efforts? Howcan we tell the poor farmers in the developing world struggling to eke out an existence  to hold out hopewhen farmers in rich countries are subsidized andrewarded for overproduction? How do we ask ourcitizens in small vulnerable economies to sacrifice andadopt free trade wholesale  while larger  moredeveloped economies devise new ways to deny themcrucial market access. Unless we address suchinequities  there will always be resentment andmistrust. We must therefore work together to levelthese bumps on the road to development. Also  wemust rob the uncivil forces of the arguments they use tofeed and exploit the anger and despair of the poor anddispossessed.I turn now to the United Nations. In our view  theUnited Nations remains central to international peaceand human security. The myriad challenges facing ustoday require collective action and partnership. I hastento add that  although the United Nations still lacksimportant elements of transparency and democracy inthe operations of the Security Council  it neverthelessrepresents the most practical framework our nationshave to address regional and international concerns in aholistic manner.I trust that  when the dust of discontent settles we will appreciate that no country can act alone inpursuit of international peace  development and humansecurity. My Government calls on the United Nationsmembership to embrace a bold vision and commitmentto fighting the pull of isolation and the lure ofeconomic and financial engineering. Our reality todayencompasses the struggles to find positive andsustainable methods for advancing our citizens’development against uncivil forces or rogue ideologiesworking relentlessly to undermine them.My Government calls on the United Nations andMember Governments to further subscribe to andpromote partnership by fulfilling the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. The Millennium Goals areessential steps to improving the human condition. Theyare also a reliable basis for addressing many of theinequities of globalization. We urge Member States towork to meet these goals. We can relent only when theother half of the world’s population ceases to live inabject poverty  when larger sectors of the world’spopulation can find work  and when all parents are ableto send their children to school.Despite its exclusion from this internationalfraternity of nations  the Republic of China on Taiwanremains a valuable partner for peace and developmentwith fullest respect for international law. We trust thatits contributions and its citizens’ right to adequate17representation can be guaranteed in the best interest ofbrotherhood so that all people can live in peace andenjoy the fruits of prosperity through partnership.Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore urges theUnited Nations to avail itself of every possibility tofacilitate a sustainable resolution of the impasse thathampers Taiwan’s efforts to engage in internationaldialogue and contribute to the common interests ofmankind.Let me end by reaffirming my Government’scommitment to multilateralism and to strategicpartnership."
"93",3842,"KOR",58,2003,"﻿Ishould like first of all to express my heartiestcongratulations to Mr. Julian Hunte on his election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession. I have no doubt that  under his ablestewardship  we will be able to achieve a great dealduring this important session. I should also like tothank Mr. Jan Kavan for his dedication and hard workduring the last session.The past year has witnessed the fall of a decades-long dictatorship in Iraq. The Iraqi people haveregained their freedom and are now embarking uponthe arduous process of rebuilding their nation.However  the auspicious political changes brought onin Iraq will hold real meaning for the Iraqi people andthe regional order only once they are able to enjoy thesocial economic benefits of a broadly based functionaldemocratic Government. To that end  the Republic ofKorea is now playing its part in the process ofrehabilitation and reconstruction.38 The situation in today's Iraq is  however  lessthan promising. The recent surge of terror and chaoshas served as a sobering reminder that winning the wardoes not necessarily mean winning peace.As the terrorist attack against the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad last month so vividlydemonstrated  the prevalence of violence and terrorismposes the most pressing challenge that Iraq has toovercome in building a democratic  peaceful andprosperous nation. The Republic of Korea stronglycondemns the atrocious act of terrorism against UnitedNations personnel who came to Iraq for the solepurpose of assisting the Iraqi people.We recommend that the Secretary-General takethe necessary steps to ensure the safety and security ofthe United Nations and its associated personnel  as wellas international humanitarian workers in Iraq  as theycarry out their noble duties.Despite the persistence of conflict and turmoil the international community has continued during thepast year to make progress in strengthening theuniversal values of human rights and democracy. Thespread of universal values in turn strengthens thefoundation for peace and prosperity around the world.However  a world in which all peoples enjoy theirfull rights and dignity is far from being a reality. Weneed to make concerted efforts to promote humandignity as the guiding precept of the world community.The Republic of Korea remains firmly committedto international efforts to advance democracy aroundthe world. In this vein  Seoul hosted the SecondMinisterial Conference of the Community ofDemocracies in November last year  as well as theThird Global Forum on Fighting Corruption andSafeguarding Integrity in May this year. We willcontinue to actively participate in efforts to promotehuman rights  the rule of law and good governance.The challenges facing us include fighting povertyand achieving sustainable development. Povertyundermines human dignity. It provides fertile groundfor conflict and dictatorship. The need for internationalcooperation in this area has never been greater.It is therefore tremendously important to achievethe goals set at last year's International Conference onFinancing for Development and the World Summit onSustainable Development. The international communitymust exercise collective wisdom to attain tangible resultsin working toward these goals.In recent years  the growing number of peoplemoving freely across borders has alerted us to theincreasing threats to public health. As demonstrated bythe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic infectious diseases have become a global issue fromwhich no country is immune. It is timely and fittingthat a high-level meeting was held earlier this week onthe follow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixthspecial session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS.In our common fight against infectious diseases  Iwould like to call your attention to the InternationalVaccine Institute  which has been headquartered inSeoul since 1997. This unique internationalorganization  devoted to the development of newvaccines needed in developing countries  awaits thesupport of the international community as it continuesto expand its activities to promote public health for theless privileged of the world.On the global security front  the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction (WMD) and itspotentially devastating linkage to terrorism loom as agrave and perilous threat. The global nuclear non-proliferation regime based on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) currently facesunprecedented challenges.How we deal with these challenges will have adecisive bearing on the future of not only the non-proliferation regime  but also the international securityenvironment as a whole. Recent cases have proven thatthe existing nuclear non-proliferation regime hasinherent limitations when it comes to dealing withdetermined proliferators.While reiterating the importance of achieving theuniversality of the NPT and strengthening thesafeguards system through universal adherence to theAdditional Protocol to the Safeguards Agreements ofthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  weunderscore the need to close the loopholes in thecurrent regime.In this regard  we stress the vital role of bilateral multilateral and regional approaches among countriessharing common security interests in the reinforcementand supplementing of the NPT. The role of export controlarrangements among potential suppliers of relevantcomponents and technologies for WMD is also crucial.39 To that end  my Government hosted a plenarymeeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group last May andwill also host a plenary meeting of the MissileTechnology Control Regime next year.We further believe that the nuclear-weapon Statescan do a great service to the cause of non-proliferationby complying with their share of the nucleardisarmament obligations under the NPT and byworking harder to achieve the early entry into force ofthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.The security of North-East Asia is currentlythreatened by the possibility of the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction. The Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea's nuclear programme not only posesa direct challenge to the security of the Koreanpeninsula  but also endangers peace and stability inNorth-East Asia and beyond. The Republic of Korea isstrongly committed to the denuclearization of theKorean peninsula  and our position on the nuclear issuein the Democratic People's Republic of Korea remainsclear and consistent.First  the Democratic People's Republic of Koreamust dismantle its nuclear programme in a complete irreversible and verifiable manner. Secondly  thenuclear issue with the Democratic People's Republic ofKorea must be resolved in a peaceful and diplomaticmanner.The heightening of military tension on the Koreanpeninsula will be detrimental to all of the countries inthe region. Fifty years after the end of the Korean War our people still feel the pain. We must not allow such atragedy ever to be repeated.By opting to combine efforts to resolve thismatter peacefully and diplomatically  the internationalcommunity has shown great wisdom in dealing withthis pressing and important matter. These efforts wereculminated in the six-party talks held in Beijing lastmonth.Given the complexity of the issue  the multilateraltalks were significant  in that all participants were ableto reach consensus on certain principles that will guidetheir future discussions.Among these principles my Governmentwelcomes  in particular  the consensus on the necessityof both the de-nuclearization of the peninsula and apeaceful resolution through dialogue.The tasks ahead will be to maintain themomentum of dialogue and to refine these agreedprinciples in greater detail. There will indeed bedifficulties in bridging the differences at future talks.To overcome these obstacles a spirit of cooperationmust prevail  and any action that may aggravate thesituation must be avoided.The success of the six-party talks would not onlybring the resolution of the nuclear issue regarding theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea  but shouldalso lead to the process of creating a durable peace onthe Korean peninsula.More than 10 years after the end of the cold war the peninsula remains the last theatre of the cold war with 1.5 million heavily armed troops still pointingguns across the demilitarized zone (DMZ) thatseparates the Republic of Korea in the south and theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea in the north. Itis time for this 50-year stand-off to give way toreconciliation and cooperation. This process should becautiously managed and occur peacefully and gradually.In this regard  I would like to draw on lessonsfrom the history of Europe that could be helpful indefining the future of inter-Korean relations. As we allknow  in the century leading up to the Second WorldWar  relations between France and Germany werecharacterized by the hostilities and confrontation ofthree major wars.After the Second World War  however  thecountries of Europe joined forces to help the two rivalssettle their differences and to pursue peace andcommon prosperity through a network of economicinterdependence.Thanks to the vision of Jean Monnet and RobertSchuman  the European Coal and Steel Communitycame into being and has since developed and expandedto become the unprecedented  multilateral institution ofintegration known today as the European Union.To be sure  the case of the Korean Peninsula isdifferent from that of Europe. Nevertheless  as in thecase of Europe  I believe that a resolution to thepolitical conflict between the two sides of Korea couldbe facilitated by economic interdependence.President Roh Moo-hyun's policy toward theNorth  aptly termed the policy for peace and prosperity is directly aimed at resolving the political confrontationbetween the South and North through the deepening of40 inter-Korean economic interdependence and with thecooperation of the international community.However  the nuclear programme of theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea has emerged asthe most serious challenge to the process ofconsolidating peace and prosperity on the KoreanPeninsula. We in the Republic of Korea sincerely hopethat the Democratic People's Republic of Korea willrealize that it simply cannot achieve economicprosperity without fully abandoning its intentions todevelop nuclear weapons.We note that all participants at the Beijing six-party talks acknowledged the need to address thesecurity concerns of the Democratic People's Republicof Korea  and we ask the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea to make a wise and far-reachingdecision in this regard. We strongly hope that thesecurity concerns of the North  along with the nuclearissue  will be dealt with in more detail at the next six-party talks.Once the Democratic People's Republic of Koreaabandons its nuclear weapon programme and seizes theopportunity offered by the six-party talks to embark ona path towards peace and prosperity  my Governmentwill take further steps towards bold inter-Koreaneconomic cooperation.The international community will also providenecessary humanitarian and economic assistance. Thepositive impact of such cooperation and assistance willresound not only on the Peninsula but throughout theregion and beyond.In conclusion  the abandonment by the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea of its nuclear programmethrough the six-party talks and the subsequent start ofthe peace process on the Korean Peninsula will presentan unprecedented opportunity to dramatically enhanceinternational relations in East Asia.In this regard  we look forward to the support ofall Member States of the United Nations for the successof the six-party talks and the establishment of a lastingpeace on the Korean Peninsula.The United Nations has much work to do in thetwenty-first century. The global body is our greatesthope in our common efforts to make the world saferand more prosperous  for us and for future generations.I sincerely hope to see the United Nations renew itselfand achieve its goals through continuous reform thatwill make it more effective and democratic. TheRepublic of Korea pledges its abiding support to thework of the United Nations in its noble mission formankind as a whole."
"94",3888,"KWT",58,2003,"﻿It gives me pleasure tobegin my statement by congratulating the President both personally and as representative of his country Saint Lucia  on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. Given his skillsand experience  we are confident that he willcompetently lead our deliberations as we consider thepressing global issues that face the Organization at thiscritical time. He may be assured of my delegation’sreadiness to fully cooperate with him in order to ensurethe successful fulfilment of his mandate. I wish also topay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for hisactive and positive role and for his remarkablecontribution to the promotion of internationalcooperation.In addition  I wish to express once again ourappreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tireless efforts to bring peaceand stability to the various troubled regions throughoutthe world. Mr. Annan deserves special tribute for hisextraordinary performance in maintaining the integrityof the United Nations and its leading role in movingthe global agenda forward  despite the enormouschallenges and high risks facing the Organization andits personnel. The terrorist attack against the UnitedNations office in Baghdad last month  which claimedthe lives of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Sergio Vieira de Mello  and of a number of hiscolleagues  is yet further clear testimony of thosechallenging difficulties and immense dangers. Anothersimilar terrorist attack occurred two days ago  andagain the target was the United Nations presence inIraq.From this rostrum  I reiterate our condemnationof that terrorist act and of all other similar acts that30have occurred in the cities of Baghdad and Najaf.Those attacks claimed the lives of highly respectedreligious leaders and symbols and other innocentvictims. We believe that such acts are aimed not only atthe underpinnings of security  of stability and of thepeople’s sense of confidence  but also at the noblevalues that we all seek to restore and consolidate inbrotherly Iraq.Perhaps the most appropriate and resoluteresponse to such criminal acts is a two-track approach.The United Nations  together with the internationalPowers interested in the Iraqi question who are alsoseeking to establish security and stability in Iraq should stay the course and resolutely face thecontinuing violence there. In the meantime  furtherefforts should focus on enabling the Iraqi people toconsolidate national legitimacy and to develop nationalinstitutions. In parallel  efforts for Iraq’s reconstructionshould be intensified in order to make up for manylong years of deprivation  oppression  destruction andmismanagement painfully endured by the Iraqi peopleunder the now-defunct regime that was removed byconcerted international action anchored in SecurityCouncil resolutions related to Iraq’s liberation.Kuwait strongly condemns the inhuman crimesand practices perpetrated by the previous regime inIraq. The most recent manifestation of those atrocitieswas the discovery of numerous mass-grave sites invarious parts of the country. Those graves containedthe remains of thousands of innocent human beings —particularly those of Kuwaitis and third-countrynationals — among which 33 were identified byforensic experts as having been prisoners who wereexecuted by shooting in 1991 and 1992. That is furtherproof of the regime’s brutality and of its total disregardfor international treaties and for the norms ofinternational humanitarian law. Above and beyond thecrimes themselves  for the past 13 years the regimepersistently denied any knowledge of those prisoners’whereabouts. It also ignored relevant decisions of theSecurity Council and of other international andregional organizations calling for its cooperation indisclosing the fate of those victims  only aggravatingtheir relatives’ anguish.Having said that  I should like to add that Kuwaitwill pursue its efforts  in coordination with the UnitedNations  the International Committee of the Red Cross the Tripartite Commission  the interim CoalitionAuthority and the citizens of Iraq  to determine the fateof the remaining Kuwaiti and third-country prisonersand detainees. Furthermore  we shall help in huntingdown the perpetrators in order to bring them to justicefor the crimes they committed against those innocent defenceless victims.Responding to its national and legal obligations Kuwait joined the coalition forces in their endeavour toenforce Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.Thus  we provided all possible facilities within theframework of that legal structure  which eventually ledto Iraq’s salvation from an oppressive  tyrannicalregime. Let me take this opportunity to say that wewelcome that regime’s removal from Iraq. Wecongratulate the brotherly people of Iraq on theirliberation  and we wish them prosperity in a secure andstable Iraq.In addition  Kuwait welcomes the SecurityCouncil’s adoption of resolutions 1483 (2003) and1500 (2003)  on Iraq. We also invite United NationsMember States to join the ongoing international effortsto restore security and stability to Iraq. That will helpthe people of Iraq to rebuild their homeland and to re-establish the political and constitutional institutions ofa national Government. In that regard  we emphasizethe central and significant role of the United Nations inthis political process.Immediately after the collapse of the formerregime in Iraq  Kuwait reached out to the brotherlypeople of Iraq with a wide array of humanitarianassistance. Our response came in the spirit of ourcommon Arab and Islamic heritage. Kuwait rushedmaterial and financial aid to several local andinternational organizations  as well as to the UnitedNations specialized agencies operating in Iraq. We alsocontributed directly to the restoration of electricalpower  health care  educational services and watersupplies to various areas in the country. In addition Kuwait set up a humanitarian operations centre tofacilitate and coordinate relief aid activities andinternational emergency relief efforts to deliver aid toIraq. Kuwait will continue its efforts to ensure thedelivery of all kinds of assistance  which we hope willalleviate the suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq.Now it is our fervent hope that Iraq will safelycross the dire straits through which it is passing andthat it will recover its security and stability and willsafeguard its independence and territorial integrity. Allthat will enable the people of Iraq to recommit their31resources and energies to their country’s reconstructionso that Iraq will reclaim its legitimate and naturalstatus in the region and in the world. Indeed  we arefully confident that Iraq will overcome the challengesof this critical stage of its history  because it isendowed with enormous natural riches  a profoundcultural heritage and skilled human resources.The Government and people of Kuwait will standwith Iraq at this stage and we look forward to enjoyinggood  brotherly relations with a free and united Iraq.We hope that our bilateral relations will becharacterized by mutual trust  respect and good-neighbourliness  and governed by established treatiesand United Nations resolutions. This will help us leavethe past behind and shift our focus onto building abetter future that will contribute to enhancing securityand stability in the region.Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001 thatstruck the United States  the phenomenon of terrorismhas dominated the global agenda. Kuwait stronglycondemned those terrorist acts and all similar crimescommitted in other countries. These are horrendousacts of terrorism that have created new realities on theinternational scene  including a universal convictionthat terrorism in its pernicious manifestations isactually an evil not exclusively associated with onenation  religion or culture. All of us also realize thatthe fight against this evil is an internationalresponsibility to be borne by all Member States  notjust one State or a certain group of States. Therefore we maintain that the United Nations remains the mostappropriate forum for examining this issue anddeveloping the most effective means to combat andeventually to stem it. To that end  the universalsignature  endorsement and enforcement by all MemberStates of the 12 international agreements relating toterrorism would represent a real breakthrough inensuring the deployment of the most effective means tocontain and eliminate this pandemic.As Kuwait firmly reiterates its categoricalrejection of terrorism in all its forms andmanifestations  as well as its renunciation of all acts ofviolence and extremism  it condemns the viciousorchestrated campaign being waged against a sisterState — the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — by someAmerican media agencies. Instead  we commend SaudiArabia for its concrete and significant contributions tothe global campaign against terrorism  bearing in mindthe fact that Saudi Arabia itself has been the target ofterrorists and has suffered as a result. Kuwait fullyendorses all measures taken by the Saudi Governmentin its drive to eliminate terrorism and to consolidateregional security and stability.In the same context  Kuwait will maintain itsefforts  in coordination with the States of the regionand the United Nations  to fight terrorism and tofurther strengthen the measures it has enforced in ordercompletely to fulfil its international obligations especially those set forth in Security Council resolution1373 (2001).Thirty-six years have passed since the oppressiveIsraeli occupation of the land of the Palestinian people who continue to suffer an ongoing decline in theireconomic and social living conditions as a result ofIsrael’s policies and practices  which contraveneinternational and humanitarian laws and norms. Kuwaitis following with grave concern the recent escalation inthe occupied Palestinian territories. Despite the intenseinternational efforts led by the Quartet  which yieldedthe road map for the settlement of the conflict within aspecific time frame with a view to the attainment bythe Palestinian people of their legitimate politicalrights  Israel persists in its policy of backtracking on itscommitments. In fact  it deliberately undermines everypromising initiative while paying no heed to thepotential consequences of the perpetuation of the cycleof violence  rising tension and instability throughoutthe region. Against this backdrop  the question ofdeploying an international monitoring force to ensurescrupulous compliance with ceasefire arrangements ismore pressing than ever.While Kuwait renews its commitment to fullysupporting the struggle of the Palestinian people toattain all their full legitimate political rights  includingthe establishment of their independent State on theirnational territory  with Jerusalem as its capital  wedemand that the Israeli Government commit itself toimplementing the resolution adopted last Friday by theGeneral Assembly at its tenth emergency specialsession and reverse its decision to remove the Presidentof the Palestinian Authority. In the same context  wedemand that the Israeli Government fulfil itsobligations and pledges set out in relevant UnitedNations resolutions  primarily Security Councilresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973); the land forpeace formula; the bilateral accords signed with thePalestinian Authority in the context of the peace32process; and the road map in all its provisions andrequirements.In addition  Israel must abandon forthwith itspolicies of isolating local communities and denyingthem food supplies  incursions  destruction of physicalinfrastructures  demolition of homes and arbitraryround-ups and arrests. Israel must also stop itsconstruction of the separation wall and of settlements.It should also release all Palestinian detainees. Recentdevelopments on the ground prove that these policiesand practices will not fulfil Israel’s goals. Rather  theywill fuel the sentiments of hostility towards Israel.They will also reinforce the sense of despair andundermine the Palestinians’ prospects for living infreedom and dignity  thus forcing them to pursue thecourse of national struggle and resistance ofoccupation. Furthermore  Israel must ultimatelywithdraw from all the Arab territories it occupied in1967 as a prerequisite for building the just  permanentand comprehensive peace for which we all yearn.At the regional level  and in line with Kuwait’scompliance with the principles of the Charter of theUnited Nations  especially Article 2  which stresses theprinciple of peaceful settlement of disputes  we call onthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the United ArabEmirates to maintain their mutual visits and to deepenbilateral talks with a view to resolving their disputeover the three islands. It is our hope that the resolutionof the current dispute will strengthen relations betweenthe two countries and the consolidation of security andstability in the region. In this regard  Kuwait  in itsforthcoming chairmanship of the Gulf CooperationCouncil  will spare no effort to strengthen all aspects ofpolitical  security and economic cooperation among theStates of the region. Furthermore  Kuwait  incooperation and coordination with the United Nationsand the regional players  will explore the activation anddevelopment of regional security arrangements withinterested countries of the region.Today’s world is different in many ways from theworld of several years ago. The trade and economicboundaries of States are rapidly disappearing. Culturalinteraction and relations among various societies isexpanding as a result of the immense achievements ininformation and communications technologies.However  such technologies have had some negativeimplications that cannot be brushed aside. Thus  we arenow seeing an increasing marginalization of themajority of the developing countries  whose economiesnow suffer from a growing set of problems thatjeopardize their prospects for meaningful development.In an attempt to face up to these challenges which hamper world economic growth  a series ofUnited Nations meetings were convened to address theimpediments to global economic growth. Thus  theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development  held inSouth Africa  and the International Conference onFinancing for Development  held in Mexico  developeda framework of action for ensuring equity and fairinterdependence and cooperation between the Northand the South. Also  specific guidelines and obligationswere set for all stakeholders to achieve a moreequitable balance in economic relations. At thisjuncture  we would therefore call on the developednations to meet their partnership obligations. Theseinclude  inter alia  adequate flows of financial andtechnical aid to the developing countries; thealleviation of the debt burden and cancellation of thedebts of the least developed countries; the removal ofcustoms restrictions on flows of goods from thedeveloping countries into world markets; and anexchange of information and expertise that would helpdeveloping countries to build and modernize theirnational institutions.To this end  Kuwait  for its part  reaffirms itscommitment to continue to provide development andfinancial assistance to developing countries. Ourchannels will either include the United Nationsprogrammes  funds  agencies and other multilateralorganizations or the Kuwait Fund for EconomicDevelopment  which has a sterling track record ofaiding and financing a wide range of developmentprojects and programmes in more than 100 developingcountries across the globe.As we are still in the early years of a new century it is our hope that all of us will draw the right lessonsfrom our collective experiences of the past. Onlythrough common action can humankind face thechallenges of the present in order to fashion a betterfuture that offers future generations the hope of livingin freedom and dignity.Let us join hands to fulfil our common vision of alife in which law and order prevail — a life governedby the values and principles of freedom  justice andequality for all; a life that upholds the concept ofpartnership and cooperation as the shortest path tosecurity  stability and peace in the world."
"95",3934,"LAO",58,2003,"﻿Let me convey my congratulations toMr. Julian Hunte on his election to the presidency ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. We areconfident that this Assembly stands to benefit greatlyfrom his diplomatic experience and skills. Like others I pledge the full support and cooperation of the Laodelegation to him as he undertakes his duties andexpress the hope that our deliberations on many of themost pressing world issues will be fruitful.Since the last time we convened  the world hasgone through major changes and challenges. Althoughpeace  dialogue and cooperation for developmentcontinue to prevail today across many regions  we havebeen bearing witness to a world beset by terror  civilwars  armed conflicts and violence  acts of aggressionand interference in the internal affairs of States. Inhandling these problems  we believe it is incumbentupon all of us to show patience  courage anddetermination and to strive to solve them throughdialogue  diplomacy and political means. Towards thatend  we should continue to seek multilateral routesthrough the United Nations. In this regard  we shouldlike to make special mention of Secretary-General KofiAnnan. While we wish him more success as heendeavours to defend and promote the principles andideals of this universal Organization  we can onlyexpress great appreciation for the efforts he has made.At present  the problems plaguing our planet alas  are not limited to those considered to be politicalor military. There are also those that affect theenvironmental  social and economic fronts. Morestriking are the issues of global warming  pollution natural disasters  HIV/AIDS  incurable diseases poverty and underdevelopment  the crises of refugees debt and economic stagnation  which have yet to findeffective solutions. The severity of these problems iseven more acute in a globalized world in which the gapbetween developed and developing countries iswidening.We should therefore strive effectively to addressthese problems in order to meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goals adopted three years ago by thisAssembly. Standing here today and recommittingourselves to meeting those noble Goals  we want aworld where poverty and hunger are alleviated; whereeducation is offered to every child; where women havethe same opportunities as men; where incurablediseases are effectively combated; and where the worldcontinues to build partnership and cooperation forsustained economic growth and sustainabledevelopment.For many years  the land-locked developingcountries have attached a particular interest to theirspecial needs and problems. As Chairman of the 31-member Group of Land-Locked Developing Countriesfor the past four years  the Lao People’s DemocraticRepublic has spared no effort in bringing the specialneeds and problems of land-locked developingcountries to the forefront of the international arena. Asa result of this long-standing concerted effort  theInternational Ministerial Conference of Landlockedand Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countriesand International Financial and Development14Institutions on Transit Transport Cooperation was heldlast month in Kazakhstan as the first-ever UnitedNations conference of its kind. The meeting adoptedthe Almaty Declaration and Programme of Action. Weare delighted that this global Programme of Actionaddresses  first and foremost  the special needs andproblems of the landlocked developing countries  whiletaking into account the legitimate concerns of transitdeveloping countries. In this respect  all stakeholdersare urged to fully and effectively implement theAlmaty Programme of Action in the years to come.Since its inception  the United Nations hasperformed multiple activities in various areas  such asthe maintenance of peace and security  socio-economicdevelopment  humanitarian assistance  the promotionof international law  human rights and the protection ofthe environment. In these endeavours  the UnitedNations has achieved many successes  including in thefield of socio-economic development. However  inmany other areas  still more effort is required in orderto attain better results.As Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in hisannual report this year “in the area of peace and security  it has been atrying year for the United Nations. The war inIraq severely tested the principle of collectivesecurity and the resilience of the Organization.”(A/58/1  para. 2)In the light of this  and given the present internationalsituation  the Security Council  the main body for themaintenance of international peace and security  shouldplay its full role in securing peace and security in theworld  as stipulated in the Charter. The SecurityCouncil members  especially the permanent members should do everything possible to ensure that this organeffectively discharges its duties in the maintenance ofpeace and security. A safe and secure world wouldenable all nations to better promote their socio-economic development. The international communityis therefore urged to deploy serious efforts towards thisend.In a world where cooperation for development iswidespread  where in every region there is economicintegration to achieve common benefits  it isregrettable that the economic  commercial and financialrestrictions imposed on Cuba continue. We reaffirm thesupport of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic forthe General Assembly resolution calling for the liftingof such a restrictive policy  with the aim of benefitingall peoples in the region as well as the world at large.With regard to the Middle East  we continue to begravely concerned about the ongoing violence anddisproportionate use of force that have brought nothingbut destruction and death to both Palestine and Israel.We urge the two sides to exercise the utmost restraintand engage in earnest negotiations so that peace andcooperation may eventually ensue in the region. If thatis done  by 2005 the inalienable rights of thePalestinian people to establish an independent andviable State  living side by side with Israel in peace andsecurity  could become a reality.The Lao People’s Democratic Republic hasfollowed the recent developments in the Koreanpeninsula with great attention. We render our fullsupport to the six-party talks hosted in Beijing inAugust by the Government of China  which contributedactively. We are pleased with the significant progressachieved by this meeting. We very much hope that thedialogue process will be pursued to address the nuclearissue in parallel with the security of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea. This would no doubtcontribute to the realization of a nuclear-free KoreanPeninsula  the assurance of security for all countries inNorth-East Asia and the peaceful reunification of thetwo Koreas.Over the past year  the Lao people of all ethnicgroups have pursued their national development inunity and harmony. We are delighted that  through thepromotion of the untapped potential of all domesticeconomic sectors and the expansion of cooperationwith the international community  the pace of nationaleconomic growth has continuously increased; thelivelihood of the people  particularly those in the ruralareas  has been further improved; and  last but notleast  political stability and social order have beenensured and strengthened.In order to free the country fromunderdevelopment  apart from our domestic effort  wehave attached great importance to the achievementsmade in our increased effort to implement the regionalintegration of the Association of South-East AsianNations (ASEAN). We highly value the continueddevelopment of cooperation between ASEAN and thePeople’s Republic of China  Japan  the Republic ofKorea  India and other dialogue partners. Furthermore we are pleased with the new chapter in the15strengthening of cooperation between ASEAN and theUnited States  in particular the signing of the bilateraltrade agreement between the Governments of the LaoPeople’s Democratic Republic and the United States inVientiane on 19 September this year. In this regard  Iwish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude tofriendly countries and international organizations forthe invaluable assistance and support rendered to thecause of our national development.As it enters this new century  humankind has astrong aspiration for peace and cooperation fordevelopment across the globe. In accordance with theCharter and international law  we should exert ourcollective efforts to build a better world. In this spirit our delegation once again calls for cooperation andunity in designing and implementing action-orientedmeasures to tackle the challenges and problemsplaguing our planet. If we do this  future generationswill commend us for all our efforts in establishingconditions for their peaceful lives and prosperity."
"96",3977,"LBN",58,2003,"﻿Thisgreat number of heads of State and Government haveassembled at the current session neither to performceremonial rituals nor to conduct the periodicconsideration of agendas. Rather  it is the state of theworld today that necessitated this exceptionalgathering  because people everywhere sense a growingstruggle between fear and hope  security andinstability  force and weakness  surplus and need  andfreedom and oppression.Returning to this Assembly is tantamount toreturning to our origins and sources  and to commonsense and principles  after nearly losing them. Wereturn to this mother Organization like children whoreturn home changed. Some are obedient and others arerebellious; some are just and others are unjust.However  we find the mother Organization as badlyhurt as some of its children.What hurts the United Nations hurts us all. Itsfallen victims are indeed martyrs of humanity in itsentirety  like Count Folke Bernadotte  DagHammarskjˆld  Sergio Vieira de Mello and others whohave made the ultimate sacrifice for this Organization.The peoples of the world perceive the UnitedNations as a haven for the rights of the weak and theneedy. It also exercises its authority to dissuade thestrong who act aggressively and forget their obligationsand commitments.In our region and in our country  we have greatlysuffered from double standards and recourse to mightat the expense of right. Since the foundation of anentity on the ruins of the people of Palestine  an entitythat recognizes neither its own borders nor those ofothers  repeated injustices and wars have arisen as aresult of violations of the spirit and raison d''tre of thisinternational Organization.Comprehensive and just approaches were adoptedat the international Conference in Madrid to find apeaceful resolution to the Middle East conflict resulting in principles and accomplishments that cannotbe renounced or reversed. Incomplete approachesemerged  but they failed to achieve peace  maintainsecurity and ensure stability. It has become clear toeveryone  except to those in Israel who are arrogantand intransigent  that there can be no security without apolitical solution  and no partial  peaceful  politicalsolution without the comprehensive peace thatembodies the spirit of justice of the Madrid Conferenceand the integrated Arab peace initiative of the ArabSummit in Beirut.Such a solution is based on the relevantinternational resolutions calling for the return toLebanon of the rest of the territory still under Israelioccupation  including Shebaa farms; for the return toSyria of its territory up to its 4 June 1967 borders; andfor enabling Palestinian refugees to exercise their legal humanitarian and moral right of return to theirhomeland. Such a process should ensure theestablishment of a sovereign  independent  stable andviable Palestinian State  with al-Quds al-Sharif as itscapital.Developments on the ground  however  dash thathope. The Government of Israel continues to buildsettlements  impose extrajudicial sentences  kill men women and children  demolish houses and carry outpre-emptive arrests and assassinations.Similarly  Lebanon suffers from persistent andextremely provocative and aggravated Israeli threats attacks and violations by sea  land and air  as describedby the Secretary-General and his SpecialRepresentative in the region. The internationalcommunity should therefore pressure Israel to endthose excesses.Lebanese detainees and prisoners are stillillegally held hostage  without due process  in Israel which still keeps the remaining maps of the landminesthat it planted during its occupation of southernLebanon. Furthermore  Israel continues its policy ofassassination and still covets Lebanon's waters andnatural resources.I must say that the failure to guarantee the rightof Palestinian refugees to exercise their right of returnputs the entire Middle East in an explosive situation.The Government and people of Lebanon are especiallycommitted to the implementation of this right  whichwe consider to be legal  natural and moral. Therefore the so-called realistic solutions to this problem shouldnot even be raised  since they run counter to theprinciples of international law and the spirit of justice.Indeed  only a commitment to the right of return andrefusal to resettle the refugees in Lebanon are at thecore of Lebanon's reconciliation that ended the war inLebanon and that led to the Taif Agreement  which wasendorsed by the United Nations.36In this context  I wish to stress that Lebanon'spolicy choices and positions regarding the Middle Eastconflict are constant and unaffected by the balance ofpower. We believe that those choices are righteous moral and consistent with the requirements of a justpeace. Those choices alone are capable of bringingabout a possible and strong settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict.Such an undertaking is compatible with the goalsof the United Nations  as it strives to strengthen itsrole  with the support of the sponsors of the peaceprocess and the participation of the European Union.It is in Israel's interest to revert to or to bebrought back to the language of reason and justice.Since Israel's Governments have failed to do so responsibility for bringing Israel back to reason falls tothe international community.For in Israel there is a Government that considersonly its rights and fails to take account of itsobligations. We believe that those who consider onlyone side are the most dangerous kinds of people.Under the pretext of security  the Government inIsrael is continuing to build a wall that separates Israelfrom the people of Palestine and is attempting to builda higher  larger and more menacing wall between thegreater nations of the West and the rest of the world especially the Arab and the Muslim world. Israel doesthat in a bid to serve and support those who wish tofuel conflict between East and West  betweenChristianity and Islam and among religions  culturesand civilizations  when  in the final analysis  there isonly one human civilization  which stems fromcommon spiritual values based on the belief in oneeternal God and his messengers.Furthermore  the Government of Israel resortsdaily to the stick as a means of subjugation. It ignores or pretends to ignore  that the use of the stick incitesdisobedience; that  with time  the oppressors and theoppressed often exchange roles and positions; and thatmany who were once at the helm at various stages oftheir lives have faded from historical memory  havingforgotten that only God is everlasting  as are theuniversal principles of equality  fairness and justice.There are those in the Israeli Government whowere brought to power by the very extremism thatcaused the ouster of their predecessors or even led totheir assassination  and who nevertheless do nothesitate to label Arabs and Muslims as the extremistsor accuse them of being the sole source of extremism.In Israel  there are those who insist on makingIsrael a fortress towering over the region  rather than aState within it. There are those who make life for thePalestinians worse than death  and who are determinedto force fellow Israelis to die with the Arabs in war rather than live with them in peace.There are those in the Government of Israel whotry to deny that Lebanon  Syria and the Palestinian'sright of return are a mandatory path for any politicalsettlement and a just  lasting and comprehensive peaceis to be achieved. On the contrary  they desperately usethe feeble-minded to fan the flames of conflict amongthe Palestinians themselves  among the Lebanese between the Lebanese and the Syrians  and among theArabs  instead of extinguishing the flames of conflictbetween the Arabs and Israelis in a decent  just andcomprehensive manner.The Government of Israel believes that it is moreimportant to gain time than to gain peace  that it isbetter to manipulate the various tracks and problemsthan to seek to resolve the conflict in all its dimensionsand problems and that intimidation can transforminjustice into right  right into injustice and occupationinto independence.In Israel  the Government clings to its slogan ofabsolute sovereignty  and to the sovereignty it violatesor violates with others  limiting the role of its mostimportant ally to providing money and weapons denying it even the right to advise. If the world's onlysuper-Power utters a word of advice about theconstruction of the wall of separation anddiscrimination  it is ignored and construction of thewall continues.Offence is often the result of excessive toleranceof fault  and excessive chaos in standards andyardsticks is caused by the discriminatory use ofstandards regarding justice and internationalresolutions. It is not just  wise  safe or peaceful forpowerful States to continue to tolerate double andmultiple standards when dealing with Israel  whileapplying firm standards and measures when dealingwith the weak and the oppressed and other nations ofthe world.This clearly leads us to call for the reform of theUnited Nations  as well as for strengthening its role  by37reviewing the working methods of the SecurityCouncil  expanding its membership  giving it moreweight in decision-making and respecting thedemocratic consultative nature that must be the basis ofour international Organization. That reform shouldfairly and effectively address new challenges of worldsecurity and safety. It should also provide balance andstability in international relations  particularly if that isaccompanied by modernizing the work of the UnitedNations organs and rationalization to avoid use of theright of veto in a way that contravenes law and justicein the world.In Iraq  there is also a growing call for the UnitedNations to play a pivotal role in assisting the people ofIraq to maintain their unity  control their own destiny end the occupation of their territories  establish themeans to administer their wealth  choose the provisionsof their constitution and freely elect theirrepresentatives.War can be waged from the air by one side only.However  peace on the ground must be made withothers inside and outside of Iraq and with the UnitedNations. Peace in Iraq and Iraq's destiny require thatthe Iraqis be freed of occupation as soon as possibleand that they work  under the auspices of the UnitedNations  in an expanded  pivotal and political role thatis not restricted to social matters alone.That is the fundamental appeal of the events andtragedies and of the people of Iraq. Only the ignorantor those pretending ignorance refuse to listen and todraw lessons and conclusions before it is too late.The beginning of this century has been marked byviolence and terrorism  whose worst manifestation hasbeen the tragedies and crimes of 11 September and thesubsequent calls for extremism and clash ofcivilizations  which prompt us to refuse to yield to theworst evils that threaten the peace and unity of ourplanet.Lebanon was among the first countries to betargeted by terrorism  which was carried out byfundamentalist groups. It fought it with courage andresolve. At the same time  Lebanon still faces Stateterrorism practiced by Israel  which has caused thedeath  injury and displacement of thousands ofLebanese and the destruction of essential facilities andinfrastructure. While we differentiate betweenterrorism and the right of peoples whose territories areoccupied to resist and to liberate that land  within thecontext of international resolutions and the Charter  ourcountry explicitly and strongly condemns all forms ofterrorism  as it constitutes a threat to mankind as awhole  regardless of race  colour or religion. Lebanonreaffirms its commitment to continue to cooperate withthe international community to fight this extremelyharmful and damaging scourge.In conclusion  I would be remiss if I did notcongratulate Mr. Hunte on his election as President ofthe General Assembly and wish him success in hisstewardship. I also would like to commend the tirelessefforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  topromote all opportunities for peace  stability anddevelopment in the world. Furthermore  I would like topay a tribute to the United Nations Interim Force inLebanon (UNIFIL) for its role in southern Lebanon.Now that Lebanon has been able to liberate most of itsterritory  it is my hope that UNIFIL will fulfil theremainder of the mandate entrusted to it  as defined inSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978).Lebanon has and always will be a country thatrejects isolation and rigidity and that will remain opento dialogue and creative  rich  civilized humaninteraction. Our country will always remain true to itsmessage. Despite the challenges  we remain eager toeffectively promote justice and the rule of law anduphold the values of freedom and democracy."
"97",4024,"LBR",58,2003,"﻿I am honoured toparticipate  on behalf of Mr. Moses Zeh Blah  Presidentof the Republic of Liberia  in the general debate of the6General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session  and tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this session. Iexpress the confidence of the Government of Liberiathat you will faithfully honour the responsibilitieswhich you have been assigned.I also wish to commend Mr. Jan Kavan of theCzech Republic for the able manner in which hesteered the activities of the fifty-seventh session of theGeneral Assembly.Undoubtedly  Mr. Kofi Annan deserves thecommendation of this Assembly for his stewardship ofour global Organization and the excellent leadershipwhich he exudes in the resolution of internationalquestions  ranging from terrorism to the deadly AIDSpandemic and from poverty to the imbalance in globaltrade and commerce.We must also pay a special tribute to SergioVieira de Mello and other United Nations workers wholost their lives in selfless humanitarian service in Iraq.Those citizens of the world embodied the spirit of theUnited Nations and are true representatives of theconscience of humanity.Terrorism  the menace to international peace andsecurity  has brought immeasurable grief to the world.Acts of terrorism have elicited neither theunderstanding nor the empathy of the world for causesto which terrorists may aspire. Contrarily  acts ofterrorism have rightly ignited widespread disdain andrevulsion for their perpetrators. Today  terrorism seeksto undermine our collective freedom and thereforerequires our collective will and efforts to combat thiscommon enemy.However  this objective is being undermined bythe lack of international consensus. The unwillingnessto garner and work along lines of internationalconsensus has exposed cracks in our efforts to fightterrorism  bringing into scrutiny the structure of thisworld body and the continued relevance of the SecurityCouncil. When the Security Council appears divided onfundamental questions of international security  theworld becomes vulnerable. A divided Security Councilfertilizes the grounds for the germination ofinternational terror and insecurity. If the SecurityCouncil is to serve as the guarantor of internationalpeace and security  then that organ must of necessity beguided by mechanisms that ensure the judiciousdevelopment of consensus and respect for andadherence to international law.Additionally  our united condemnation of andfight against terrorism must never stoop to theemployment of methods not far removed from thoseused by terrorists themselves. To fight fire with firewill leave our global village without a single hut. Wemust muster the will to tackle the issues that areexploited by terrorists and terrorist organizations.The conflict in the Middle East has inescapablyattracted the attention of the world  posing the greatestchallenge to international peace and security. We aresaddened by and deeply concerned about the recentturn of events  which has occasioned the virtualdebunking of the road map for peace and ensured aclassic return to violence. Admittedly  there are seriousdifficulties in the search for peace for our brothers andsisters of that troubled region. However  thesedifficulties should neither beset us with a sense ofhopelessness nor obscure the agonies and the fears thathave come to characterize the way of life in the MiddleEast.We therefore call on the Government of Israel andthe Palestinian Authority to recognize the right toexistence of each other within recognized internationalborders and to foster pragmatic approaches to dialogue peace  security and the virtues of good-neighbourliness. At the same time  we urge theSecurity Council to develop  strengthen and maintaininternational consensus on the way forward.With respect to the Liberian crisis  since our lastaddress to this Assembly  Liberia has wrestled andcontinues to wrestle with serious political and securitychallenges. An insurgency that began four years agoreached the Liberian capital  Monrovia. Unsurprisingly an already deteriorating humanitarian situationworsened  accompanied by the widespread breakdownof law and order. Regrettably  while recognizing theintensification of the war in Liberia and the right of theLiberian people to self-defence  the Security Councilmaintained an arms embargo on the Government. Thissituation catalysed the rapid advance of the insurgentsand bestowed upon their cause a false sense ofinternational approbation. The Liberian State teeteredon the verge of disintegration.But for the resilience of the people of Liberia andthe timely intervention of the Economic Community ofWest African States (ECOWAS) and the International7Contact Group on Liberia  Liberia would have slippedinto the abyss of unbridled anarchy. We will thereforeremain eternally grateful to ECOWAS  and particularlyto the Governments and peoples of the FederalRepublic of Nigeria and Ghana  for their leadership inthe quest to stabilize the situation in my country. In asimilar manner  the Government of Liberia expressesimmense gratitude to the Government of the UnitedStates of America  the United Nations  the EuropeanUnion and the African Union for their respective rolesin and continued support for the ongoing efforts torestore lasting peace  security and democracy toLiberia. We must also pay special tribute to the supportof the Governments of South Africa and Mozambique.On 11 August 2003  with the deployment of avanguard force from the friendly Government of theFederal Republic of Nigeria  the promise of a smoothtransfer of power was remarkably fulfilled. Thisdevelopment energized the signing  on 18 August inAccra  Republic of Ghana  of a Comprehensive PeaceAgreement. The Agreement establishes a frameworkfor the formation and installation of a transitionalGovernment  the disarmament  demobilization andreintegration of combatants and the restructuring of thenational security apparatus. It also provides for therepatriation and resettlement of refugees and internallydisplaced persons  the rebuilding of the nation’sproductive capacity and the creation of democraticspace for the conduct of free  fair and credibleelections in 2005. These goals cannot be achievedwithout concerted multinational collaboration andassistance.The Government of Liberia welcomes theadoption of Security Council resolution 1509 (2003) which establishes the United Nations Mission inLiberia. We pledge our cooperation and support to therealization of the objectives set out in the resolution.Comprehensive disarmament  demobilization and asustained programme of reintegration and resettlementare sine qua non to peace  security and stability inLiberia and the West African subregion. TheGovernment of Liberia is therefore beholden to theinternational community  with gratitude for itscontinuous assistance and support in the search forpeace and security in Liberia and the West Africansubregion. However  unless democratic expressionsand aspirations are allowed to flourish throughstrengthened democratic institutions  and unless analternative source of livelihood is provided thedisarmed combatants  the gains obtained through thesupport of the international community could begrievously undermined.In this respect  resolution 1509 (2003)  whichengenders new hope for Liberia  appears to becontradicted by the demands of resolution 1343 (2001).That resolution imposes and maintains a regime ofsanctions and other restrictions on Liberia. Unarguably economic sanctions imposed under resolution 1343(2001) becloud Liberia with an undeserved stigma that in effect  discourages the flow of much-neededinternational investment into the private sector tosupport Liberia’s post-conflict reconstruction anddevelopment programmes and restricts the essentialflow of energy needed to revive Liberia’s economicinfrastructure.A vibrant private sector is the key to Liberia’srecovery and the cure to problems of unemployment which provides stimulus to social unrest and politicalinstability. If sanctions  smart or targeted  are tools toaccomplish political objectives  then they must respondaffirmatively to the realization of the objectives. Onedoes not administer medication to a dead person nordoes one take medication to cure the illness of another.The Government of Liberia therefore calls on theSecurity Council to lift its regime of economicsanctions imposed on the country.In situations such as ours  international goodwilland assistance are often accompanied by the temptationto ignore indigenous expertise largely in favour ofexpatriates. The net effect of adherence to suchtemptation is the development of structures andinstitutions that are neither manageable nor sustainableby the beneficiaries after the departure of theexpatriates. Even so  Liberia is blessed with its share ofendowments in human and natural resources. As can beexpected  years of political turmoil  conflict andmismanagement have resulted in the massive exodus ofLiberia’s human resources. Welcoming a newopportunity to rebuild a more democratic  accountableand coherent society  Liberians are desperate to returnhome and contribute. To that end  it is the desire andexpectation of the Government and people of Liberiathat  as much as is possible  Liberians will beemployed at all levels in the post-conflictreconstruction and rehabilitation of their country.Liberia is a founding Member of this world body.Irrespective of the current problems we face and our8need for international assistance  Liberia will remain arespectable member of the international community.We intend to uphold our sovereign dignity in theconduct of international affairs. Liberia cannot and willnot be a subject of trusteeship.Like most third-world nations  Liberia is deeplyindebted to several international financial institutionsand organizations. We are grateful to our creditors fortheir patience and understanding. Determined as we areto survive  we count on the empathy of theinternational community to treat our indebtedness withthe uniqueness that it deserves and pledge ourcommitment to working along with those institutions indeveloping appropriate mechanisms to deal withLiberia’s debt. Servicing these debts remains a priorityfor the Government of Liberia. However  our capacityto make payment is limited by manifold problemsoccasioned by several years of continuous warfare.I should now like to turn to the case of theRepublic of China. The General Assembly mustconfront the moral and legal challenges posed by theexclusion of more than 23 million people fromrepresentation in this world body. How else are we toexplain the denial of the rights of a progressive andindustrious people from representation at the level ofthe General Assembly? The fact remains that theGovernment and people of the Republic of China onTaiwan have  and continue to engage in  responsibleself-governance. It is incontestable that the people ofthe Republic of China on Taiwan continue tosignificantly contribute to the improvement of thehuman family. Their achievements in the spheres ofscience and technology  commerce and trade  and thearts and culture cannot be ignored.The undaunted spirit of the great people of theRepublic of China aspires to participate in the UnitedNations. Liberia is convinced that the participation ofboth sides of the Taiwan Strait in the activities ofinternational organizations will encourage greaterunderstanding and mutual trust between the two sides.That is consistent with the spirit of preventivediplomacy advocated by the United Nations. Liberiatherefore reiterates its call for the admission of theRepublic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations andits specialized agencies  as well as the assumption ofits rightful place in the discourse and transaction ofworld affairs.In conclusion  Liberia is today in urgent need ofinternational assistance and support. While oursituation appears to be grim  it is certainly nothopeless. While many of our compatriots may have lostlives and limbs  we are still a forgiving people. Whileour national infrastructure may have been destroyed we are still a resilient people. While our dignity mayhave been impinged upon  we are still a proud people.We Liberians are unified in our determination to workfor a better and brighter future. We are united infostering the faith of our founding fathers to build anation dedicated to freedom  liberty and justice for all."
"98",4101,"LCA",58,2003,"﻿It is neither pride northe prospect of privilege that moves us to assume thePresidency of the United Nations General Assemblybut a certain determination that is the unspokenstrength of islands. Nor is it merely that we arehonoured — though indeed we are — but that we alsofeel worthy  as worthy as any other member of thiscommunity and determined to make our contribution tothe progress of humanity and the welfare of the world.Saint Lucia recognizes and appreciates that thisPresidency became a reality only with the support ofthe Latin American and Caribbean family.Our preoccupation is not with size  sovereignty orpower but with people  and by this measure we are notsmall  nor are we just an island  for we do not standalone. We stand as one Member of this Organization proud of the legacy and the vision that we can offer theworld. We assume this role because we wish to offerthat vision to the world — because it is larger than our238 square miles and larger than our population of159 000 people. It is a vision we wish to place at theservice of humanity.It is our hope that Saint Lucia’s presidency willoffer a fresh perspective  an alternative view  and adifferent  but not discordant  voice to the heart of theAssembly. As such  the people and the Government ofSaint Lucia express both their appreciation and theirdetermination to the members of this internationalcommunity — appreciation for the faith and trustbestowed upon us with the presidency of thisinstitution  and determination that we shall not fail it but be judged equal to the task before us. If it is a taskof Herculean proportion  then we will face it with equalconfidence  certain that the rebuilding of our brokenhumanity is a matter which we encounter in thecompany of equally resolute and undaunted partners.Since the end of the cold war  the legitimacy credibility and relevance of this time-honouredinstitution have never been so questioned as they aretoday. The United Nations Millennium Declaration wasdesigned to revive the dying pulse of all humanity buthas itself become comatose. Indeed  Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan was moved to state that:“It is uncertain whether the consensus andthe vision that the Millennium Declarationexpressed are still intact.”Saint Lucia therefore calls on the internationalcommunity to heed the appeal of our Secretary-Generalto seek balance between the imperatives of militarysecurity and human security. In the interest ofredistributive justice  global peace and security  thedeveloped countries must not renege on theircommitments to the developing world in the areas oftrade  debt relief and aid.The Millennium Declaration goal of halvingglobal poverty is receding into nothingness  but it canbe rescued if developed countries make good on theirpledges. Moreover  we might challenge ourselvesbeyond merely halving global poverty  by aspiring toits virtual elimination. By now  it should be clear to us27all that poverty issues are inseparable from humanrights issues  as are environmental issues fromeconomic and political development issues. Nationalsecurity and international stability can be realized onlywhere there is justice.It was the prophet Isaiah who reminded us that ifmankind is brought low  everyone will be humbled. Yetif we  the international community  retreat from theideals of the creation of a greater humanity  we wouldalso be retreating from the core values and principlesenshrined within the United Nations Charter. Moreimportantly  we would be tacitly endorsing the returnand consolidation of a global uncivil society — thesymptoms of which are already manifest within ourglobal society. Religious intolerance  tribal aggressionand civil war continue to ravage many parts of ourplanet. Among the victims are the poor  themarginalized and the vulnerable — often women andchildren  who play no part in the making of war butfind themselves stripped of their human dignity andbasic human rights. Terrorist attacks in Bali  Kenya Saudi Arabia and Baghdad add to our symptoms ofimpending rupture.The arteries of conscience are becoming hardenedby the frequency of wanton violence  yet on occasionthere are incidents that shock our sensibilities. Themurder of Sergio Vieira de Mello and other UnitedNations colleagues reminds us of the mindless horror atthe heart of that darkness. Saint Lucia joins theinternational community in expressing sympathy totheir families  and we reiterate our profound respect tothose international workers who are so willing to makethe ultimate sacrifice to extend humanitarianassistance  security and comfort to those in peril and inneed.In this environment  it is essential that wemaintain a United Nations which steadfastly adheres toits original core values. Saint Lucia will resist anyattempt to de-legitimize the United Nations system.Any strategy which claims to embrace peace  securityand justice and yet excludes the United Nations beliesa flawed and unreal conception of world affairs. ThisOrganization has been instrumental in the preservationof the nation-State within a framework of bindingrelationships among Governments. More importantly the United Nations has been a devoted guardian ofindividual rights and freedoms. Saint Lucia maintainsthat the United Nations  precisely because of itsdiversity  is the only organization with the political andmoral legitimacy to deal adequately with global issues.This universal body — this United Nations — hasno other choice but to heed the lessons of the past andthe wisdom of the ages in its attempt to better servehumanity. When our predecessor organization  theLeague of Nations  was discarded as irrelevant  wewitnessed the advance of disorder and humancatastrophe on a scale never before envisioned. If westand idly by now  while this time-honoured institutionis rendered irrelevant and toothless  we will havecommissioned an epitaph for humanity.Saint Lucia therefore calls for the completion ofthe efforts at reforming the Security Council to betterreflect the realities of this new century and to make itmore representative — more democratic  legitimateand transparent. The existing veto system is too easilyinfluenced by national interests to address seriousissues afflicting humankind. If a coalition of thewilling could be assembled for war  then surely we canalso gather a coalition of the willing to address theproblems of poverty  disease  illiteracy  hunger  andtrade imbalances. There can be no sanitizing of onecorner of the globe while contagion  despair anddesperation fester elsewhere. There is no security forthe one while insecurity plagues the other.But  ultimately  the strength of the United Nationsmust come from the political will of the MemberStates — a political will that must accept that everyoneshould adhere to  abide by  and implement all thedecisions taken and resolutions adopted by theOrganization. We cannot  in the name of nationalinterest  observe only some resolutions and expect tohave a strong United Nations.The United Nations cannot be strengthened if wedo not have the political will to accept that its activitiescannot be dictated by the agendas of a few powerfulStates. It must embrace  in equal measure  the concernsof the small and the weak that are the majority of itsMembers. No single State  by virtue of its economic ormilitary might  should determine  on its own  theobligations and responsibilities of the rest of humanity.“Muscular unilateralism” and the emergingdoctrine of diplomatic unilateralism cannot be thepreferred approach to serious global issues.Exceptionalism within the international system iscertain to fragment international cooperation  making it28less likely that countries will forgo aspects of nationalsovereignty in the interest of the common good.It has become abundantly clear that theinternational community will not succeed in its waragainst terrorism if it fails to address root causes. Thecurrent war on terrorism is designed to capture  confineor eliminate existing terrorist networks withoutaddressing the causes of terrorism. Terrorism does notstem simply from the arrogance and madness of a fewdictators and misguided fanatics; it is also the result ofdeep-seated inequity and  sometimes  bigotry. If thestatus quo denies opportunity  freedom and fulfilmentto those who hunger and dwell in despair  the appeal ofchaos and extremism as an avenue to change becomesthat much more attractive. If  on the other hand  weperceive that the world order works in the interests ofall of us  there will be a universal commitment tosustain that order. Consequently  it is imperative thatthe international community jointly address economicinjustice and political exclusion as common enemies ofus all.Your assumption  Sir  of the presidency of thisinstitution at this time  as a representative of a smallisland developing State — one of the smallestMembers of the United Nations — is both a tribute tothe democratic principles of the United Nations and asignal of the need to conclude the process ofrevitalizing the work of the General Assembly. Wemust conquer delay  procrastination  repetition andinaction.Many years have passed since deliberations onthe reform of the Security Council began; and yet thereis no end in sight. Consultations on the revitalization ofthe General Assembly first began 13 years ago  and onthat issue  too  there is no end in sight.For some reason  the United Nations seems toenjoy operating in decades. We create decades for ourprogrammes  and when we fail to take action in aparticular decade  we simply declare another decade.And so the cycle continues — for decades. This bodycan no longer afford the luxury of “decade syndrome” compounded as it is by bureaucratic operations boundby tradition and habit.We must be extremely proactive on the questionof the revitalization of the General Assembly. SaintLucia therefore wishes to propose that during thissession we review all the draft resolutions before us and determine which need to be consigned to therecord books and which merit the continued attentionof the Assembly. We need to restructure the timeframe  as well as the working methods  of theAssembly and its Main Committees  so as to makemore productive use of an entire year  rather thanengaging in a three-month frenzy of activities.Furthermore  we should consider making the agendasof the Main Committees and the Assembly morerelevant to the general debate. It is our view that theseshould flow from the themes enunciated at the generaldebate.The United Nations must not compromise its rolein global economic governance and development. SaintLucia calls for Members to resist attempts to dilute thedevelopment agenda through cuts and freezes ofregular and core budget allocations.Saint Lucia reiterates the need for reform of thesystem of global economic governance so as to allowfor fair trade and special and differential treatment fordeveloping countries. The current global governancesystem has failed many small States by eliminatingcommodity protocols and the quota and pricepreferences that sustain small economies.Unfortunately  they have been replaced by theconspicuous indifference of neo-liberal economicpractice. This has contributed to the decimation ofmany Caribbean economies. It is Saint Lucia’s earnestplea that the distortions in farm trade about which —despite their prevalence — discussion is conspicuouslyavoided  will be treated in a manner reflective of theredistributive priorities of this Organization. We aretherefore determined that a more inclusive andtransparent global governance system should hold assacred the goals and aspirations of those of us in thedeveloping world who strive against all odds.Among the most vulnerable countries in theworld today are some of the territories that are on theUnited Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.These countries  the majority of which are small islandStates in the Caribbean and the Pacific  have yet toexercise the right to self-determination. In the words ofthe Secretary-General  it is time for the United Nationsto bring to a close this colonial chapter of history.We therefore welcome the cooperation that theSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization hasrecently been receiving from the administering Powersof those Territories and the advances that haveconsequently been made in the work of the Committee.29We further welcome the negotiations that have justbegun  for the first time  between the SpecialCommittee and the United Kingdom on the process ofdecolonization in the Caribbean. We look forward tocontinued cooperation with the administering Powersso that the goal of self-determination for all of theseTerritories can be achieved in less than a decade.We believe that this General Assemblypresidency is both symbolic and strategic — not justfor ourselves  but for this Organization and therevitalization of its development agenda. That a smalldeveloping country should aspire to and attain suchhigh office is a testament to the magnanimity of thisnoble institution. It is an opportunity to demonstratethat global equity and universal democracy remainmeaningful constructs of the world community.Our voice can be ignored or it can be heeded  butit will not be silenced. The choice of an appropriateresponse rests with this community. Our presence here however  is a manifestation of our belief that humanitydemands conscious renewal — renewal to guaranteethat the international community resists war remembers the poor and is prepared to give tangiblemeaning to the Charter  to which we all subscribe asresponsible members of the world community.But there can be no renewal if faith in the UnitedNations system is not also restored and retained. TheUnited Nations must remain as the moral epicentre ofworld politics. Any re-conceptualization of thearchitecture of global governance that excludes theUnited Nations will leave the world weaker  moredivided  vulnerable and less secure. This cannot andshould not be our legacy to future generations  whowill judge us not by our words or espoused principles but by the actions we employ to render this world fitfor human habitation."
"99",4128,"LIE",58,2003,"﻿Let me first paytribute to the commitment and the courage of theSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General  SergioVieira de Mello  and all the United Nations staffmembers who lost their lives in the unprecedentedattack on United Nations headquarters in Baghdad. Thedate of 19 August is engraved in the consciousness ofthe international community and in the annals of theUnited Nations. We were forced to face a fact that wehave not tackled with the necessary determination inthe past: the vulnerability of United Nations staffworldwide. While legal protection can certainly notprevent an attack such as the one of 19 August  wemust nevertheless provide the best possible protectionin this respect. We therefore hope that the GeneralAssembly will take the necessary measures to make the23United Nations Convention on the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel more effective.The process that led to this engagement of theUnited Nations in Iraq constituted a major crisis for theexisting mechanisms dealing with threats tointernational peace and security  first and foremost theSecurity Council. This Organization is subject to anddependent on the political will of its Members. Itsdistinctive quality lies in the fact that it provideslegitimacy in accordance with international law. Thisoutstanding quality it must not lose  and we are allchallenged to stand up for this core function of theUnited Nations  which is a good part of its raison d''trein today's world. The crisis the United Nations hasgone through in connection with the action takenagainst Iraq will not be overcome simply by adopting apragmatic approach in dealing with the aftermaththereof. We welcome the ongoing discussions in theSecurity Council on a stronger and more meaningfulrole of the United Nations in Iraq. At the same time there must also be a recognition that international lawcontinues to be the foundation for our actions indealing with problems of international peace andsecurity and that the rule of law needs to be appliedboth at the national and at the international levels.Like any other State  in particular small States Liechtenstein attaches the highest possible priority tothe rule of international law   expressed  inter alia  inour commitment to the International Criminal Court  and international relations that are based on rulesderived from international legal standards. The UnitedNations  as the core body for drafting and adoptingthose standards  must continue to play its role indefending and upholding them.It is more obvious than ever that the SecurityCouncil is facing a particular challenge in this respect.While discussions in the media  in the academic worldand in think tanks after the military action against Iraqinvariably have focused on the theme of the need forquick and effective Security Council reform  this senseof urgency was lost on the Open-ended Working Groupon Security Council Reform   the very body that hasthe competence to make decisions on such reform.After 10 years of debate on this issue  we all appreciatethe difficulties attached to it  and they are indeed big.However  these difficulties are not sufficientjustification for our failure to resolve an issue thateverybody agrees is a major obstacle to the effectivefunctioning of the Organization as a whole. It wastherefore rather disturbing to see the Open-endedWorking Group continue engaging in business as usual while the world   the world we are supposed torepresent  after all   unanimously called for effectiveand comprehensive reform.The composition of the Council is clearly areflection of a geopolitical reality that ceased to exist along time ago and enlargement thus continues to be anindispensable element of a meaningful reform of theCouncil. At the same time  there is also a clear need toaddress other issues  such as the mechanisms fordecision-making and in particular the implementationof Security Council resolutions   whether adoptedunder Chapter VI or Chapter VII   and issues oflegality. We hope that the initiative the Secretary-General presented last week will contribute to makingthe main organ that is at the centre of the world'sattention a more effective and representative body.While the work on Security Council reform hasbeen slow and unsatisfactory overall  it hasnevertheless produced some important and positiveresults. The Council has opened up to the membershipas a whole and increasingly engaged in open debates both on thematic and on other issues of concern to themembership as a whole. Liechtenstein welcomes thisdevelopment and has participated in many of thosedebates.This increased openness of the Council  however does not resolve the issue of its accountability. Theeffectiveness and credibility of the Council will bemuch enhanced if it bases its decision-making on adialogue with the States on whose behalf it acts. In therecent past  the Council has made some decisions thatwere controversial and others that were ofunprecedented reach. Some of the measures taken inconnection with financial sanctions impact directly onthe lives of individuals who have no means of bringingtheir grievances stemming from such decisions to theattention of the Council. Since the Council makes itsdecisions on behalf of the entire membership and sincetheir implementation is mandatory for all MemberStates  there should be ways for all Member States toexpress the concerns they might have with regard tosuch decisions. The appropriate body for suchdiscussions is obviously the General Assembly  theonly main organ of the organization of universalmembership.24When educating people about the United Nations we keep stumbling upon one issue: The need to explainthat the United Nations is not identical with theSecurity Council. The fact that the Council is seizedwith the most burning issues and the most pressinginternational crises is only one part of the explanationfor this fact. The flip side which we must no longerignore is the increasingly futile struggle of the GeneralAssembly to play its rightful role in accordance withthe Charter of the United Nations. An overburdenedagenda  sterile debates  an overflow of documentationand the routine adoption of resolutions  that are but arehash of past resolutions  have a combined devastatingeffect on the relevance of this body.The General Assembly is today paralysed to apoint that keeps it from dealing with the politicallycrucial issues and from acting in a quick and flexiblemanner. A good illustration is the resolution in whichthe General Assembly condemned the attack on theUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad. Even thougheverybody shared the shock and dismay about thisvicious attack  it took the General Assembly almost amonth to adopt the said resolution.The current state of the Assembly sadly plays intothe hands of its detractors. Presiding over the GeneralAssembly is a very difficult task  Mr. President. If youare able to lead this Assembly out of its establishedroutine of paying lip service to its own reform and ifyou are able to initiate the radical reform this body sodesperately needs  you will have created a lastinglegacy  and we will support you.Much has been said about the crisis in which theUnited Nations finds itself after this difficult year.However  every crisis is an opportunity  and I hope thatthe Assembly will take up its work in this spirit. Veryrarely over the past few years has the public interest inthe United Nations been greater than it has over thepast 12 months. We must ensure that the peoples of theworld continue turning to the United Nations as theplace where established rules are upheld  newchallenges are tackled and effective and responsibleaction is taken collectively."
"100",4175,"LKA",58,2003,"﻿Allow me toextend my congratulations to the President on hisunanimous and well-deserved election as President ofthe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Thisis a difficult period for any person to preside over theGeneral Assembly  and I wish him every success. I alsowish to thank Mr. Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic forhis exemplary work as the outgoing President.Last year  while addressing the GeneralAssembly  I referred to the commencement of the peaceprocess in Sri Lanka and promised to report on itsprogress. Progress in the peace process in Sri Lanka isdue to the fact that we stopped talking about talking toeach other and actually began to talk. We have beenlucky  because the international community did notsimply talk about helping us  it actually did so.In moving from conflict to peace in Sri Lanka weinitiated fundamental change in policy and strategy. Weshifted from confrontation to negotiation  identifyingand recognizing the root causes of the conflict. Thesuccess story that Sri Lanka is fast becoming alsodemonstrates the value of the support of theinternational community acting in concert. That theglobal community  moving with a common purpose can succeed in re-establishing peace  democracy andprosperity has been amply demonstrated in the SriLankan experience. After 20 years of conflict  our peopleare now enjoying the fruits of 20 months of peace.The role of the international community inenabling us to move from war to peace has beenoutstanding. The facilitation provided by Norway hashad the result of bringing the Government and theLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) together inseveral rounds of negotiation. President ChandrikaKumaratunga's continuing declaration of commitmentto a political solution has been invaluable. The moraland material support that our other frontline sponsors  India  the European Union  Japan  Canada and theUnited States  along with the multilateral institutions ofthe United Nations and the rest of the internationalcommunity   have given  and continue to give to us has guaranteed that our efforts to consolidate andmaintain the peace will strengthen and develop.Last November at Oslo  our international partnersendorsed and underwrote a paradigm shift in policywhen the Government and the LTTE accepted that the13future political order in Sri Lanka would includemoving towards a federal polity where the unity andterritorial integrity of the country would be ensured.Again  in June of this year at Tokyo  52 nations and 21multilateral agencies  many of them of the UnitedNations system  pledged their support to Sri Lanka'speace efforts  rehabilitation and developmentprogrammes. The massive and unparalleled financialcontributions alone totalled $4.5 billion over a four-yearperiod. Those are indeed landmark events underlining thevalue and strength of international action.I must  however  inform the Assembly that  likein all negotiations in a peace process  we find ourselvestoday at a temporary impasse in the talks. Within thenext few weeks we should know the results of acomprehensive review undertaken by the LTTE inresponse to our earlier proposals regarding an interimadministrative arrangement for the north and east of ourcountry. That they should take so much time and effortcan be seen as a positive sign. We in turn will lookpositively at the proposals put forward by the LTTE  andwill do everything in our power to keep the peaceprocess moving forward to a successful conclusion.Meanwhile  our collective efforts  which havebeen handsomely supported by the internationalcommunity and multilateral agencies  at providingrelief  rehabilitation and development to the conflict-affected areas of the country are proceeding apace.Economic growth is marching ahead  from a growthrate of -1 per cent in the year 2001 to possibly 6 percent this year. And tourism is booming.That has thus far been the story of Sri Lanka. In therecent past there have indeed also been some successstories in the United Nations: in Haiti  Somalia  Angola Kosovo and East Timor. But they are not enough.The United Nations represents a unique conceptfor international order formulated by the Allied Powersto address challenges to peace and security and todevelopment and democracy in the aftermath of theSecond World War. President Roosevelt  in his 1943Christmas Eve radio talk  said that as long as Britain Russia  China and the United States stuck together indetermination to keep the peace  there was nopossibility of an aggressor nation arising to startanother world war.But the world that the United Nations is calledupon to represent today is an immeasurably changedworld. Today's problems  as the Secretary-General hasreminded us  are problems that respect no borders andno laws. The proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  environmental degradation  alienation andexclusion  conflict  global terrorism  disease and endemicpoverty are foremost among those problems. Inescapably the United Nations remains the central  indispensableforum in which we can collectively and democraticallyrespond to the challenges that we face in common.But the United Nations is under enormous stress.That strain comes from the structure of the Organizationitself. As a result  the adequacy and effectiveness of therules and instruments devised over 50 years ago to bringorder and reason to the post-Second-World-Warinternational scene are being questioned. The apparentirrelevance of the current multilateral rules andinstitutions to deal with the manifold problems of todaycompel our urgent attention. In the words of theSecretary-General  it challenges our ability to dealwith the least difficult issues and to do so effectively'.Hence the rationale for reform   which is insistent compelling and radical   cannot be averted; for wordswithout action are meaningless  as we in Sri Lankahave learned at a bitter cost.Take for example the profound issues surroundingIraq. There are members in the Hall today who believepassionately that the United States and its allies werewrong to intervene in Iraq. Then there are those of uswho feel that the United States and its allies had nochoice but to intervene  that the failure of the UnitedNations had created the need for a world policeman however reluctant it might be. But Iraq is more than adivergence of views on a major issue. It shows theinadequacies of the present collective security system a decision-making system which grappled with theissue of Iraq for over a decade without a solution andcreated a deadlock at a most critical time.The United Nations has already paid a dreadfulprice. The attack on United Nations headquarters inBaghdad not only deprived the world community ofsome of its most devoted and talented servants butraised to the fore issues relating to the mandatesentrusted to the United Nations by its Member States.It represents  undoubtedly  a direct challenge   achallenge which must be met.Any reform must be radical  so that in thischanged world   so different from the one it wascalled upon to serve in 1945   the United Nations canhave the capacity to cope with war  poverty  human rights 14terrorism and a dramatically changed environment inwhich weapons of mass destruction have become sopotent a symbol. We have to move beyond rhetoric andfrom cosmetic change to major surgery if we are toovercome the challenge ahead. Rhetoric is not asubstitute for decisive action. Frantic activity is not asubstitute for concerted action  and the adoption ofresolutions does not make a tangible difference in theday-to-day lives of our peoples. Above all  let us recallthat inaction in itself is a deliberate and a considereddecision to do nothing. We should not rival the Leagueof Nations' impotence on Abyssinia.The problems we are encountering at the presenttime compel us courageously and resolutely to addressand overcome the fundamental inadequacies that afflictour international institutions and processes.This year has seen the propitious coming together ofthree events which have framed thus far the political financial and economic ordering of our world. I refer tothis session of the General Assembly  the gathering of theFinance Ministers at the Bretton Woods institutions and the discussions at Cancun on the reordering of theworld trade regime. At all three meetings  the call forstructural reform was insistent and compelling. Allthree   the United Nations  the Bretton Woods Twinsand the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT)   were born out of the trauma and dislocationof the Second World War. For over 50 years they haveserved our many causes in varying ways  at times withlimited success  at times with despair at their inabilityto effectively deal with the fundamental problems ofthe day. After the Asian crisis  the Bretton Woodinstitutions came under close scrutiny  and today weare discussing how the developing countries can havegreater say in their decision-making.Recent experience under the Doha Round of theWorld Trade Organization (WTO) process at Cancunfurther illustrates the problems that face us. No oneexpected an agreed formula to come out of Cancun. Onthe other hand  it need not have ended in collapse.The Secretary-General's report has identifiedmany of the defects of the system that need to beaddressed. Other speakers  too  have made proposals inthis regard. At this stage  I should like to mention that in our view  any expansion of the Security Council as aresult of reforms must involve a manageable number and Asia must be given its due. This was ignored in1945.While many have urged a radical reform of thestructure of the United Nations so as to make it able torespond to the challenges that confront multilateralismat the present time  most have been hesitant to suggestideas that are both practical and doable. I believe thatthe time has come for all of us who accept in principlethe value of this institution  the United Nations  and theobjective it stands for to think out of the box   tothink creatively  imaginatively and unconventionally.If I were to hazard an approach  it would be alongthe lines of going back to our roots. The outline of theUnited Nations prepared at Dumbarton Oaks in Augustand September 1944 was agreed to at Yalta in February1945 at the level of head of Government. The Charterwas signed at the final meeting in San Francisco  inJune 1945. All this was completed in just 10 months.I  for one  would like to suggest that the Secretary-General and a carefully selected group of political leadersthemselves come up with recommendations for UnitedNations reform. Their recommendations could be placedbefore a special session of the General Assembly  atwhich heads of State or Government would be present.I suggest that the time frame for this need not beany longer than at the inception of the United Nations 58 years ago.In conclusion  let us remind ourselves that 11September was a tragic wake-up call for all of us. The19th of August was a tragic wake-up call for the UnitedNations.We have before us a historic opportunity to builda United Nations worthy of the people whom we havethe honour to represent   a United Nations wherehonesty is not clouded by diplomacy  where realismreplaces rhetoric  and where action supplants treaties."
"101",4217,"LSO",58,2003,"﻿My delegation associatesitself with the compliments expressed to Mr. JulianHunte on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at this session; to his predecessor  Mr. JanKavan of the Czech Republic; and to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan.As we converge upon this city of New York  weare once again reminded of the stark reality of thescourge of terrorism  whose effects have reverberatedacross the world. Earlier this month two years ago  inthis very city  humanity suffered the worst threat evervisited on it by terrorism. We continue to share thegrief of those who will forever miss the love and thesupport of their loved ones. We must therefore reaffirmour resolve to join together in partnership to eliminatethose elements which threaten to destroy humanity andits way of life.Our best hope for success is   and should be  our collective strength. We owe it to ourselves and tofuture generations of humankind to pool our resourcesand strategies to annihilate the scourge of terrorism. Indoing so  we must simultaneously and genuinelyexamine and begin to understand what forces andfactors drive an inherently good human being tocommit such desperate actions and drastic acts ofviolence  in the process committing them not onlyagainst others  but against himself. Our preventivemeasures must address such forces and factors in orderto disarm potential terrorists.The progress report on the implementation of theMillennium Development Goals in Lesotho documentsthat the single greatest obstacle to the development ofour nation   and indeed to reaching the objectives laidout in the Goals   is the scourge of HIV/AIDS. In ourpart of the world  Southern Africa  Governments areoverwhelmed by high levels of morbidity andmortality  especially among the working-age group inall sectors  including health and agriculture. HIV/AIDShas become the leading cause of the food insecurityand famine that plague so many of our people today.We are also frustrated because our efforts toachieve the Millennium Development Goal ofeducation for all by 2015 through the introduction offree primary education is faltering due to the high rateof absenteeism by both teachers and pupils. Teachersare sick and dying. Children   especially girls   aredropping out of school to take care of their sickrelatives. The number of malnourished  traumatized orphaned and out-of-school children is increasing at analarming rate. We therefore stress the need for urgentassistance to Lesotho and the southern African regionand increased supplies of the anti-retroviral and otherrelated HIV and AIDS drugs  in order to curb thescourge. Lesotho and the region also need financial andtechnical resources for training and capacity-buildingin HIV and AIDS programme implementation andmanagement.Lesotho is concerned that the goal of povertyeradication  which is the first Millennium DevelopmentGoal and one of the cross-cutting themes of all majorUnited Nations conferences and summits  could eludethe international community. Indeed  this critical stateof affairs is highlighted in the Economic Report onAfrica  2003  which indicates that in 2002  of the 53countries in Africa  only five achieved the 7 per centgrowth rate required to meet the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  while 43 countries registeredgrowth rates below 7 per cent and five countriesregistered negative growth rates.Against the backdrop of a democratizingcontinent   a precondition set for assistance by thedeveloped North   there is a growing consensus thatthe decline in official development assistance and otherfinancial flows to Africa is increasing the19marginalization of the continent in the global economy.Without new inflows of external resources  the pace ofdevelopment in Africa will forever remain elusive. Mydelegation therefore wishes to reiterate its appeal to thedeveloped countries to fulfil the commitments made atall the major United Nations conferences  as well as atthe Millennium Summit.Furthermore  we wish to stress the need for areview of the list of heavily indebted poor countriesand those on the borderline  so that all poor countriesthat  like Lesotho  face debt servicing difficulties  canbe considered under the enhanced Heavily IndebtedPoor Countries Debt Initiative. My delegation alsoshares the view that debt cancellation for the leastdeveloped countries should be considered as a viableoption so that such countries can inject that money intotheir economies.My delegation reiterates the call for increasedsupport to the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD). We are aware that Iraq todaydominates the world spotlight  as was confirmed inrecent testimony before the Congress of the UnitedStates of America  which was asked to approve $87billion for the rehabilitation of that country. In sharpcontrast  an injection of only about $6 billion intoNEPAD would go a long way towards achieving whatis a continentwide agenda.African leaders need extensive support as theyaddress  inter alia  the root causes of the agriculturalcrises in the continent. For us in Africa  agriculture isthe engine of overall growth  as it is at the very core ofpeople's livelihoods  especially in the rural areas. It islinked to issues of food security and affects growth inother economic sectors.Lesotho is deeply concerned that armed conflictscontinue to hinder economic growth in Africa andelsewhere. We have also been shocked by severalreports of an extreme lack of respect for the basicprinciples of international humanitarian law on the partof parties to armed conflict. Equally regrettable areincidents of egregious violations of the rights ofwomen and children. We therefore commend theUnited Nations for all its efforts aimed at theelimination of human suffering in armed conflict.Indeed  the establishment of the International CriminalTribunals  the birth of the International Criminal Courtand the setting up of the Special Court for SierraLeone  are cause for considerable optimism and provebeyond any doubt that the world has grown weary ofimpunity. It is our fervent hope that Member States willcontinue to provide the necessary support andcooperation to those institutions.Africa hungers for peace. The continent mustnever again have to witness acts of violence andatrocities such as those that were recently committed inthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Liberia. Wehope that the international community will continue tosupport all endeavours aimed at attaining lasting peace security and stability in those countries.My delegation is encouraged by the progress todate to restore law and order in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  including the establishment ofan all-inclusive transitional Government of NationalUnity. The international community must intensify itsefforts to assist millions of Congolese people who arenot only displaced but also facing serious foodshortages. My delegation is confident that  with thenecessary support  the Government of National Unityin the Democratic Republic of the Congo will restorepeace and security in the country and heal the deepwounds caused by war and ethnic hatred. We are alsogratified that the Security Council has mandated aspecial Panel to investigate the plunder of naturalresources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Itis our hope and wish that those responsible will bebrought to book.The people of Angola have peace at last  now thatone of Africa's longest-running fratricidal wars hascome to an end. The scars of war in Angola will remainforever  deeply embedded in the memories of the mostvulnerable of the population   the women andchildren of that country  where motherhood was abusedand children were deprived of their childhood.Reintegration and rehabilitation assistance to Angola therefore  should  in the main  target those groups.The future of Somalia continues to hang in thebalance  despite the efforts by Kenya  the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development  the AfricanUnion and all other stakeholders to put an end to thecarnage in that country. Somalia has been turned into abreeding ground for warlords who have no respect forhuman life but are greedy for power and money. Wetend to agree with those who argue that the deploymentof an international force would help to facilitate thedisarmament  demobilization and reintegration process.20At the end of the day  however  the responsibility forbringing peace and reconciliation to Somalia lies withthe Somalis themselves.Although there have been positive indicators inthe search for a peaceful and acceptable solution to theconflict between Israel and Palestine  we are concernedthat the recent resumption of the cycle of violence willrender the road map for peace futile. The drastic andrepressive measures  the unilateral erection of a walldividing the two  the reoccupation of Palestinian townsand villages  and the targeting of Hamas leaders withthe aim of killing them are all measures which cannothelp the course of peace or ensure that the Palestinianpeople enjoy their inalienable rights  including theright to self-determination in a sovereign andindependent State. In like manner  the continuingsuicide missions by militant groups to kill Israelisindiscriminately cannot  and must not  be condoned orjustified.But then two stark realities must be addressed:first  that the root cause of the problem is the illegaloccupation of Palestinian lands; and secondly  that noone country can be an honest broker in the MiddleEast. History itself positions some countries so muchwith one party to the conflict that they cannot   evenwith the best of intentions   be non-partisan.Consequently  my delegation strongly urges the UnitedNations to take the initiative and to lead the process and thus to lend legitimacy and credibility to the effortsto find an abiding solution.The same goes for the people of Western Sahara.In the civilized world of the twenty-first century  it issimply untenable that we still have colonizers in someparts of the world  in disregard of the widely acceptedprinciples of self-determination and democracy. Theinternational community must intervene so as to bringfinality to the status of the Saharawi Arab DemocraticRepublic. The brotherly people of Sahara have sufferedunduly and long enough.On a positive note  we welcome the lifting ofsanctions against Libya by the Security Council.Nevertheless  it is our contention that the lifting of thesanctions would have been more significant if all themembers of the Security Council had raised their flagsin favour.By the same token  it is now time to collectivelyaddress all issues relating to the unilateral economicblockade against Cuba. It is simply untenable for theUnited Nations to look on helplessly when a MemberState strangles another Member State of this body simply because it holds or practices different economicphilosophies or political viewpoints. Those truths mustbe confronted and discussed in honesty and withoutmalice towards anyone. Otherwise  our credibility andour raison d''tre are called into question.In conclusion  I wish to refer to the question ofthe reform of the Security Council. It is now a trite factthat the credibility of the United Nations   includingits adherence to multilateralism   is being openlyquestioned. It will take a lot of work to change thatperception on the part of many  especially in thedeveloping world. The Secretary-General  Mr. Annan has on several occasions stressed the need for radicalreform to restore United Nations credibility. Wetherefore applaud the statement that he made beforethis body yesterday that he intends to establish a high-level panel of eminent persons to look into thechallenges to peace  security and other global issues. Itis our hope that the recommendations of that panel willpave the way to a better international order.It has been almost 10 years since theestablishment of an open-ended working group to studyall questions relating to equitable representation in theSecurity Council  including increasing the membershipof the Council. My delegation is of the view that thereis an urgent need to accelerate the pace and to redoubleour efforts to bring this matter to a conclusion. Let usface it: the very concept and practice of a veto in theSecurity Council is simply untenable and is totally atvariance with the democratic principles of our moderntimes. For one member with a veto to overrule 14others is simply undemocratic. It is patently unjust andcontrary to every principle underpinning fair play andworld order. My delegation cannot   in all honestyand without malice to anyone   understand how andwhy leading champions of democracy can cling sodesperately to such an outmoded  primitive and unjustsystem. The same sacred convictions  truths and beliefsthat guided and forced our forbears to abolish slavery to declare racism and genocide crimes againsthumanity and to preach and uphold the equality of allhumans must of necessity guide us in this instance.Otherwise  history will judge and chastise usseverely   but justifiably   as dishonest. Such is thenaked truth staring us in the face."
"102",4243,"LTU",58,2003,"﻿I would like first of allto express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Jan Kavan forhis work as President of the General Assembly at itsprevious session. We appreciate the knowledge andskilful leadership of the current President  Mr. Julian R.Hunte of Saint Lucia  and wish him a year ofconstructive dialogue and cooperation.This year was one of shocking news and humantragedy. We lost a noble man and a distinguisheddiplomat  our friend Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  andmany others who happened to be on duty at the UnitedNations premises on that tragic day in Baghdad. Morerecently  we paid a final tribute to Ms. Anna Lindh  thelate Swedish Foreign Minister and our good friend who fell victim to another act of human insanity. Wegrieve for those lost  but we also remember their workand unfinished missions.Iraq is one such example of unfinished business.The restoration of sovereignty and the implementationof a political process leading to the establishment of afully representative Government through democraticelections is our primary goal. State-building  however is not an overnight process. Only through coordinatedeffort and close international cooperation can weexpect to rebuild a free and peaceful Iraq. The UnitedNations  with its unique experience and legitimacy  isessential to efforts to help the Iraqi people recover theirsovereignty. In Iraq  the first signs of recovery arealready visible  as demonstrated by the appointment ofa Governing Council and the formation of apreparatory constitutional committee. These positivedevelopments should be supported and encouraged.Thus we look forward to the forthcoming Madridconference  which will address many issues importantto Iraq’s future. International support is indispensable and sometimes even critical  to people coping with thelegacy of a fallen dictatorship.The current setbacks in the conflict betweenIsrael and the Palestinians must not prevent theimplementation of the road map. The vision of twoStates living side by side in peace and prosperityremains the only viable option.The real strength of our power as an internationalcommunity continues to lie in our resolve to dealcollectively with critical issues. The recent report ofthe Secretary-General posed hard questions. We needto find consensus on the conceptual and politicalframework for the operation of the United Nations in15the coming decades. Lithuania firmly supports theUnited Nations as it pursues the goals enshrined in theUnited Nations Charter. We share the view that themultilateral institutions must be updated andreinforced. It is absolutely essential that the UnitedNations and its principal organs be seen as relevant andeffective. Lithuania is ready to contribute to the goal ofbuilding an international order based on effectivemultilateral institutions and on the fundamental goalsof the United Nations Charter.Lasting peace is our collective responsibility. TheSecurity Council must be able to take a leadership rolein maintaining international peace and security. ThusLithuania supports substantial reform to ensure a betterand more equitable representation in both categories permanent and non-permanent  through the inclusion ofGermany and Japan  as well as certain other leadingcountries from other regions.Lithuania welcomes the intention of theSecretary-General to establish a high-level panel ofeminent personalities to address responses to currentchallenges. The European Convention  which preparedthe draft European Constitution  is a good example ofhow such fundamental policy questions could be dealtwith.Regrettably  terrorism and the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction and their means ofdelivery continue to be on the list of our chief securityconcerns. The Thessaloniki European CouncilDeclaration on the Non-Proliferation of Weapons ofMass Destruction  and the European Union’s (EU)basic principles and action plan against theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction are well-defined responses. Lithuania associates itself with themand will contribute to their implementation. I shouldalso like to recall the Hague Code of Conduct AgainstBallistic Missile Proliferation  which is yet anotherresult of multilateral efforts and is worthy of globaluniversalization.Global stability also requires regional efforts. Inthis context  I would like to note with satisfaction thatnext year Lithuania and other Central and EasternEuropean countries will join the EU and NATO  thusexpanding the zone of stability and democracy inEurope. Moreover  our accession will have animportant positive effect on the nations at the newborders of the EU and NATO. Lithuania is determinedto continue its good-neighbourly policies and todevelop closer relations with its new EU neighbours. Ishould also like to draw attention to Baltic-Caucasusregional cooperation  which is already developing anumber of successful initiatives.We are witnessing the willingness to adopt moreeffective measures to combat terrorism and weapons ofmass destruction. Invariably  more conventionalchallenges can be dealt with by transparency andconfidence-building activities. As a new State party tothe Ottawa Convention  Lithuania is committed tocontributing practically to its implementation andpromotion. We feel that it is increasingly important tofacilitate regional dialogue and action that contributesto the abolition of anti-personnel mines and theclearing up of old unexploded ordnance. We havealready started working with interested parties in thatrespect.Democracy  the rule of law and respect for humanrights and fundamental freedoms are undoubtedly themost important in our system of values. In view of theprocess of globalization  securing this system is a greatchallenge. Such global afflictions as poverty  hunger unsustainable development  disastrous massivepandemics and grave violations of human rights raisebefore us the vital task of standing together in order tosecure the future of our children.Stable conditions for peace cannot be createdwithout addressing poverty and eradicating socialexclusion. We should  therefore  put all our effortstowards achieving the goals that we agreed to in theMillennium Declaration. Lithuania  as a future memberof the European Union  is also assuming itsresponsibilities as an emerging donor in this regard."
"103",4287,"LUX",58,2003,"﻿Ms. Lydie Polfer  Deputy Prime Minister and Ministerfor Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg  regrets that she isnot able to speak to the Assembly today and has askedme to do so in her place.The current President of the European Union  Mr.Silvio Berlusconi  has already presented to theAssembly the priorities and positions of the EuropeanUnion  which Luxembourg supports with conviction.The United Nations remains in mourningfollowing the cowardly and inhuman attack of 19August 2003 against United Nations headquarters inBaghdad  which took the lives of 22 persons — most ofwhom were United Nations personnel — including thatof Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  Special Representativeof the Secretary-General. Today our thoughts are withthose victims  who  day after day  through their work inthe service of the Organization  helped to make theworld a better place.As was recently noted by the Secretary-General that heinous act raises important questions  because itis“a direct challenge to the vision of worldsolidarity and of collective security rooted in theCharter and articulated in the MillenniumDeclaration”. (A/58/323  chapter I  para. 2)It is our responsibility  as representatives of thenations of the world  gathered here at the fifty-eighthsession of the General Assembly  to meet this challengeand to try to provide constructive answers that openprospects for the future.A few months ago  the Minister for ForeignAffairs  Ms. Lydie Polfer  presented to the LuxembourgParliament her foreign policy declaration in a contextcharacterized by the deep divisions in the internationalcommunity that marked the international situation atthe beginning of this year. At that time  Ms. Polferelaborated on these thoughts  which also define theoverall approach of the Luxembourg Government tomultilateral cooperation.“During the debates on Iraq  all sidesextensively debated the role and the credibility ofour shared institutions. Have they shown theirlimits? Have they ceased to function? Are theystill adapted to our day and age? Ismultilateralism still relevant today? I would liketo give a clear answer to this question. Yes  morethan ever  we need multilateral bodies that allowus to work together so that international law canbe established and respected  with internationalrules and procedures that ensure respect forhuman rights and that govern the lives of allStates  regardless of their size. This is not justwishful thinking  but something that is in ourinterest.“We must not only assist in the developmentof these institutions  but also participate activelyin strengthening them through committed andconstructive cooperation. The United Nations is of course  the primary forum for such cooperationto take place”.But while we believe that multilateral cooperationremains the best way of dealing with the many currentinternational issues  we must  however  reflect on waysand means of adapting such cooperation to theevolution of our world  with a view to defining a newmultilateralism for the twenty-first century and torethinking the conditions of a new kind of globalgovernance. In this context  the MillenniumDeclaration charts a steady course that will enable us tomobilize the international community to take action ona number of specific  quantifiable objectives.Among recent advances  I would like to highlightin particular the achievements registered at the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly under theleadership of President Kavan; we commend theinnovative work he did during his presidency of theGeneral Assembly. We wish also to stress the processof reflection that was inspired by the Brahimi report onpeacekeeping operations.Much work remains to be done  however. Thetwo recent reports of the Secretary-General on theimplementation of the United Nations MillenniumDeclaration and on the strengthening of the UnitedNations provide them with both an analytical20framework and an operational plan of action of vitalimportance. We must provide them with concretefollow-up.The United Nations must remain the premierinstitution for meeting the challenges facinghumankind and for finding shared solutions. To quotethe expressive words of Kofi Annan “The challenge ahead is to strengthen ourcapacity for collective action and thus forge acommon destiny in a time of accelerating globalchange”. (A/57/387  chapter I  para. 2)We must reaffirm the status of international lawwhile developing it to take account of new situationsand contexts. We are doing this successfully in thefields of the protection of human rights  the fightagainst terrorism  the environment  and in other fields.The inception of the International Criminal Court(ICC) is a major stage  which we welcome. We hopethat it will soon begin work on the full range of itsactivities  in accordance with the terms of its Statute.We appeal to all Members of our Organization toaccede to the Rome Statute in order to give the ICC theuniversality that will enable it to fight impunity for thegravest of crimes. We must continue  withdetermination and courage  efforts to reform andrevitalize our institutions. Much has already been done thanks in particular to the efforts of our Secretary-General regarding the Secretariat  whose structureshave been modernized and whose procedures havebeen rationalized  though work must continue particularly in the financial  budgetary andmanagement areas.Last week  the Secretary-General rightly drew ourattention to the vital renewal of the intergovernmentalbodies of our Organization — be it the SecurityCouncil  the General Assembly or the Economic andSocial Council. With respect to the General Assemblyin particular  our President — whom I wish warmly tocongratulate on his election to his important post —undertook a certain number of initiatives aimed atrevitalizing our annual session  in order to give it onceagain the central place it should occupy as the primaryvenue for meetings  debates and stock-taking. I wish toassure the President that Luxembourg — which holds avice-presidency of the General Assembly — will fullysupport his endeavours.The ability to work with updated methods on astreamlined agenda that focuses on the real needs ofour day seems to us to be a prerequisite for theincreased presence and greater relevance of the GeneralAssembly in international debates.Important progress has already been made in theareas of peacekeeping and peace-building. Thepresentation in 2000 of the Brahimi report launched anintensive process of reflection and debate  and led to anumber of crucial decisions aimed at more effectivemanagement of peacekeeping operations. The adoptionof Security Council resolution 1327 (2000) and theAssembly’s adoption on 3 July 2003 of resolution57/337  “Prevention of armed conflict”  constitutedparticularly significant events  which we welcome  justas we support their practical implementation.While the debate has developed considerably politically and conceptually  we must emphasize theadmirable work carried out by the United Nations inthe field  in often difficult conditions. It should berecalled that today our Organization is managing 15peacekeeping operations throughout the world mobilizing approximately 40 000 Blue Helmets andcivilian staff. We can rightly be proud of this  withoutbeing complacent. The missions in Timor-Leste Kosovo and Sierra Leone have shown the decisiveimpact that the United Nations can have when it has aclear mandate and adequate resources.Here again  much remains to be done. Thedifficult situations that persist in countries such asAfghanistan  Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia and in the GreatLakes region  not to mention the “forgotten conflicts” continue to demand greater attention by theinternational community. By contributing to the sharedeffort  particularly in Kosovo and Afghanistan Luxembourg has shown its readiness to assume itsshare of responsibility in this regard.Special attention should be given in the future tothe problem of the transition from intervention inemergencies and crisis situations to the handling ofpost-conflict contexts. Integrating all dimensions particularly the political  humanitarian  security andeconomic  in a single approach  perfecting theinstruments and methodologies adapted to this type ofchallenge  seems to us to be an urgent and necessarytask.The Government of Luxembourg is convincedthat the noble task of preserving peace must be based21on a broad and complex concept of security. Newthreats have been added to the dangers of traditionalmilitary confrontation. At the forefront of those threatsare terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction.Two years after the deadly attacks of 11September  which touched the entire world  we can seethat great progress has been made in the fight againstterrorism. A firm position of principle and amultidisciplinary approach remain indispensable inorder to combat and stop this widespread anddestructive phenomenon. Luxembourg will play its fullpart in this effort  which must be pursued tirelessly with our Organization playing a major role.The danger of the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction continues to arouse the legitimateconcern of our peoples. World leaders have aresponsibility to confront this serious threat to peaceand security by establishing and strengthening thenecessary international regimes. For its part  theEuropean Union has decided  on the basis of theEuropean Council’s Thessaloniki Declaration  todevelop a long-term strategy against proliferation  andhas already adopted basic principles and a concreteplan of action to give shape to this strategy.Likewise  international arms limitation andreduction efforts  particularly with regard to smallarms  must be continued and broadened.But  given the immediate and tragic urgency ofviolent conflicts and terrorist attacks  we must not losesight of a more structural cause of global instabilityand insecurity: the persistence of poverty andunderdevelopment. In a world in which every yearalmost 15 million children under the age of 5 die of theeffects of poverty  we must continue unabated our fightfor development. The Millennium Declaration  theconclusions of the Johannesburg Summit and theMonterrey Consensus have shown us the way and theobjectives to be achieved in order to establish a realglobal partnership for development.The dimensions of this basic problem are manyand interdependent. I shall cite just three.The first dimension is the fight againstHIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis  in whichLuxembourg is strongly involved and which was quiterightly the focus of attention at the high-level debatethat opened this session of the General Assembly. Thesecond is international trade. The failure of the FifthWorld Trade Organization Ministerial Conference inCancún is undeniably a major disappointment. If wewant to achieve a balanced and more just trade system it is imperative that we resume the dialogue on theobjectives to be achieved and the way to achieve them.The third dimension is financing for development which  according to the Secretary-General’s report onthe follow-up to the outcome of the MillenniumSummit  remains “well below the level needed to meetthe Goals” (A/58/323  para. 49)  even though we arepleased at a recent rise in the volume of officialdevelopment assistance. For its part  my country isparticipating in this global solidarity effort by devotingover 0.8 per cent of its gross national product toofficial development assistance  with a view toachieving the target of 1 per cent about midwaythrough the decade.While development remains the new name ofpeace  we must not lose sight of other factors ofinstability  such as ecological problems  new infectiousdiseases  transnational crime and corruption  and lastly  grave and repeated violations of human rightsand threats to democracy and good governance.Let us not forget  in that regard  the wise words ofMr. Annan  who has written:“Greater respect for human rights  along withdemocracy and social justice  will  in the longterm  be the most effective prophylactic againstterror”. (ibid  para. 76)Given these multiple threats  defining aprogramme of shared security on a global scale  withinmultilateral bodies  is a primary objective. TheEuropean Union  an international actor deeply involvedin a vast process of enlargement and constitutionaldevelopment  has begun the discussion of a strategicconcept of security and defence  which will make amajor contribution to the international debate in thisregard.For more than a year  international attention hasbeen focused once again on the situation in Iraq. Thereis no need to go over again before this audience thesequence of events that led last spring to the onset ofwar in that afflicted part of the world. We all rememberthe deep divisions that emerged in the internationalcommunity during that period  threatening to upset thevery foundations of our Organization. Regardless of thestand that we may have taken individually regarding22these events  we must now look to the future todetermine the prospects of a better future for the Iraqipeople. That is the objective that should bring ustogether now.We are convinced that the United Nations mustplay a central role here  on the basis of a clear andsubstantial mandate accompanied by adequateresources. While it is primarily up to the Iraqi people todecide their own future  we all agree that sovereigntyshould be transferred to the Iraqis themselves as soonas possible.In the phase of political  socio-economic anddiplomatic transition and reconstruction  there mustquickly begin a steady transfer of authority andresponsibility to legitimate institutions recognized bythe Iraqi people. That process must include the draftingand adoption of a new constitution  and the holding  assoon as the situation allows  of free  democraticelections. Among the essentials for this are therestoration of basic living conditions and security inthe daily lives of Iraqis  reconstruction of the basicinfrastructure and a rapid relaunching of economicactivity.The Security Council and its members bear theprimary responsibility  but the emergence of anindependent  democratic  prosperous and peaceful Iraqis in the common interest of all Members of ourOrganization. Together with its European Unionpartners  the Government of Luxembourg remainsconfident that through a broad mobilization theinternational community will be able to make adecisive contribution to this objective.Year after year  the General Assembly mustaddress the situation in the Middle East  particularlythe Israeli-Palestinian conflict  because progresstowards a just and lasting peace remains difficult. Evenfaced with a resumption of tension and repeated acts ofviolence and terrorism  which we emphatically reject we have a duty and responsibility to persevere in thesearch for solutions that will enable reconciliationamong the States and peoples of the region. The searchfor peace must be tireless. The European Unionremains prepared and determined to play its role especially through its action in the Quartet. We remainconvinced that the course charted by the road mapremains the right way to break the current impasse. Butall players who are directly involved must display goodwill and good faith in re-launching the peace processby creating the indispensable conditions of confidenceand security. That is the urgent appeal that we make tothem  that is the urgent task that we must undertake.In the face of wars and violent conflict  in theface of new threats  in the face of violations of humanrights  in the face of poverty and underdevelopment the law and multilateralism are an often fragile butirreplaceable recourse for nations. While we must tryvigorously to remedy the weaknesses andinsufficiencies in multilateral cooperation  it remains asource of hope for the men and women of the entireworld. This is a hope that we must not betray  this isthe primary responsibility that is ours at this fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly."
"104",4313,"LVA",58,2003,"﻿I would like to beginby extending Latvia’s heartfelt congratulations toMr. Julian Hunte on his appointment as President of theUnited Nations General Assembly. Latvia highly valueshis extensive experience and is confident that he willsucceed in his efforts to hasten the pace of reformswithin the Assembly. I am pleased that a broadconsensus on the main goals of these reforms wasachieved during the previous session  and I wish himsuccess in his responsible duties.Three days ago  the people of Latvia made ahistorical decision that will influence their country’scourse of development over the next foreseeabledecades  or even centuries. On 20 September 2003  thepeople of Latvia decided  in a referendum  to join theEuropean Union. In voting for accession to thisinfluential body of free and democratic nations  mycountry became the last of 10 candidate States toconfirm its commitment to a strong and united Europeand to the extension of a growing family of secure andprosperous nations.It is our hope that this extended Union of 25member States will serve not only to promote thewelfare of its citizens  but also to become an even moresignificant contributor to international stability andworldwide prosperity. The European Union is alreadythe world’s largest provider of development assistanceand Latvia looks forward to undertaking theresponsibilities and commitments that this entails. Thisincludes taking an active part in the formulation ofpriorities to ensure that the assistance provided by theEuropean Union reaches those who need it most.Latvia and her Baltic neighbours reappeared onthe international stage only twelve short years ago following half a century of totalitarian rule under NaziGermany and Soviet Russia. Our success story ofrebirth and renewal testifies to the fact that throughhard work and dedicated effort the re-establishment ofdemocratic societies and functioning market economiescan be realized within a relatively short period of time.Many other nations in transition are nowundertaking similar paths of development and reform.Latvia is already sharing its experiences with other2developing countries  and will continue to do so in thefuture.Twelve years ago  when Latvia became a memberof the United Nations  the Soviet Union was in theprocess of breaking up and the Cold War was comingto an end. As the threat of a nuclear conflagrationbetween two mutually hostile superpowers receded new challenges to world security were coming to thefore  and older ones were showing no sign of goingaway.Perhaps humanity’s greatest problem lies in itspropensity for violence  which manifests itself in alllevels of society  starting with the abusive individual inthe family household and ending in armed conflict inthe international arena. Even peaceful countries withlengthy traditions of non-intervention and domestictranquillity are finding themselves faced with tragicacts of senseless violence that include the beating andkilling of immigrants and political assassinations.The unrest and turmoil in the Middle East  whichhas lasted for well over five decades  shows no sign ofabating and can only come to an end once violence isfirmly forsaken as a means for obtaining political ends.Latvia views the road map for peace  which foresees afree and secure State of Israel living in peace alongsidean independent Palestinian State as the only feasiblemeans for ending the dangerous impasse that both sideshave now reached. The alternative is a continuingescalation of bloodshed  a never-ending cycle of killingand mounting mutual hostility.Latvia is ready to promote the establishment of alasting peace in the region  under the auspices of boththe United Nations and the European Union. Weencourage the interested parties to do everything withintheir means to de-escalate tensions and put the peaceprocess back on track.The establishment of a genuine and lasting peacebetween the Israelis and the Palestinians would alsohave an additional benefit. It would remove thePalestinian cause as an excuse for terrorists to justifytheir actions of murder and destruction. As the eventsof the last few years so poignantly reveal  terrorism andarms proliferation have become two of the largestthreats to world security today.Currently  the international community is deeplydivided about the ethics and feasibility ofimplementing direct military action againstGovernments that are deemed to support and sponsorterrorism. In the case of Afghanistan and Iraq  whereundeniably repressive regimes were removed by forcethrough outside intervention  the military measuresundertaken by the United States and its allies will haveto be followed by comprehensive international effortsto help those countries rebuild their societies and theireconomies. I am certain that most of us would agree onthe need for reconstruction and security regardless ofour opinion about the foreign military presence in thesetwo countries.Within the limited means at its disposal  Latviahas sent humanitarian assistance and military medicalpersonnel to Afghanistan and has dispatched a militarycontingent to help maintain order in post-war Iraq.As we collectively seek to avoid a clash ofcivilizations between different societies in the world so we must seek to reduce the growing discrepanciesbetween the rich and the poor. Poverty afflicts everysingle member country of the United Nations. Aboutthree billion people  or half the world’s population struggle to subsist on the equivalent of less than twodollars a day. Seventy per cent of the world’s poorestpeople live in rural areas and depend on agriculture fortheir subsistence. The Millennium Goal of reducingpoverty and of halving the proportion of people earningless than one dollar a day can be achieved only byimproving the plight of poor farmers and creatingviable agricultural communities. Poor farmers indeveloping countries cannot compete with productssubsidized by the treasuries of the world’s richestcountries.At this month’s World Trade Organization (WTO)Ministerial Conference in Cancún  Mexico  UnitedNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the WTOmember States to say no to trade policies thataggravate poverty and to say yes to bold and sensiblesteps that will revive the global economy and set thenew course for development.Poverty also provides fertile ground for modern-day slavery and the trafficking of humans  whichcontinues to occur in nearly all regions of the globe. Atthe beginning of the twenty-first century  an estimated27 million people are still being bought  sold  heldcaptive  brutalized and exploited for profit. Togetherwith non-governmental organizations that are workingto stop slavery  and through international organizations3such as the United Nations  our Governments musthelp those slaves break free from their chains.We all live in a world where such deadly diseasesas HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria and  lately  SARS to name a few  know no borders. It is only through thecontinued vigilance of our countries’ health officialsand through close international cooperation that wewill ever be able to keep those mortal dangers in check.I hope that yesterday’s AIDS conference hasstrengthened the resolve and confidence of participantsto overcome this great affliction.The Government of Latvia is actively pursuing itscommitments under the Millennium Declaration toattain the Millennium Development Goals. Forexample  it has prepared a national action plan toaddress the needs of children in consultation with localauthorities  non-governmental organizations and thechildren themselves. In cooperation with the UnitedNations Development Programme office in Riga  it hasalso established a working group that is devotingparticular attention to the reduction of child mortalityand the improvement of mothers’ health.During the twentieth century  mankind inflictedmore environmental damage on our planet than duringall of the previous centuries combined. If we do notdevote greater efforts to reducing environmentalpollution  including greenhouse gas emissions  thenfuture generations stand to inherit a planet withincreasingly destructive climate change and with aforest cover that is restricted to scattered naturereserves. We must avoid reaching the stage at whichthe Earth’s energy and food resources becomeirreversibly depleted. People and Governments must bewilling to make difficult economic sacrifices for thesake of a cleaner environment.Since its foundation in 1945  the United Nationshas seen the number of its Member States increasealmost fourfold. It has seen European colonialism  theCold War and apartheid come to an end. It hassuccessfully brokered the cessation of hostilities inCyprus  East Timor and other countries. It has providedtrillions of dollars of development assistance tonumerous countries. Latvia believes that the UnitedNations should remain the principal world body for themediation of international disputes and for theformulation of universal rules of conduct that all abideby.However  the United Nations has also beencriticized for being slow  unwieldy and ineffectual.Few would disagree that it has reached a point wherechanges within its structure are required so that it caneffectively deal with the new challenges of the twenty-first century. Let us recall that a working group on thereform of the Security Council was created already tenyears ago  shortly after the collapse of the bipolarworld that had dominated international relations fordecades. At that time there were hopes that anunprecedented degree of unity might be reached withinthe United Nations community. For the moment however  it appears that any substantial changes withinthe United Nations will have to await a renewedclimate of consensus  which is not likely to precede theresolution of the crisis in the Middle East  the settlingof trade disputes and the establishment of greater unityabout agricultural subsidies  arms proliferation andenvironmental issues.Latvia firmly believes in the universal ideals thatthis Organization embodies and is ready  within thelimited means at its disposal  to contribute to theirrealization. The United Nations presents our 191Member States with the unique opportunity to worktogether for the benefit of humanity. Let us hope thatour efforts will be coordinated and constructive  so thatwe may make the twenty-first century one of security peace  and continued development."
"105",4360,"MAR",58,2003,"﻿I would like first of all to congratulate you Sir  on being unanimously elected to chair the fifty-eighth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly. On behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco andof the Group of 77 and China  I wish to assure you ofour full support for making a success of this importantsession.Realizing what a delicate phase our Organizationis going through  many heads of State and Governmenthave accepted the invitation extended to them byMr. Kofi Annan  the United Nations Secretary-General.I should like to take this opportunity to express myappreciation to him  once again  for the relentlessefforts he is making to shore up the efficiency of theOrganization.This is an emotionally charged moment for me  asI stand on this prestigious rostrum and recall the appealand initiatives launched by my late grandfather andfather  Their Majesties King Mohammed V and KingHassan II  urging concerted action by the internationalcommunity to speed up decolonization  especially inthe Arab Maghreb and on the African continent  and touphold the principles of peace  coexistence  opennessand tolerance.What we have done  at the international level  hasalways been guided by the same ideals that inspired thefounders of our Organization. It seeks to contribute tothe significant cultural accomplishments made bymankind thanks to this institution  to preserve humandignity  and to ensure equality in rights andobligations  not only between men and women  but alsoamong nations  large and small  in full respect ofinternational legality  and in a spirit of freedom andsolidarity.30We certainly value the positive and concreteachievements of the Organization. However  in keepingwith our firm commitment to its noble mission  we askourselves: to what extent has the Organizationmanaged to make peace prevail and to contributesignificantly to sustainable development and to thesettlement of conflicts arising  more often than not from colonization  which tore apart entire peoples andnations  especially across our African continent?Moreover  I should like to assure our brothers andsisters from African States of Morocco's constant andunwavering solidarity as well as of its determination tofurther expand cooperation with them on political economic  social and security matters and to supportconstructive African initiatives. In that context  theinternational community is called upon to providetangible support to the African strategy  the NewPartnership for Africa's Development  which targetsthe sustainable development of the African continent mostly through interaction on the part of itssubregional entities.The Millennium Declaration marked a turningpoint in carrying out the mission unanimouslyentrusted to the United Nations in the area ofsustainable development. Indeed  for the first time heads of State and Government agreed on specificobjectives and targets in the social  economic andeducational fields up to the year 2015. As early asJanuary this year  I made a point of assigning to theChair of the Group of 77 and China the priority task ofensuring follow-up to those commitments andmonitoring their integrated implementation. On ourGroup's initiative  the General Assembly unanimouslyadopted a resolution to that effect last June  pending aglobal assessment in 2005.Although the Group of 77 and China has soughtto keep development issues high on the Organization'sagenda  one must admit that the main thrust of ourefforts has focused on the serious threats posed toworld peace in the Middle East region. Despite theefforts undertaken for the settlement of the Palestinianquestion   whether by the United Nations or by theinternational Quartet  through the road map   thelogic of violence and intransigence continues tohamper the restoration of peace. The sufferings deprivations and injustices endured daily by thebrotherly Palestinian people call for strongercommitment on the part of the international communityto achieving irreversible implementation of the roadmap.As Chairman of the al-Quds Committee  I wish tosay that I am fully prepared to help to find a just andfinal solution leading to the establishment of a viablePalestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital living side by side with the State of Israel  in a just comprehensive and lasting peace. With the settlementof that issue   which is contingent upon thewithdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arabterritories   the region will regain its original status asa land of religious and cultural coexistence.Similarly  Morocco calls for concertedinternational action that would enable the brotherlyIraqi people to live in security  stability and freedomand to rebuild their country  while ensuring that theirchoices are fully respected and that their State'ssovereignty  national unity and territorial integrity arepreserved.The Mediterranean region is particularly affectedby the crises I have just mentioned. We thereforebelieve that the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue is anelement that is key for the region's stability  securityand development. In that context  the Kingdom ofMorocco has made the strategic choice of opting forthe construction of the Arab Maghreb as a regionwhere peace and development may be fostered for thebenefit of its members  where there must be notendency towards balkanization and where thefundamental national attributes of each Member Stateare fully respected.The Kingdom of Morocco  guided by thatMaghreban ideal and committed to safeguarding itsgood-neighbourly relations  has agreed to ease thetension fomented on its borders and is endeavouring inall good faith to find an international consensus on theissue of the Moroccan Sahara. The attempts that havebeen made thus far to reach a solution show that theonly way to resolve the issue once and for all is tocome up with a realistic and final political solution inkeeping with democratic principles  while fullyrespecting the Kingdom of Morocco's sovereignty andterritorial integrity  as the United Nations itselfrecommended in June 2001. In that connection  Ishould like once more to officially proclaim Morocco'spledge to cooperate with the United Nations to bringabout such a political solution.31Ever since the tragic events of 11 September  theinternational community has been involved in aresolute fight against international terrorism  whichposes a threat to mankind's most sacred values. LastMay  the Moroccan nation was itself the target of theodious plague of terrorism in a desperate attempt tochallenge the democratic model that Morocco haschosen and to undermine its strong commitment to thevalues of freedom  tolerance and openness. We shouldtherefore like to insist on the need for intensifiedinternational cooperation to eradicate this scourge.Here  I should like to strongly denounce theconfusion deliberately created by those whopersistently associate terrorism with Islam  thuschoosing to ignore the fact that Islam advocates peaceand respect for human life and flatly rejects injusticeand aggression.The United Nations system is now confrontedwith a deeply troubled international environment andfaces new and major challenges. If the United Nationsis to play its role as the sole regulator of relationsbetween and among States  it is imperative that werestore to the concept of universalism its originalmeaning: the obligation shared by all to comply withthe same ethics and rules of law and with effectivesolidarity among all peoples and nations. To attain thatobjective  mankind must find new reasons to rekindlehope. We must also have faith and confidence in theUnited Nations to help it recover its standing and itseffectiveness. Let us therefore make a common pledgeto build up its resources and to strengthen its action.The Assembly may count on the help and support ofthe King of Morocco so that  together  we may build asafer  more equitable and more humane world."
"106",4384,"MCO",58,2003,"﻿Letme first congratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. Your election is welcome testimony of theequal sovereignty of States  a principle to which thedelegation of the Principality of Monaco attachesparticular importance. I assure you and the members of12 the Bureau of our support for your high mission at theservice of the international community.I also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General:all are aware of his tireless efforts to promote withcourage and lucidity the ideals our Organizationembodies as it faces the challenges of our time. Thetragic circumstances surrounding the heinous attackperpetrated in Baghdad last month call for us to payspecial tribute to all United Nations personnel andsalute with respect and sorrow the memory of those including Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and hiscompanions  who by sacrificing their lives  havedemonstrated the strength and grandeur of commitmentto the values that only our Organization canlegitimately embody.When it joined the United Nations ten years ago the Principality of Monaco pledged to fully abide bythe obligations incumbent on all Member States and toparticipate  according to our means  in the promotionof the values that bring us together. We are all the moreattached to that commitment because it is particularlyimportant for small States such as Monaco that all arebound by the same rules in their international conductand that all enjoy equal dignity and the equal right torespect.Of course  there is a considerable and at timesglaring divergence between the ambitions we collectivelyespouse and the actual situations we observe around us which unfortunately afflict so many among us.Assuredly  it would be pointless to ignore the profounddifferences that may exist between States in terms ofboth their characteristics and their influence ininternational affairs. But it is essential that we have aplace  a forum in which we are all compelled to judge ouractions and conduct by the principles that are supposed toguide our actions and in which we are compelled toexamine our conscience — in short  a place where we  asmembers of the international community  are heldaccountable to the collective demands of that community.That is why it is so important that we strive tomake the Organization more effective so that respectfor our principles and purposes prevails over theseeming ease of self-justification and so that acollective approach based on dialogue prevails overunilateral action. As a question of principle and as aresult of reasoning  the Principality of Monacotherefore supports all initiatives aimed at strengtheningour collective mechanisms  in particular thoseundertaken by the Secretary-General pursuant to theMillennium Declaration as presented at the opening ofthe present session.Accordingly  the Principality of Monaco attachesparticular importance to the effective implementationof the General Assembly resolution on the follow-up tooutcomes of the major United Nations conferences andsummits in the economic and social fields. Indeed what purpose would be served by these enormousgatherings in which all participants vie to demonstratetheir magnanimity and generosity if the resultingcommitments are not followed up on or lack the meansto monitor their implementation? The authority of theUnited Nations and the confidence placed in it wouldbe diminished  even as the Organization hasconsiderably expanded the range of its activities inorder to effectively tackle the problems of our time acting from the global perspective of its own ongoingresponsibility to ensure peace  security anddevelopment. Would civil society  which today ispresent in all the debates that involve it  not feelfrustrated and seek to take the lead on its own terms creating an environment of confrontation?While participating in the many activities pursuedwithin the Organization  a small country such as thePrincipality of Monaco must reasonably assess the sizeof the contribution it is able to make to the action ofthe international community. Thus  we have focusedour efforts in the areas of sustainable development andhumanitarian action because we feel that our acquiredexperience enables us  despite our human and materiallimitations  to make a useful contribution since we cancount on very dynamic Monegasque non-governmentalorganizations  which benefit from particularly generouslocal support. I am happy to convey our appreciation tothose organizations.Monaco’s priority areas are education  health  theprotection of children  development assistance andenvironmental protection. Its activities have resulted innumerous achievements in the field  particularly inAfrica  where our aid has doubled following theadoption of the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment. Monaco has also achieved much in theMediterranean region. All Monaco’s initiatives arecomplemented by our active participation in the forumswhere those various situations are addressed.The Principality of Monaco focuses on concreteprojects such as schools  occupational training centres 13 healthcare centres  investments in local communities topromote economic activity in village communitiesthrough micro-credit programmes. All those projectsare aimed at directly improving the living conditions oftheir beneficiaries.In the area of the environment  in which thePrincipality has long distinguished itself  especially inthe protection of the marine environment since one ofMonaco’s sovereigns  Prince Albert I  helped found thestudy of oceanography in the late nineteenth century.Our experience has led to us being chosen toparticipate in the next Governing Council of the UnitedNations Environment Programme. The Principality ofMonaco has also been the source of many initiativesrelated both to protecting its immediate environment the Mediterranean Sea  and to monitoring pollution andpreserving biodiversity elsewhere  with a long-termperspective of support for sustainable development.Resolutely committed to participating in theefforts of the international community to rise to themost recent challenges with which it has beenconfronted  Monaco has ratified the twelve maininternational instruments relating to terrorism  puttinginto place appropriate administrative structures.Furthermore  it is the first State to ratify the UnitedNations Convention against Transnational OrganizedCrime  which will enter into force in the next few days on 29 September. It is also preparing to host  nextmonth  the Fifth International Summit on TransnationalCrime  organized by the United Nations and theCouncil of Europe  which will bring togetherrepresentatives of Governments and the private sector.In the same spirit  the Principality works with all therelevant institutions to fight drugs and humantrafficking and the illegal financial flows they engenderor sustain.Need I also reaffirm the obvious commitment topeace and security of a country as sensitive to itsenvironment as Monaco  even if  having no armedforces  it is unable to participate in collective actionsunder the flag of the United Nations? It is in thehumanitarian field that Monaco consistently makes itscontribution by assisting civilian populations  victimsof combat and the upheavals and atrocities that toooften today characterize armed conflicts  as can be seenparticularly in Africa. In a symbolic solidarity  thePrincipality celebrates the International Day of Peaceon 21 September and associates itself with the OlympicTruce  given Monaco’s involvement in the Olympicmovement as symbolized in the long-standingparticipation of Crown Prince Albert in the InternationalOlympic Committee. We thus welcome the inclusion of anew item on the agenda of this session  entitled“International Year of Sport and Physical Education” whose goal is to highlight what has always been ourmotivation  the outstanding role of sport in developingrelations between peoples by promoting mutualunderstanding and intercultural dialogue  factors thatcontribute to both peace and development.As I conclude this statement  I hope I havesucceeded in communicating the profound attachment ofthe Principality of Monaco to the world Organization thatit joined 10 years ago at His Serene Highness PrinceRainier III’s initiative. He was convinced that hiscountry would thereby gain a most effectiveinternational profile  protection in an uncertain worldand an opportunity to usefully demonstrate itssolidarity. Since Monaco is naturally open to theoutside world  it has easily found its place among you.Our Principality is grateful for what the UnitedNations has given it and is striving in return and to theextent of its capacity to help the Organization achieveits objectives with the conviction that what theinternational community needs are reliable MemberStates. And reliability is not a question of size but ofwill. It is this will that inspires and guides us."
"107",4409,"MDA",58,2003,"﻿Allow me at the outsetto congratulate the Honourable Julian Hunte on theoccasion of his election to the important position ofPresident  at the fifty-eighth session  of the GeneralAssembly — the most representative and prestigiousorganization in the world. I am convinced that hiselection is recognition of both the achievements of thecountry he represents and his personal merits.Allow me also to express my gratitude to Mr. JanKavan for the responsibility he showed in carrying outhis duties as President at the previous session.I also must point out the remarkable role playedby the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  inenhancing the authority and efficiency of the UnitedNations  particularly in the context of the dramaticevents that the international community faced duringthe past few years. For the entire world  the UnitedNations was and continues to be an organizationserving the noble ideals of peace  equality andeconomic prosperity of the peoples on our planet.The international community has undertakenenormous efforts to ensure that phenomena alien to thespirit and aspirations of the contemporary world suchas poverty  oppression  terrorism and the dangers ofecological disaster are perceived as reasons for generalconcern that have in turn led to mobilization of allnations’ forces. We are aware of how the internationalcommunity has gone beyond adopting emotivehumanitarian declarations to establish institutions andorganizations that are not only actively analysingvarious problems  but are also working to correcteconomic  social and political developments  whereverthey occur.Global threats are being given a global rebuff and the chaos of destruction is ever more stronglyopposed by integrated ethics and new technology forstructuring international relations based onsupranational values of human civilization  theuniversality of the principles of democracy  civilfreedoms and life itself.The epochal Millennium Summit and the summitsheld at Rome  Monterrey  Doha and Johannesburgmarked the foreshadowing of a new system of globalpriorities aimed at preventing and neutralizing possiblethreats. Clearly  that system is leaving less and lessroom for resolving the individual problems ofsovereign States and is increasingly opening the wayfor making use of international mechanisms to that end.That system  which has been increasingly gaining inmodern politics  is now determining the new context ofthe relationship between States and internationalinstitutions  excluding the dependent attitude of trivialprofiting assumed by national elites towardsinternational assistance and requiring a responsible anddecisive approach to the issue of reforming our own9economies and establishing modern social and politicalstandards.Undoubtedly  we are currently entering a centuryof integration  an era in which traditional inter-Statebarriers are coming down. Yet  it is an era in which thelocal interests of some countries may in fact lead tobenefits for the entire community. Therefore  it isextremely important to be aware that the current stageof globalization will not disappoint us  only if  on theway to integration — the integration of values andstandards — the initiative for taking the first stepbelongs to the States themselves. That is a task that inprinciple is new for all us — heads of State andpoliticians.It is not gratuitous that I began my speech withthese considerations. I did so at the outset because onlysuch an approach can provide for the success of theState I represent to significant extent.Moldova embarked on the path of independentdevelopment 12 years ago. The chronic Transnistrianproblem  de-industrialization and economic recession poverty  nationalism and separatism served for adecade as the calling card of our country.The “first step” policy is being implemented inMoldova in two areas of the utmost importance. First there is the problem of the Transnistrian settlement. Weare aware of the fundamental character of the motivesthat are at the core of this 10-year-old conflict. As theprimary way to resolve these contradictions  we haveproposed that a new State constitution be drafted andadopted through joint efforts. In the draft that currentlyis being elaborated  we are insisting on giving up thestatus of unitary State  which does not take intoaccount the profound specific characteristics of theTransnistrian region. We are laying as the basis of thenew State draft the principles of the federativeorganization of our country  which take intoconsideration the long-term interests of all the regionsof Moldova.In eliminating the effects of the nationalistichysteria characteristic of the early 1990s  whichdivided both the society and the country  Moldova hasdeclared itself determined to build a harmonious multi-ethnic society  based on principles of ethnic andlinguistic liberalism and pluralism. I believe that it isprecisely this policy that corresponds to thoseintegrationist trends that are replacing isolationism andsecessionism.Unity in diversity — that is the principle of ourpolicy today  and that is the motto of the Moldovanchairmanship in the Council of Europe. We are firmlyconvinced that only those transformations will be ableto serve as the proper basis for resolving both thedomestic problems of the Moldovan State and theproblems concerning regional security.In the second place  the Republic of Moldova hasproclaimed the path of European integration a prioritynational strategy of the State. We are well aware ofhow difficult that path is  and of the responsibility itrequires  but at the same time we firmly state that itrepresents first and foremost an internal political andeconomic option for Moldova. We know that thisoption requires effective and comprehensiveconsolidation of the market economy institutions further advancement of democratic reforms and thedevelopment of civil society and the social sphere. Yethowever difficult the task before us may be  we hopethat in time our decision will lead to the establishmentof a national consensus.Peace and security on our planet may constitutethe guarantee that all States will adopt a joint positionregarding the acknowledgement of modern social economic  political and legal standards. It is clear thatthere is no other way. Humankind is currently morevulnerable than ever to crises and disasters of everyscope and degree. That is why civilization today doesnot have  and should not have  any local problems; nordoes it  or should it  have any dark corners where  as ina hothouse  terrorism  repression and defiant disdainfor the opinion of the international community canflourish.In developing such a position  the most importantrole lies with the Security Council. In that context  Iexpress my support for the idea of making the SecurityCouncil more representative. The Republic of Moldovastands for a reasonable increase in the number ofpermanent and non-permanent members in the SecurityCouncil  which would further ensure the principle ofequal geographic representation and would reflect theinterests of all regional groups. Fully aware of thedifficulty of reaching consensus on that issue  I callupon all Members of the United Nations to make everyeffort to adopt a definitive decision to that end.The Republic of Moldova also supports the ideaof restoring the role of the General Assembly as the10most important  representative and deliberative body ofthe United Nations. Along the same lines  I think thereis a need to consolidate further the capacity of theEconomic and Social Council as the coordinator ofUnited Nations funds and programmes. I am sure thatthe further development of United Nations institutionsand structures will be the best proof of the viability ofthe principles of the Organization  its growing prestigeand its leading role in the world. I express the hope thatthe United Nations will know how to place itself at thevanguard of current positive developments.I am firmly convinced that the proceedings of thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly will takeplace in a spirit of sincere cooperation and solidarity so that the representatives of all States will makesustained efforts to achieve the noble goals of peace stability and prosperity."
"108",4453,"MDG",58,2003,"﻿The United Nations is at a crossroads. The fifty-eighthsession of the General Assembly is taking place at acritical time in the history of the Organization.However  that moment could also be decisive for thefuture of the Organization. Recent developments on theinternational scene represent a call to action thatcompels us to review its organization and rules so thatit may serve all nations.Your election  Mr. President  to the presidency ofthe principal body of the United Nations will contributeto the achievement of those objectives. I would alsolike to pay tribute to Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annanfor his dedication to the cause of international peaceand security and for his ongoing desire to achieve thecommon good of mankind.International peace and security continue to bedangerously precarious as internal conflicts andconfrontations between States proliferate in manyregions of the world. We believe that the refusal to6 implement obligations imposed upon States underinternational law and the violation of the provisions ofthe Charter are two areas of grave concern to us. Neversince its creation has the Organization been confrontedwith so many situations and divergent views seriouslythreatening the attainment of its goals. Unity andcohesion among the members of the Security Councilare essential in order to strengthen the credibility of theUnited Nations and the confidence of Member Statesand to ensure that organ's effectiveness  as it is theorgan with primary responsibility for the maintenanceof international peace and security.Let me mention the struggle against terrorism which no longer hesitates to attack our Organization.On this issue  Madagascar is truly at one with theinternational community in its struggle against thatscourge. Accordingly  we have ratified the 12 existinginternational conventions to combat terrorism. We takethis opportunity to pay heartfelt tribute to the lateSergio Vieira de Mello  our Representative in Iraq.The creativity and courage of our Secretary-General in shouldering his responsibilities andcommitments to peace and security  in a spirit ofsolidarity  deserve the support of all. We endorse therecommendations contained in his report aimed atstrengthening the United Nations. We hope to seechanges in our Organization that would place greateremphasis on the importance of the General Assemblyas the principal deliberative and decision-making organand on rendering the Security Council morerepresentative and more transparent.Such reforms are necessary in order to protect thesovereignty of smaller nations. They are indispensable for the common interests of the peoples of the worldshould have no platform other than the GeneralAssembly. We support the proposals made by Mr.Couchepin  President of the Swiss Federation  to forgea new vision of security by increasingly involvingindividuals in the deliberative process.A strong United Nations will be able to findsolutions for integrating economic and social questionsinto the framework of the peace and security of peoples.The economic and social situation in the worldremains a source of great concern. The beneficialimpact of global economic growth has circumventedour island  as it has done with other countries in Africa.In the course of this past decade  major United Nationsconferences have pinpointed strategies and establishedobjectives to achieve sustainable human development.But we still need to mobilize the necessary resources toimplement  together  the declarations we all adopted  declarations which kindled so much hope in ourpeoples  who are languishing in dire poverty.The Millennium Declaration set deadlines for anumber of common objectives for all Member States.Such goals are achievable  but they remain to beattained. The new form of international cooperationbased on partnerships between the public and privatesectors offers us this opportunity  particularly since thisis a mutually advantageous relationship.The Economic and Social Council  in theDeclaration it adopted on 2 July last  emphasizes theimportance of partnerships at the national andinternational levels with a view to promotingcooperation among various sectors. The Economic andSocial Council solemnly committed itself to facilitatingand supporting the creation of alliances betweenGovernments  donors  non-governmental organizations civil society  decentralized communities and the privatesector in order to promote integrated ruraldevelopment. Our country is very pleased at havingbeen elected to preside over the United Nations Public-Private Alliance for Rural Development and at havingbeen chosen as the first pilot country.Madagascar  like most African countries  has notbenefited from the world economic expansion. Morethan 70 per cent of the population of Madagascar stilllives below the poverty line. Fifty per cent of thepopulation has no access to drinking water  and  as aresult  50 000 children die annually. I am not going topass judgement here  but I an convinced that afundamental dilemma exists: the past does not loom aslarge in other parts of the world as it does in Africa. InAfrica  the past is part and parcel of the structure ofsociety and of people's mindsets.At the same time  we are confronted with thechallenges of the policies  values  economic trends andtechnology of the twenty-first century. Africa issuffering from major gaps in this respect  more thanother continents. To bridge such gaps is not an easyprocess. Whatever the case may be  Africa must takeup the challenges of the future and undertake the7 implementation of good governance and of a rapid andsustainable economic development.Today's Madagascar is a different country. It isaiming to establish a true democracy based on the ruleof law and on respect for international law. Goodgovernance  the rule of law  the combat againstcorruption  decentralization  participation of thepopulation and the support of the private sector are itspillars. Restoring the confidence of economic players establishing conducive and secure conditions forbusiness and sharing responsibilities are key  with theState playing the role of facilitator. These are the mainunderpinnings of our economic activities.Let us not forget that the key to success is theright approach. In order to encourage investments various laws have been enacted in order to reduceimport taxes and duties on capital goods. At presentforeign investors can own real estate.Furthermore  agreements to protect investmentshave been signed or are being prepared. We areextremely grateful for the efforts undertaken bynational and international donors. Personally speaking I know that it is not easy to collect the necessary fundsfor poor countries when the world economy itself isshowing signs of weakness.I am convinced that the efforts of Africancountries designed to improve their cooperation in thecontext of the African Union  the New Partnership forAfrica's Development  the Common Market for Easternand Southern Africa (COMESA)  the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC)  the Indian OceanRim and other organizations will lead to the expectedresults.But this is not enough. Madagascar is opening up and I dare to hope that other countries will also followsuit. But the world itself is not opening up  as was seenat Cancun. Why then can we not use as an example theEuropean expansion process? This may be difficult andcostly  but the outcome is promising and the proceduresare already known.Will the international community and the Africancountries find a common vision for the future ofAfrica? Personally  I believe that it is high time that themajor Powers took steps towards a more equitablepartnership. We receive credits  grants  experts andprogrammes  but what do we read in the internationalpress every day? That Africa is a forgotten continent.Unfortunately  this is true. We are far away from thestrategic spheres of the think tanks  of the heads ofState of the major Powers  and of the chief executiveofficers of large corporations. In other words  Africaremains the victim of marginalization.Does the international community haveconfidence in the future of Africa? Is it not true that itis urgent to develop a different outlook for ourcontinent?We have this confidence. Our objectives are clear but our capacities are still low. We need assistance inthe area of capacity enhancement in order to attain theobjectives we have set for ourselves. We are ready towork tirelessly; we are ready for change  ready foropenness. However  we would like to have moresupport  greater openness and especially a differentoutlook and a new vision for our own continent in thisconcert of nations."
"109",4492,"MDV",58,2003,"﻿Allow me at the outset Sir  to convey to you  on behalf of my delegation  oursincere congratulations on your election as thePresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession. It is indeed an added pleasure for mydelegation to see such a distinguished personality froma sisterly small island State preside over the Assembly.Allow me also to extend my delegation'sprofound gratitude and appreciation to yourpredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  former Deputy PrimeMinister and former Minister of Foreign Affairs of theCzech Republic  for the exemplary manner in which hesteered the work of the fifty-seventh session.I would also like to take this opportunity  onbehalf of my delegation  to express our deepappreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan for his dedication and his untiring work in promotingthe noble principles of this Organization. I alsocongratulate him in particular for the courage andforesight with which he proposed last week much-needed reforms to this Organization. I sincerely wishhim every success in carrying them forward.I would also like to take this opportunity toexpress my delegation's sentiments of sadness anddeep sorrow at the tremendous loss suffered by theinternational community in the recent terroristbombings of the United Nations premises in Baghdad. Ipay a special tribute to the Special Representative ofthe Secretary-General  Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  andto the other staff members of the Organization whomade the ultimate sacrifice in the cause of humanity.Terrorism has always menaced the human race inone form or another. Yet never before have wewitnessed acts of terrorism so organized  so frequentand so lethal  threatening international peace andsecurity in its entirety. The Baghdad bombing and otherviolent eruptions elsewhere in the world grimly remindus that serious threats to world peace and securityremain  undermining the noble principles that had sofar contributed to the survival of the world order and tothe sustenance of the values that we upheld. Much hasbeen done  yet the persistence of such deplorable actssignals our failure to address the fundamental causes ofthose threats. Bold decisions need to be taken swiftlyto address them.Since my country fell victim to a brutal terroristattack in 1988  we had tried  on many occasions  toimpress upon the Assembly the threats to small Statesposed by increased international terrorism. A decadeand a half later  the threat of terrorism is affecting usall  irrespective of our physical size  economic25strength  political power or military might. For somesmall States  the danger is graver  as a terroristonslaught could severely threaten even theirsovereignty and independence. Therefore  let meemphasize the importance of providing support andassistance to small States in the implementation ofSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001)  and ofstrengthening their institutional capabilities in thisimportant field.We all should recognize that the strength andstability of the international security system or of anypolitical order is determined by the strength not of itsstrongest  but of its weakest members.Maldives will nevertheless continue to supportthe war against international terrorism in the spirit ofcontributing to enhanced international peace andsecurity.The structural impediments facing small islanddeveloping States such as Maldives are numerous. Thegeophysical characteristics of our island States combined with their remoteness from major markets have accentuated our vulnerabilities. Nearly a decadeago  we met in Barbados to address the environmentalvulnerabilities and developmental challenges faced bysmall island developing States. However  addressingthose vulnerabilities and challenges requires ameaningful global partnership  with sharedresponsibility and commitments at the highest level.My country hopes that Barbados+10  to be held inMauritius next year  will provide an impetus for theinternational community to renew the commitments toconcrete action it made at Barbados 10 years ago.The globalization of the world economy and theliberalization of the multilateral trading system arecontinuing to marginalize the developing countries especially the least developed countries. As tariffbarriers fall  so does the potential for developingcountries to compete effectively in the open market.Hopes were dashed at Cancun recently  as theConference proved disappointing  leaving thedeveloping countries still afflicted with problems.Abject poverty and disease in the developingworld exist at a level that defies comprehension  whiledeadly diseases such as HIV/AIDS  malaria andtuberculosis remain rampant. Developmentopportunities for the least developed countries appearbleak. I therefore call for a level playing field for allcountries  with preferential treatment for the weak  and in particular  for narrowly based economies such asthat of my own country  who find it hard  if notimpossible  to sustain their share of the global market.My delegation believes that a greater commitmentto the implementation of the Brussels Programme ofAction for the Least Developed Countries is aprerequisite if we are to halt and reverse thedeteriorating situation of the least developed countries.While I express my appreciation of the donorcommunity's willingness to help those countriesaccelerate their growth and sustain their development and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  itmust be said that the Monterrey pledges remain farfrom being realized.The overriding objectives of the BrusselsProgramme of Action to arrest and reverse thecontinued socio-economic marginalization of the leastdeveloped countries and to improve their participationin international trade and their share of foreigninvestment and other financial flows will also remainbut a dream if official development assistance is notincreased and international development assistance isnot augmented.As I have stated on many occasions  Maldives isnot simply an island nation; it is a nation of many far-flung islands covering 90 000 square kilometres ofocean. Our islands are resource-poor  and the salinesoil conditions prohibit most agricultural production.Transport and communication costs are exorbitant. Thescope for economic diversification is very limited. Thatis why we have appealed to the internationalcommunity to take a closer look at our true situationbefore the issue of our graduation from least-developed-country status is considered by theEconomic and Social Council.As I emphasized in my statement to the Assemblylast year  the structural weaknesses of our economycould have grave implications for my country'sdevelopment  should it be deprived of the preferentialaccess to markets and the concessional capital that ithas critically relied upon.The Committee for Development Policy (CDP)has fully recognized the special circumstances of smallStates like Maldives that are environmentally fragileand economically vulnerable. The CDP has also  overthe years  highlighted those vulnerabilities and thesevere costs that small island developing countries willhave to endure in the event of their graduation. We26believe that  unless these vulnerabilities and costs areaddressed in a concrete and meaningful manner  theconditions for graduation set forth in Assemblyresolution 46/206  particularly that of smoothtransition  will not be met. We are concerned that  ifsuch issues are not adequately addressed  graduationwill reverse the progress that we have made so far.Although the criteria for inclusion in the list ofleast developed countries and graduation therefromhave been regularly reviewed and refined  they still failto cover the entire range of structural and otherhandicaps. We are glad that the CDP is continuing itswork on refining the criteria. We also believe that  ofthe three criteria for graduation  that relating to theEconomic Vulnerability Index must be a requirement if we are to ensure that a country will not lapse backinto a lower category of development after the fatal dayof graduation.The United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment profile of Maldives also highlights anumber of circumstances not covered by the criteria.The profile very clearly states that graduation wouldresult in an unsustainable debt burden  even if there issustained growth. The rate of our economic growth hasdeclined significantly since 1997 and graduation at thepresent time would therefore amount to a seriousexogenous shock. This is precisely the situation that weare so desperately trying to avoid.In accordance with the decision taken at its 2003substantive session held at Geneva  the Economic andSocial Council will soon consider the issue of thegraduation of Maldives from least-developed-countrystatus. We sincerely hope that we will receive thenecessary support and cooperation of all countries witha view to adopting a comprehensive resolution thatwould address the issue of graduation in a holisticmanner and require an appropriate mechanism toensure a smooth transition.In this connection  we would like to express ourfull support for the call by the CDP to convene anexpert group meeting to address the issue of smoothtransition. We also expect the International Meeting onSmall Island Developing States  scheduled to takeplace in Mauritius next year  to formulaterecommendations to guide policies on the graduation ofsmall island developing States.Following the glimmer of hope for the revival ofthe Middle East peace process  we are again witnessingan unprecedented deterioration of the situation inPalestine and the Middle East. We strongly condemnthe Israeli move to deport President Yasser Arafat fromthe Palestinian territories  as well as the continuedIsraeli aggression against the Palestinian people. Wehave consistently supported the just struggle of thePalestinian people to regain their inalienable rights andto establish an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital. We call upon the members of theQuartet  particularly the United States  to ensure theimplementation of the road map for peace. While wesincerely believe that the United Nations has animportant role to play in the peace process  we are alsoconvinced that the United States needs to remainactively engaged  as it currently is  in a spirit ofsincerity  in the search for a just  permanent and lastingpeace in the region.The international community should maintain thehigh priority that it has accorded to disarmament andarms control efforts  without any discrimination amongnations or regions  with a view to making the world amore peaceful place. The international communitymust strengthen and improve the enforcement of thenon-proliferation regime. In this context  we believethat the United Nations not only must be at the centreof the multilateral process  but must remain theprincipal player in grappling with important globalissues. We believe that  with unity of purpose and in aspirit of complementarity  bilateral  regional andmultilateral approaches can lead to the resolution ofthese issues.As the Secretary-General emphasized  the need toreform the United Nations to enable it to face thechallenges of a changing world remains paramount. Weare convinced that the United Nations  with itsuniversal membership  is not only the sole legitimatebody responsible for the preservation and maintenanceof international peace and security but also a uniquebody  capable of achieving the goal of a better andsecure world for humankind. We should never therefore  allow the United Nations to be marginalizedor diverted from its role or the principles of theCharter. Maldives remains committed  and will do itsutmost to contribute to strengthening the role of theUnited Nations and to making it more efficient andeffective."
"110",4539,"MEX",58,2003,"﻿Allow me atthe outset to express my pleasure at seeing in thepresidency of the General Assembly a representative ofthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. Iwould ask you  Sir  to extend my greetings toSecretary-General Kofi Annan  along with our fullrecognition of his leadership  which has given thisinstitution of ours a new impetus. I would also ask youto convey to him and to the entire staff of the UnitedNations our condolences over the death of Mr. SergioVieira de Mello.We live in a world of fragile and perilousbalances  the result of our collective inability toachieve genuine peace and shared well-being in thecontext of international legality. We are confrontingtoday an economic globalization that is triggeringimbalances to the detriment of developing countries particularly the poorest. We are also confronting aglobalization of violence  suffering the threats ofterrorism as well as the war against it  and internationalorganized crime that weakens public security andjeopardizes world peace.We share these problems along with theresponsibility to find a solution to them. No country large or small  can overcome alone either thechallenges of the present or those that will have to bemet successfully in the future. The attitude that will beessential in the face of threats to international peace security and development is that of responsibilityshared among all nations.Mexico knows that we  the peoples of the UnitedNations  can together ensure that hunger  intolerance exclusion  crime and illegitimacy are banished onceand for all. Together  we can guarantee everyindividual the right to live in human dignity and theright of future generations to grow  develop andcontribute to the history of human civilization. In ourMillennium Declaration  we have an irreplaceableguide on how to meet the challenges of the present andthe future.Mexico has made significant progress in terms ofdemocracy  freedoms  gender equity  respect forminority groups  health and education  and particularlyin reducing poverty and improving income distribution as reflected in the resolute and rapid advances we havemade towards the attainment of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. We have come one third of theway towards achieving those goals in the past twoyears alone and we shall have essentially attained themby 2010  well before the target date of 2015.Though Mexican men and women will not besatisfied merely by achieving those goals  we know weare on the right track. Now is the time not for us toshrink from challenges  but rather to be hopeful aboutour joint labours and our work as a team. We feel thesame about the international situation as we do aboutthe national context.Convinced therefore of the validity  usefulnessand relevance of our Organization  Mexico appealsfrom this supreme global forum for shared internationalresponsibility. This Assembly  the most representativebody of humankind  is the most appropriate forum inwhich to call for collective action. Here the majorinternational problems have been discussed  and heredialogue has been made the cornerstone of the effort tofind solutions. Here  therefore  we must focus ourefforts on achieving shared peace  security anddevelopment.21This is the first general debate of our Assemblysince the Iraq war. Our Organization is at a critical andcrucial juncture. The attacks on the United Nations inBaghdad have harmed our Organization and hurt us all.An attack on the United Nations is an attack on all itsMembers. The events in Iraq sparked a debate thatranks among the most far-reaching in the life of theUnited Nations. As a non-permanent member of theSecurity Council and  above all  assuming itsresponsibility as a member of the world community Mexico has been faithful to the principle of seeking thepacific settlement of disputes  in accordance with theprinciples of the United Nations Charter.We have been actively and constructivelyinvolved in negotiating resolutions and are convincedthat they will lead to the swift restoration of fullsovereignty and independence for the Iraqi people. Oneof the top priorities of our Organization is to giveimpetus to the process of restoring sovereignty resulting in the establishment of a representativeGovernment for Iraqi men and women.The debate over the issue of Iraq requires us toact upon our commitments and change the way wethink about when the use of force is legitimate  inaccordance with the Charter. It is vitally important thatwe review States’ commitments to abide byinternational law and the existing machinery to ensurecompliance with Security Council resolutions. Theagreements reached and reforms achieved will greatlyand profoundly determine the future effectiveness ofthe United Nations and proper functioning of thecollective decision-making processes that underpin themultilateral approach.Above and beyond Iraq  the world is closelyfollowing many other major challenges. As we havenoted today  the unfinished job of peace-making in theMiddle East  Afghanistan  Africa and the Balkansimplies new threats and challenges to internationalsecurity. A particular source of concern is the increasein tensions in Asia  in light of the development ofweapons of mass destruction.We have always been a nation committed topeace  convinced that dialogue  negotiation and the laware effective conflict-resolution instruments. Today  wereaffirm that it is time to give special emphasis todiplomatic action and to work together to meetcommon challenges. In view of the world’s presentpotential for destruction  it is time for us to ensure thatdiplomacy and negotiation get priority attention withregard to international disputes. Reaffirming theprinciples and values that govern our actions on theinternational scene  Mexico is appealing for peace andglobal cooperation so that  together  we can effectivelyfoster international peace  security and development.History teaches us that  unless great economicand social disparities  injustice  discrimination intolerance and lack of international cooperation areaddressed  we will continue to endure current threatssuch as terrorism. Mexico is unequivocally committedto combating terrorism. Combating it effectivelyrequires not only better and more intense internationalcooperation but also new approaches to internationallegality. The fight against terrorism will not beeffective without a new recognition of international lawand a United Nations system that has sufficientcapacity to ensure compliance with it.We must confront this and other challenges byadopting a holistic view of our responsibility formaintaining and restoring peace in the world today while tackling the structural causes of conflicts. Tomeet those challenges will require sustained conflict-prevention capacity  the mobilization of political willand a strategically targeted commitment of resources.Such a perspective can be contributed only bythis universal Organization  the only such body withthe legitimacy  experience  capacity to convene peoplesand the moral force to concert our efforts for the sakeof peace and universal well-being. The response to theglobal challenges facing us requires a robust politicaleffort on the part of all nations — an effort that ispossible solely from within these halls.As a nation that has always done its utmost toattain the noble objectives of the United Nations andconvinced of the relevance of the principles and valuesthat gave rise to this Organization  Mexico renews itsfirm commitment to the United Nations and its ideals.Security cannot be built based on barriers orignorance. True security and lasting peace amongnations is based on mutual understanding and ademonstrated belief in equal treatment for allnations — ideals that have developed over time withinthis Organization.The relevance of this Organization is undeniable.Mexico reaffirms its confidence in multilateralarrangements. We have associated ourselves with the22appeal by the Secretary-General to put forwardinnovative ideas and approaches geared towardsreforming the United Nations. We agree with theSecretary-General’s view that the international systemis in crisis and with his appeal for fundamental reformof the United Nations. Members can rest assured thatMexico will make every diplomatic effort to reformand update our Organization  which the internationalsituation necessitates. Mexico considers that realreform must be based on five specific guidelines.The first is to strengthen our collective securitysystem to ensure rapid responses to crises andtransparent collective decision-making. The second isto guarantee support for economic and socialdevelopment of States  particularly for the least-developed. The third is to guarantee respect for thesovereignty and independence of States while assuringat the same time the legitimacy and legality ofinternational efforts to combat impunity. The fourth isto promote and protect human rights. The fifth is toincrease the effectiveness of decision-making.We must revitalize the commitment that Statesand nations make to observing universal norms.Reforms must concentrate on the performance of ourmultilateral system. The work of the Security Councildemonstrates this need. Without question  debate overits composition involves the need to make it morerepresentative and thus increase its legitimacy.Although the central issue is the functioning of theSecurity Council and respect for its resolutions  thediscussions of the past decade have focused onexpanding the membership and selecting newpermanent members.There is little worth in considering a Council witha larger membership if the resolutions that it issues arenot respected or if they lack a common interpretationof the scope of their provisions. We must ensure theright kind of representativeness  limit and regulate theright of veto and call for greater transparency and forcreating a more balanced relationship with the otherorgans of the United Nations system  particularly theGeneral Assembly.We must ensure that the Council does not exceedits competencies or shirk its responsibilities. Let usthink democratically. Let us seek a balance between themain organs of the United Nations. Let us dare toachieve a reform of the General Assembly that willinclude safeguarding its quality as a universal parliamentary forum  without abandoning its ability fordecision-making and acting in a timely manner. Let usthink of a new type of collective security system that iseffective and balanced  which would function under theguidance of our democratic body par excellence — theGeneral Assembly.Inertia has caused each main organ of ourOrganization to act in a manner that is removed fromthe main purposes and objectives of the UnitedNations. The development agenda must be better linkedto conflict prevention and peace-building activitiesmust include mechanisms to ensure economic andsocial development. For that reason  we must also thinkabout how to strengthen the Economic and SocialCouncil and about whether we can and should turn itinto an economic and social security council.Mexico believes that reform should bring theUnited Nations into line with the requirements of anever-changing world  in order to help us to overcomethe existing gaps and fresh challenges. Today  faithfulto the principles  values and ideals of our Organization we have the obligation to build a new internationalarchitecture  which  with a vision for the future  leavesfratricidal conflicts and struggles behind  opens newavenues of understanding and international cooperationand forges new paths towards peace  internationalsecurity and development."
"111",4564,"MHL",58,2003,"﻿I am honoured toaddress the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession  on behalf of His Excellency President KessaiH. Note and the people of the Republic of the MarshallIslands.Allow me to extend my sincere congratulations toyou  Mr. President  on your election to your highoffice. At the outset  I would like to take thisopportunity to express our deepest condolences to thebereaved families that lost loved ones in the recentbombing attack on the United Nations offices inBaghdad. That tragic event was also a great loss to theinternational community. Such horrific acts ofterrorism are utterly condemnable  and thoseresponsible should be swiftly brought to justice.My delegation is especially pleased that thissession of the General Assembly will be presided overby the representative of a fellow member of theAlliance of Small Island States  and we wish you well Sir  in your endeavours throughout the session. We arehopeful that your presidency will help to highlight thespecial needs of small island developing States. It haslong been recognized that such States suffer particulardisadvantages in terms of both environment anddevelopment. This was recently reaffirmed by theWorld Summit on Sustainable Development  whichcalled for a full and comprehensive review of theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.The coming year will be a particularly importantone for the Marshall Islands and for all small islanddeveloping States as we prepare for the 2004International Meeting in Mauritius to review theimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.In preparation for that Meeting  the Marshall Islands iscurrently completing an assessment of theimplementation of the Programme of Action at thenational level. I would like to take this opportunity toencourage the international donor and developmentcommunity to engage with the small island developingStates in the preparatory process and to activelyparticipate in the International Meeting so that it canproduce successful and practical outcomes for all suchStates.The Marshall Islands is faced with challengesshared by many small island States. Our landcomprises small  scattered islands and atolls  spreadover vast areas of ocean. Our unique environment isfragile and highly vulnerable to the threats posed byglobal warming and environmental pollution anddegradation. Our natural resource base is extremelynarrow  our economy very small and we aredisadvantaged by our remoteness from world markets.Given these factors  in our interactions within theinternational community  the Marshall Islands isparticularly concerned about the following issues. Thefirst issue is sustainable development. Pursuing thethree pillars of sustainable development — economic social and environmental — poses many challenges forsmall island States. During last year’s general debate we introduced our national blueprint for sustainabledevelopment. This document forms the basis of ourlong-term sustainable development plans  which we arecurrently working hard to implement.In this context  and in the follow-up to the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development  we continue toseek opportunities to form partnerships that will assistus in the practical implementation of projects under thePacific’s 14 Type II Umbrella Initiatives. Areas ofparticular importance for our people include the needfor greater access to fresh water  the availability ofaffordable  renewable and environmentally soundenergy sources and the development of wastemanagement systems that minimize hazardous impactson society and the environment.Also in this regard  we welcome the new workprogramme of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment. We are particularly pleased that smallisland developing countries will be considered as across-cutting issue in relation to the themes of eachtwo-year work cycle  and that the theme of the 2014-2015 work cycle will focus on small island developingStates issues.Our second main area of concern is theenvironment  and in particular the threats posed byglobal climate change and sea level rise. These threats23are felt most acutely by low-lying island and atollcountries such as the Marshall Islands and many of ourPacific neighbours.I am pleased to announce that the MarshallIslands has recently completed its ratification processfor the Kyoto Protocol. I take this opportunity tocommend those States that have ratified the Protocol and I urge remaining States to do so without delay.This matter is surely the most urgent facing theinternational community today. If we fail to act now the future will see the complete disappearance of manysmall island nations.In relation to environmental matters  the MarshallIslands is particularly concerned about the state of theworld’s oceans and fisheries. As a nation whose verylivelihood depends on the resources of the sea  theMarshall Islands Government reaffirms its unwaveringsupport for the regime established under the UnitedNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I am alsopleased to state that the Marshall Islands is now a partyto the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement.The Marshall Islands is seriously concerned aboutinstances of illegal  unreported and unregulated fishingwithin its exclusive economic zone. Such fishinggravely undermines the livelihood of our people thatdepend on these resources as their primary means ofsurvival. Regional and international cooperation mustfocus on addressing this issue.Within our region  we are pleased to note therecent progress of the Convention on the Conservationand Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks inthe Western and Central Pacific Ocean. We are alsoparticularly pleased with the development of thePacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy and we lookforward to broad participation in the upcoming PacificIslands Regional Ocean Forum.An ongoing issue of major concern for theMarshall Islands is that of nuclear weapons testing.The people and the environment of the MarshallIslands continue to suffer as a consequence of thenuclear weapons tests that were conducted in ourterritory between 1946 and 1958.As we continue to seek resolution of this issueour people continue to suffer from ongoing healtheffects  the food chain still contains dangerously highradiation levels and our development capacity isrestrained by an inability to use contaminated islandsand atolls.I have briefly addressed a few issues of majorconcern to the Marshall Islands. There are  of course many other significant issues to be addressed duringthe upcoming session.One of the most important challenges facing theinternational community is the need for acomprehensive  unified response to combat acts ofinternational terrorism. I am pleased to be able to saythat the Marshall Islands has ratified all 12 of the coreConventions against terrorism. We are continuallyworking to implement the provisions of SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  and we have takenmany steps at the national level to combat moneylaundering and terrorist financing. We reiterate oursolidarity with all Member States that are working toeliminate terrorism in all its forms.Another important issue facing this body is thecontinued exclusion of the Republic of China onTaiwan from the United Nations. The Marshall IslandsGovernment reiterates its concern that the exclusion ofa nation of peaceful and law-abiding citizens is notconsistent with the inclusive ideal of the UnitedNations. I therefore strongly urge every Member Stateto reconsider this matter.The Marshall Islands welcomes the progressachieved by the International Criminal Court over thepast year. Many positive developments have takenplace  not the least of these being the election of aprominent panel of judges and the chief prosecutor. Welook forward to the Court becoming fully operationaland we are confident that the Court will prove to be avaluable mechanism in the administration of justice atthe international level.Finally  in terms of the need for further UnitedNations reform  the Marshall Islands Governmentwishes to reiterate its support for the expansion of theSecurity Council. We believe that the number of bothpermanent and non-permanent members should beincreased  and that such expansion should includemembers from both developed and developingcountries. This expansion is urgently needed toincrease the representative base of the Council and toenhance its legitimacy in the light of the geographicand political realities of the world today. We also wishto emphasize the need for further streamlining of thework of the General Assembly and its six Main24Committees in order to enhance the efficiency andeffectiveness of the Organization."
"112",4588,"MKD",58,2003,"﻿I am greatly honoured toaddress this distinguished gathering of the world'sleaders at the United Nations  a truly unique globalorganization that is deeply engaged in the promotion ofhuman values and international peace and stability.I would like to thank Mr. Jan Kavan for hisimportant contribution in the past year as President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session and tocongratulate Mr. Julian Robert Hunte on his election tothe post of President of the General Assembly at thefifty-eighth session. I wish him every success inexecuting that function of great responsibility.On behalf of all citizens of the Republic ofMacedonia  I would like to pay special tribute to theUnited Nations and Secretary-General Kofi Annan who delivered an indeed inspiring speech yesterday  fortheir relentless dedication and efforts in pursuing therighteous causes of protecting human rights andfreedoms and safeguarding prosperity and security inthe world.We certainly remember a great person  Mr. SergioVieira de Mello  who paid the highest price forpursuing the noble role of the United Nations in Iraq.We fully support the goals of the internationalcommunity in Iraq: the achievement of a free andsovereign Iraq governed by the people of Iraq for thepeople of Iraq. However  that sovereignty must bebased on democracy  freedom and peaceful existencewith its neighbours. To achieve those goals as quicklyas possible  the United Nations must play a morecomprehensive and active role in the transition back toIraqi sovereignty. I would also like to take thisoccasion to express our satisfaction with the workcarried out by the coalition forces in helping the Iraqipeople to rebuild their country after the decades ofdisasters of Saddam Hussein's despotic regime.Reforming the United Nations  particularly theSecurity Council  and revitalizing the GeneralAssembly are of crucial importance to us all. MyGovernment firmly believes in the need to pursue thosegoals in a consistent and more efficient way.The Republic of Macedonia strongly believes theUnited Nations involvement in various parts of theworld will essentially improve the responses ofdemocratically oriented Governments and reform-minded people and will add to the overall level oflegitimacy of their actions. It is obvious that we need tooffer more vocal support to multilateralism whendealing with the substantial issues on the internationalagenda to which we are fully committed: theeradication of poverty  the fight against the scourge ofHIV/AIDS around the world  conflict prevention andthe protection of the environment  among others.The World Summit on the Information Society  tobe held in Geneva this year and in Tunis 2005  alongwith two other summits held last year on financing fordevelopment in Monterrey  Mexico  and sustainabledevelopment in Johannesburg  can be regarded  in thecontext of globalization and the overall developmentprocess  as landmarks of a new approach in dealingwith the challenges of today's world. Within theaforementioned framework  it is essential fully toimplement the Millennium Declaration as a keydocument for peace  security  sustainable developmentand prosperity.The most serious contemporary threat tohumanity is identified and visible. It is the evil ofterrorism. The fight against terrorism has been andmust remain our highest priority. In this regard  itwould be immensely helpful to make a commitment toreaching a consensus in relation to the remaining7disputed points in the process of drafting conventionson international and nuclear terrorism.Facing the challenge of the year 2001  we found away out by signing the Framework Agreement thatbrought vital democratic processes back to ourinstitutions and re-established and reaffirmeddemocratic procedures for addressing internal problemsof any kind. Today  I am very proud to say that I comehere in the same mood I was in three years ago when Itook part in the Millennium Summit   full ofoptimism and truly convinced that  after the hard workhad been done  strategic issues of our future had beensolved  once and for all  upon a broad political  socialand interethnic consensus. Progress towards a real andauthentic integration of all ethnic communities in theState structures is significant and has roots in ourcenturies-old model and tradition of multiculturalismand inter-ethnic coexistence.In order to contribute in a constructive way tocreating a more positive picture of the region andproductive cooperation among nations  the Republic ofMacedonia launched numerous regional initiatives inthe context of integration into the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization and the European Union. In parallel while pursuing very ambitious reform agendas  weachieved an internal consensus about our foreign policypriorities and realized that we will most successfullyleave behind the poor legacies of our unfortunate pastby promoting new substantial links among the peoplewho live in South-East Europe.A month ago in Ohrid  we held a very successfulregional forum on dialogue among civilizations attended by numerous heads of State  other leaders andscholars from all over the world  who spoke veryopenly about the importance of having culturalinterchange as a permanent basis for the promotion ofcontinuous dialogue and cohabitation among peoplesand States. In the message adopted at the forum  allparticipants agreed that a thorough and continuouscommitment would be needed by all to genuinelytransform our region and to defuse once and for all thispowder keg of Europe.The Republic of Macedonia has built solidcooperation with the United Nations InterimAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) anddeveloped a network of activities aimed at easingcommunications and at liberalizing the movement ofpeople from both sides of the border. The Republic ofMacedonia welcomes the appointment of Harri Holkerias the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General and gives him its full support. We are fullysupportive of the implementation of Security Councilresolution 1244 (1999) and the political positiondeclared by UNMIK calling for the fulfilment of thestandards of democracy and the application of the ruleof law before the onset of negotiations over the finalstatus of Kosovo. We express our deep concern overthe recent upsurge of inter-ethnic violence in Kosovo which only undermines the efforts of the internationalcommunity and the Kosovar people to fulfil the setstandards.In the Balkans  we are seeing collaboration andmutual respect emerging even between yesterday'senemies and opposing factions. We are witnessing thegradual but steady reconciliation of the nations. Lastbut not least  important regional initiatives for freetrade  trade facilitation and building infrastructure areconnecting businesses and binding people in aproductive way  which helps to raise awareness of ourcommon future.My country  the Republic of Macedonia  is anindivisible part of these joint regional efforts totransform our part of the continent into a decent placeto live in. To that end  we will need the understandingand concrete support of the rest of the worldcommunity  which should not neglect the call ofprogressive people to join efforts to secure liberty. Webelieve that the greatness of countries is dependent notupon the size of their armies and the number ofweapons they possess  but upon the commitment anddedication of their citizens to the noble ideas ofhumanity and the legacy of our civilization. In thistremendous task of preserving our common treasuryand of creating a better world for the generations tocome  we are more than willing to participate  becausewe are all equal to each other  while contributing to thecommon aim.We are deeply concerned about the escalation ofviolence in the Middle East. The parties need torecommit themselves to the road map process  becauseit is the only alternative that can bring security andstability to Israelis and Palestinians alike. Theinternational community must step up its activities atthis extremely difficult juncture  ensuring that itremains on the path of ending terrorism and occupationand of establishing the State of Palestine  living side byside with the State of Israel in peace and security.8On disarmament matters  bearing in mind ourimmediate concerns over the problem of small armsand light weapons  the Republic of Macedonia hasbeen an advocate of strong international action towardspreventing  combating and eradicating the illicit tradein small arms and light weapons  since these pose aserious threat not only to the security and stability ofmy country  but also to the broader region. Wewelcome the conclusion of the First Biennial Meetingof States to Consider the Implementation of the UnitedNations Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat andEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and LightWeapons in All its Aspects  held in July 2003  thatprogress had been made worldwide within barely twoyears of the adoption of the Programme of Action.For the African countries  the main priority at thismoment is the fight against HIV/AIDS  a pandemicthat is taking a devastating toll on the Africanpopulation. The international community must workhand in hand with the African Governments to defeatthis deadly disease. Africa must also work very hard toachieve the strategic goals of the New Partnership forAfrica's Development in the areas of peace andsecurity  democracy  good governance  povertyreduction and sound economic management.I sincerely believe that we will find a commonlanguage with regard to the issue of how to strengthenour Organization and maintain its mission of peace prosperity  economic and social justice and humanrights."
"113",4634,"MLI",58,2003,"﻿First  Sir please accept my warm congratulations and my ferventhopes for your successful achievement of the missionentrusted to you. Your election to the presidency of thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly is a fittingtribute by the international community to the people ofSaint Lucia. I am convinced that with your experience22 and your distinguished intellectual and ethicalqualities  you will successfully lead our work to becarried out in the best spirit.Sir  I wish to convey to your predecessor  Mr. JanKavan  the congratulations of the delegation of Malifor the skill  dedication and spirit of initiative and theauthority with which he directed the work of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I also takethis solemn occasion to pay well-deserved tribute toSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan for his dedication tothe ideals of the United Nations.The present session is opening in a context wherethe United Nations is still confronting challenges to itsvery existence; those challenges moved humanity 58years ago to equip itself with an instrument of hopecapable of meeting them. Let us recall that the UnitedNations were conceived to save ourselves from thedemons of war and insecurity. The idea was to secure astate of grace   one of man reconciled with himself  and to create the conditions for reducing material want uncertainty and poverty.Flashpoints of tension   fire and smoke   existand are developing in many places. Poverty anddistress are the daily lot of many inhabitants of ourplanet  particularly in Africa.The arrival of the new millennium broughtenormous hopes. We have barely turned to the thirdpage of this millennium and new challenges areassailing humankind. Upon us are other questions forwhich we must uncover the appropriate solutions sothat our Organization will remain true to itself andpursue its goals without succumbing to a hijacking ofits mandate.The Government of Mali believes that the UnitedNations remains an instrument of great value. Definingthe rules of the game is one thing; applying them underthe watchful eye of an impartial arbiter who has thenecessary authority and the corresponding means to actis another. We need to work to make the UnitedNations that authority and arbiter.For its part  under the distinguished leadership ofMr. Amadou Toumani TourÈ  President of the Republicof Mali  our country is steadfastly committed tosupporting the United Nations in attaining its objective:the full development of humankind.At the national level  our President is firmlycommitted to strengthening the institutions of theRepublic and of communities  to promote democracyand human rights and to give a boost to good governance economic growth and sustainable development.Peace and security are among the principal valuesheld and venerated by the peoples of the entire worldas they are essential for their social and economicdevelopment.Mali has been fully committed to the twinchallenges of conflict prevention and conflictmanagement. At the subregional level  Mali has senttroops to Liberia  and our President has beenpersonally committed to solidarity with theGovernment and people of CÙte d'Ivoire in their searchfor coordinated political solutions to the crisis faced bythat brotherly country. That testifies to the importancewe attach to peace and stability.At the continental level  our country willunstintingly continue its tireless efforts within theAfrican Union  which have deployed continuouslysince the establishment of the African Union to achievestability  the guarantor for all economic social andcultural development. Therefore  Mali calls on allStates to adopt a multilateral approach  subregional andregional cooperation and international solidarity  withrigorous respect for the sovereignty of States.The overall situation prevailing in the MiddleEast  in particular the conflict in Iraq  remains aburning issue of the day and a major concern for theinternational community. We should point out to theprotagonists of these conflicts that war is neveranything other than a political failure and that thevictories of peace are no less renowned than those ofwar. Peace between Palestinians and Israelis willgarner more fame than all wars combined. The partiesto the conflict should be mindful of that.In addition  we invite the internationalcommunity to provide aid and assistance to thePalestinian people and the Palestinian Authoritybecause the destruction of Palestinian infrastructureand the restrictions imposed as a result of occupationhave caused a clear deterioration of the socio-economicfabric of Palestinian society. It is therefore to be fearedthat the strategy of destruction will henceforth becomea constant in how conflicts unfold in general.Terrorism is one of the gravest threats to humansecurity. Combating that scourge requires strengtheningnational and regional capacities. It should be recalled23 that Mali has ratified all international legal instrumentsconcerning terrorism and transnational organizedcrime  as well as the additional protocol.It is encouraging to note that the internationalcommunity  in particular the United Nations  has madethe campaign against the proliferation of small armsand light weapons a major focus of concern. That isparticularly reassuring because  for the last ten years small arms and light weapons have weighed on thefuture and destiny of the peoples of Africa. Theiradverse affects have been a great blow to humandignity  freedom and security.Mali  which since 10 May 2003 has held thepresidency of the Human Security Network  calls on allStates to unite for the success of the initiative of theframework convention on international transfers ofarms  currently being drafted  which is expected to belaunched in Bamako next October; it will be animportant step towards the establishment of themandate of the heads of State and Government of theEconomic Community of West African States totransform the moratorium on small arms and lightweapons into an international convention.In addition  Mali continues to be deeplyconcerned by the phenomenon of child soldiers andcalls for vigorous action to put an end to that practice if we wish to save future generations from the scourgeof war.For many reasons  the level of security for theworld's population has considerably deteriorated inrecent years. Even today  in many African countries people are often caught in the grip of conflictsinvolving guerrillas  rebel groups  civil war  ethnic war clan war and clashes between militias  warlords andregular army forces. Designing a political strategybased on the idea of human security has now become avery urgent priority.For its mandate at the head of the HumanSecurity Network  Mali has made its priority the issuesof education in human rights  children in armedconflict  the campaign against the proliferation of smallarms and light weapons  gender in peacekeepingoperations and food security.In the field of economics  the Government ofMali is adopting stimulative fiscal measures in order toattract national and international investment  inparticular in the productive areas of cotton  mines andraising livestock. But those efforts are being hamperedby the effects of globalization. In fact  in agriculture inparticular  it is not so much poverty that offends as theconditions that engender that poverty.To give but one example  Mali   like otherAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries   issuffering from the cotton competition with developedcountries  which each year provide five times morefunds in subsidies to their farmers than they do todevelopment assistance. Those subsidies have a directimpact on world cotton prices  which are lower thanthey have been for 25 years. That policy of cottonproduction and export subsidies by certain developedcountries must be abandoned  because they are contraryto the rules and principles of the multilateral tradesystem. They are ruining African economies  deprivingour farmers of their share of the world market  andexacerbating the poverty that we undertook toeliminate at the Millennium Summit.On another topic  Mali welcomes the adoption ofthe Almaty Programme of Action  whose aim is forgepartnerships that will better meet the special needs ofthe landlocked developing countries. We believe thatthat Programme makes it incumbent on theinternational community to devise a new framework ofcooperation with respect to transportation and transit  a policy that will help developing landlockedcountries to integrate into the world economy and tospeed up their socio-economic development. To do so it is essential that this Programme of Action beimplemented with diligence at all levels  with theactive assistance of the technical and financial partnersof the landlocked developing countries.Given the major changes that the world is goingthrough today and the many challenges that it faces Africa decided to crystallize its willingness to actthrough two initiatives: the creation of the AfricanUnion and the launching of the New Partnership forAfrica's Development. These two initiatives represent aclear and courageous vision of the way Africa intendsto shoulder its responsibilities with respect to its owndevelopment and its full integration into the worldeconomy.We deeply appreciate the commitment made bythe international community here at United NationsHeadquarters to support the tremendous task ofdevelopment in Africa  and we welcome the actions ofthe Group of Eight aimed at establishing programmes24 that will help translate into reality the commitmentsmade in the African action plan. We hope that thisexample will be followed by the internationalcommunity  because the implementation of NEPADwill require substantial and effective support.With respect to information and communicationtechnologies  my delegation welcomes the upcomingholding  in December 2003 in Geneva  of the firstphase of the World Summit on the Information Society which will offer the international community  andAfrican States in particular  the opportunity to discussthe role of those technologies and their impact onsocio-economic development. The second phase will beheld in Tunis  Africa  and we hope that the Summit willadopt specific measures to promote the development ofthe least advanced people in these areas.The world is in crisis  and the worldwide crisis atpresent is largely due to humankind's inability tocomprehend and to take on the responsibilities requiredby the new role that is required in the world. In thecontext of this crisis  realities have changed also for theUnited Nations. Today we have to deal with those whohad previously been overlooked.For Mali  the United Nations remains the livingincarnation of this hope for peace and security. It is anunequalled instrument. But  like any other instrument it can worn out if it is overused  and from time to timeit needs to be reinvigorated in order to be moreeffective  efficient and modern and to perform better.Our Organization is at a crossroads. To quote acontemporary author If we keep looking towards the past to prolongit  we are doomed. If we look towards a newhorizon  then our strength  our creativity and thepower of our intellect will do the rest.'The past of our Organization has shown its limits.We must now implement reforms that will allow us torealize our hopes for the future. Global governancerequires the democratization of the decision-makingstructures that will implement it. The currentmembership of the Security Council  for example  nolonger meets the needs of our planet. Its compositionmust reflect its universal nature. Therefore  we are infavour of opening it up and expanding it to includeother Member States in order better to meet thecomplex challenges of the day.Mali has taken note of the commitments madealong these lines by the Secretary-General in his mostrecent report and reaffirms the central role of theUnited Nations in the implementation of internationalcommitments and the fact that this can be done only ifthere is a dynamic and innovative partnership betweendeveloped and developing countries.The creation of the International Criminal Court whose elected judges and Prosecutor were sworn in thisyear  is certainly a success for the internationalcommunity  which has fought against impunity andmade it a subject of international concern. In fact  fortwo decades  the fight against impunity and respect forhuman dignity has mobilized all people of goodwill.Although recent developments seem to indicatethat prospects for the advent of an independentinternational judicial forum do not appear promising  Iwould recall that the path to follow involves not onlyresolving conflicts and establishing peace  but alsorequires our determination to work together. We areconvinced of this  and therefore Mali would plead for astrong ICC   a universal ICC  acting as an instrumentwhich cannot be deterred and which will helpcontribute to the maintenance of international peaceand security.In conclusion  I should like to recall that democracy justice  freedom  peace  security  development andrespect for commitments are common values that areour foundation for  and give us a sense of  ourhumanity.All people must be given their freedom and theirdignity. We therefore call on all States to look to thefuture to imagine and to promote the lifestyle thatcorresponds to the aspirations of our people. To do so we are determined to reject any sense of fatalism ofwhatever kind   political  economic  social or cultural.Indeed  today there are men and women who arecapable  through their work and through their will  ofrealizing the aspirations of our peoples for well-being peace  security  prosperity and sustainabledevelopment. Now we can hope to build a new world  a world that is rich in its diversity   within theframework of the United Nations and on new bases  aglorious world in which we can work together in aspirit of solidarity.Some of those men and women  on behalf of thepeoples of the world  paid with their lives for their25 dedication to the lofty ideals of the United Nations. Letthem always be in our thoughts and prayers.Let us all work together. Let us all continue tobelieve in the intrinsic nature of human beings   intheir basic dignity and kind-heartedness."
"114",4675,"MLT",58,2003,"﻿I would first like tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election to thepresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. You have an important and challenging taskahead. In executing your duties  you can be assured ofmy full support and that of the Maltese delegation.I take this opportunity to express our appreciationto the outgoing President of the fifty-seventh session Mr. Jan Kavan  for the dedication and initiative withwhich he accomplished his task. I would also like toexpress our support for the Secretary-General. The past12 months have been a particularly difficult time forhim and for the Organization he serves so well. Werespect and admire the patience  tact  wisdom anddetermination that he has once again demonstrated inthese trying times.The attack on the United Nations headquarters inBaghdad on 19 August has added an unwelcomedimension of tragedy and urgency to this year’s sessionof the General Assembly. Our thoughts are with therelatives and friends of the victims  to whom we againexpress our deepest condolences. Not for the first timein its history the United Nations is mourning theviolent death of its talented servants in the course oftheir duty.Besides being a human tragedy  it was indeed —for the first time — also a direct and deliberate attackon the United Nations itself. In this sense  an analysisof the implications of the attack in Baghdad needs toform an integral part of the broader considerationsrelating to the structures and objectives of theinternational system.The reality is that in the United Nations theinternational community has a system that is both vitaland indispensable. However  it is also a fact that theinternational community has taken this system forgranted for too long. Events over the last few weeksand months constitute a renewed reminder that urgentreform is necessary. We need to heed the Secretary-General’s advice that this action has to be radical.One important element in the process of buildinginternational cooperation and solidarity lies in theregional dimension. That dimension was given itsimportance in the original architecture of the United25 Nations Charter. Over the last 12 months Malta together with nine other countries  successfullyconcluded negotiations to join one of the most creativeand impressive manifestations of regional cooperation:the European Union. The results of those negotiationswere confirmed by the people of Malta  first in areferendum and subsequently in the general electionsheld earlier this year. Our desire to join the EuropeanUnion stems primarily from our appreciation of boththe history and the present reality of the European-Mediterranean region  and of Malta’s place and role inthat region.At the same time  for Malta  the objective ofmembership in the European Union has also been afurther means of deepening and reinforcing itslongstanding commitment towards internationalcooperation and solidarity.We are gratified to see how the European Unionis fast becoming one of the main partners of the UnitedNations in the collective endeavour towards globalcooperation and solidarity. We are encouraged to discoverhow much that partnership enhances the opportunities foreven the smaller members to play a positive andconstructive role in many issues of global concern.Among such issues  the question of security in allof its complex dimensions has assumed formidableproportions this year. One of the more disturbingaspects in that regard is the way in which the differentdimensions of terrorism and arms control have becomeintertwined. That link has become a factor in thesometimes differing perceptions of the sources of thesecurity risks faced by States. In turn  that has led todifferences of emphasis in action priorities  even amongStates with otherwise very convergent policies andapproaches. When such differences are reflected withinthe Security Council itself  there is a risk of erosion to thestill fragile structure of international legitimacy.On the question of Iraq in particular  it iscritically important for the Security Council to reachearly agreement on the role the United Nations mustplay in the re-establishment of order and legitimacy inthat country. We strongly urge all members of theCouncil  in particular the permanent members  to spareno effort to achieve that objective.The question of armaments today confronts us inits bewildering complexity. At one extreme is theoutrageous reality of child soldiers brandishing lethalconventional weapons. At the other extreme is theincreasingly credible prospect that terrorist groups willprocure and use weapons of mass destruction to bringmajor tragedy and destruction to the hearts of States.These extremes have intruded into the more traditionaldisarmament process that has itself been movingforward hesitantly and intermittently over the years.Yet however hesitant and intermittent it may be the disarmament process has produced some resultsupon which we can build further. A range of agreementsand instruments are already available concerning bothweapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons.The more immediate challenges in this regard lie in theareas of compliance and verification.Over recent months  the European Union hasbeen working on a comprehensive security strategy onthe issues of non-proliferation and weapons of massdestruction. One of the key principles underpinningthis strategy is the need to uphold and implement themultilateral treaties and agreements that exist in thisarea. Equally important is the need to support themultilateral institutions charged with verifying andensuring compliance with these agreements. Primaryamong these institutions is the United Nations.Terrorism in our day is a phenomenon that isunprecedented in terms of motivation  tenacity andmethods. Over the past 12 months terrorist acts haveindiscriminately struck peoples  both in areas of activeconflict and elsewhere. The counter-terrorism measuresput in place following the attack here in New York on11 September 2001 provide us with tools which canhave an effect if applied forcefully  universally andconsistently. Our response must remain adamant andclear. At the same time  as the Secretary-Generalreminds us  while there is an unquestionable need toconfront terrorist groups with determination  thisshould never be at the expense of the commitment tohuman rights.The objective of increased security at the globallevel demands efforts across a range of widely differentfronts  ranging from issues relating to peacemaking andpeacekeeping  to issues relating to economic and socialdevelopment.The United Nations has a steady record ofpositive involvement in peacekeeping. The recentexperiences in Sierra Leone  Timor-Leste and Kosovoprovide encouraging instances of this. The Secretary-General reminds us that peacekeeping efforts  andespecially what he terms “robust” peacekeeping  must26 be provided with both the necessary capabilities and anadequate mandate. He also correctly points out thatpeacekeeping must be preceded by effective actiontowards conflict resolution.The question of Palestine is one issue with regardto which sustained efforts at conflict resolution havenot yet prevailed. Over the past few weeks we havebeen witnessing the gradual disintegration of yetanother major and sustained effort at peacemaking inthat region.The immediate obstacles to peace in Palestinearise from two contrasting directions. On the one handis the reality of an illegal occupation of territoryoriginally achieved  and continuously maintained  byarmed force. On the other is the reality of a resistanceto this occupation that uses unacceptable means ofcivilian terror and destruction to pursue its ends.These two realities feed upon each other in avicious cycle of ever-escalating hatred and violence.Perhaps the most frightening aspect of the situation inPalestine is the fact that each successive failure ofeffort towards peacemaking ratchets up the level ofhatred and violence. The international communityneeds to find a way of breaking the conditionalitywhich makes the two extremes feed upon each other.Israel needs to clearly recognize the illegality ofits presence in the occupied territories. This implies thereversal of the measures that are accompanying thisoccupation — in particular the building and maintenanceof settlements and the construction of the partition wallon Palestinian territory.Furthermore  the support of the chosen leadershipof the Palestinian people is necessary if progresstowards peace and stability is to be achieved. In thisspirit  we call upon Israel to desist from any act ofdeportation and cease any threat to the safety of theelected President of the Palestinian Authority.For their part  the Palestinians must recognizethat all violent acts against civilians are unacceptableand must stop unconditionally. The PalestinianAuthority needs to assert its control and prevent anyfurther acts of terrorism.In spite of the latest setbacks  the approach by theQuartet still needs to be supported and encouraged. Byvirtue of its composition  the Quartet offers the bestprospects for finding ways of breaking theconditionality that feeds the extremes on both sides.The hope remains that  at the core of both the Israeliand the Palestinian populations  the desire for peaceand reconciliation is stronger than the delirium of fearand hatred.Malta always views the problem of Palestinefrom the perspective of its effect on issues of securityand cooperation in the Mediterranean. Our membershipof the European Union will provide us with enhancedopportunities to intensify our traditional role in thisregard.Progress in the process of Euro-Mediterraneancooperation has been slow but steady since theEuropean Union launched its Euro-Mediterraneaninitiative in 1995. The process has itself been affectedby the vicissitudes of the situation in Palestine overthese years. Yet the general trend has remainedpositive  even in the most difficult of times.The recent resolution of the Lockerbie issuefurther helps in creating the right atmosphere forenhanced regional cooperation.It is now our hope that the work of theSecretary-General  accompanied by the efforts ofpersuasion of the European Union  will succeed inresolving one of the still outstanding problems in ourregion — the problem of Cyprus. Malta wouldwelcome in May next year the integration of a reunitedCyprus into the folds of the European Union.One of the major strengths of the Euro-Mediterranean process lies in the linkage that itmaintains between security issues and wider issues ofcooperation in the economic and humanitarian fields.In his report this year  the Secretary-General underlinesthe fact that issues related to development form animportant part of the commitments undertaken underthe Millennium Declaration. The Secretary-Generalnotes that a stronger consensus has been forged on thisissue. But he also cautions that grave doubts remain asto whether Member States are sufficiently determinedto act on this consensus.The failure of the World Trade Organizationmeeting in Cancún last week highlights the difficultiesinherent in translating broad consensus into concreteaction. In the area of trade  as in other areas ofdevelopment  it is indeed the case that globalizationhas exposed a major disequilibrium and greatinequalities in the international arena. In some respectsit has also exacerbated the injustices arising from those27 inequalities. There is an even greater need  therefore for the international community to persevere in itsefforts towards more concrete and effective measuresof consensus-building. The high-level meeting onHIV/AIDS that recently concluded highlights the wayin which problems that have a global dimension needto be tackled.The problem of AIDS also underlines theimportance of continuing efforts towards norm-settingin the various dimensions of international life.The practice of holding annual treaty events instituted following the Millennium Summit  hasproved its value in this regard. This year’s event isfocusing on Treaties against transnational organizedcrime and terrorism. On that occasion  Malta will bedepositing its ratification of the United NationsConvention against Transnational Organized Crime andtwo of its protocols. We will have thus already ratifiedor acceded to 11 of the 15 Treaties on which theSecretary-General has focused for this year’s event.One area where norm setting is in its early stagesconcerns the issue of cloning. Malta approaches thisissue from a moral and ethical standpoint based on thedeepest respect for human life. We believe that whilescientific considerations are sometimes relevant inmatters of this nature  final decisions must primarily bebased on fundamental human  ethical and moralconsiderations. In this spirit  the draft resolutionproposing a convention that bans all forms of humancloning fully reflects our views. For this reason we willsupport this draft resolution. At the same time  we alsobelieve that on issues of such deep ethical and moralsensitivity  real progress can only be achieved throughconsensus.The issues before the General Assembly are manyand wide-ranging. Such a dense and varied agendaconfirms the relevance and vitality of our Organization.At the same time  it also points to the problemsregarding the effectiveness and functionality aboutwhich so many of us are concerned.I trust that under your guidance  Mr. President the Assembly will find the wisdom and energy toclearly define its priorities and take the necessaryaction. I wish you every success in your endeavours."
"115",4721,"MMR",58,2003,"﻿Allow me  at the outset  toextend my warm felicitations to you  Sir  on yourassumption of the presidency of the fifty-eighth sessionof the General Assembly. Your vast experience anddiplomatic skills augur well for the success of ourdeliberations. I would also like to express our gratitudeand appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan for his invaluable contribution to the success of theprevious session of the General Assembly. We also paytribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless effortsin leading the Organization through challenging times.We are meeting at a time when the world is facingdaunting challenges. In addition to the perennialproblems of extreme poverty  the spread of infectiousdiseases such as HIV/AIDS and environmentaldegradation  we are faced with the challenge posed bynew forms of terrorism. We must confront all thosechallenges squarely if we are to fulfil the vision ofglobal prosperity and collective security set out in theDeclaration of the Millennium Summit  three yearsago.The United Nations has a vital role to play inensuring peace and security. Myanmar firmly believesthat the Organization must be revitalized to accomplishour objectives. We cannot overcome the complexproblems that beset our world without universalcommitment to multilateralism and a reaffirmation offaith in the central role of the United Nations in thepromotion of global peace and security. Theimportance of multilateralism and the need forcountries to strictly abide by the principles ofinternational law cannot be overemphasized. Indeed Member States  both large and small  have an interestand a responsibility to uphold the Charter of the UnitedNations.More than ever before  our world needs greaterinternational solidarity and cooperation. In that respect we welcome the intention of the Secretary-General toreform the United Nations into a more effectiveOrganization.15My delegation also shares the Secretary-General'sconcern that the pre-emptive use of force could setprecedents that could result in a proliferation of theunilateral and lawless use of force  with or withoutjustification.Recent attacks by terrorists in Baghdad  Bali Casablanca  Jakarta  Jerusalem  Mumbai and otherplaces serve to remind us of the grim fact that the fightagainst terrorism is not over. It is evident that the useof force alone cannot wipe out terrorism. If we wish toachieve enduring results  we must address suchfundamental problems as the persistence of extremepoverty  the disparity of income between and withincountries  racial and religious prejudice and attemptsby some countries to impose their values on small anddeveloping countries.Terrorism poses a common threat to humankind.It respects neither borders nor religion nor race. Allnations must therefore join hands to meet the challengeposed by terrorists. It is only through increasedcooperation at the national  regional and internationallevels that we can hope to overcome that menace. Iwish to reiterate that Myanmar is against all forms ofterrorism. We have had bitter experiences withterrorism in our own country and we are firmlycommitted to work with the international community toprevent  counter and eliminate that terrible scourge ofhumankind.Last month  terrorists brought their war to thedoorsteps of our Organization when they attacked theUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad. They took thelives of 22 people  including that of Mr. Sergio Vieirade Mello  one of the most outstanding internationalcivil servants. We join the rest of the world in payingtribute to his memory and profess our profound sadnessover the loss of the life of the Special Representative and of other lives  in that unwarranted attack.I would now like to turn to recent politicaldevelopments in my country. Some have accused us ofdeliberately creating a political impasse in order todelay the transfer of power. If one takes a close andobjective look at the situation in the country  one willsee that what needs to be done to effect a smoothtransition to democracy is  first and foremost  to havethe political will to do so. Let me assure the GeneralAssembly that we have that political will. We arefirmly committed to bringing about a systematictransformation to democracy. In the past  successiveGovernments in Myanmar failed in their attempts tobuild a multiparty democratic system  because theywere unable to overcome the fundamental issues facingthe nation  namely  the issues of peace and stability national unity among all national races   whichnumber more than 100   economic development andhuman resources development. Attempts were madewithout first solving those fundamental problems; thecountry drifted and the people suffered.The present Government  aware of the fact thatfundamental issues must first be addressed  adopted adifferent approach. It laid down four politicalobjectives: first  to establish peace and stability in thewhole nation and to ensure the prevalence of law andorder; secondly  to consolidate unity among all nationalraces; thirdly  to strive for a durable Constitution; and fourthly  to build a modern and democratic nation inkeeping with the new Constitution.At the outset  an olive branch was extended to thearmed groups that had been fighting the Governmentfor decades. Following successful negotiations  thosegroups returned to the legal fold. National unity wasachieved. Peace now reigns in the entire country providing an opportunity for long-neglected borderareas to develop quickly. The gap between urban andrural areas has been narrowed. At the same time  wehave taken developmental initiatives to promote abetter life for our peoples. We have worked tirelessly toprovide better health care  education and housing forall our peoples. We have had to rebuild the countryfrom scratch.Those who come to Myanmar will be able toobserve at first hand the immense transformationstaking place in the country. As the adage goes  seeingis believing. Today our people can look forward to thefuture with confidence and renewed hope. Now thatfirm foundations have been laid  we have moved on tothe next phase to commence work on the drafting of anew Constitution and to build a modern democraticnation in keeping with it.The new Prime Minister  General Khin Nyunt who was appointed on 25 August 2003  outlined a roadmap for the transition to democracy. The seven-stepprogramme includes  first  the reconvening of theNational Convention  which has been adjourned since1996; secondly  after the successful holding of theNational Convention  the step-by-step implementationof the process necessary for the emergence of a16genuine and disciplined democratic system; thirdly  thedrafting of a new Constitution in accordance with basicprinciples and the detailed basic principles to be laiddown by the National Convention; fourthly  theadoption of the Constitution through a nationalreferendum; fifthly  the holding of free and fairelections for pyithu hluttaws  or legislative bodies according to the new Constitution; sixthly  theconvening of hluttaws attended by hluttaw members inaccordance with the new Constitution; and  seventhly the building of a modern  developed and democraticnation by the State leaders elected by the hluttaw  theGovernment and other central organs formed by thehluttaw. All strata of the country's population haveadopted a unified approach and supported the roadmap.In recent weeks  Myanmar has taken substantialsteps on the road to democracy. It is important that theinternational community recognize those positivechanges; credit must be given where credit is due.Myanmar is working to ensure an environment inwhich we can achieve our objectives. The people ofMyanmar are enthusiastic about consolidating theprogress achieved thus far. At the same time  we seekto maintain good and friendly relations with allcountries in the region and in the rest of the world sothat we can thrive and prosper. We have never posed asecurity threat to any neighbour  and we have alwayssought to promote regional peace and stability and thecommon weal of all our nations.It is disconcerting that some countries havechosen to turn a blind eye to reality and have subjectedMyanmar to a wide array of unfair economic sanctionsfor their own political ends. Those unilateral coercivemeasures not only go against the spirit and the letter ofthe Charter of the United Nations  but also violateinternational law and rules of international trade. Theyare intrinsically unfair and only add to the hardships ofpeople already marginalized by globalization.Countries that place a high premium on democracy andhuman rights have a responsibility to live up to thosenoble ideals in their relations with others. Our commonaspirations to peace and development can be fulfilledonly if nations avoid double standards and adopt amore positive attitude.We live in challenging and dangerous times.Conflicts and tensions in various parts of the worldthreaten global peace and security. Transnationalcrimes and new forms of terrorism also add to ourproblems. Yet it is in our power to make the world abetter place. Here  it is pertinent to recall what I statedlast year in this hallowed Hall: if we want to ensure abetter future for mankind  we must heed the teachingsof the world's great religions. Every religion calls fortolerance  understanding and compassion for fellowhuman beings. Only when we can overcome anger andhatred and do away with false pride and prejudice willwe succeed in establishing a world in which peace andjustice prevail.All conflicts  rivalries and hostilities have theirroots in hatred and enmity. We must try to overcomethem. We should all try to build a global order wherethe strong will not impose their will on the weak andwhere democracy prevails not only within nations  butalso in the international arena. Let us work together  asa family of nations  to overcome the serious commonchallenges that we face."
"116",4778,"MNG",58,2003,"﻿May I extendmy heartfelt congratulations to the President for hisunanimous election as President of the fifty-eighthsession of the United Nations General Assembly andexpress my confidence that under his able stewardshipthis session will successfully accomplish its mission.For the 58-year-old United Nations  which hasbeen working throughout to maintain internationalpeace and security  the promotion of human rights andfundamental freedoms and to foster development andprogress  the passing year has proved to be achallenging period. Moreover  we feel deeplyconcerned that the United Nations and its staffmembers  who dedicate their lives to helping peoplesand countries affected by wars and armed conflictshave turned into targets of terrorist acts. But it is ourearnest belief that the noble mission of the late SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  Mr. SergioVieira de Mello  and other United Nations staffmembers who lost their precious lives while helpingand assisting the people of Iraq  will not be in vain.At the Millennium Summit  held at the turn of anew century  world leaders reaffirmed theircommitment to the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations Charter and proclaimed their firmresolve to work together towards a more efficient andrevitalized United Nations.However  the emergence of a complexinternational situation and its subsequent developmentscast into doubt the ability of the United Nations todevelop a fast and adequate response to internationalcrises  to maintain international peace and security  toprevent armed conflicts  to resolve pressing issues inwar-torn countries and effectively assist them inbuilding national reconciliation and reconstruction.Even more important  the relevance of the UnitedNations itself has been put into question.It is therefore incumbent upon us to reaffirmanew  at the highest level  our shared commitment toimplement the Millennium Development Goalsunanimously adopted at the Summit and to reiterate theimportance of enhancing the role of the United Nationsand multilateralism in addressing the formidablechallenges of the twenty-first century.Mongolia has consistently supported the UnitedNations as the singular world Organization to serve theinterests of its Member States and as a principalinstrument of multilateral cooperation  given itsunderlying purposes and principles as well as itsuniversal representation. Mongolia stands for areformed and revitalized United Nations  adapted to theevolving international realities  for its enhanced roleand greater involvement in all areas pertaining to themaintenance of international peace and security resolution of pressing economic and social issues andpromotion of sustainable development.As its practical contribution to United Nationspeacekeeping operations  Mongolia endeavours toprovide the relevant personnel to its various missionsand supports the efforts to make peace-buildingmissions more effective with an increased emphasis onpreventive diplomacy. While emphasizing theincreasing importance of ensuring the safety andsecurity of United Nations personnel engaged inpeacekeeping and humanitarian missions  mydelegation fully endorses the additional measuresrecently adopted by the Security Council to this effect.Mongolia has signed the Convention on the Safety ofUnited Nations and Associated Personnel and intendsto ratify it in the near future.My delegation shares the concern over the slowpace of the reform process of the United Nationsinitiated by the Secretary-General a few years ago.Hence  we believe that there is an urgent need to speedup the reform through identifying innovativeapproaches so that the United Nations and its SecurityCouncil are able to effectively address the challengesahead.Mongolia reiterates its support for a just andequitable enlargement of the Security Council byincreasing the number of permanent and non-permanent seats and ensuring representation of bothdeveloping and developed countries  reviewing theveto power and democratizing working methods of theSecurity Council through enhancing the openness andtransparency of its work. We support the proposal ofthe Secretary-General to establish a high-level panel ofeminent personalities entrusted with a mandate toconduct a comprehensive analysis of evolvingchallenges and ways of strengthening the UnitedNations.Some are portraying the contours of today'sworld as unipolar. Others are challenging this  arguingfor a multi-polar world. It seems unreasonable to seekto command humankind and the patterns of its6existence under any particular roof or leadership  or totry to tear it apart into different directions.In today's world  characterized by globalizationand interdependence  it has become increasinglyevident that  despite divergent views  we all live in oneglobal village  breathe the same air and share acommon future. Mutual understanding and cooperationare becoming the order of the day  rather than division fragmentation  marginalization or discrimination.Indeed  contemporary human philosophy teaches us notto alienate or estrange  but  rather  to interact and alignwith one another.In addition to the traditional threats emanatingfrom the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the spread of missile technology and inter- and- intra-State conflicts  non-traditional threats  includingterrorism  organized crime  illegal drug trafficking scarce drinking water  environmental pollution andglobal climate change  are having adverse effects onregional and international security.As a State party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  conventionsbanning chemical and biological weapons and theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  Mongoliadeems it important to ensure their universality; toaddress disarmament issues in a comprehensivemanner; to further reduce all types of weapons; to helpthe Conference on Disarmament to break through itsongoing impasse; and to strengthen monitoringmechanisms for the relevant multilateral treaties andagreements.As a nuclear-weapon-free country  Mongoliaactively supports the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in other parts of the world. Mongoliabelieves that the nuclear-weapon States should providesecurity guarantees to non-nuclear-weapon States andStates parties to the NPT  and supports the conclusionof a multilateral treaty to that effect.Mongolia is in favour of a nuclear-free Koreanpeninsula and of a peaceful resolution of theDemocratic People's Republic of Korea's nuclearprogramme issue. In this regard  we are in favour ofcontinuing the relevant multilateral talks.Mongolia fully supports the efforts beingundertaken by the international community to revivethe Middle East peace process and to implement theroad map  and supports the establishment of a just anddurable peace in the region  on the basis of ensuringthe legitimate interests of the parties concerned.Mongolia shares the concern of other nations overthe precarious situation and continued loss of life inIraq despite the termination of major combatoperations. Mongolia is in favour of an increased roleand involvement of the United Nations in restoringpeace and stability in Iraq and in providinghumanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people.With the rapid advance of globalization andtechnological breakthroughs  we deem it important tocreate an enabling environment for all countries  especially weak  small or vulnerable economies  equally to benefit from globalization  and for theinternational community to offer support and assistanceto those countries in their social and economicdevelopment and to enhance global partnerships fordevelopment.Recent years have been marked by an increasedemphasis on social and development issues  resultingin a host of international conferences on sustainabledevelopment  financing for development and foodsecurity  all organized under the auspices of the UnitedNations. The speedy implementation  at the national regional and international levels  of the decisions takenat the social summits  as well as efforts to achieve thegoals agreed by the Millennium Summit and atMonterrey  Johannesburg and Rome  have become thetop priority of the world community. The recentCancun Ministerial Conference of the World TradeOrganization has revealed the complexity of theprocess  leading to a new round of talks on the DohaDevelopment Agenda.Growing development disparities between havesand have-nots; increasing poverty and unemploymentin the developing world  in particular the leastdeveloped countries; the spread of HIV/AIDS; the debtburden and trade inequalities  and the furtheraggravation of such pressing issues remain ourimmediate cause of concern. We cannot ignore the factthat underdevelopment  poverty and social inequalitycould serve as a breeding ground for confrontationsand armed conflicts. Hence  it has become imperativefor the international community to display genuinesolidarity and shared responsibility for our commongood.International cooperation is crucial in effectivelyaddressing environmental challenges  including natural7disasters  global climate change  air and waterpollution  and desertification. In this respect  small andpoor nations warrant greater attention and support.Mongolia commends the outcome of the firstInternational Ministerial Conference of Landlockedand Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countriesand International Financial and DevelopmentInstitutions on Transit Transport Cooperation  held inAlmaty  Kazakhstan  in August this year  under theauspices of the United Nations. We consider that thetimely and expeditious implementation of the AlmatyPlan of Action will help landlocked developingcountries to become actively engaged in globaleconomic integration.Fifty-five years have elapsed since the adoptionby the Assembly of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. The relevance of this fundamentaldocument has stood the test of time  as its underlyingideals have been enshrined in both international treatiesand conventions and in national legislation  thusbecoming the universal norms of humankind. The ideascontained in the Universal Declaration of HumanRights have been carefully integrated into Mongolia's1992 Constitution  and my country is firmly pursuingpolicies to consolidate democracy and to protect andpromote human rights and fundamental freedoms.Thirteen years ago  Mongolia irreversiblyembarked on the road to democracy and hasendeavoured to make its own contribution to the causeof promoting democratic ideals. Earlier this monthMongolia hosted the Fifth International Conference ofNew or Restored Democracies  which resulted in theadoption of the Ulaanbaatar Declaration and Plan ofAction. More than 600 representatives from 119countries and a host of international and non-governmental organizations participated in theConference  thoroughly discussing and sharing theirexperiences on a wide range of issues under the maintheme of Democracy  Good Governance and CivilSociety'. It is gratifying to note that the Conferencesuccessfully completed its ambitious agenda. Mydelegation will actively collaborate with others inensuring effective follow-up to the implementation ofthe Ulaanbaatar Declaration and the Plan of Action atthe national  regional and international levels.The State and Government of Mongolia arepursuing an open and multifaceted foreign policy andundertaking specific measures to consolidate thedemocratic reforms with a view to ensuring human-centred development and human security  promotingand protecting human rights and fundamentalfreedoms  fostering political and economic stabilityand achieving sustained economic growth.In conclusion  may I express my confidence thatdeliberations on the pressing issues before theinternational community during this session of theGeneral Assembly will be productive and result insound decisions that contribute to the strengthening ofinternational peace and security and the advancementof social progress and development. In this context you may rest assured  Sir  of the continued support andfull cooperation of my delegation."
"117",4819,"MOZ",58,2003,"﻿Allow me  at the outset  tojoin previous speakers in congratulating you  Sir  onyour election as President of the fifty-eighth session ofthe General Assembly. We would also like to commendyour predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for the manner inwhich he guided the proceedings of the Assemblyduring the previous session. I would likewise like tocommend the Secretary-General for his relentlessefforts to turn the United Nations into an effectiveinstrument for international cooperation in the searchfor  and the preservation of  peace and security.The United Nations family has recently lost someof its best servants. We mourn  in particular  the tragicdeath of Sergio Vieira de Mello  a dedicated servant ofour Organization. We would like to reiterate ourdeepest condolences to the United Nations  theGovernment of Brazil and Sergio’s family.We also mourn the passing away of Anna Lindh Sweden’s Minister for Foreign Affairs  who was anoutstanding diplomat and defender of the UnitedNations. Her departure is a major loss for humankind as she fought for a world order in which every nationcould live in peace  harmony and prosperity. We wishto reiterate our heartfelt condolences to the people andGovernment of Sweden  as well as to her bereavedfamily.2I have come to this session of the GeneralAssembly as a messenger of the peoples ofMozambique  and of Africa as a whole — a messengerof peoples who are engaged in consolidating political economic and social reforms. Today more than everbefore  the peoples of Africa believe in the strength oftheir will  cohesion and unity. They believe in realizingthe potential of their human and natural resources andcapacities. They believe in learning from pastexperiences  good and bad  to restore peace andstability and to generate wealth and prosperitythroughout the continent. The peoples of Africa areemulating the experiences of countries like my own Mozambique  where after years of armed conflict anew era of peace and gradual  but steady  developmenthas been taking place during the past 11 years. Duringthose 11 years  we have made continuous progress inconsolidating peace and democracy. We are nowengaged in the process of preparing for our secondmunicipal elections  which will be held on 19November 2003. In 2004 Mozambique will hold itsthird general and multiparty elections to elect thePresident as well as members of Parliament. The peaceand socio-economic stability that prevail in our countryhave created an enabling environment for domestic andforeign investment  which are pivotal for thegeneration of employment and for the reduction ofpoverty.The gross domestic product of Mozambique’seconomy grew at an encouraging rate of 7.7 per centlast year  which has resulted in increased social-serviceallocations in the national budget. That is all the moreimportant given the fact that Mozambique  like manyother countries in southern Africa  is still facing ahumanitarian crisis that is the result of continuingunfavourable weather patterns that have stricken theentire region for several years. We urge theinternational community to respond favourably to therecently launched appeal for humanitarian assistancefor southern Africa.As part of its efforts to fight poverty  theGovernment is implementing a plan of action for theeradication of absolute poverty  which aims to maintainthe current average economic growth rate of 8 per centand to reduce absolute poverty to below 50 per cent by2010. With the objective of creating a national visionfor development in the next 25 years  the Governmentof Mozambique has launched its Agenda 2025  anational strategy for the future of the country based ona constructive dialogue with all political parties andstakeholders.Last July  Mozambique had the honour of hostingthe Second Assembly of the Heads of State andGovernment of the African Union. During thatAssembly  we took important decisions that laid downthe foundations of the African Union and that willcontribute to the effective implementation of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). Asexpressed in the Maputo Declaration  the commitmentand political will of African countries to take effectiveand concrete measures towards the implementation ofNEPAD reflects the recognition of the fact that theprimary responsibility for the implementation of thatinitiative rests with the peoples and Governments ofAfrica.In the course of the past two years  in order togive coherence to NEPAD matters within AfricanGovernments  we have emphasized the creation of aninstitutional framework to oversee the implementationof NEPAD at the regional level so as to integrateNEPAD priorities into our national developmentprogrammes and create institutions to manage thosepriorities. In that connection  we must also highlightthe fact that NEPAD includes an African Peer ReviewMechanism  whose objective is to foster the adoptionof policies  standards and practices conducive topolitical stability  high economic growth  sustainabledevelopment and accelerated regional and continentalintegration. We have already assembled a “panel ofwise persons” to lend its assistance to the reviewprocess that will soon be under way.International support for the implementation ofNEPAD is essential. NEPAD should be the frameworkwithin which the international community  includingthe United Nations system  concentrates its efforts onAfrica’s development. In that connection  Africa’sdevelopment partners are urged to continue to lendtheir assistance  with a view to translating into realitytheir pledges of support to NEPAD.That is the main agenda of the African Union which seeks to build a strong foundation fordemocracy  good governance  peace  stability andsustainable development  as well as to create betterliving conditions for all of Africa’s peoples. Werecognize that that represents a colossal challenge forpresent and future generations of African leaders  as itwas when we created the Organization of African3Unity (OAU) 40 years ago and committed ourselves toliberating Africa as our main goal.In Maputo we have also dealt with the issues ofpeace and security  for they continue to be the majorchallenge in Africa. It is for that reason that we havereiterated the importance of the entry into force of thePeace and Security Council  which will be an importantbody of the African Union that will deal with issuesrelated to conflict prevention  management andresolution.Step by step  and with the continued support ofthe international community  Africa is steadilydischarging its responsibilities for the maintenance ofpeace and stability in the continent.In keeping with the OAU Algiers Summitdecision of 1999 on unconstitutional change ofGovernment  the coordinated action of the AfricanUnion  the Community of the Portuguese-SpeakingCountries  the Economic Community of CentralAfrican States  Nigeria  South Africa and other keyplayers  enabled President Fradique de Menezes of SaoTome and Principe to return to power  foiling anattempted unconstitutional change of Government.The recent positive developments in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  including theformation of the Transitional Government and theParliament  the appointment of army commandstructures and the deployment of the forces of theUnited Nations Organization Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) inBunia  have lent new momentum to the peace processin that country. We must not allow that process to bederailed. All of us  including neighbouring countries have an obligation to support the Congolese people andits Government in their long struggle for peace andstability.Following the departure of President Taylor fromLiberia  on 18 August 2003  we witnessed the signingat Accra  Ghana  of the Comprehensive PeaceAgreement. That Agreement covers a wide range ofissues  including the cessation of hostilities. Moreimportantly  it provides for the establishment of atransitional Government that will assume itsresponsibilities on 14 October 2003 until the holding ofcredible general elections in October 2005.Allow me pay well-deserved tribute to PresidentKufuor of Ghana and President Obasanjo of Nigeria and indeed to all the member States of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)  fortheir critical role in that process. Regional leadershipand international support for the peace process inLiberia will be meaningless if Liberians themselves failto meet their obligations regarding peace and stabilityin their country. We would also like to commend theSecurity Council for its action on Liberia in support ofECOWAS efforts. We welcome the adoption ofresolution 1509 (2003)  which established the UnitedNations Mission in Liberia.With respect to Burundi  we Africans havedischarged our responsibilities by establishing anAfrican mission in Burundi. In that context  I am happyto inform the General Assembly that  prior to mydeparture from Maputo  I bid farewell to theMozambican contingent of peacekeepers to bedeployed to Burundi. They are joining South Africanand Ethiopian forces in a clear demonstration of ourcommitment to peace and stability in Burundi and inthe subregion. In that regard  I would like to take thisopportunity to express our gratitude to the BritishGovernment for the assistance it has extended to us.We appeal to the Security Council to adopt aresolution formally endorsing that mission  and to takethe necessary measures to provide political  financialand logistical support to it. Failure to act decisivelywill lead to a deterioration of the situation  with seriousimplications for the stability of Burundi and thesubregion.The African Union and ECOWAS took promptmeasures after the recent coup d’état in Guinea-Bissauto help the people of that country to return toconstitutional legality. We are pleased to inform theAssembly that they have already selected by consensusa President and Prime Minister  who are going to lead atransitional Government. They have also developedother bodies to prepare the country for elections  whichare to be held soon. We appeal to the internationalcommunity to render its valuable assistance to Guinea-Bissau so that it will be able to overcome its dramaticsocial and economic situation as soon as possible.In the Horn of Africa  we must continue toencourage Ethiopia and Eritrea to work together  withthe support of the United Nations  to strengthen peace stability and good neighbourliness and to overcome thedifficulties that continue to exist. The ongoing peace4processes in Sudan and Somalia raise our hopes thatlasting peace will soon be achieved in the region.We welcome the lifting of sanctions against Libyaand the settlement reached between all partiesconcerned  which will enable us to bring that issue to aclose.The stabilization of the situation in Angola Comoros and Sierra Leone are clear signs that  despitethe difficulties  Africa is making strides towards theattainment of lasting peace  stability and socio-economic development.The peoples of Africa are fully engaged inbuilding a continent of hope. The African Union  alongwith the regional economic communities  is committedto addressing the challenges faced by the continent.Africa is endowed with human and natural resourcesthat can contribute decisively to African development.What we need is an opportunity to integrate ourselvesinto the world economy; an opportunity to benefit fromglobalization and increased interdependence; anopportunity to benefit from liberalized trade  financeand investment  instead of suffering frommarginalization and exclusion; and an opportunity foraccess to science and technology  in particularinformation technology.That will be possible if  among other things  theinternational community continues to seek viable andeffective ways and means to address the debt burden the low levels of official development assistance andforeign direct investment and the issue of marketaccess for African products in developed countries.With regard to the latter  we are disappointed that theCancún conference failed to produce positive results.The recent tragic events that have claimed somany innocent lives are a painful reminder of the factthat international terrorism continues to represent aserious threat to peace and security in the world. Thoseevents have also further demonstrated that no countryis immune from the scourge of terror and that we willhave to take concerted action to effectively address thatissue. The United Nations remains the most appropriateforum to find the best ways and means to combatterrorism.In recent times  some sceptical people havewondered whether the United Nations has lost itscredibility and relevance. The answer is clear: the roleof the United Nations as the main instrument for themaintenance of international peace and security hastoday been vindicated more than ever before. As theSecretary-General has correctly pointed out  it isthrough the United Nations that we can all find themuch-sought legitimacy of action in tackling issues ofcommon concern  including threats to peace andsecurity  and in addressing the challenges ofsustainable development and HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis malaria and other infectious diseases.The Millennium Development Goals remain themost significant targets agreed by the internationalcommunity  as they cover the major areas of concern tothe peoples of the world.Since the adoption of the MillenniumDeclaration  experience has shown that attaining itsgoals requires greater international solidarity andcooperation.By virtue of its universality  the United Nationshas shown that it has the political and moral authorityto tackle not only the issues I have outlined  but also allother issues of concern to mankind. The Organizationmust therefore be strengthened  safeguarded andadequately funded. It is for those reasons that we mustcontinue to support the Secretary-General and theUnited Nations as they shoulder their responsibilities inlaying the foundations for a just and lasting peace andfor socio-economic development worldwide. We inAfrica reiterate our firm commitment to make ourcontribution to the United Nations."
"118",4865,"MRT",58,2003,"﻿On behalf of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania  Ishould like to convey to you  Sir  our warmestcongratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. I amconvinced that your great wisdom and wealth ofexperience will guarantee the success of our work. Iwould also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. JanKavan  former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister forForeign Affairs of the Czech Republic  who guided thework of the previous session with great skill andability.I would also like to express congratulations andgreat appreciation to the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  and all his associates  for theiroutstanding and tireless efforts to achieve the nobleideals of our Organization. I would also like to expressour satisfaction with the action taken since the previoussession of the General Assembly  in particular themeeting in New York of the Commission onSustainable Development  which addressed measuresand priorities envisaged for implementingrecommendations of the Monterrey Conference onFinancing for Development  the decisions of theJohannesburg Summit and the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.I note particularly the efforts to facilitate accessfor poor countries to quality medicines to combatendemic diseases.The hideous murder of Mr. Sergio Vieira deMello  Special Representative of the Secretary-General  together with a number of his closestassociates  in the terrorist attack on the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad profoundly shocked anddistressed us. The increase of terrorism and itsconsequences in terms of fear and human and materialdestruction require the international community to stepup consultations  cooperation and coordination andstrengthen efforts to tackle the dangers that threaten allhumankind.Achieving the objectives of development security and stability hinges strongly on howeffectively we handle the challenges of extremism andterrorism. My country  while stating its commitment torelevant Security Council resolutions  reiterates itsabsolute and firm condemnation and denunciation ofviolence and terrorism in all its forms and reaffirms itssupport for all regional and international efforts andinitiatives to combat this scourge.Given the global nature of terrorism  the fightagainst it must necessarily be global in nature and beunderpinned by an intellectual and cultural dimensionbased on the complementarity of civilizations andabsolute rejection of any clash or conflict betweenthem.We also must not overlook the impact ofimbalance in the development levels of rich and poorcountries  since poverty and social  scientific andtechnological under-development are primary causes oftension and sources of violence and extremism.There can be no doubt that maintenance of peaceand security around the world requires a greater rolefor the United Nations and the strengthening ofinternational law. My country therefore notes withsatisfaction the acceptance by the Palestinian Authorityand the Israeli Government of the road map assubmitted by the Quartet. This framework offers afresh opportunity to establish a just and lasting peace inthe interest of all peoples of the region  ensuring therestoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinianpeople  including the right to establish an independentState with Jerusalem as its capital  pursuant to thedecisions of the Madrid Conference  the principles ofland for peace and Security Council resolutions 242(1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978).My country stresses the importance it attaches tothe demand that Israel withdraw from the occupiedArab territories and that negotiations be resumedimmediately  as the only way towards peace andsecurity in the Middle East.On the question of Iraq  we welcome theestablishment of the new transitional IraqiGovernment  while stressing our concern for theindependence of that fraternal country  its sovereignty the safety and security of its people and its territorialintegrity.Regarding the question of the Western Sahara Mauritania supports the steps taken by the Secretary-General and his personal envoy  Mr. James Baker aimed at seeking a permanent solution that guaranteesstability in the region and enjoys the agreement of allparties.28As regards the positive developments in theLockerbie crisis  we express our satisfaction at thesolution reached between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyaand the parties concerned. We also welcome the liftingof sanctions against Libya by the Security Council.Regarding the African continent  we welcome theestablishment of African Union institutions and organswhich will help resolve conflicts in the continent andrespond to the aspirations of African peoples toprogress and development. We also wish to express oursatisfaction with the New Partnership for Africa'sDevelopment (NEPAD)  which is aimed at enhancingregional cooperation in order to achieve economicintegration in the continent. We are also pleased by thesupport given to this initiative by our developmentpartners.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania  under theleadership of the President of the Republic Mr. Maaouya Ould Sid' Ahmed Taya  is peaceablypursuing its course towards progress and development inspired by the comprehensive and coherent vision of asocietal project that meets national aspirations andoffers real prospects for social advancement modernization and openness within the context of aState governed by law  justice and equality.That strategy focuses on combating ignorance andilliteracy  and on spreading scientific and otherknowledge by promoting books and reading as part of alarge-scale national programme entitled Knowledgefor all'  launched by His Excellency the President ofthe Republic  to which  over the past few years  3 percent of the State budget has been allocated annually.That leading-edge programme  regarded around theworld as one of the best cultural projects  involves inits first stage the establishment of 1 000 libraries inmajor population centres  particularly in rural areas equipped with books and reference works relating tovarious fields of professional  cultural and social life.This significant network of cultural institutions isstriving to instil the habit of reading among allsegments of society and within all age groups. It alsohelps to disseminate a civic spirit to promote soundthinking  combat ignorance   illiteracy andprofessional and cultural ignorance   in order tostrengthen and supplement the efforts made in that areaby the competent agencies. The implementationexecution of that programme follows a participatoryapproach that offers the populations concerned andcivil society organizations a basic monitoring andfollow-up role. All the major societal forces havemobilized under the programme  and our citizenryunderstands its scope and the importance.By opting for that strategic approach  our countryis embracing a vision in which human dignity  freedom equality and social justice  the consolidation of noblehuman values  the preservation of safety and securityand social peace around the world and comprehensive fair and balanced development are all noble objectivesthat can be achieved or maintained only through thetotal eradication of ignorance  illiteracy and culturaland intellectual underdevelopment.The basic focuses of this strategy also include theprotection of women's rights as a dynamic factor ofsociety  and increasing the participation of women inthe various fields of national life. The same is true ofchildhood development and the protection of the rightsof children. In that context  appropriate legalinstruments have been promulgated and a policy ofdevelopment has been built around those priorities which have accelerated the pace of human and socialdevelopment indicators.It has been possible through substantive reformsto launch private enterprise and to create a favourableclimate for investment  despite the impact of thecurrent world economic situation. The national strategyto combat poverty has made it possible to improve theliving standards and conditions of the population  withthe widespread provision of basic social services suchas health  education  water  energy andtelecommunications. It should be noted that thoseresults could not have been achieved without a climateof security and stability promoted by a regime ofpluralistic democracy that has eliminated all forms ofexclusion  opened the path to effective citizenparticipation  promoted all individual and collectivefreedoms and given particular attention to thepromotion of human rights.The United Nations Charter reflects the commonaspirations of the peoples of the world to achieve theirfundamental objectives  including safeguardinginternational peace and security. The profound changesin the international scene call for the revision of thestructural organization of the United Nations  in orderto adapt it to the new realities and in keeping with itsobjectives. In that regard  it would seem pertinent to29reconsider the system of representation within theSecurity Council.We sincerely hope that the internationalcommunity will pool its efforts to enhance internationalsolidarity and build a new international order based onlaw and justice  one that safeguards peace and securityand guarantees a decent life for all."
"119",4911,"MUS",58,2003,"﻿Let me firstextend to you  Sir  on behalf of my delegation and inmy own name  our sincere congratulations on yourelection as President of the General Assembly at thissession. Indeed  it is a matter of pride for all smallisland States  and Mauritius in particular  to see youpresiding over the Assembly. My delegation wishes toassure you of its full support and cooperation duringyour tenure of office.Let me also express my Government's deepestappreciation to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr.Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic  for the remarkablemanner in which he presided over the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session and to theSecretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  forhis dedicated leadership of our Organization. I wish toassure him of our full support in his appeal for radicalreforms of our Organization and the setting up of ahigh-level panel to address the issues of peace andsecurity  and institutional reform.Since we were here last autumn  many events ofglobal importance have occurred. The war against Iraqwas waged and hostilities were declared at an end  butpeace and stability in Iraq have yet to be restored.Terrorism has continued relentlessly on its path ofghastly attacks and indiscriminate killing of innocentcivilians. The geographical shift  however  in theterrorist attacks is becoming increasingly a disturbingdevelopment.Multilateralism  which was almost condemned toa premature burial  is being re-energized.Unfortunately  the recurring problems of HIV/AIDS malaria  poverty  lack of development  conflicts and theready supply of small arms and light weapons havecontinued to inflict death and suffering on anunprecedented scale  particularly in Africa.The attack against the United Nations compoundin Baghdad contains countless messages. The mostsignificant of them is that our Organization is in urgentneed of major overhaul and reform  as rightly stated bythe Secretary-General.The premature deaths of the Special Envoy of theSecretary-General to Iraq  the late Sergio Vieira deMello  and other dedicated staff members of the UnitedNations  whom we deeply mourn  should make usreflect on the dangers behind foreign policy initiativesthat undermine or ignore the United Nations.The international community is deeply attachedto the legitimacy the United Nations confers on itsactions. It is our collective duty to refrain from takingany measures likely to weaken it.These horrendous terrorist acts havedemonstrated anew the crucial need for theinternational community to tackle the root causes ofterrorism.As all small islands  we in Mauritius remainhighly vulnerable in respect of our security andterrorist threats. With limited means at our disposal coupled with the multiple demands on our scantyresources  we find that it is only through internationalefforts and cooperation that we can win the war againstterrorism. We are particularly anxious that there shouldbe concerted and sustained action and a commitment tocooperation at the international level with a view toeradicating the scourge of terrorism. All countries mustcooperate to stem the flow of cross-border infiltration.The financing of terrorism and the proceeds oftransnational organized crime need to be closelymonitored.Not winning the war against terrorism as well asthat against transnational organized crime is not anoption for the world today. Mauritius views withconcern that  despite the stated commitment of theinternational community to the cause of disarmament the actions of many countries do not match theirrhetoric.The new challenges to security and disarmamentshould compel us to look anew at the potential threatposed by nuclear weapons and weapons of massdestruction and to pursue more vigorously effortstowards their total elimination.We reiterate our appeal to the nuclear Powers forthe early convening of a conference on nucleardisarmament as a first step towards completedisarmament  keeping in mind that such a regime mustbe comprehensive and non-discriminatory.25Over the last year the international community'sability to tackle political conflicts and find lastingsolutions has been dismal.The situation in the Middle East continues topreoccupy us. Despite the various initiatives  includingthe latest Road Map  violence remains unabated and wefear that recent developments in the region will unleashfurther killings and destruction.No solution will be possible there unless all theprotagonists are taken on board. Exclusion as a policyis destined to fail. We continue to believe that PresidentArafat is an essential part of the solution  and anyattempt to sideline him will be detrimental to any peaceinitiative.We call on both Israel and the PalestinianAuthority to exercise utmost restraint and to pursuetheir efforts for the implementation of the Road Mapwith a view to putting an end to the occupation and thesucceeding generations of Palestinians in refugeecamps. The establishment of a Palestinian State at theearliest should be the priority of the internationalcommunity.The situation in Iraq is disquieting. It is importantthat the Iraqis regain as soon as possible totalsovereignty and assume control over their own destinythrough a democratic process. The United Nations has in the view of my delegation  a leading role to play inthis process and must be empowered to do so.The African continent has been plagued for toolong by conflicts and wars  which have led to the lossof thousands of innocent lives and the squandering ofenormous wealth and resources. Small arms and lightweapons have in fact become the weapons of massdestruction on the African continent. These weaponsdrain African resources and we appeal to thosecountries that manufacture and market those weaponsof destruction to ensure that Africa does not continueto be their killing field.Nonetheless  during the past two years  theAfrican continent has demonstrated an unprecedentedmomentum in its efforts to seriously address theseconflicts and to search for lasting solutions. There is however  some good news out of Africa and everythingis not gloomy.The transformation of the Organization of AfricanUnity into the African Union  the coming intooperation of the various commissions of the Union andthe election of commissioners on a gender-equal basisat the Maputo Summit in July last are clear indicationsthat Africa has chosen a new path and is confident thatit will be able to meet the challenges ahead.It is a matter of great satisfaction that peace isnow slowly returning to the troubled areas on thecontinent. The conflicts in Sierra Leone and Angolahave ended. A government of national unity is in officein the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Efforts underthe auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment (IGAD) for a comprehensive and lastingresolution to the conflict in Somalia have beencrowned with success. We do recognize that years ofconflict will not be easily forgotten  but what isreassuring is that African leaders are maintaining ahands-on approach to these situations.The recent developments in Liberia and therestoration of the constitutional order in Sao Tome andPrincipe confirm the ability of African leaders toeffectively address issues affecting their continent.There is fresh confidence in the African leaders'ability to deal with flashpoints. The implementation ofthe Peace and Security Council of the African Unionwill go a long way towards preventive action beingtaken. We recognize that we will have to bear primaryresponsibility for the peace and security of ourcontinent.The New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD) is our basic instrument of empowerment.Having decided to take our destiny in our own hands we are not going to engage in the blame game  but wewill take action to reverse poverty and to promote goodgovernance. We will do whatever is necessary to attractinvestment. The establishment of the African PeerReview Mechanism within NEPAD will ensure thateconomic development takes place in the spirit of goodgovernance  democracy  transparency andaccountability.It is comforting  therefore  that this homegrownAfrican initiative has received global recognition. Theassistance of the Group of Eight and countries likeIndia in the implementation of the objectives ofNEPAD is much appreciated.We noted with regret that the rate of officialdevelopment assistance to developing countries isdecreasing  contrary to the commitment made inMonterrey.26We therefore call on the developed countries andother key specialized institutions in the monetary financial and development fields to deliver on theirimplementation plans for the Monterrey Consensusduring the October high-level dialogue.Monday's high-level segment on HIV/AIDS  inwhich more than a hundred delegations took part demonstrates the extent of the concern of the UnitedNations membership to the pandemic of HIV/AIDS.We welcome the initiative of the General Assembly tomaintain global awareness of the problem and to ensurethat effective action is taken urgently to stop the spreadof the pandemic.I mentioned earlier the need for reform of ourOrganization. It is imperative that the necessaryreforms of the United Nations be undertaken to reflectin a more realistic manner the political realities in theworld today.The United Nations Charter must be amended toprovide for a Security Council that is more democraticand more representative of today's world. Shouldpermanent membership of the Security Council withveto power be retained  we consider that India shouldbe admitted with such a membership at the earliest.Likewise we believe that the African continent shouldbe adequately represented at the same level.We would also urge a review of the veto power which has been used in the past and continues to beused for purposes outside the letter and spirit of theCharter.May I welcome the decision of the SecurityCouncil to lift the sanctions on the Libyan ArabJamahiriya.The situation of small island developing States(SIDS) will be the focus of attention in September2004  when Mauritius hosts an international meetingfor the 10-year review of the Barbados Programme ofAction. This Barbados +10 meeting will allow us tomake a full assessment of the Programme of Actionand evaluate its success and shortcomings.We need to constantly remind the internationalcommunity about the fragility and vulnerability ofSIDS where ecology and geography combine to inflictirreparable damage.Mauritius and all other small island developingStates attach great importance to this internationalmeeting and hope that it will harness more efforts onthe part of the international community to provide therequired assistance to the small island developingStates. I call on this Assembly to lend the necessarysupport to make this international meeting a success.In this regard  let me express my appreciation tothe Commonwealth and La Francophonie for theiractive interest in supporting the cause of small islandStates.As the current Chairman of the Alliance of SmallIsland States (AOSIS)  may I inform the Assembly thatthe 44 Alliance Member States and Observers considerthe International Meeting to be a very importantoccasion for reaffirming the partnership for sustainabledevelopment that grew out of the Rio Conference. InMauritius next year we expect to establish anappropriate framework for partnership and cooperation.The time has come to enshrine the special case ofSmall Island Developing States as an importantcomponent of focus and attention on the part of theinternational community.We appeal to the international community tosupport this process and ensure the full and effectiveparticipation of all SIDS at the meeting and to ensure as well  its own participation in it.Access to information and communicationtechnologies remains a fundamental concern in Africa.While such technologies are often promoted as aninstrument that will allow countries to leapfrog stagesin development  there is a real fear that the digitaldivide could very well prove to be yet another handicapthat adds to Africa's marginalization.We therefore urge that particular attention be paidto issues of access and infrastructure. My delegationwishes to underscore that Mauritius  like many othersmall island States  has high hopes that the Plan ofAction of the World Summit on the InformationSociety will provide concrete action in favour of smallisland developing States  whose geographical isolation remoteness and other inherent constraints warrantspecial attention.The failure of the World Trade Organization(WTO) Ministerial Conference at Cancun has dealt ablow to the multilateral trading system. That is veryunfortunate  as there are no winners but only losers.For small developing countries in particular  a strongrules-based global trading system provides protection27against the unilateralism of powerful trading countriesor blocs. The serious imbalances in the WTO system coupled with the lack of effective and operational rulesand disciplines to address their development concerns resulted the failure of Cancun. We should pick up thepieces from Cancun and try to construct a tradingsystem that guarantees equity and fairness fordeveloping countries. Only such an approach willprovide the legitimacy that the WTO system so badlyneeds to deliver on the Doha Development Agenda.In order to successfully respond to themultifaceted challenges we are facing in the worldtoday  we are convinced that the internationalcommunity should rededicate itself to the values ofsolidarity  tolerance  mutual respect and cooperation.The belief that countries can be immune fromwhat other countries do is no longer tenable. The needfor international cooperation  rather than confrontation is critical. A new international order is essential if weare to avoid a collision of cultures and religious beliefs.This is the last occasion on which I will addressthe General Assembly in my capacity as PrimeMinister. In six days' time  I will relinquish my currentpost and accede to the presidency  while my DeputyPrime Minister will be sworn in as Prime Minister. Iam confident that he will be accorded the samecollaboration and friendship that I have enjoyed duringmy tenure in office.Before I conclude  however  I renew my appeal tothe United Kingdom to take all measures to completethe process of the decolonization of Mauritius. Foryears  Mauritius has consistently reaffirmed itssovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago  includingDiego Garcia  here and in all international forums. Isincerely regret that this issue has not been resolved. Itherefore reiterate our appeal to the United Kingdom as a country known for its fair play and forchampioning human rights  and to our friends in theUnited States  to engage in a serious dialogue withMauritius over the issue of the Chagos Archipelago sothat an early solution may be found.The removal of the Chagossians under falsepretences resulted in gross violations of human rights.Hopefully this aspect of the matter will be resolvedthrough the British courts shortly.I also appeal to the French Republic  with whichwe have excellent relations  to resume the dialoguewith a view to returning Tromelin island to Mauritiansovereignty.With those words  I bid the Assembly goodbye."
"120",4948,"MWI",58,2003,"﻿First of all Sir  allow me to congratulate you on your election asPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighthsession and also to commend Mr. Jan Kavan for hisoutstanding and astute leadership in presiding over thefifty-seventh session. I should like also to commendSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his dynamism andfor the great leadership qualities he continues todisplay in steering the affairs of the United Nations. Iwish to assure you of Malawi’s continued support andcooperation as we deal with the challenges before us.I would like to express Malawi’s sincerecondolences to the families of the victims of thesenseless and barbaric attack against the headquartersof the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq which resulted in the loss of a number of lives including that of the Special Representative of theSecretary-General  Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. Theattack should serve as a warning of our need to remainfocused on the fight against terrorism to ensure that the20war against that scourge proceeds as a multilateralundertaking. We fully support the call for all thoseresponsible for such attacks to be charged with warcrimes.Time has demonstrated the cardinal place ofmultilateral approaches to international issues andproblems. The Iraq situation has revealed to us all inthe international community the importance ofmultilateralism under the auspices of the UnitedNations  whose central role in addressing internationalconflicts should not be undermined.Let me seize this opportunity to express  onbehalf of the Government and the people of Malawi my gratitude to the United Nations and its agencies  aswell as to other multilateral and bilateral donors  forthe emergency relief assistance given to Malawi and toother countries of southern Africa during the past twoyears  when our people faced a critical food shortagethat threatened millions of lives. Their timelyintervention enabled us to prevent a massive loss oflife. We trust that the international community will alsoassist us in improving our agricultural production so asto prevent the recurrence of famine.Africa continues to experience the effects of thetragedy created by the HIV/AIDS scourge. Ournational budgets are seriously overstretched by thedemands of care  treatment  support and funerals forHIV/AIDS victims  which occur on an hourly basis inan environment of devastating economic decline andfamine. We are losing able-bodied people andprofessional expertise in all the sectors of our societytwo and a half times faster than we can replace them.We are grappling with the problem of caring for tens ofthousands of orphans  whose numbers are increasing atan alarming rate.The bleak and desperate situation created by HIV/AIDS urgently calls for concerted and practicalinternational action to implement the MillenniumDeclaration and Development Goals in the fight againstthis pandemic. I would like to thank all those partnersthat continue to assist us in addressing this seriousproblem.Malawi has paid close attention to the newinternational debate presently taking shape whichadvocates a qualitative paradigm shift from policyframeworks and mere commitments in conferences tothe concrete implementation of an agreed actionprogramme  or what has become known as the NewMultilateralism which aims at addressing the seriousshortcomings of existing multilateral policyprescriptions. The debate also seeks to effect a move inthe right direction. My Government supports thisimportant innovation and  especially  the newly-launched United Nations system wide integratedframework for least developed countries  jointlyworked out by the six core agencies and designed tofacilitate the effective integration of the leastdeveloped economies into the multilateral tradingsystem.We also support the United Nations DevelopmentAssistance Framework (UNDAF) mechanism foreffecting increased coordination and collaboration atthe national level in the preparation of developmentplans and programmes. We are keen to see a better-coordinated and integrated follow-up to  andimplementation of  not only conference outcomes butalso outstanding donor commitments to ourdevelopment efforts.In the same vein  the Government of Malawi fullyendorses the current exercise designed to reform theUnited Nations. A more representative and democraticUnited Nations will enhance the efficiency andcredibility of this world organization.I cannot overemphasize the centrality of marketaccess and trade to the whole question of povertyeradication  sustainable agriculture and ruraldevelopment. We need to translate the debate onWestern protectionism into a deliberate  broad-rangingglobal policy against trade barriers. Malawi isconcerned at the collapse of the recent World TradeOrganization meeting in Cancún  Mexico. We can onlyhope that the stalemate in the talks is only temporary.In the current unbalanced system of trade  lowcommodity prices on the international market haveallowed a virtual free flow of our primary products tothe West with a near-zero return on our agriculturalsector  making it all the more difficult to develop thesector into a key catalyst for rural and sustainabledevelopment as a strategy for effective povertyreduction.The world today is faced with multiplechallenges  which have tested the resilience of thestrong  as well as that of the weak. In Africa  the nobleobjectives of the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment (NEPAD)  geared towards enabling.Africans themselves to assume full responsibility for21development challenges  can be meaningfully realisedonly with the support of the developed countries. Sofar  not much has been achieved owing to resourceconstraints. The resource pledges made by the Groupof Eight at meetings in Canada and France must behonoured in order for the implementation of theNEPAD programmes to pull Africa out of economicstagnation.We were heartened by the launch  early this year of the road map for a Middle East peace with theexpectation that it had established conditions for anirreversible transition to the establishment of anindependent Palestinian State co-existing with the Stateof Israel. It is  therefore  regrettable that the road mapis being frustrated by elements that do not wish to seepeace take root in the Middle East. We call upon theMiddle East Quartet and the Israeli and the Palestiniansides  in particular  to remain committed to the roadmap and to do everything in their power to make itsucceed.I would like to commend the Secretary-General jointly with the Assembly and the Security Council  forhaving taken a number of decisive steps towards theresolution of conflicts in Africa  including through theframework of the open-ended ad hoc Committee. of theSecurity Council on conflict prevention and recovery inAfrica. Malawi reaffirms its alignment with theposition of Africa and the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community on preventive diplomacy and commends  in this regard  the General Assemblywork on a draft resolution on the prevention of armedconflict in Africa. We also support the Economic andSocial Council resolution establishing an Ad HocAdvisory Group for mobilizing assistance for Africancountries emerging from conflict.The humanitarian tragedies in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Côte d’Ivoire  Guinea-Bissau Sierra Leone and Liberia remain a serious distractionfrom important national and regional developmentinitiatives.In this regard  we welcome the peaceful handoverof the reigns of power in Burundi on 30 April  2003  inaccordance with the terms of the peace accord ofAugust 2000. We also commend the successfulestablishment and launching of a broad-basedGovernment of national unity in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo on 15 July 2003 and thepeaceful and successful elections recently held inRwanda. However  it is important that war crimescommitted in conflict areas be thoroughly investigatedso that justice may take its course. This would help tocheck impunity  a phenomenon of most conflictsituations. In this connection  my Governmentwelcomes the announcement  on 16 July 2003  by theChief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court ofplans to investigate war crimes committed in the regionof Ituri in the north-eastern part of the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo.Malawi believes that the United Nations canmeaningfully advance the principles upon which it wasfounded and effectively deal with the multiplechallenges that the global community is facing bytaking an all-inclusive approach to its membership. It isin this spirit that my country has  time and again  calledfor the participation of the Republic of China in theaffairs of this Organization in line with the principle ofuniversality. Taiwan has a lot to offer in the promotionof the global common good  which the United Nationsis here to advance. I therefore hope that the 23 millionpeople of Taiwan will be given sympatheticconsideration so that they may  once again  enjoy theright to associate with the world community throughthis Organization.Next year will be an important one for the peopleof Malawi  as we will be holding the third generalelection of the democratic dispensation ushered in1994. The elections will be tripartite  as they willinclude presidential  parliamentary and localgovernment elections. The elections could not havebeen scheduled to take place at a worse time  given thatthe country has recently experienced a serious foodshortage that has further strained the few resourcesavailable to it. However  in response to the demands ofthe country’s constitution  the Government and thepeople of Malawi remain committed to fulfilling thisconstitutional requirement for good governance basedon free and fair elections. Malawi seeks thecooperation  support and assistance of the internationalcommunity to facilitate the entire electoral process.May I conclude by conveying to you Mr. President  to the Secretary-General and  indeed  tothe United Nations family  the profound gratitude andappreciation of His Excellency President Bakili Muluziand the people of Malawi for the support andcooperation extended to the President and hisGovernment since they assumed power in 1994. AsPresident Muluzi prepares to retire next year  after22serving the people of Malawi as President for twoconsecutive five-year terms  he is confident that theUnited Nations and  indeed  the internationalcommunity at large  will remain committed to assistingthe new leadership and the people of Malawi in theirquest for meaningful and effective socio-economic andpolitical development."
"121",4994,"MYS",58,2003,"﻿Sir  may I  as PrimeMinister of Malaysia and Chairman of the Non-AlignedMovement  offer my sincere congratulations to thePresident on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am confident thatgiven his wisdom  experience and diplomatic skill  hewill be able to steer the proceedings of this session to asuccessful conclusion. I wish to assure him of the10 fullest cooperation of the Malaysian delegation. Istrongly believe that the members of the Non-AlignedMovement would similarly render their full supportand cooperation to him.Allow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan  for his dedication andthe effective manner in which he conducted the workof the fifty-seventh session. I also commend theSecretary-General for his efforts and perseverance  andI salute the men and women who had dedicated andgiven their lives in the service of the United Nations.The General Assembly has been conceived as aforum for the nations of the world  big and small  to airtheir views and grievances freely  as the stakeholders inthe governance of the international community.Unfortunately  it is subservient to the Security Council which in turn is subservient to any single one of the fivevictors of a war fought more than half a century ago. Itis hardly a democratic forum  but it is all that the greatcivilization of the late twentieth and early twenty-firstcenturies has — a civilization that is supposed touphold freedom.Still we  the small nations  have much to begrateful for. From being the colonies of the Europeans we are now independent and we are grantedmembership of the United Nations with the right tospeak  albeit with proper restraint and decorum  in thisAssembly. As independent nations  we believe that wehave a right to manage our internal affairs ourselveswithout foreign interference.We admit that there are abuses in the managementof our countries by some of our Governments  but ourdetractors should remember that they  too  abused theirGovernments’ power when they seized land belongingto indigenous peoples and exterminated them  claimingthat it was their “manifest destiny”  the “white man’sburden”  to bring civilization by setting up their owncountries in these lands and confining the indigenouspeoples to barren reserves  with no role in theGovernment of the new nations. What they did to theindigenous peoples is not out of character  for in theirown countries they carried out pogroms against theJews  inquisitions and mock trials  torture and killingby burning at the stake.We all carry the baggage of history  but we wouldwillingly leave it behind were it not for the fact thathistory has a nasty habit of repeating itself. Today  weare seeing the resurgence of European imperialism. Atfirst  we thought that the colonization would be virtual.Merely by economic strangulation and financialemasculation  the newly independent countries couldbe brought to their knees  begging to be recolonized inother forms. Today  however  we are actually facing theold physical occupation by foreign forces. Puppetregimes are installed  dancing as puppets do.This institution  the United Nations  in which wehad pinned so much hope  despite the safeguardssupposed to be provided by the permanent five  istoday collapsing on its clay feet  helpless to protect theweak and the poor. This United Nations can just beignored  pushed aside  gesticulating feebly as itstruggles to be relevant. Its organs have been cut out dissected and reshaped so that they may perform theway the puppetmasters want. The World Bank  theInternational Monetary Fund and the World TradeOrganization have now been turned into instruments ofhegemony to impoverish the poor and enrich the rich.It is not surprising that today the disparities betweenrich and poor are far greater than ever.With an impotent United Nations and its agenciesturned into national organs of the powerful  the smallnations are now naked and hapless. Even if we aretotally innocent  there is nothing to prevent trumped-upcharges being brought against us.We feel a great need for the integrity andcredibility of the United Nations to be restored.Fortunately  the breach of international norms has beenby countries which are reputedly tolerant of free speechand the rights of others. When criticisms are forbidden the abuses will increase until they become intolerableand revolt takes place  with all the destruction thataccompanies it. That was what happened with SaddamHussein on a national scale. That can also happen on aninternational scale. Free speech provides the safetyvalve  the absence of which must eventually lead to anexplosion.Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997  Malaysiahas not been able to recover fully. This crisis wasfollowed by the collapse of the dot.com companies andthe massive cheating by the huge multinationalcorporations of the rich. Then came the 11 September2001 attack by terrorists  which precipitated anunprecedented tightening of security worldwide and theinvasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The world now lives in fear — the rich of terror attacks and the others ofbeing made targets of suspicion and pre-emptiveaggression.Then came severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS)  which almost bankrupted many airlines andthe tour and travel business. SARS disappeared almostas quickly as it appeared  but there is no guarantee that itor similar new infectious diseases will not come back.The world has lost its way. The hopes of the post-Second-World-War period and the United Nations weredashed by the cold war. The cold war is over now  butthe resultant unipolar world and the ascendancy ofcapitalism have brought about new threats. No countryis safe from marauding currency traders who  in a fewshort days  can demolish the patiently nurturedeconomies of the developing world. Far from beingcurbed  these highway brigands are lauded for theirphilanthropy. Robin Hood at least stole from the rich togive to the poor. These highwaymen steal from thepoor and give a paltry sum to assuage their sense ofguilt. They are no philanthropists.The unipolar world dominated by a democraticnation is leading the world into economic chaos political anarchy  uncertainty and fear. We are notgoing to recover or have peace so long as threats areused for political and economic reforms that most ofthe world is not ready for or willing to accept.If we want to have democracy  the rule of law andrespect for human rights  the powerful mustdemonstrate their commitment to all these noble ideas.And they can begin by restructuring the UnitedNations  in particular by abolishing the undemocraticsingle-country veto. This should be replaced with amodified veto whereby two veto powers  backed bythree other members of the Security Council  would beneeded to block any United Nations resolution. Eventhat  however  should be gradually dismantled infavour of majority decisions in the Security Council.The other important agencies of the UnitedNations must be freed from the domination of anysingle country. Gradually  they should be made moredemocratic.The free market must be recognized for what it is— a market in which the bottom line is paramount. It isnot a political force for the disciplining ofGovernments. For the right to exploit world trade  a taxshould be levied by the United Nations and used by theUnited Nations to build needed infrastructure for thepoor countries of the world. Exchange rates should befixed by an international commission based on relevantissues. Apart from a small commission  no profits maybe made by speculating or manipulating exchangerates. Subsidies by rich countries for the production offood and other products must be forbidden  althoughpoor countries should be allowed for a stipulated timeto protect their industries and food production.The world has lost its way. The world is movingtoo fast. We need to pause to take stock of things.There is a Malaysian saying that when one loses hisway he should go back to the beginning. We need to goback to the beginning. If we dare to admit it  many ofthe problems that we face today are due to the arbitraryexpropriation of the land of the Palestinians in order tocreate the State of Israel in order to solve the EuropeanJewish problem."
"122",5021,"NAM",58,2003,"﻿Mr. President  mydelegation congratulates you on your assumption ofthis high office. We are confident that  given your vastexperience and consummate diplomatic skill  you willbe able to successfully manage the proceedings of thissession of the General Assembly. I also wish to expressour appreciation for the excellent and effective mannerin which your predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  conductedthe work of the fifty-seventh session. In the same vein I would like to commend the Secretary-General for hisefforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations inresolving the world’s burning issues.Allow me also to pay tribute to the internationalworkers who have recently given their lives in serviceto the United Nations in Iraq. In particular  we reiterateour condolences to the Secretary-General and theOrganization for the tragic death of Sergio Vieira deMello  that outstanding servant of the United Nations.As we condemn terrorism and violence in all theirforms and manifestations  we honour the memory ofAnna Lindh  the slain Foreign Minister of Sweden who dedicated her life to the pursuit of peace development and social progress.We appear here before this Assembly every yearto renew our vow to the United Nations as the mainguarantor of international peace and security. Thespeeches that we deliver here are a distilled expressionof our collective passion for and conviction about theideals that the United Nations stands for.Yet  at times  as was the case with the war onIraq  the United Nations gets sidelined and the uniquelegitimacy of its authority undermined throughunilateral actions. Such actions produced a generalfeeling of fear and uncertainty  especially among thesmall and weak nations of the world. This is why thecentral theme that runs through nearly all the speechesat this session is the call for a return to multilateraldialogue  persuasion and collective action as the onlyappropriate approach to resolving the many conflictsfacing the international community. Being a smallcountry  Namibia echoes this call. Multilateralism mustbe the basis of global security  if smaller countries arenot to feel that they are at the mercy of stronger ones.But  as recent events have demonstrated  big Powers like the smaller ones  also need a multilateralframework as a more reassuring environment for theexecution of foreign policy.We cannot fail to re-emphasize the inseparablelink between international security and economicdevelopment. Therefore  the Organization must upholdthe commitments made in the field of economicdevelopment  especially the important pledges made atthe Millennium Summit and contained in theMillennium Declaration.In that Declaration  world leaders committedthemselves to help lift half of the world’s poor out ofmisery and deprivation by the year 2015. We aretalking here of 1.5 billion people around the world who10are today victims of abject poverty and 800 millionwho are starving. Still more  we are talking about the900 million adults worldwide who are illiterate.The tragedy is that this human misery is acquiringdeepening and broadening dimensions at a time whenhuman ingenuity is ever enlarging the horizons ofpossibilities of doing away with this terrible scourge ofextreme poverty and deprivation. Clearly  therefore  theimplementation of the Millennium Declaration is a raceagainst time. Failure to act now  and to do so with asense of urgency  will mean that we  especially the richof this world  have failed to rise to the moral andpolitical challenge  which is to protect that most sacredof all human rights  the right to life.Namibia is fully committed to the implementationof the Millennium Declaration. To this end  we allocate23 per cent of our annual national budget to educationand 15 per cent to health. In this commitment to investin our people  we have proceeded from the premise thata fundamental way to address the problem of poverty isto improve the productive competitiveness of oureconomy  and that improving that competitiveness isdependant on the rapid increase in the knowledge skills and capacities of the people  with a view toempowering them to be able to escape from the trap ofpoverty. Skills in the field of information technologyare a critical element of our human resourcesdevelopment programme.The other urgent challenge  spelled out in theMillennium Declaration  is the fight against the AIDSpandemic. Namibia is devoting considerable resourcesand attention to this seemingly daunting battle tocontain the spread and limit the impact of this epidemicon our society. In this effort  we are working with othercountries  relevant United Nations agencies  the privatesector and members of civil society. In the context ofthis battle  the plight of AIDS orphans is given priority.However  there is a need for more generouscontributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria.In the pursuit of Millennium Development Goals Namibia is  furthermore  working closely with itspartners in the Southern African DevelopmentCommunity (SADC) to implement a number of keyregional projects. One of these is a major powerproject  involving the power utilities of Angola Botswana  the Democratic Republic of the Congo South Africa and Namibia.Similarly  Namibia  together with Angola Botswana  Zambia and Zimbabwe  has embarked onone of the world’s largest regional wildlifeconservation and tourism development projects. Thegeographical scope of this area cuts across theterritories of all five countries and coversapproximately 278 000 square kilometres.We would like  therefore  to reassure theSecretary-General that Namibia has  indeed  started inearnest on the implementation of the MillenniumDeclaration and is staying the course. However  as Isaid earlier  there is still a great need for additionalresources so that we can intensify our efforts aimed atdevelopment and poverty eradication.For more than a decade now  the overwhelmingmajority of Member States  including Namibia  havebeen calling for the reform of the institutions of theOrganization  especially the Security Council.At the time of the founding of the United Nationsin 1945  the Organization consisted of only 51 MemberStates. That number has now grown to 191 sovereignStates. But the structure of the United Nations hasremained in some respects unchanged.The Security Council needs to becomedemocratic and more representative — allowing otherregions and States to be represented. There is a broadconsensus that by making it a democratic body  andmore representative  we would give the SecurityCouncil greater legitimacy and that that  in turn  wouldmean more effective United Nations machinery.This call for reform is in line with the principle ofdemocratic governance so often demanded of thedeveloping countries by  among others  some of thePowers that occupy permanent seats in the SecurityCouncil.We welcome the fact that the Secretary-Generalhas taken on board the reform of the United Nations and that it is one of the higher priorities on his agenda.We have noted with great interest his plan to set up apanel of eminent personalities to look into the reformprocess and recommend ways of effecting such areform.One of the issues that underlines the need for theurgent reform of the Security Council is the patheticinability of that organ to bring the authority of theUnited Nations to bear on the situation in the MiddleEast. The unrelenting carnage that is taking place inthat region has not compelled the Powers that be toaccept the fact that that situation constitutes a threat tointernational peace and security. Because of a lack ofpolitical will in the Security Council  there has been noability to act collectively to put a stop to the carnage.The continued occupation of the Palestinianterritory exacerbates frustration and despair among thePalestinians. It follows  therefore  that the end of theoccupation and the establishment of a Palestinian State existing side by side with Israel  is key to peace andstability in that region.The implementation of the Security Council’splan for Western Sahara would have closed the chapteron decolonization in Africa. The right of the people ofWestern Sahara to self-determination and independenceis a Charter obligation that we cannot shirk.We hail the efforts of the Economic Communityof West African States in Liberia and welcome theestablishment of the United Nations Mission in thatcountry. Guided by our commitment to Africansolidarity and given the resolve of the African Union tocontribute to the maintenance of international peaceand security  Namibia has decided to contribute troopsto the United Nations Mission in Liberia.Geographic proximity is not a matter of choice.We abhor the continued imposition of the United Statesembargo against the people of Cuba  and call on theinternational community to demand the immediatelifting of that embargo.In conclusion  I would like to stress the vitalimportance of international cooperation by allstakeholders in our effort to realize the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. In order to reduce the scourge ofpoverty and underdevelopment  developing countriesneed access to the markets of developed countries.There is  therefore  an urgent need to overcomethe impasse which has developed as result of thefailure of the World Trade Organization MinisterialConference at Cancún. We need to emphasize thaturgent need. We call on the developed countries todemonstrate a spirit of compromise in line with theirundertakings at the Millennium Summit.Furthermore the implementation of the decisionstaken at the Monterrey Conference on Financing forDevelopment must not be allowed to become a deadletter. The promise made by world leaders at theMillennium Summit to give globalization a human faceshould also be given practical expression.In short  the vision of a bright and prosperity-enhancing new Millennium must not be allowed tobecome a mirage or a dream that could not be realized."
"123",5066,"NER",58,2003,"﻿Niger isgratified by your election  Sir  to preside over thissession and through me assures you of its full supportas you carry out the important mission that has beenentrusted to you. We wish you every success.I also wish to address to your predecessor  Mr.Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic  my sincerecongratulations on the skill  dedication and foresightwith which he guided the work of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session.I should further like to reiterate Niger’s greatappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for thewisdom and efficiency with which he has guided ourOrganization in a particularly difficult internationalcontext.On 19 August  sadly  international terrorismstruck yet another symbol: United Nations headquartersin Baghdad. The attack claimed many lives  includingthat of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Sergio Vieira de Mello. Niger reiterates itsunequivocal condemnation of that barbaric act andreviles all terrorist acts committed anywhere in theworld.The Government of Niger welcomes ourOrganization’s determination to provide all necessaryassistance to the Iraqi people  despite all theintimidation to which it has been subject. Suchdetermination  however  can achieve results only if theUnited Nations is given a key role in managing theprocess of rebuilding a free and democratic Iraq that isthe master of its own destiny.The maintenance of international peace andsecurity must remain a priority objective of the UnitedNations. In this respect  in addition to our ongoing waragainst international terrorism  we must pursue ourefforts to free the world from the specter of weapons ofmass destruction and the proliferation of small armsand light weapons. In that connection  the FirstBiennial Meeting of States to Consider theImplementation of the United Nations Programme ofAction to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the IllicitTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All itsAspects at the National  Regional and Global Levelsnoted that  despite progress made since the adoption ofthe Programme of Action  control of firearms and theiruse remains limited. That is why Niger firmly supportsthe elaboration of binding legal instruments on themarking  tracking and sale of such weapons.For Niger  the regional approach must be givenpride of place in the settlement of conflicts  since it is2increasingly recognized that most conflicts in Africahave a subregional dimension. That is the case inparticular in West Africa  where stability in the ManoRiver region is linked to the situation in Liberia. It isalso the case in Central Africa  where stability in theGreat Lakes region is linked to the situations in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Burundi.That is why the Government of Niger feels that thestrengthening of regional peacekeeping and securitycapacities  the cornerstone of the collective securitysystem  must be based on enhanced cooperationbetween the United Nations and regional andsubregional organizations.With regard to the Jammu and Kashmir conflict Niger believes that  despite the recent incidents  theimproved relations between India and Pakistan  whichopened diplomatic relations in August  provide anunprecedented opportunity that must be seized toachieve a political settlement through the organizationof a referendum on the self-determination of theKashmiri people  in accordance with the relevantresolutions of the Security Council.In the Middle East  the vision of a sovereign andviable Palestinian State  peacefully coexisting withIsrael  must become a reality. In this regard  it is moreurgent than ever before for the two parties to theconflict to agree to a ceasefire  comprehensiveadherence to which would help relaunch the road map which is showing signs of withering. Moreover  theeventful history of the Israeli-Palestinian peaceprocess — a history marked by recurrent setbacks anddashed hope — requires us to acknowledge that onlythe presence of an international interposition force canguarantee an end to the bloody violence and createconditions for the effective implementation ofagreements. Thus  Niger makes a heartfelt appeal to theUnited Nations  the Security Council in particular  toensure that this question be reconsidered with all dueattention and in full responsibility in the interest ofworld peace.Niger is deeply dedicated to the noble ideals ofthe Charter and therefore strives for regional and globalpeace and is actively participating in efforts to achievegeneral and complete disarmament. In that context  mycountry has always subscribed to the standards of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in orderto achieve full transparency in the production  sale anddelivery of uranium. That position is reflected in ourdecade-long cooperation with all actors in the uraniumsector. We allow for no ambiguity. Niger continues tobe ready  as it has always been  to submit to theauthority of the IAEA for any verification related to theproduction and sale of its uranium.I wish to recall that  in this sphere  my country  inaccordance with article III of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  has accepted  inagreement with the IAEA  the monitoring andguarantee system which  when implemented in goodfaith as it is in Niger  offers absolutely no opportunityfor the kind of clandestine transactions of which mycountry was so unjustly accused.The Development Goals defined in the historicMillennium Declaration must remain an ongoingconcern of the international community and guideglobal action aimed at the establishment of a stable andjust socio-economic order involving greater sharingand solidarity. We cannot overemphasize the fact thatthe achievement of these Goals requires reflection inspecific action of all commitments undertaken at themajor international conferences and summits.What in fact have we been seeing? Theinternational scene continues to offer the paradoxicaland somewhat ignominious image of a world ofenormous wealth in which the overwhelming majorityof inhabitants still lives in total destitution. Despite thecommitments made and the consensus reached byGovernments of the entire world on this issue  we areobliged to note that the terrible vise of poverty ignorance and disease has only been tightened aroundthe poor peoples of the third world in general and ofAfrica in particular. When we know  for example  that six years after the World Food Summit  815 millionpeople throughout the world continue to suffer fromhunger and 150 million children suffer frommalnutrition deficiencies  we can readily gauge thefeeble support of donors for anti-poverty strategies despite the lofty statements of intention that areoccasionally mouthed.Today more than ever  the situation should pull atthe conscience of the international community andinspire us to greater solidarity and determination tofulfil our commitments. It is time to understand onceand for all that the reduction of poverty is more than amoral imperative; it is in fact a secure investment inthe promotion of a world of peace  prosperity andsocial progress.3It is encouraging to note that  in recent years Africa has been at the core of major internationalconferences. From the Brussels Conference on theLeast Developed Countries to the JohannesburgSummit  as well as the Monterrey InternationalConference on Financing for Development  the WorldEconomic Forum  the Evian G-8 summit and the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) Conference in Cancún  toname but a few  Africa has been at the heart of thedebates.It should be noted that  while these meetings hadthe merit of having been convened  unfortunately theydid not respond to the urgent and enormousexpectations of the continent. In this regard  there is aneed to ensure consistency in global economicgovernance through the strengthening of cooperationamong the international organizations and of thecompatibility of their decisions. It is only thus that theexcessive marginalization of Africa can be alleviated because this is the appropriate way to bring thepromises of increased official development assistanceto fruition. Similarly  it is important to increase theflow of direct foreign investment into Africa.Furthermore  given the limited results achievedby current debt-alleviation programmes — the HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries Initiative in particular — wemust now recognize that the ultimate solution lies inthe outright cancellation of the debt  the servicing ofwhich is consuming the greater part of the budgets ofAfrican countries and fuelling capital flight. There isalso a need for Africa’s trade partners fully to complywith their commitments  in particular by improving theaccess of African products to their markets and byeliminating agricultural subsidies that create distortionsin world trade.The failure of the WTO Conference in Cancún isa good illustration of the obstinate reluctance of therich countries to take into account the legitimateaspirations of the poor countries regarding theestablishment of just and equitable standards to governworld trade. And yet  solving the critical problem ofagricultural subsidies and of access to markets wouldhave made it possible both to enhance the badlytarnished credibility of the WTO and to provide ameasure of consistency to the declarations of intentionmade by the countries of the North. Above all andunquestionably  it would have contributed to raisingmillions of people out of poverty. This lack ofagreement means that the cotton workers of WestAfrica  among others  can no longer live from theirlabour and may be excluded from international trade  tothe benefit of more competitive producers who arebeing subsidized.Cancún was a failed rendezvous of the DohaRound. WTO will certainly have to adopt a newapproach and prioritize the settlement of agriculturalproblems  which most agree are more important thanthe interests of the multinationals.The countries of Africa are fully aware of theneed to develop their relationship with theirdevelopment partners within the context ofinterdependence  cooperation and mutualresponsibility. In that regard  they acknowledge theimportance of judicious national policies and goodgovernance  which they consider to be indispensable toaccelerated development and  above all  to achievingthe 7 per cent growth rate required to achieve theMillennium Development Goals.The New Partnership for Africa’s Development(NEPAD) is inspired by this consensual approach based on a new relationship of cooperation betweenAfrica and the developed world. NEPAD  a symbol ofAfrica’s resolve to take its own destiny in hand  is thefoundation on which the African Union will rely topromote the growth and sustainable development ofAfrican countries  individually and collectively.While we call for a massive flow of investmentsand the growth of official development assistance tocontribute to our development efforts  we  too  mustcomply with our commitments in terms of mutualresponsibility. That is why my country  Niger  firmlysupports the implementation of the NEPAD PeerReview Mechanism. The Mechanism will play a keyrole in the continent’s prospects as an instrument forbuilding strong States dedicated to good governanceand sustainable development.In drawing up through a participatory approach anational strategy for poverty reduction  theGovernment of Niger intends to become deeplyinvolved in the dynamic process of establishing strong stable and competitive economies in accordance withthe objectives of the NEPAD Programme of Action.The strategy document serves simultaneously as areference framework for poverty reduction policies andprogrammes and as an instrument to mobilize financialresources. We are convinced that the implementation ofthe poverty-reduction strategy will contribute to4improving the dialogue of policies  to furtherstrengthening donor coordination and intervention  andto developing a multidimensional strategic partnershipto translate into action the deepest hopes of the peopleof Niger.From this rostrum  I solemnly reaffirm the deepgratitude of the Government of Niger to thoseinternational partners which  at the poverty-reductionforum held last June in Niamey  proved their fulladherence to the strategy and their commitment tosupporting its implementation.In recent years  the world has undergone rapidand profound changes. These require us to adapt ourOrganization’s functions to today’s reality in order tobetter to take into account the new challenges andlegitimate aspirations of the peoples of the planet andnot the specific interests of a tiny group of countries no matter how powerful. That is why Niger firmlysupports the courageous reforms proposed by theSecretary-General to strengthen and improve thefunctioning of the Organization and to allow iteffectively to cope with the challenges of our times.The long-awaited democratization of the SecurityCouncil must be accompanied by a strengthening of therole of the General Assembly  the highestrepresentative body  and of the Economic and SocialCouncil  the guarantor of the advent of a new economicand social order.The United Nations is at a decisive juncture andmust urgently regain the confidence of States and ofworld public opinion  which has been sorely tested byrecent events. It is up to all of us to strive resolutely tothat end  because  as the Secretary-General has said we are the United Nations."
"124",5112,"NGA",58,2003,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment and people of Nigeria  I would like tocongratulate you  Sir  on your election as the Presidentof the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I18assure you of the cooperation and support of mydelegation in ensuring a successful outcome to thissession. Permit me also to acknowledge the excellentwork done by your predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan. I alsowish to commend the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  for his tireless efforts  vision and leadership and for his inspiring address to the General Assemblythis morning.In recent months  many voices inside and outsideof Governments have questioned the utility  relevanceand efficacy of the United Nations  the only universalmultilateral tool at our disposal. Even more tragically sinister forces have taken aim at the United Nationsand its dedicated staff  as demonstrated by thesenseless attack on the United Nations compound inBaghdad. My Government once again joins theinternational community in condemning that heartlessaction  which claimed the lives of so many talented anddedicated staff members. We share the sorrow of theSecretary-General and his staff  and extend ourheartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. In thatconnection  I wish to reaffirm my country’s totalcommitment to  and support for  our Organization.My Government is deeply concerned about thepersistence of conflicts in many regions of the world and in particular in our subregion of West Africa. Theconflict in Liberia has again tested the will of theinternational community to respond proactively toconflicts and to the humanitarian catastrophes theyleave in their wake. The decision of the EconomicCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) todeploy troops to Liberia in the face of obvioushesitation by the international community and despitethe strain it placed our resources was thereforeindicative of our determination to show that we willnot stand by wringing our hands when suchcatastrophic events occur in our neighbourhood. We aregreatly relieved that our forward deployment of troopsand the initiative to remove the former LiberianPresident from the scene have had such an immediatecalming effect  which will hopefully be furtherreinforced by the deployment of a United Nationspeacekeeping force.I therefore wish to assure the General Assemblythat Nigeria appreciates the decision taken by theSecurity Council in resolution 1509 (2003)  of 19September 2003  to authorize a multisectoralpeacekeeping mission in Liberia in order to continuethe achievement of the ECOWAS initiative. I shouldlike to emphasize the fact that if regional organizationsare to play the lead role that the United Nations isincreasingly demanding  the international communitywill not be able to escape its own responsibility to domuch more to strengthen the requisite capacities ofsuch organizations.Let me now turn to another subject that is closelyrelated to the conflicts in Africa. The proliferation ofsmall arms and light weapons has been identified asone of the major factors fuelling conflicts. An effectivestrategy to deal with that proliferation entailscontrolling the illicit trade in that category of weaponsemanating from the countries where they originate  aswell as controlling their transfer to intermediaries andarms merchants. We therefore call for an earlyconclusion of negotiations on a legally bindinginternational instrument to control the indiscriminatesupply of small arms and light weapons  especially tonon-State actors. In keeping with our commitment tothe eradication of those weapons  ECOWAS hasalready established and renewed a moratorium on theimportation of small arms and light weapons. To makethat moratorium as effective as intended  we call foreffective cooperation on the part of all producingcountries.In April 2003  the people of Nigeria reaffirmedtheir commitment to good governance and democracyby holding successful elections. Following our 1999elections  which marked the transition from military tocivilian Government  last April’s election representedboth our first civilian-to-civilian transition and aconsolidation of our democratic process. I consider myre-election to a second — and under our Constitution my last — term of office not only as a vote ofconfidence but also as a great challenge to deliver thedividends of democracy to our citizens. To meet thatchallenge  my Government has developed a programmeof economic reforms  the National EconomicEmpowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS).The programme  which places people first  is aimed atlaying a solid foundation for sustainable socio-economic transformation and poverty eradication. Byits design  it will strengthen governance  enhancetransparency  intensify the fight against corruption anddevelop infrastructure — especially in the areas ofelectricity  water and roads. It also places high priorityon food security  agricultural development and thepromotion of small- and medium-scale enterprises.19I believe that that ambitious economic reformwill constitute an important national contribution to theattainment of the targets of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals and of the objectives of the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). In thatconnection  my Government’s new reform programmeis a clarion call to national mobilization and re-orientation. However  it also envisages activecooperation by our multilateral and bilateral partners.We are all too well aware that the development of ouragricultural sector  by which the majority of our peoplestill earn their living  cannot be successful as long ashuge subsidies to agriculture in the developed countriescontinue. My Government  therefore  wishes to use thisforum to call again for the reform of the system ofsubsidies to agricultural production  which isstrangulating agriculture in developing countries.In this connection  it is regrettable that thereasonable proposals made by the group of developingcountries at the recently concluded World TradeOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Cancúnwere rejected by their negotiating partners  leading tothe collapse of the Conference. Creating conditions offair and undistorted trade would be the most effectiveway of providing additional resources to developingcountries. This is particularly urgent in light of the lowlevels of official development assistance and the recentsharp decline in the flow of foreign direct investment.Other areas that we hope the internationalcommunity will address with determination include theproblem of external debt. This continues to be a majorobstacle to the development of my country and manyother African countries. It is evident that the variousinitiatives by the international community on debtrelief and debt management have been able neither toaddress nor solve the problems.While appreciating the efforts by the internationalcommunity in the context of the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries (HIPC) initiative  we must observe that theseefforts have not provided adequate responses orsolutions to the problems. This is even more true in thecase of the heavily indebted middle-income countries like Nigeria  for whom no special debt reliefmechanism exists  although such machinery wassuccessfully established for countries in Eastern andCentral Europe  for instance.Nigeria believes  therefore  that bolder steps mustbe taken to resolve the heavy debt burden  which for alarge number of countries has become unsustainableand a hindrance to development. I am afraid that wehave no effective mechanism in place to tackle thisproblem. Neither the Bretton Woods institutions nor theParis and London Clubs alone can provide lastingsolutions and relief. I therefore believe that this issue isof such significance for the peace and development ofsuch a large portion of the world community that weneed to create a mechanism within the United Nationsto address the problem in its full scope  based on theprinciple of the joint responsibility of debtors andcreditors alike.We welcome the ongoing negotiations for alegally binding instrument on the repatriation ofillicitly acquired funds stashed away in foreigncountries. We call for the early conclusion of theConvention on that issue. This Convention is expectedto make more resources available for development andshow concretely the global commitment to eradicatinglarge-scale corruption  which is at the origin of thefunds. In this connection  I must say that theexperience of my country has been one of onlylukewarm cooperation by most countries where ourlooted funds have been traced. Our partners among thegreat banking nations should recognize that it iscontradictory to condemn corruption on the one hand and  on the other  to hinder us in the recovery of theplundered funds. For our economic and social reformprogrammes  the funds to be recovered can make ahuge difference in meeting our national objectives. Iearnestly appeal through this forum for maximumcooperation in repatriating the looted funds. I take thisopportunity to thank those countries that have matchedtheir words with actions in assisting us in repatriatinglooted funds.Last year  this Assembly endorsed the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as theframework for development of the continent. Wecommend the Group of 8 for their Africa Action Planto support the implementation of NEPAD and hope thatthis will soon be translated into cooperation on specificprogrammes and projects. In addition  we hope that thedeveloped countries will also concretely demonstratetheir support for NEPAD.For our part in Nigeria  the Government’seconomic reform programme is a commitment tocontinue to make our contribution to an Africanrenaissance  which will underpin NEPAD.20We welcome the establishment by the UnitedNations of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africaand urge that adequate resources be provided for itsmandate to be discharged effectively.The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to ravage ourcontinent  affecting most of all the productive segmentof the population. To combat the epidemic  myGovernment has embarked on a major nationalprogramme of action  the highlight of which consists ofa nationwide public enlightenment campaign and massmobilization to deepen awareness and understanding ofthe disease  the prevention and control of its spread andmodalities for providing care and support for peopleliving with the virus. To contribute to the globalprogramme on HIV/AIDS  Nigeria has redeemed itspledge of $10 000 000 to the Global Fund.Let me urge all countries that have not yet madepledges to the Global Fund to do so urgently. Thosethat have made pledges should kindly redeem themearly. I wish to acknowledge with gratitude  the effortsso far deployed by the international community on thepandemic  and to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annanfor convening yesterday the high-level plenary meetingdevoted to HIV/AIDS. However  a lot still needs to bedone in a more concerted way to address all aspects ofthe problem  including the issue of more internationalfunding and access to affordable drugs. These actionsmust be taken urgently if the Millennium DevelopmentGoal of halting and reversing the spread of this dreadeddisease by 2015 is to be achieved.The issue of terrorism has been of greatpreoccupation to our Organization in the past fewyears. Several instances of terrorist attacks continue tosurface in different parts of the world  involving theloss of innocent lives and vast destruction ofproperties.Nigeria reiterates its condemnation of terrorism inall its manifestations  and joins other Member States inthe global determination to combat this veritable threatto national and international security. We support thework of the Counter-Terrorism Committee  andreaffirm our conviction that a comprehensiveconvention on international terrorism will constitute animportant instrument for the protection of theindividual and collective rights to life.The situation in the Middle East  which we hadhoped would improve with the adoption of the roadmap for a peaceful settlement of the conflict  has againdeteriorated. We call on the parties to halt the newcycle of violence — a cycle from which neither sidestands to gain. We believe that any violation of theterms of the peace plan by either side does a greatdisservice to the Palestinians  as well as to the Israelis.We therefore appeal to both sides to demonstrate theirfull commitment to the implementation of the plan soas to create conditions for the peaceful coexistence of aPalestinian State  side by side with the State of Israel.In conclusion  I would like to comment briefly onthe issue of the reform of our Organization so as tomake it more responsive to contemporary global needsand challenges. Nigeria has noted with dismay thatobstacles continue to be placed in the way of theadoption of any of the constructive proposals for thereform of the Security Council. The changes that arebeing made in the Council’s working methods to makeit more open to non-members are appreciated; however these are no more than marginal. I wish again toreiterate Nigeria’s long held conviction that what isrequired is a more fundamental reform that woulddemocratize the Security Council and thus reposition itto enable it to respond to issues of international peaceand security in a more comprehensive  objective andeffective manner. The overwhelming membership ofour Organization demands no less in the interest of itscontinued relevance.We cannot preach and endeavour to practiseparticipation and inclusiveness at the national levelwhile denying it at the global level of the UnitedNations  and expect that all will be well. Yet we haveno substitute for this universal Organization. That pointis now becoming evident in the context of the currentsituation of Iraq. Whatever the circumstances in whichthe Iraqi war occurred  the role played by the UnitedNations will be decisive in resolving the presentimpasse. Our Organization has now established itself inthe post-conflict pacification of States. We can use thatvast United Nations experience to our advantage inmanaging the current post-conflict situation in Iraq. Wenow have the possibility of an independent democraticIraq  and we must not waste this opportunity.One obvious point of disagreement relates to theissue of decision-making  both prior to and after theIraqi war. This may be symptomatic of thedeficiencies — to which I alluded — that are notconducive to the well-being of our Organization. Let ustherefore undertake the necessary reforms in order tomake our Organization work for all of us so that we21can deal effectively and adequately with the pressingissues of the twenty-first century."
"125",5157,"NIC",58,2003,"﻿Iwould like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election asPresident of the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. I would also like to take this opportunity toacknowledge the fine work done by your predecessor Mr. Jan Kavan.All of us were shocked by the terrorist attacks onUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad. In lastmonth’s attack the precious lives of several innocentUnited Nations staff members were lost  including thatof Sergio Vieira de Mello  the High Commissioner forHuman Rights. The world must not be intimidated byterrorism. The role of the United Nations as a guarantorof collective security is irreplaceable. Global securityis the responsibility of all nations  just as we are allequally bound by international law.Nicaragua has come to the General Assembly tomake suggestions with regard to the building of a newworld order and to cooperate actively within themultilateral system to combat  among other scourges terrorism  corruption  drug trafficking  the illegaltrafficking in arms and persons  and transnationalcrime  all of which are harmful to strengtheningdemocracy and the progress of the world.That is why we have begun a new era in CentralAmerica  in which the region will be more united thanever before and serve as a model for democraticsecurity that includes an innovative strategy toovercome both traditional challenges and modernthreats.At the meeting of Central American Presidentsthat took place in Guatemala on 17 July 2003  I made aproposal for a programme for arms limitation andcontrol in Central America to achieve a reasonablebalance of forces and to foster stability  mutual trustand transparency. The idea behind my Government’sproposal is to establish the necessary controls toachieve a reasonable balance in defence forces; to putin place modern policies for regional defence andpublic security while strengthening mechanisms for thepeaceful settlement of disputes. The Central AmericanPresidents meeting in Belize at the beginning of thismonth enthusiastically approved that plan. I am alsopleased to inform the General Assembly that technicalteams have already begun to work to implement theplan.In the current situation  the subject ofinternational trafficking in small arms and lightweapons is equally worthy of our attention. Nicaraguawill soon be the site of a major project to achieveprogress in that area.Drug trafficking is global threat that constitutesan assault on democracy and its institutions andimperils comprehensive human development. Due toour privileged geographical position  internationalorganized crime is continuing to attempt to makeinroads into our region in order to make it a gatewaybetween producers and consumers of illicit substances.We have cut off its advance in Nicaragua  a countrythat enjoys high levels of domestic security. However it is essential that we strengthen the cooperation of allinternational actors on the basis of sharedresponsibility to prevent the expansion of organizedcrime and increased drug use.My country’s commitment to democratic securityis consistent with the struggle for peace and theestablishment of a just international order. A countrythat has experienced war  like Nicaragua  is in a betterposition to make a more effective contribution topreventing war than countries that have not. WeNicaraguans have suffered the horrors and theaftermath of war. It is for that reason that Nicaraguahas the ability to make a contribution to themaintenance of international peace and security.It is also for that reason that I have come toGeneral Assembly  namely  to convey to the Assemblythe resolute desire and just aspirations of myGovernment and people to be elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the2006-2007 term. Our candidacy has garneredincreasingly strong support  which we hope tostrengthen decisively in the coming months.The fight against corruption is an unrelentingundertaking for my Government. We have achievedmajor successes and are proud to know we have set anexample that is already being emulated by some of oursisterly countries. I wish to express my gratitude forthe support of the international community  whichunderstood our desire to bring morality to publicadministration. Corruption is the cause of many evils and it takes a huge toll on the economy  in addition toundermining public and private institutions.Nicaragua greatly appreciates efforts to develop aUnited Nations convention against corruption. In that6regard  we also welcome the progress made during thesixth round of meetings in Vienna  which will providea solid foundation for the establishment of internationallegal norms to help combat that scourge  therebystrengthening political stability in our countries.However  the fight against corruption in my countryalso requires a strengthening of the judicial andelectoral systems.Resistance to change makes it difficult to makeprogress in those areas at the pace and scope requiredto meet my country’s needs. I therefore recentlypresented to Nicaragua’s political  economic and socialactors my proposal for a national development plan  inorder to obtain the input of all segments of Nicaraguansociety. That plan also specifies the actions to be takenby every State entity in evaluating and modifying theplan to achieve the country’s comprehensivedevelopment.Nicaragua needs foreign assistance. Thatassistance should be coordinated in a manner that takesinto account national plans and strategies pertaining tohow assistance is utilized. The quality  effectivenessand impact of such cooperation should be improved byemploying new ideas that lead to tangible results in thearea of sustainable development. Additional newresources will also be necessary to fulfil theMillennium Development Goals.We appreciate the United Kingdom’s proposal foran international financing facility as a way to increasethe flow of short-term resources by issuing negotiableinstruments backed by future assistance.Cooperation in solidarity by the internationalcommunity has been particularly meaningful in thearea of mine clearance in my country  where substantialprogress has been made  thanks both to the fine workof national and international institutions participatingin that humanitarian endeavour and the professionalismof the our army’s sappers.Nicaragua is also a thankful country. On severaloccasions  we have received significant amounts ofhumanitarian assistance from many countries. As atoken of our gratitude  we have made our small  butfull  contribution of humanitarian assistance toneighbouring countries in need. We are now taking partin the purely humanitarian mission involving mineclearance and the provision of medical support for thecivilian population in Iraq.However  international cooperation alone is notenough to achieve economic development. We mustpromote a more equitable international trade systemthrough the World Trade Organization. In other words what good is cooperation for productive developmentwhen there are tariff and non-tariff restrictions ontrade? We want fair treatment. That is the issue  and wehope the developed countries will support us inbringing about a new trade relationship withdeveloping countries — such as Nicaragua. With fairtreatment and with markets for our products  we willhave a more competitive Central American market andwill attract greater investment in order to generatemore jobs at fair wages  reaping the benefits of theregion’s strategic geographic location.The Central American integration process hasmade much progress and has been one of the pillars ofmy foreign policy. We have achieved our most notableresults in economic integration  and we have paved theway for successful negotiation of free-trade treatieswith other countries and regions  such as the one weare currently working out with the United States.Nicaragua will insist on preferential treatment in ournegotiations because our economy is less developed very open and highly dependent on trade and externalfinancing. With greater development and wealthgeneration  we will keep our citizens from migrating tothe North or to other countries.Peace is still only a hope in some regions of theworld. Nicaragua advocates multilateral action to findpeaceful solutions in keeping with international law.We are concerned at the escalation of the situation inthe Middle East and its consequences  which is why webelieve that the international community mustcontribute  through the United Nations  to finding ajust and lasting peace in the region. My Governmentsupports an immediate resumption of the peace processbegun this year through the peace plan known as theroad map.We confirm our commitment to strengthening theuniversal vocation of the United Nations so that allpeoples of the world  without exception  can be fairlyrepresented in it. That is why I reaffirm before theAssembly the importance of considering the desire of apeople with legitimate representation — the Republicof China — to participate as a full-fledged member ofthe United Nations.7Nicaragua recognizes its responsibility in thebuilding of a new international order that is morehumane  more just and more secure. It has been our lotto live through difficult times since that fateful day of11 September. Let us be capable of building a differentworld  so that future generations will not blame us for alack of consensus on humanity’s problems requiringurgent action. Nicaragua is aware of that responsibility and therefore we pledge to work with other MemberStates to defend multilateralism and to overcomecurrent security problems  remaining united in thespirit of the Charter of the United Nations and in strictadherence to and respect for international law.May God bless the Assembly  may God bless theUnited Nations  may God bless all peoples of theworld  and may God always bless Nicaragua."
"126",5204,"NLD",58,2003,"﻿The deathsof Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues leave aterrible void. The loss of so many dedicated servants ofthe United Nations at its headquarters in Baghdad fillsus with shock  grief and concern. This atrocity and theother murderous attacks we have seen in the past twoyears are chilling evidence that terrorists are ruthlesslytargeting the civilized world. Terrorism is a directthreat to us all  to humanity as a whole.Weapons of mass destruction are the other directthreat  an even worse threat if such weapons were tofall into the hands of terrorists.In addition to these direct threats to peace andsecurity  we are faced with  in the words of Secretary-General Kofi Annan  “soft threats”: poverty and hunger environmental degradation and diseases of massdestruction like HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis.What all these threats have in common is thatthey do not stop at national borders. Their often lethalconsequences affect groups of countries  wholecontinents or even the entire planet. The only way totackle them is by collective action. Enforcement andimplementation are the key.But do we have the capacity to take such action?Is the existing multilateral system with its institutionsand rules capable of responding to the hard threats andsoft threats we are facing? I doubt it. Take the growingdanger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Can weallow a few countries to reject the rules agreed to by187 other countries? Can we run the risk of countriesturning into suppliers of nuclear arms to terroristorganizations? No  we cannot. And if today’s rulescannot avert States putting humanity at risk  we musttighten those rules and we must be ready to collectivelyenforce them.I therefore welcome President Bush’s proposalfor a binding Security Council resolution  tightening upthe non-proliferation rules. I suggest that we build onexisting export control regimes and make themuniversal and legally binding. This approach would bein line with the successful example of Security Councilresolution 1373 (2001)  containing binding obligationsfor States to take action against terrorism. Otherelements in a more forceful multilateral system are15greater attention to conflict prevention  better use ofsanctions or “smart sanctions”  an upgrading of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency’s inspectionsregime and  as suggested by President Chirac  apermanent instrument for inspections at the disposal ofthe Security Council.More robust multilateral action is also needed inour dealings with failed States. I am encouraged by theincreased willingness of the international community totake more determined action. Liberia is a test case. TheBrahimi report has shown us the right direction.Peacekeeping operations can only be effective if theyare based on a strong mandate  fully implemented onthe ground and fully backed by the key players in theSecurity Council. The five permanent members bear aspecial responsibility for global peace and securityNoblesse oblige.The United Nations is now also at the centre ofthe debate about Iraq. Let us put our past differenceson Iraq behind us. It is crucial now that theinternational community support the Iraqi people intheir reconstruction efforts. I trust that the SecurityCouncil will reach agreement  as soon as possible  onwhat we all want  in other words  stabilization  securityand transfer of sovereignty to a legitimate Iraqigovernment. This will also allow the United Nationsand the other multilateral institutions to make theirindispensable contributions to a better future for theIraqi people.A stronger United Nations is also needed for theeffective promotion and protection of human rights. Iregret that we do not live up to the expectations of theoppressed. The great dependence of the United NationsHigh Commissioner for Human Rights on voluntarycontributions is a major concern. His office shouldinstead receive a larger allocation from the regularUnited Nations budget. The promotion and protectionof human rights is United Nations core business.Speaking of human rights  there is no doubt thatterrorism itself ranks as one of the most serious threatsto democracy and the enjoyment of human rights.Terrorists seek to destroy democracy  freedom andtolerance. If we sacrifice those universal values in thestruggle against terrorists  we play into their hands.If I may speak for a moment as Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe (OSCE)  I can assure you thatour experience shows that policies aimed at promotinghuman rights  the rule of law and good governance canreinforce each other as parts of a more comprehensivesecurity strategy. The International Criminal Court isanother example of how to ensure that internationalnorms are upheld in cases where national Governmentsfail to do so.On the trafficking of human beings  women andchildren in particular  I share the concerns expressed byPresident Bush. He was right to draw a comparisonwith slavery. For the OSCE  the threat posed by theinternational trafficking of drugs  of small arms and ofwomen and children is a top priority. We have alreadytaken concrete action  adopting the OSCE Action Planto combat trafficking in human beings as an instrumentfor protecting our people. This Action Plan could serveas a model for worldwide action.Yet another reason why we need a robustmultilateral system is that we must break the cycles ofpoverty and violence we witness in many parts ofAfrica. This implies restoring stability and order as aprecondition for reconstruction and development. Italso requires an integrated approach. To this end myGovernment will set up a stability fund to tackle thetwin challenges of development and security. Becausedevelopment and security are closely linked  theMillennium Development Goals should remain at thecentre of our policies. The Netherlands remainscommitted to allocating 0.8 per cent of our gross domesticproduct to development cooperation and I call on allcountries to implement their Monterrey commitments.But development is not just a matter of aid  it will alsodepend on liberalizing trade. I am disappointed that theWorld Trade Organization Ministerial Conference inCancún failed to produce results.The legitimacy of the decisions of the SecurityCouncil is questioned because the composition of theCouncil no longer reflects today’s geopolitical realities.However  expansion is not a solution in itself.Effectiveness can easily fall victim to the quest forlegitimacy. Crucial to restored legitimacy is betterinteraction between the members of the Council andthe United Nations membership at large. Members ofthe Council should represent relevant and broadsections of world opinion.I agree with the Secretary-General that we needto take a hard look at the existing architecture ofinternational institutions. Many other organizations Iknow well  such as the OSCE  the European Union16(EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) (and I hope to get to know the lastorganization even better in the near future)  are in theprocess of redefining their roles in drastically changedcircumstances. The United Nations cannot be leftbehind. Interaction between the United Nations on theone hand  and regional organizations such as theOSCE  the EU and NATO on the other  is growing.There is considerable scope for intensifying thatinteraction  as is indeed foreseen in the Charter.As the Italian Presidency of the European Unionillustrated in its intervention here some days ago  theUnited Nations can count on the EU in the quest forrobust multilateralism. As a member State of the EU  theNetherlands fully endorses the Presidency’s statement.The EU’s new emphasis on countering the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction in its common foreign andsecurity policy is an example of how we want ourcommon efforts to be in the vanguard.Let me now focus on the General Assembly. Takethe example of how we deal with the Israeli-Palestinianconflict. Let us connect the General Assembly toreality. Instead of dealing with 23 resolutions  shouldwe not try to find our strength in a more focusedcentral message  supported by all  a message that callsupon both Israel and the Palestinians to put an end tothe bloodshed and violence and to immediatelyimplement the road map as the only viable way to long-lasting peace? The EU will continue to do all it can together with its partners in the Quartet  to helpPalestinians and Israelis reach that destination. I hopethat this Assembly can contribute.The Assembly should be made more effective. Ineed not repeat what you all know about overlappingor hardly relevant agenda items  repetitive debates andresolutions and the prevalence of the lowest commondenominator. As a contribution to improvement  mycountry tabled the Greentree report  the result of aseminar involving representatives from a wide circle ofcountries. The Greentree report aims at restoring theGeneral Assembly to its rightful place as the centrestage for worldwide deliberations on our commonproblems. We are certain that in that endeavour  wewill be able to count on the leadership and wisdom ofthe President of the General Assembly.My Government wholeheartedly supports thedecision of the Secretary-General to establish a panelof eminent persons. We look forward to hisrecommendations for next year’s session of theAssembly. Meanwhile  we should not sit back and wait.It is upon us Member States to engage now in thedebate on the pertinent reform questions the Secretary-General has put to us.In order to defuse the threats we face and to leavea better world for future generations  we need to domore than talk. We must act and we must act together.We need clear rules and strong institutions —institutions that ensure that the rules of the multilateralgame are respected  strengthened and enforced. Weneed a multilateral system with teeth; we need amultilateral system that works."
"127",5249,"NOR",58,2003,"﻿The brutal attacks on theUnited Nations Mission in Baghdad are beyondcomprehension. I condemn them in the strongestpossible terms. The perpetrators of such crimes must bebrought to justice. We must renew our efforts to bolsterrespect for humanitarian principles. It is unacceptablethat United Nations personnel are unable to conducthumanitarian relief operations without risking theirlives. It is unacceptable that United Nations personnelare denied access to people in distress.On behalf of the people of Norway  I wish toexpress my respect and admiration to all UnitedNations workers who are doing what they can to helpin Iraq and other zones of conflict and danger.Unless the security needs in Iraq are met valuable time on the road to political stability democracy and economic and social development willbe lost. Without a safe and secure environment  theUnited Nations is unable to help Iraq along that road. Ideplore the political assassinations of religious andpolitical leaders in Iraq.Now we must focus our attention on what isneeded to rebuild Iraq. Norway is participating ininternational efforts to stabilize and rebuild Iraq for thebenefit of the Iraqi people. Our aim is to help thepeople of Iraq regain control of their own destiny  tohelp them build a future of freedom and justice and alife in peace with their neighbours.The United Nations should play a key role insetting the benchmarks and guiding the politicalprocess towards the early restoration of Iraq’ssovereignty and the transfer of power to an Iraqigovernment. A carefully considered timeframe must bedrawn up. We must also make sure that the tasks thatwe decide for the United Nations in Iraq are realisticand achievable.Terrorism is a dark force  which targets the veryvalues and norms upon which the United NationsCharter is based. An overwhelming majority ofMember States have joined forces to fight it  and wehave taken some important steps together. We need tostrengthen the role of the United Nations in multilateraldisarmament  arms control and non-proliferation. Weneed to agree on strong and effective regimes that canprovide reliable protection against weapons of massdestruction.A week ago  world leaders and the Secretary-General sat down in New York at the invitation ofNorway to discuss ways to fight terrorism and the rootsof evil. They voiced their dedication to the fightagainst terrorism  and their determination to placehumanity at the centre of that fight.We want a United Nations that reaches out andresponds to the concerns of all Member States. It mustreach out and respond to the concerns of allindividuals  to the needs of men and women alike. Weneed a world of equal opportunities  where all theworld’s human resources — and not only half ofthem — are fully put to use. We have a vision of ahumane world where people can live in security anddignity  free from poverty and despair. To live up to theideals enshrined in the Charter  the United Nationsmust continue to give priority to human rights andfundamental aspects of governance.A culture of impunity for mass atrocities isincompatible with human dignity and undermines long-term security. The establishment of the InternationalCriminal Court is a historic turning point.Fighting terrorism  strengthening human security working for development and preventing conflict arechallenges that are closely related. In the Millennium16Development Goals  we have pledged to halve theproportion of people living in extreme poverty and toreduce child mortality by two-thirds. We have pledgedto halve the proportion of people without access to safedrinking water and basic sanitation.Norway currently holds the chairmanship of theCommission on Sustainable Development  and we arecommitted to achieving real progress. It is crucial thatdeveloping and developed countries and the privatesector all contribute. Development must be built on aglobal partnership and on shared responsibilities.Norway remains committed to the Doha DevelopmentAgenda. We are confident that strengthening andmaking full use of this multilateral framework is theway to go. We will work hard to get the negotiationsback on track.More often than not  the United Nations onlybecomes engaged in earnest after armed conflict hasbroken out. The reasons are many  but they are noexcuse for the loss of lives  the human misery and thesetbacks in development that are too often the highprice of collective inaction. Too often the main legacyof a civil war is another civil war. Yet there are manythings we can do to prevent this from happening.We can act to prevent economic conflict driverssuch as diamonds and other natural resources  fromfuelling and prolonging conflicts  and we can act tocurb the illegal trade in small arms. By fightingpoverty and promoting peace and development  we aremaking the soundest investment possible in Africa. Wewill assist the African Union and the New Partnershipfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) in their endeavourstowards economic and social development and politicalstability in Africa.Norway will continue working for peace andstability in the Horn of Africa. The peace processbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea is entering a crucialphase. We urge both parties to stand by theircommitments and not hesitate now that they stand atthe threshold of lasting peace.In the Sudan  important progress has just beenmade. We urge the parties to step up their efforts andreach a final settlement.Over the last few years  the United Nations hasmade considerable progress in peacekeeping. Thefoundations for a new approach have been laid.Notable results have been achieved in Kosovo  SierraLeone and Timor-Leste  as well as in reinforcing thecapabilities of the Department of PeacekeepingOperations and strengthening the United NationsStandby Arrangement System.The United Nations Assistance Mission inAfghanistan is facing a particularly challenging task.Two years on  much has been achieved  but thesituation is still volatile. The safe and secureenvironment needed for economic growth and fullimplementation of the Bonn Agreement is not in place.Many people are suffering from food shortages  and arein need of assistance. Elections are due next year.Women are not yet properly empowered. Unless we canassure nation-wide security  the nation-building processin Afghanistan will be at risk. A sustained internationalpresence will be necessary for the foreseeable future.With NATO in command of the InternationalSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF)  Norway as a NATOmember has an additional stake in the building of apeaceful and prosperous future for the people ofAfghanistan. We have decided to make Afghanistanone of our partner countries in developmentcooperation.In Sri Lanka the peace process has reached adecisive juncture. We are hopeful that the parties willsoon be able to embark on negotiations towards aninterim administration for the North-East Province. Itis vital that the parties reach agreement and resumedirect peace negotiations within the timeframeenvisaged.Development of the economic infrastructure isequally important for all in Sri Lanka. In parallel withdealing with the political process  the parties shouldtake care to proceed with the important task ofreconstruction and development.Norway remains firmly committed to the role offacilitator of the peace process between theGovernment of Sri Lanka and the LTTE. We call on theinternational community to engage in the efforts forreconstruction and rehabilitation in Sri Lanka.In Myanmar the Government has recently statedits intention to invite the democratic opposition and theethnic minorities to take part in the building of anational consensus. A good way to start would be torelease Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and withoutconditions and thereby demonstrate the Government’s17sincere intentions. This might mean the beginning of anew political era in Myanmar. Norway stands ready tosupport efforts to make democratization an irreversibleprocess. We strongly support the role of the UnitedNations and believe that the active involvement ofcountries in the region will be vital to reaching asolution.The year 2003 has been a tragic one for Israelisand Palestinians. Their acceptance of the road map forpeace boded well  but again violence and not politics isdetermining the course of development. A politicalsolution is needed  building on a parallel process whereIsrael takes significant steps to end the occupation  andwhere the Palestinian Authority takes determined stepsto fight terror. The ultimate goal  in which we will notlose faith  is that of two States — Israel andPalestine — living side by side in peace and security.Norway urges Israel to do its utmost to ease theliving conditions of the Palestinians. In our capacity aschairman of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee forassistance to the Palestinian people  Norway remainscommitted to rebuilding the Palestinian areas.Norway also believes that the parties should availthemselves of the assistance of the internationalcommunity and individual countries throughappropriate monitoring mechanisms.The past year has been a trying one for the UnitedNations. Multilateralism has come under pressure fromthose who continue to question the primacy of theUnited Nations and therefore look elsewhere forsolutions.The answer to this challenge is to make theUnited Nations more effective and thus more relevantin dealing with issues at the top of the internationalagenda. By increasing the relevance of the UnitedNations we can increase its authority and legitimacy.Norway shares the Secretary-General’s view thatMember States need to take a hard look at today’sUnited Nations institutions and ask whether they areadequate for the tasks we have before us.The time has come to advance the issue of reformof the Security Council. It is also time to agree on amore relevant agenda for the General Assembly  theEconomic and Social Council and the Commission onHuman Rights. Norway puts emphasis on reforming thework of the First Committee. We therefore welcomethe Secretary-General’s decision to appoint a high-levelpanel to recommend concrete ways in which tostrengthen the functioning of the major bodies of theUnited Nations and the relationships between them.Norway  together with the Nordic countries  has a long-standing commitment to reform. We stand ready toassist in bringing the initiatives of the Secretary-General to fruition.The aims and ideals of the United Nations are asrelevant as ever — to maintain peace and security  toreaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  to establishconditions for justice and the international rule of lawand to promote economic and social development.The world has changed since 1945  but the UnitedNations has not changed with it. I urge Member Statesto come together with a renewed sense of unity andpurpose  so that we can change our Organization in thecollective spirit that lies at the core of the Charter."
"128",5295,"NPL",58,2003,"﻿I greet Julian Hunte warmlyas President at this session and assure him of Nepal’sfull cooperation in his work. His Excellency JanKavan  the outgoing President  deserves ourappreciation for the job well done. I also pay tribute tothe distinguished Secretary-General for providingdynamic leadership to the United Nations.The last 12 months have been a momentousperiod of convulsive events. It has been a mixed bag.We have made a dent in combating terrorism  but itremains a serious threat to peace. Some countries havelimped back to normality  while others have descendedinto chaos. All sides have accepted the Middle Eastroad map  but a new cycle of violence is underminingit. Iraq continues to be a source of concern to all. Theglobal economic slump has turned the corner  butgrowth remains anaemic  and the Cancun trade talkshave foundered.In these developments  the United Nations hascome into a sharp focus that is not always flattering.However  Nepal has an abiding faith in the UnitedNations and believes in its centrality for all humanity’squest for shared peace  progress and justice. To smallnations like ours  the United Nations is and should bethe bulwark of sovereignty and defender of freedom. Ithas stood up to such challenges in the past  and it mustprepare itself to face the future just as boldly through aprocess of strengthened multilateralism.Today  the world faces a number of threats to itspeace  progress and harmony. Terrorism is now by farthe most immediate threat that afflicts countries  richand poor  large and small. After 11 September 2001 the concerted battle we have launched has pushedterror into retreat  but the decisive war against it thatwe must win has yet to be won.This scourge has not left the United Nationsuntouched either. For instance  two bombs explodedwithin the first two months of the United Nationspresence in Baghdad at its offices there  killing Mr.Sergio Vieira de Mello and others  and serving as agrim reminder of the indiscriminate dark threat ofterrorism. We condemn the assault on the UnitedNations and our profound condolences go to thecountries that lost their citizens and families who losttheir dear ones in those tragic attacks.My own nation is in the throes of terrorism perpetrated by the self-proclaimed Maoists for the lastseven years. Opposed to constitutional monarchy anddemocratic order  the Maoists have broken theseven-month ceasefire  withdrawn from the talks andunleashed unspeakable violence on the people. Theydid so even as the Government showed flexibility inaccommodating several of their demands and put acomprehensive package of reforms on the table.His Majesty’s Government has the duty to protectthe life and liberty of the people and to defend freedomand democracy in the country. We will do so resolutelybut also responsibly. While doing so  we have kept thedoor of dialogue open. On behalf of the Government  Ithank our friends for their understanding and assistancein our war against terror and the Secretary-General forhis interest and concern.Clearly  Iraq continues to be a serious issue. Nowthat the war is over  the global community must agreeto return sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly aspossible  to let them govern themselves and to helpthem rebuild their country. The United Nations shouldbe given an enhanced role in this process.Renewed violence in the Middle East hasimperilled the Quartet-endorsed road map  whichpromises a viable State to the Palestinians and securityto the Israelis. Nepal appeals to both sides to exercisemaximum restraint and engage in constructive dialogueto attain a comprehensive settlement of the long-festering crisis. It also appeals to Israel to reconsiderits decision to remove Palestinian President Arafat.The Security Council must take an early decisionto extend security throughout Afghanistan so thatrebuilding can go forward in the country. It should alsoaugment efforts to resolve conflicts and bring stabilityto volatile countries in Africa and elsewhere.Nepal has a deep interest in  and unwaveringcommitment to  United Nations peacekeeping.Nepalese Blue Helmets have served in variousmissions in an outstanding manner  and many of themhave made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of peaceand humanity. The United Nations should continue to39help poor troop-contributing countries to bridge theirresources gaps  and give them more say in missionplanning and deployment of forces.While firefighting in crisis situations is urgent the international community must look beyond theimmediacy of conflicts and attempt to build an edificeof durable peace in the world. Disarmament development and the rule of law are the pillars of sucharchitecture. There is a moral case for all of us to worktogether towards such peace and it is also a matter ofenlightened self-interest.Disarmament and confidence-building measuresare critical to building a culture of peace. Nuclearweapons are the greatest threat to humanity and mustbe eliminated  with their delivery vehicles  in a time-bound manner. Nuclear-weapon States should steadilyreduce their nuclear arsenals; the Conference onDisarmament must draw up a strategy to eradicatethese arms.As a nation committed to peace  Nepal welcomesthe proposals to establish nuclear-weapon-free zonesand to keep outer space free of weapons. We also stressthe necessity to reinforce the regimes banning chemicaland biological weapons and to strengthen measures toprevent the access of non-State actors to small armsand light weapons.Nepal supports the regional centres for peace anddisarmament as significant tools for buildingconfidence among nations. We eagerly look forward tohosting in Kathmandu the Regional Centre for Peaceand Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific. We haveasked the Secretariat to revise the draft host countryagreements so that they are consistent with diplomaticpractices and with the provisions for the other twocentres.Poverty is by far the most entrenched threat topeace and human dignity  and development is the mostdaunting challenge for the world. The globalcommunity must act together to lift people indeveloping countries from the perils of hunger ignorance  disease and despair. We must create jobsand opportunities to enable people to lead a decent lifeand to raise their stakes in peace and order. Nepal hasaccorded the highest priority to poverty alleviation inits current plan  modelled after the Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers. Broad-based growth  social sectordevelopment  targeted programmes and goodgovernance constitute the strategy of the plan. We haveliberalized our economy to foster broader partnershipwith the private sector  non-governmentalorganizations and community groups and provide awider space for foreign investment.Improvements in the agriculture and socialsectors as well as in rural infrastructure constitute thecore of our quest for poverty reduction and sustainabledevelopment. However  Nepal lacks sufficientresources to achieve its development objectives. Ourresource constraints have become more acute due toMaoist insurgency and consequent economicdisruption. Many other developing countries are in asimilar situation.The global community must join forces  in aspirit of partnership  to eradicate absolute poverty andstimulate development in developing nations. Indeed the Millennium Summit and global conferences onfinancing  sustainable development  HIV/AIDS andtrade have clearly laid down the way forward. We mustensure that these compacts do not fail in the crucible ofimplementation.As developing countries lead efforts for theirprogress  development partners must keep theircommitments by meeting development assistancetargets and providing debt relief to the highly indebtedpoor countries  including the least developed nations.Increasing development assistance alone however  will do little to help developing countriesunless rich nations dismantle their farm subsidies andpull down their tariff and non-tariff barriers to productsfrom the South. Improved access to world markets iscritical for poor nations to attract investment  removetheir supply-side constraints and transform theireconomies. In this context  the Cancun trade talks mustbe resumed soon and in such a manner thatglobalization brings benefits to the poor as well.His Majesty’s Government is grateful to theWorld Trade Organization for deciding to admit Nepaland Cambodia as new members. That is just the firststep. Nepal needs  as other least developed countriesdo  duty-free and quota-free access to  and increasedassistance from  rich nations to escape the poverty trapand to integrate itself into the global economy.Landlocked developing countries face geographichandicaps and remoteness from the major corridors ofglobal commerce. We welcome the fact that the AlmatyProgramme of Action addresses their problem and we40thank the transit and development partners for makingthe ministerial meeting a success. We urge all sides tomake concerted efforts to implement the AlmatyProgramme of Action.Democracy  fairness and the rule of law are thebuilding blocks of secure peace at home and across theworld. With this in view  Nepal has embracedpluralistic democracy  constitutional monarchy  and theinviolability of human rights and freedoms as thedefining features in our present Constitution.Our pledge to these values and ideals remains asstrong as ever. Parliamentary elections postponed dueto the Maoist threat will be held as soon as possible and immediate steps will be taken to restore andreactivate local authorities. The Government isseriously committed to doing this.The Government has accorded high priority toraising the status of women  children anddisadvantaged people  as well as to preventingtrafficking in women. It has established juvenile courtsand strengthened the court system  and has tried to givethe human rights protection and anti-corruptionagencies the necessary tools and resources to do theirjob.Nepal firmly believes that the world communityshould try its level best to promote democracy  justiceand fairness in world trade  global governance andinternational relations. In this spirit  we underscore theimperative need for change in the global trade regime for reform in the international financial architectureand for help to developing countries to overcome theirproblems.Speaking of justice  nearly 100 000 Bhutaneserefugees living in camps in Nepal have been waitingfor over a decade to return home in safety and dignity.We hope Bhutan will show more flexibility in thebilateral negotiations to find an early and justsettlement. We call on the world community  includingthe Office of the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees (UNHCR)  to help create a climateconducive for resolving this distressing humanitarianproblem by sustaining its interest and assistance for themaintenance of the refugees at this crucial juncture.No organization can stand the test of time unlessit is prepared to carry out bold reforms. Events in therun-up to the Iraq war have shown the frailty of theUnited Nations and underlined the imperative forimmediate and balanced reforms for the Organizationto secure more legitimacy  not only in the eyes of therich but also in the perception of the poor.While we welcome the reforms the GeneralAssembly adopted last year  we support the Secretary-General’s proposal to set up a high-level panel to seekways to make the United Nations a vibrant  effectiveand efficient Organization  which can come to gripswith emerging challenges.As we see it  it is imperative for the GeneralAssembly to reclaim its primacy at the United Nationsand for the Economic and Social Council to make itswork more visible and relevant to ordinary people. Toachieve these objectives  we must not only rationalizethe agendas of those organs but also ensure that theyadopt fewer but more relevant resolutions —resolutions that could be implemented to benefithumanity.Reforms are long overdue to make the SecurityCouncil more democratic in its work and morerepresentative in its structure. Nepal expresses its deepconcern at the lack of tangible progress for over adecade on the issue of Council enlargement and urgesall Member States to scale up their efforts to achievethat goal. In our view  the Non-Aligned Movementshould play an active role in United Nations reform. Itshould also work closely with the G-77 to advancetheir shared agenda in this and other respects.In South Asia  as elsewhere  we view regionalcooperation as an instrument of South-Southcooperation for collective progress in the region andthe world at large. The South Asian Association forRegional Cooperation (SAARC) has been inspired bythat aspiration. Let us hope our region can put itspolitical differences behind it and steam ahead to findthe place South Asia deserves in the community ofnations.If our immediate and overriding preoccupation athome is the restoration of peace  our commitment toregional cooperation and a just and secure worldconstitutes an objective of equal order. The world haswitnessed the resilience of the Nepalese people duringthe difficult periods in our history. We remain equallycommitted today to overcome the current challenge. Icall on friends and well-wishers of Nepal for greaterunderstanding and cooperation to help us helpourselves in our onward journey to peace and progress."
"129",5312,"NRU",58,2003,"﻿It gives me greatpleasure to deliver this statement on behalf of HisExcellency Rene Harris  President and Minister forForeign Affairs of the Republic of Nauru  who had tocancel his trip to New York at the last minute due topressing matters at home. President Harris has askedme to convey to Mr. Julian Hunte warmestcongratulations on his assumption of the stewardship ofthe Assembly. As a small island developing State Nauru is extremely proud to be associated with theCaribbean Community on Mr. Hunte’s marvellousachievement  which gives us hope that we in thePacific will also have the opportunity to preside overthe Assembly.My delegation would like  through him  tocommend His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan  President ofthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session  forhis excellent leadership and the great efforts that hemade  particularly in tackling the difficult issues thathave plagued the revitalization of the GeneralAssembly as the premier organ of the United Nations.The President has pledged to continue the good workthat has been done in these areas  and he can count onNauru’s full cooperation.Peace and security — or  more correctly  the lackof it — is still the main focus of the United Nations 58years after its inception. In the past 24 months  we haveseen the internationalization of terrorism manifest itselfout of a cocktail of hatred  desperation and fanaticismthat has spread its tentacles from the Middle East intothe international arena. It is unconventional clandestine  and indiscriminate with respect to itsvictims. We are also seeing an increase in theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction after aperiod of relative calm  and this is further exacerbatingthe situation.The sum of these two nightmarish threats is acause for concern  and States that feel uniquelyvulnerable to terrorist acts are considering the realpossibility of terrorists gaining access to weapons ofmass destruction. That scenario has forced such Statesto develop the antidote of unilateral action primed witha pre-emptive strike policy.We saw it in action in Afghanistan and  sixmonths ago in Iraq  just as President Bush said wewould if the Security Council failed to walk the talk ofresolution 1441 (2002)  which called for thedisarmament by Iraq of its weapons of massdestruction. Nauru is disappointed that President Bushdid not refer in his statement last week to the status ofthe coalition’s search for stockpiles of these weapons and we are puzzled as to why it is hard to find themwhen intelligence indicated that the Iraqis could armand unleash them so as to hit the United Kingdomwithin 45 minutes.My delegation considers the antidote to which Ireferred to be the catalyst in the new wave of nuclearweapons proliferation  and it is not a coincidence thatthe countries singled out as part of the “axis of evil”are being accused of developing nuclear weapons.Nauru joins the appeal to the countries concerned toobserve their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to allow theInternational Atomic Energy Agency to carry outinspections and verify that nuclear weapons are notbeing developed.In all of this  we are certain of one thing: that themajor casualty of the current state of affairs is theinnocence of the United Nations  which was mortallywounded in Baghdad when the lives of 22 dedicatedUnited Nations servants were lost  including that of the22revered Sergio Vieira de Mello  and more than 100were injured.The people of Nauru join the United Nationsfamily in mourning the victims of that tragedy  and ourheartfelt condolences go to the bereaved families. Thatdespicable act of terror has cast a shadow over thesafety and security of United Nations personneleverywhere. The clarity of its emblem  which stood fortolerance  hope and impartiality and which had acted asa shield against attack  may have been blurred by itssubservient role to the administering force in Iraq.In the light of the facts before us  Nauru fullyagrees with the assessment made by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  in his bold and gutsystatement that the Organization has “come to a fork inthe road” and that we are in a moment of time that is“no less decisive than 1945 itself  when the UnitedNations was founded.” (A/58/PV.7  p. 3)Nauru fully supports the proposal to establish ahigh-level panel of eminent personalities to reviewthreats to peace and security and other globalchallenges insofar as these may influence or beconnected with such threats. Nauru strongly believes inmultilateralism as a key tool in resolving contemporaryproblems in all of their complexity.The Security Council should be at the centre ofour collective efforts in maintaining peace andresolving conflict. At the same time  the Council musthave at its disposal the means of making evaluationsand taking collective action. Most importantly  it musthave the will to act quickly and decisively  not only tothreats to peace and security  but to genocide and othermassive violations of human rights.Nauru is pleased to see the rapid progressiontowards making the International Criminal Courtoperational since its Statute came into force in July2001. We believe that the objectives of the Court makeit a useful addition to the international tool kit for thepreservation of peace  as perpetrators of atrocious actsin armed conflict have been put on notice that they willbe held accountable for their acts or omissions.As a small island developing State in the PacificOcean  Nauru aligns itself with the statements of theleaders of the Pacific nations who have spoken beforeme on the concerns and challenges that we  the small-island-big-ocean developing States are facing  now andin the future. Nauru bears all the unique characteristicsof a small island State  given our small size  in terms ofboth land area and population  our remoteness and ourvulnerability to exogenous forces  be they man-made ornatural.In 1994  the world community agreed that smallisland developing States warranted specialconsideration with regard to their economic and socialdevelopment because of the unique set ofcharacteristics that are inherent in each island country and it was to address those unique problems that theBarbados Plan of Action was created.As His Royal Highness the Prime Minister ofTonga stated in his intervention  the road to sustainabledevelopment for small island developing States isposted with signs of undertakings  as we marched fromBarbados in 1994 to New York in 1999 for the five-year review  then on to Monterrey in 2002 for theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment  where more signs were posted sayingthat internal self-help  good governance and trade werethe key to poverty alleviation  and that subscription tothose cures would provide the way for developedcountries to come in and help. Most  if not all  of thesmall island developing States have been taking thismedicine for a long time  and we have yet to see thedoctor. In Johannesburg  a whole chapter was devotedto the cause of the small island developing States. InApril of this year  the Commission on SustainableDevelopment paved the way for an internationalmeeting to be held in Mauritius in 2004.Yet despite all these signs of good intentions  thereality is that  when small island developing States tryto see that these decisions or undertakings are reflectedin other international forums  our proposals in mostcases are either rejected or rendered impotent afterintense and difficult negotiations. The Cancún meetingis a good example  as is the recent meeting ofConvention bodies such as the Eighth Conference ofthe Parties to the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change in New Delhi in 2002 and the Sixth Conference of the Parties to the UnitedNations Convention to Combat Desertification  held inHavana recently. This undesirable situation needs to beaddressed if small island developing States are tobenefit from the positive outcomes of internationalmeetings or review conferences.23As we march towards Mauritius  small islanddeveloping States will have to endure due process inthe Second Committee and at the twelfth session of theCommission on Sustainable Development in order toestablish administrative and financial norms for theinternational meeting. My delegation suspects thatthere will be many bumps and detours on the way  butour hope is that  at the end of the road  the outcomewill focus on what needs to be done — when and bywhom — to overcome impediments in theimplementation of the Programme of Action.It is not sufficient to rely solely on the BarbadosProgramme of Action to address all the developmentproblems of small island developing States. To thatend  Nauru sees the Millennium Development Goals assupplementing the Programme of Action by adding thehuman development dimension to the scope of issuesthat should be addressed and by offering partnership todrive the process.However  for small island States like Nauru  thecomplex reporting requirement of the Goals is addingto the burden of reports that we are required to prepare and therefore it is the considered view of mydelegation that the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme should tailor the questionnaire to suit agroup of clients rather than use a one-size-fits-allapproach. Assistance also should be provided tocountries such as Nauru to collect and process the rawdata required for the report.Nauru  like other low-lying small island States sees the Kyoto Protocol as its salvation from sea-levelrise and climate change  which would devastate ouralready fragile ecological system  which is essential toour livelihood and culture. My delegation understandsthat the Russian Federation now stands between theKyoto Protocol’s coming into force and its continuingto languish. If that is the case  then Nauru calls on theRussian Federation to do what is universally right andjust by ratifying the protocol before the meeting of theNinth Conference of the Parties to the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change  to be heldin Italy in December this year.A healthy Pacific Ocean and the sustainable useof its natural resources  including highly migratory fishstocks  are also critical to our livelihood. We in thePacific have walked the talk on these issues throughthe development of an ocean policy to guide us in themanagement of our part of the Pacific Ocean and toform the framework for future regional ocean-relatedinitiatives.Secondly  we have adopted a Convention on theConservation and Management of Highly MigratoryFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean which provides a comprehensive regime for themanagement of the region’s highly migratory fishstocks  both in our exclusive economic zone and in thehigh seas.The trans-shipment of nuclear waste through ourwaters is of great concern to many island countriesbecause of the damage it could cause.My delegation has stated during previous debatesthat it agrees fully with the proposal to reform theSecurity Council to bring it into tune with the realitiesof today’s world order. We are disappointed that  after10 years of debate  there is still no convergence ofviews between the two camps on how to move forward.To try to address the expansion along with thequestion of the veto would be like riding a deadhorse — we would not go anywhere  which is exactlythe situation we are in.Furthermore  my delegation believes that we havedone all we can do at the representative level  and thatthe only way we can make progress is to take it to ahigher level  so that our political leaders can reviewwhat we have done and make a decision on how tomove forward.On the question of reforms to operational policiesand administrative structures  including budgetaryaspects of the United Nations  my delegation fullysupports the actions taken by the Secretary-General inthis regard  but it appears that much more has to bedone. The areas of review have to be enlarged andintensified  if indeed the prediction that the regularbudget is going to exceed the $3 billion mark iscorrect.Finally  concerning reform  my delegation fullysupports the view expressed by Australia that the groupsystem needs modernization. Most of the Pacific smallisland countries are buried in the Asian group  whichextends from the Pacific Ocean to the Suez Canal while our big brothers  Australia and New Zealand  are“Others” in the Western European group. Outside theUnited Nations system  the Pacific is usually groupedwith East Asia  in both economic and geopoliticalzoning. We see no reason why this cannot be the case24at the United Nations  considering that the dividebetween Eastern and Western Europe will becomemeaningless as the two converge.Nauru  because of biased and incorrect mediareports over the last five years  now carries a stigma asa haven for money-laundering through offshore banksregistered in Nauru. There have also been reports thatour Citizen Investment Programme is aiding andabetting criminals and terrorists  allowing them freemovement by making possible the acquisition ofNauruan passports.The reluctance of foreign authorities to provideproof of allegations of criminal activities by banksregistered in Nauru prevented the Government frominitiating the mechanism provided for in our legislationto release information on offshore banks to foreignauthorities. This has put us on a collision course.Nauru was not surprised when  in 2000  theFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) of theOrganization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) listed it along with others as anon-cooperating country. The following year  Nauru’sstatus was further downgraded  and it was put on thelist for “countermeasures” by members of FATF  notbecause our laws were insufficient  but because thegoalposts were shifted and our failure involved a lackof capacity and capability to supervise the offshorebanks registered in Nauru.In December 2002  the United StatesGovernment  in taking up FATF’s call to applycountermeasures against Nauru  announced that Nauruwould be designated a “money-laundering” countryunder the provisions of the Patriotic Act. The highestlevel of sanctions would be applied  which wouldprohibit all commercial and financial transactionsbetween any Nauru-registered financial institution andthe United States. In May 2003 Nauru was accordinglyinformed and was given 30 days to show cause as towhy the sanction should not be applied.Nauru submitted its comments  passed new lawsin March of this year repealing the registration ofoffshore banks  and included a sunset clauseterminating the licenses that would come into effect 30to 180 days — as the case may be — from 27 March2003  when the law came into force. The Governmenthas also suspended the Citizen Investment Programmewhile it reviews the law  in order to address theconcerns expressed by the United States Department ofState.A new anti-money-laundering law was passed inMarch  and work is in progress on omnibus legislationthat would address the financing of terrorism transnational organized crime and money-laundering.Nauru also signed an article 98 agreement with theUnited States.In the process  Nauru has lost close to $2 million if not more  in revenue  which is a drop in the ocean toOECD members but real money to us  considering thatit is equivalent to 5 per cent of the Government’sannual budget. We are now waiting to learn our fate —awaiting the judgement of the United States and theFATF  as the two are interlinked.To conclude  Nauru  small as it is  believes thatpower consists in a nation’s capacity to link its willwith the purpose of others  to lead by reason and givethe gift of cooperation."
"130",5359,"NZL",58,2003,"﻿The General Assemblyis meeting in the shadow of the tragedy last month inwhich United Nations staff were killed or injured inBaghdad. New Zealand unreservedly condemns suchbrutal and calculated acts of terror. The United Nations after all  was in Iraq to improve the conditions of Iraqipeople and to assist the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty.We mourn the loss of all those who perished. Inparticular  I pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello  whoworked so effectively in the world’s trouble spots including Timor-Leste  where New Zealand workedalongside him and developed huge admiration for hisability and determination.This was not the first occasion on which theemployees of the international community have beentargeted  although it was the worst. History suggeststhat it will not be the last.To do its work effectively  the United Nationsmust interact with local communities  not operate frombehind barbed wire and concrete barriers. Itsemployees are mainly unarmed civilians. We  the StatesMembers of the United Nations  must do more toprotect those whom we employ to work on our behalf.Nine years ago New Zealand was at the forefrontin creating the Convention for the Safety of United7Nations and Associated Personnel. It was opened forsignature in 1995. Regrettably  only one third of themembership has since become a party to it. We urge allcountries to do so now.New Zealand believes that the Convention shouldbe widened to cover all situations where UnitedNations and other associated personnel are engaged inpeacekeeping  humanitarian and other assistance-related activities.Over the last year we have witnessed terroristattacks  including in Casablanca  Riyadh and Jakarta as well as in Baghdad.Next month is the first anniversary of the terroristattack in Bali  in which more than 200 people lost theirlives. And two years ago this city itself was the victimof the 9/11 attacks  which took 3 000 lives.International terrorism remains the primary threat tothe security and well-being of people across the world.If we are to defeat terrorism  regional cooperationis imperative. In the Asia Pacific region  a concertedresponse to terrorism is now at the centre of theAssociation of South-east Asian Nations RegionalForum agenda and is becoming increasingly importantin the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.The Pacific Islands Forum is respondingcollectively to security challenges  including terrorism transnational crimes and challenges to nationalintegrity and independence.An effective campaign against terrorism requiresinternational collaboration on intelligence  military social and economic measures.New Zealand is aware that while we focus on thesymptoms of terrorism  the international communitymust work together to tackle the conditions that fosterit. We welcome the Norwegian initiative to strengthenanalysis of the causes of terrorism. There are simply noends that can justify the death and the maiming ofvulnerable and innocent people.New Zealand has  since 1972  supported thedevelopment of a comprehensive international regime tooutlaw terrorism. I hope that the General Assembly willbe able to move forward on this issue and conclude thecomprehensive and nuclear terrorism conventions.In combating terrorism  however  we shouldavoid undermining the very values we are seeking touphold. The fight against terrorism should not becomean excuse to justify actions that do not conform tointernational standards of humanity.New Zealand is the current Chair of the PacificIslands Forum  which it hosted last month. Leadersstrongly endorsed the Regional Assistance Mission tothe Solomon Islands — a concrete example of theregion working together to assist one of its members torestore security  stability and progress to its people.New Zealand joined with the other members ofthe Pacific Islands Forum in responding to a requestfrom the Solomon Islands Government for police andmilitary assistance to end the actions of armedcriminals responsible for the deterioration in the socialand economic conditions in the Solomon Islands. Apolice-led operation has been working successfully torestore the rule of law and economic stability.In failed or weak States  Governments often lack thecapacity or will to exercise territorial control. That cancreate a power vacuum for terrorist organizations andcriminals to exploit and maintain safe havens  trainingfacilities and bases for launching terrorist operations.The Regional Assistance Mission has goneexceptionally well to date and has received strongsupport from the people of the Solomon Islands. It is aPacific solution to a Pacific problem. Cooperation andcommitment by Pacific States to respond to regionalsecurity needs  under the umbrella of the Pacific IslandsForum  is a model that other regions could adopt.The statements of support from the Secretary-General and the Security Council for this regionalaction  taken in accordance with the Charter  arewelcome. We would urge the United Nations to assistwhere it can the process of rebuilding the socialstructure and the economy of that country.New Zealand is working to enhance andcomplement existing security capabilities within thePacific region. We are engaged in a number ofactivities  including establishing border securitysystems and drafting model legislation to addressterrorism and transnational organized crime.The international community must retain anongoing commitment to Afghanistan  where PresidentKarzai’s Government continues to face significantchallenges. Improving security outside Kabul will be acrucial element in bringing political stability toAfghanistan.8It is in the interests of us all to assist in therestoration of Afghanistan — not only for the well-being of the Afghan people  but also so that terroristscannot operate freely within its borders.Earlier this week  New Zealand assumedleadership of the Provincial Reconstruction Team inBamian Province. I am pleased that we coulddemonstrate support for the Afghanistan TransitionalGovernment in this way.The shared nightmare of all States is thatweapons of mass destruction or the materials fromwhich they can be constructed will find their way intothe terrorist arsenal. The possibility of nuclear weaponsin the hands of terrorists is a worst-case scenario withhorrific implications. We must do everything we can toprevent this from happening.The possible acquisition of nuclear weapons byterrorist groups increases as the numbers and types ofthese weapons  and the States that possess them continue to expand. For these and other reasons theelimination of these weapons is vital.New Zealand calls on all countries to commit andto adhere to multilateral disarmament and arms controltreaties.North Korea’s proclaimed nuclear weaponsprogramme is a major concern. We urge North Korea toresume its cooperation with the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA) and its commitment to theNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The currentmultilateral dialogue process is a positive way forward.We commend China for facilitating this.Iran  too  must heed the strong message of theinternational community and take the urgent stepsrequired to restore confidence that its nuclearintentions are peaceful.The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is equallyabout nuclear disarmament. The commitment given bythe nuclear-weapon States to give up their nuclearweapons  reaffirmed unequivocally at the NPT ReviewConference in 2000  must be honoured.The nuclear Powers have a particular responsibilityin this respect. They must lead by example againstproliferation. Meaningful steps toward permanentdisarmament would add to their moral authority indemanding that others must not develop nuclearweapons capability.The invasion of Iraq has had a profound impacton this Organization. We regret that differences of viewcould not be resolved in the Security Council.The reconstruction of Iraq  the restoration of itssovereignty and the rebuilding of political and socialstructures to guarantee the Iraqi people a better life arenow the critical issues. We welcome initiatives to pushforward the political and constitutional process.The passage of Security Council resolutions 1483(2003) and 1500 (2003) recognizes the vital role of theUnited Nations and the need for the internationalcommunity to be fully engaged in reconstructionefforts. While responsibility for security mustinevitably rest with coalition forces  multilateralismoffers the best prospect and the greatest legitimacy forthe process of transition back to Iraqi self-rule.New Zealand has announced substantialcontributions to reconstruction and humanitarian reliefwork. These include the deployment of a New ZealandDefence Force light engineer group to work onhumanitarian and reconstruction tasks alongside aUnited Kingdom engineer regiment in southern Iraq.We have helped with demining operations and havemade contributions through United Nations agencies the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations.New Zealand continues to view the UnitedNations as the best hope we have to collectively pursuethe principles enshrined in the Charter. The strength ofthe United Nation is that it brings all countries of theworld together on an equal footing to address commonproblems. Millions of people around the world have hadtheir lives improved by the actions of the United Nations.East Timor is but one recent example of its effectivenesswhen it is supported by a common will to act.At the same time  we all recognize the need toreform the Organization. In opening this session  theSecretary-General called on us to consider whether therules and instruments of this multilateral institutioncontinue to serve us well. We have been discussing thereform of the Security Council for more than a decadenow. It is time to make an institution designed in anearlier age  for a smaller number of nations morerepresentative and responsive to the 191 currentMembers of the United Nations. We welcome theestablishment of a panel to address key issuesfundamental to the Organization’s future role. MemberStates will need to put aside self-interest and9differences to reach agreement on the panel’s findingsand to translate those into action.Fifty-eight years ago  the United Nations wascreated in the aftermath of the death and devastationthat had resulted from two world wars. The vision ofits founders was that of an organization that wouldestablish rules to govern international behaviour  withprocedures to enforce them through collective action. TheUnited Nations was bestowed with a unique legitimacyand unique authority to resolve conflict. Whatever itsshortcomings  it remains an indispensable organization.The challenge before us is to create the structuresand provide the political will that will enable it todeliver the peaceful  just and prosperous world that isthe hope and expectation of humanity."

We assure you of ourreadiness to work with you and to contribute sincerelyand successfully to the achievement of the noble goalswe all seek to accomplish in the service of humanity and to the safety and security of the internationalcommunity. I also take this opportunity to express ourheartfelt thanks to your predecessor  His ExcellencyMr. Jan Kavan  who presided over the previous session for his efforts to guarantee the success of the regularsession and the special sessions held during the pastyear.Let me also acknowledge the tireless and seriousefforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  topromote the leading role of the United Nations in thefield of international peace and security.6Once again  we stress the Sultanate of Oman’ssupport for the Organization in its endeavours toachieve the purposes and principles of the Charter.At the outset  I should like to shed some light onthe measures taken by my country to develop itsimportant institutions  particularly the judiciary. It isour strong belief that a fair and just judiciary forms thebasis for social and economic development. In ourcontemporary history  the Sultanate of Oman hasenabled the judiciary to become the most importantmeans of establishing justice  issuing fair rulings andremoving injustices in society  without interference bythe Executive branch or by any other branch ofGovernment. That development was endorsed in theconstitutional State system enacted by His MajestySultan Qaboos Bin Said through decree 101/96  issuedon 6 November 1996.His Majesty also issued decree 90/99  whichenacted the law granting full independence to thejudiciary  on 21 November 1999. That law regulates thejurisdiction and the functions of courts of variouscircuits and at various levels. Moreover  the SupremeCourt was established at the top of the judicialpyramid  with competence to standardize legalprinciples and to address faulty rulings. That wasfollowed by a series of laws organizing various judicialorgans  including a law establishing the higher judicialsystem. Additionally  a draft law on civil and tradeprocedures has been elaborated.All of the aforementioned demonstrates HisMajesty’s interest in guaranteeing the well-being of theOmani citizen and in ensuring that all citizens arefamiliar with their rights and obligations  which areguaranteed through the right to due process.In the spirit of continued development andbroadened participation by the Omani people in oursocial and economic development programmes  mycountry — since the dawn of the blessed renaissancethat began in 1970 at the initiative of His MajestySultan Qaboos Bin Said and that has continuedthroughout the past 33 years — has adopted anapproach utilizing the experience and expertise ofOmani citizens in the Majlis al-Shura  or ConsultativeCouncil  which includes positive aspects of our culturalheritage in the modern development of the Sultanate.Our Consultative Council process has witnessed aqualitative shift and an important transformation in ourmodern history. His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Saidissued royal instructions in October 2002 expandingthe base of popular participation in elections for theOmani Consultative Council by granting every citizen male or female  over the age of 21  the right to vote andto participate in the next election — scheduled for4 October — to select the 83 members of theConsultative Council for its fifth session  from 2004 to2006. That step complements previous steps aimed atdeveloping the Consultative Council. Those importantdevelopments in the Sultanate of Oman will create astrong foundation for more development andadvancement programmes to benefit the Omani people.We have followed recent developments inPalestine with grave concern. The Palestinian NationalAuthority responded positively to the internationalcommunity’s demands by accepting the road map —considered the most important document in the historyof the Arab-Israeli conflict — which embodies theinternational commitment to establishing anindependent  sovereign Palestinian State alongside theState of Israel. Nevertheless  the cycle of violencebetween the Palestinians and the Israeli Governmentcontinues unabated  which may doom the entire peaceprocess  plunging it into a dark abyss from which itcould be very difficult to rescue it. Therefore  theQuartet — sponsor of the road map — must shoulderits international responsibilities in that regard.One might well wonder how peace can beachieved between the Palestinian and Israeli peopleswhen the Israeli Government has decided in principleto expel President Yasser Arafat  Chairman of thePalestinian Authority and elected leader of thePalestinian people. One might also ask whether theGovernment of Israel  a Member State of the UnitedNations  is honouring its commitments under theCharter. The United Nations must intervene to put anend to that Israeli policy. Israel must respond to theinternational community’s demands and must complywith international resolutions. It must respondpositively to international efforts aimed atimplementation of the road map  which provides bothparties with international guarantees aimed atachieving peace based on the establishment of anindependent  sovereign Palestinian State on allPalestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967.Such a solution would give the States in the region ahistoric opportunity to build a new Middle East. In thatconnection  we must warn that failure to commit to theestablishment of a Palestinian State in conformity with7the road map would create a crisis with catastrophicresults.My country shares with many other MemberStates the view that peace in the Middle East regionwill not be true and lasting unless our approach is justand comprehensive. In that connection  the Sultanate ofOman reaffirms its support for Lebanon’s right torestore the remaining Sheba’a farms and the SyrianArab Republic’s right to recover the Syrian Golan occupied on 4 June 1967.The war against Iraq in the first half of this yearwas only one link in the chain of wars that have beenendured by the Middle East region. That war created anew reality  characterized mainly by the collapse of theformer regime  the creation of a huge political andsecurity vacuum and deterioration in basic services forIraqi society. The continued lack of security in Iraq andthe resulting loss of lives — in addition to thedestruction of the United Nations Office and theescalation in assassinations — certainly do not helpIraq in this phase of re-establishing the Governmentand rebuilding the country.Prompted by our concern about the situation inIraq  we believe that efforts are needed to enable theIraqis to assume full responsibility for managing theircountry. Iraq has an abundance of national experts inevery field. These qualified Iraqi cadres are capable ofleading the process of restoring security and ofrebuilding and fully developing their country. Iraq alsopossesses enormous economic and human resourcesthat could help it to regain its strength and to play itsregional and international roles. Undoubtedly  an activerole for the United Nations and its specialized agencieswill help us to attain our common objective: unity andterritorial integrity for Iraq and prosperity and securityfor all its people.Committed to Iraq’s sovereignty  territorialintegrity and unity  we welcomed the formation of thetransitional Governing Council. We believe it essentialto deal with that political institution so that we begin tobuild the right foundations for post-war Iraq —including the provision of basic services and thecreation of a political climate conducive to theestablishment of a stable political system that willrespond to the Iraqi people’s wishes — as a prelude tobeginning the reconstruction phase.Stability and the consolidation of security arerequirements of all peoples throughout the world. Wein the Sultanate of Oman — like all other countries inthe Middle East — have been following with interestand optimism the official contacts taking place invarious conflict areas. We hope that the contacts anddiscussions between the United Arab Emirates and theIslamic Republic of Iran concerning the islandsbelonging to the United Arab Emirates will enable thetwo countries to arrive at an effective mechanism tosettle their dispute. In addition  we appreciate theinitiatives by India and Pakistan aimed at starting adialogue between them. Moreover  my country hopesthat the two Koreas and other concerned parties will beable to reach an agreement that addresses the variousoutstanding issues through constructive dialogue andadherence to international conventions and resolutions.We hope that that part of the world will ultimatelyachieve peace and coexistence.We also pay tribute to the peaceful efforts tosolve the conflicts in Africa  and call on theinternational community to assist in developing a fairsystem to improve economic conditions and amechanism to relieve the onerous burden of debt onAfrican countries.International policies have in recent years led tothe emergence of various types of terrorist acts. All ofus must pause and deeply focus on this phenomenon which targets people’s security and safety. We believethat it has become essential to study in acomprehensive and cooperative manner the root causesunderlying this phenomenon. Although we fullysupport international efforts to combat terrorism by allavailable means  we must allocate part of the massivefinancial resources devoted to combating terrorism tohelp the least developed countries that may be fertileground for terrorist activities.There is no doubt that United Nations efforts inthe field of disarmament are leading nowhere. Theywill remain an exercise in futility so long as MemberStates cannot count on an effective system of collectivesecurity safeguards. Without such a system responsibility for assessments of the level and qualityof weapons needed will be subjective and fall solely toindividual Governments. This would open the doorwide to further arms races  and hinder progress towardsdisarmament or the reduction of armaments.While supporting the efforts to limit armaments the Sultanate of Oman affirms the need to takepractical measures in accordance with the International8Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regime of mutualguarantees. My country signed a safeguards agreementwith the IAEA on 28 June 2001 at the headquarters ofthe Agency in Vienna.My country also believes that it is essential topromote cooperation between States to reduce theillegal trafficking of small arms and light weapons which are the reason for most of the conflicts in theworld. My country notes the efforts made by the UnitedNations to achieve the elimination of all lethal weaponsfrom every corner of the earth and from outer space.My country supports all these efforts and underlinesthe responsibility of the international Organization forestablishing a world order that is more capable ofguaranteeing security for all States in a manner thatreflects the reality of life in the third millennium. Itshould be consistent with partnership and withresponsibilities  which are essential for the success ofall efforts.This session is being convened at a time ofcontinuous and intertwined development at the worldeconomic  financial and trade levels. Many economiesstill suffer from economic stagnation and recession.The Sultanate of Oman appreciates the continuedefforts of the International Bank  the InternationalMonetary Fund and the World Trade Organization(WTO) to achieve complementarity in their work sothat they may confront the challenges that the countriesof the world are now facing. These challenges includeeconomic growth  sustainable development  povertyreduction and financial stability and balance.Since its accession to the World TradeOrganization in October 2000  the Sultanate of Omanhas taken great strides towards implementing itscommitments to the Organization. The Sultanate hasintroduced many amendments and improvements to itssystems  organizations and laws  and has enacted newlegislation in conformity with the requirements of theWorld Trade Organization.My country has also been following with greatinterest the ongoing negotiations in the framework ofthe World Trade Organization with a view toovercoming the obstacles and difficulties impeding itswork. Here  we must point an important differencebetween developing countries and developed countries in that the latter control the World Intellectual PropertyOrganization agreements and other conventions. Suchagreements should not be misused by multinationalcorporations in a manner that adds to the burdens of theleast developed countries in the fields ofpharmaceuticals  foodstuffs and technology transfer which would only exacerbate the obstacles to tradeliberalization that the World Trade Organization istrying to overcome. Although the WTO Council ofMinisters issued a separate statement on safeguards forpatented drugs  aimed at helping developing countriesto combat serious and contagious diseases  such a stepmay not sufficiently protect least developed countriesfrom being forced to bear excessive costs.The Sultanate of Oman has worked hard at theregional level with its brothers and friends and throughregional economic groupings  to enhance the climatefor the liberalization of trade and the economy. In theframework of the Gulf Cooperation Council  theSultanate participated in the establishment of the GulfCustoms Union at the beginning of this year. In theframework of the Arab League  we have also pushedforward the deadline for the establishment of a free-trade zone among the Arab States parties to the tradezone agreement to the beginning of January 2005 whenfull liberalization is expected to occur  opening thedoor to the free trade of Arab products and paving theway to an Arab common market.At the local level  my country has continued itsefforts to enhance the role of the private sector in thenational economy  based on the market economy andfree competition and a favourable economic and tradeclimate that aims at the achievement of a trueinvestment and trade partnership with all countries ofthe world  in the hope that conditions will be conduciveto linking the economy of Oman to the world economy.Recognizing that the protection of theenvironment and its resources is a collectiveresponsibility  my country’s Government has beenactive in stimulating the role of Omani society and itseffective contribution to this cause. Here  we toreaffirm our commitment to the basic principlesadopted at the two earth summits  in Rio de Janeiro  in1992  and in South Africa  in 2002. We believe thatthese principles constitute a scientific framework thatwill guarantee our world partnership and help us toshoulder our collective responsibility for the protectionof the environment and its natural resources in theservice of sustainable development.9We would like to express our gratitude andappreciation for the efforts and endeavours of theSecretary-General as reflected in his annual report  inwhich he details the achievements of the UnitedNations  as well as and the obstacles it faces  and setsout the strategies for the future for this Organization which embodies the conscience and aspirations of theworld. We support the proposals in the Secretary-General’s report on developing and restructuring theorgans of the United Nations to enable theOrganization to reflect current political reality.The United Nations should remain a truecornerstone of world policy and the main source ofinternational legitimacy  so that countries may appealto it for the prevention of wars and conflict. This isonly possible through the effective pursuit ofpreventive diplomacy  the peaceful settlement ofdisputes and the maintenance of peace  enhancingworld cooperation and dialogue among civilizations.This involves working towards resolving the problemsof poverty and disease  protecting the environment combating terrorism and bridging the gap between therich countries of the North and the poor countries ofthe South.Relations between the United Nations andregional organizations in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security should be strengthenedthrough the enhancement of weak regional structures toenable them to archive collective security in a worldgoverned by technology and great population increases.We believe that the United Nations representsinternational legitimacy. It is the crucible in which allregional and international efforts meld to realize thehopes and aspirations of our peoples and to confrontthe real challenges to peace  security and developmentin all their aspects. This can enhance relations andstability and spread a culture of peace and constructivedialogue among present and future generations tocounter the logic of the threat of force or apprehensionsabout the future.We hope that this session will be a success so thatit may chart a vision for the future that points to waysto serve humanity and renew the Member States’ trustin the Organization  total commitment to theimplementation of its resolutions and respect for theprovisions of the Charter."
"132",5450,"PAK",58,2003,"﻿It is with great pleasurethat I extend to you  Mr. President  our warmestfelicitations on your election. I also congratulate yourpredecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan  for hiseffective leadership during the previous session of theGeneral Assembly.We support Secretary-General Kofi Annan’sefforts to infuse a new sense of mission into the UnitedNations and maintain the centrality of its role in thepromotion of global peace and security. We pay tributeto the memory of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and theother United Nations officials who sacrificed their livesin the service of peace.When the Berlin Wall collapsed  hopes revivedfor a new age of cooperation and peace  free fromideological confrontations. Sadly  those hopes weredashed — by ethnic cleansing in Bosnia  and then inKosovo; by the failure to end the occupation ofPalestine  leading to the revived intifada against Israelioccupation; by the brutal suppression of the Kashmiri’sdemand for self-determination and freedom fromIndian occupation; by the unending war in Afghanistanand the international neglect which created a climate inwhich extremism and terrorism could breed; and by theseries of international financial crises and the rise ofpoverty as a consequence of unequal economicglobalization.The terrible terrorist atrocity of 11 September2001 jolted the foundations of the international system.The response has weakened al Qaeda  but it has noteliminated its associates. Terrorists have struckrepeatedly around the world — in Indonesia  Tunisia Morocco  Saudi Arabia  Russia  Kenya and my country Pakistan.18The tragedy of 11 September 2001 transformedsecurity policies and changed geopolitical calculations.Pakistan took a strategic decision  based on ourprinciples of humanity and national interest  to supportthe war on terrorism. There should be no doubtwhatsoever about intentions. Our actions speak louderthan words. Our capabilities were limited  but theyhave been progressively improved. We are actingagainst al Qaeda and its associates very effectively. Wehave also acted against other organizations or groupsinvolved in any form of terrorism. Pakistan will remainat the forefront of the war on terrorism.The war against terrorism must be foughtcomprehensively  on a global front  with vision andunderstanding. It should not erode the moral values ofour societies. It must not be hijacked by those whoseek to use it as an excuse to suppress other peoples.It must not be allowed to engender a clash ofcivilizations — a clash between Islam and the West.It is unfortunate that great religions — whichshould be a source of hope  tolerance and peace — areseen as being pitted against each other. Many Muslimsbelieve their eternal faith is being demonized. They seeMuslim peoples being cruelly suppressed fordemanding freedom and equality  or targeted fordiscrimination and worse. On the other hand  the Westperceives the Islamic world as volatile and hostile  bentupon striking at Western values. Muslims are oftenseen as fanatics  extremists and terrorists.Against the background of this volatile milieu the recent war in Iraq evoked negative reactions inmost Arab and Islamic countries.This moment in history calls for reflection introspection and action. The thesis of a clash ofcivilizations is a travesty. We must bridge the gulf ofmisunderstanding between Islam and the West. Wemust be the catalysts of change  not the prophets ofdoom.Islam is a faith of peace  harmony and justice.Islam is democracy in action. It upholds human rights social equality  non-discrimination and freedom ofspeech. The protection of minorities is an article offaith in Islam. It does not discriminate on the basis ofcolour  caste  creed or religion. Our faith is dynamic promoting constant renewal and adaptation  throughthe process of ijtihad — interpretation throughconsultation. Islam’s vision is not trapped in any oneperiod of history; it is modern and futuristic. Islammust not be confused with the narrow vision of a fewextremists.I believe the way forward is to adopt a two-pronged — or double-pincer — strategy to buildharmony  promote moderation  oppose extremism andensure justice. I call this the strategy of enlightenedmoderation.On the one hand  Muslim nations must assumetheir responsibility for internal reform and renewal.They are at the crossroads. They must eschewextremism and confrontation. They must embrace themarch of human civilization. They must address thedeficits in their social and economic development.They must seek science and technology  highereducation and human resource development.The international community — especially theadvanced countries of the West — must deliver theother pincer in this strategy of enlightened moderation.They can do so by helping to resolve political disputesand situations in which Muslim peoples are beingsuppressed  such as in Palestine and Kashmir; byrejecting attempts to equate terrorism with Islam; andby assisting the Muslim world in poverty alleviationand in socio-economic development. The UnitedNations itself has a crucial role to play in theconception and execution of the strategy of enlightenedmoderation.In that context  it is clear that a consensus mustbe quickly developed at the United Nations on ways torestore Iraq’s stability  security and sovereignty. Iraqcannot be allowed to remain an open wound. Thatwould have an impact on the region and could inject anew dimension into the campaign against terrorism andextremism. The consensus that is developed mustenable the Iraqi people  through an inclusive politicalprocess  to determine the sequence of steps leading to afully representative Iraqi Government and to an end tooccupation. The Iraqi people should assume control oftheir resources and of their political destiny as soon aspossible. They must receive the full support of theinternational community  including Iraq’s neighboursand the Arab and the Islamic countries  in buildingsecurity and in reconstructing their country. Pakistanwould be prepared to help in a collective United-Nations-sanctioned Arab and Islamic effort to help theIraqi people  if they themselves wish us to do so.Endeavours to stabilize Iraq will be enhanced byprogress in promoting peace with justice in the Middle19East. Hopes for a just and comprehensive peace werearoused earlier this year by the Quartet’s road map;those hopes have been progressively dimmed. Butfailure is not an option at all. The fate of thePalestinian people is the principal factor in determiningpublic and political perceptions in the entire Islamicworld. It is only progress towards a just peace that canmarginalize the extremists. Therefore  we must revivefaithful implementation of the road map and mustrealize the vision of two States  Palestine and Israel living side by side in peace within recognizedboundaries.We must ensure successful implementation of theBonn process in Afghanistan. The internationalstabilization force should be expanded and enlarged toensure security and control over all parts ofAfghanistan by President Karzai’s Government.Pakistan will continue to contribute to interdicting andarresting al Qaeda and associated terrorists. We willfurther intensify our economic cooperation withAfghanistan. It is essential that Afghanistan’s territorynot be used by third countries for interference or forterrorism against Afghanistan’s neighbours.Jammu and Kashmir has been rightly described asthe most dangerous dispute in the world. A justsolution of that dispute holds the key to peace andsecurity in South Asia. I am glad that India has steppedback from its dangerous and failed experiment incoercive diplomacy last year. Despite someimprovement in the political atmosphere  Indiacontinues to suppress the legitimate struggle of theKashmiri people to exercise their right of self-determination  in accordance with Security Councilresolutions. It refuses Pakistan’s offers of dialogue toaddress and resolve the Kashmir dispute once and forall.India cites cross-border terrorism in order toreject dialogue. It knows full well that the Kashmiristruggle is indigenous. India seeks to exploit theinternational anti-terrorist sentiment after 11 Septemberto delegitimize the Kashmiri freedom struggle. On thecontrary  it is India which violates international law byrefusing to implement Security Council resolutions andby perpetrating gross and consistent violations ofhuman rights in Kashmir.Once again  from this rostrum  I invite India tojoin Pakistan in a sustained dialogue to resolve theKashmir dispute. I am convinced that  with goodwill we can find a just solution which is acceptable to India to Pakistan and  above all  to the people of Kashmir. Ialso invite India  jointly with Pakistan  to observe acomplete ceasefire along the Line of Control inKashmir.Pakistan would also be prepared to encourage ageneral cessation of violence within Kashmir involvingreciprocal obligations and restraints on Indian forcesand on the Kashmir freedom movement. And  may Iadd  if India is genuinely concerned about infiltrationacross the Line of Control  we ask that it agree to aviable mechanism to monitor such infiltration on bothsides of the Line. The United Nations MilitaryObserver Group in India and Pakistan could beenlarged for that very purpose.Apart from addressing Kashmir  sustainablesecurity in South Asia requires India and Pakistan toinstitute measures to ensure mutual nuclear restraintand a conventional-arms balance. Unfortunately  Indiahas embarked on a massive build-up of its conventionaland non-conventional military capabilities — advancedoffensive aircraft  ballistic and cruise missiles  anti-ballistic-missile systems  nuclear submarines and anaircraft carrier. That will destabilize South Asia anderode strategic deterrence. Those Powers which desirepeace  stability and security in South Asia  and opposethe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  mustreview their decisions to offer such major strategic-weapons systems to India. They must contribute tomaintaining arms restraint and a military balance inSouth Asia.The crises and conflicts of the past decade haveenhanced  not diminished  the relevance of the UnitedNations. The United Nations remains the central forumfor dialogue and diplomacy  and it must bestrengthened. The Security Council must be made morerepresentative by increasing the number of non-permanent members. New permanent members willonly expand inequality. States which occupy andsuppress other peoples  and defy the resolutions of theCouncil  have absolutely no credentials to aspire topermanent Security Council membership.We are on the cusp of a new millennium. It is adecisive moment in history. We must decide whether toflow with the currents that threaten confrontation andthe collapse of civilizations  or to muster the collectivewill to chart the course of history towards a peacefuland cooperative global society. The leaders assembled20here bear an enormous responsibility to rescue ourworld from war and violence  poverty and pestilence;to redress inequity and impoverishment  which breeddespair and destruction; and finally  to collectivelyconstruct a new global architecture of peace andprosperity for all peoples and all nations."
"133",5493,"PAN",58,2003,"﻿Onbehalf of the President of the Republic of Panama Mireya Elisa Moscoso Rodr'guez  and on my ownbehalf  I extend my warmest congratulations to Mr.Hunte on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at this session. The delegation of Panama isdeeply gratified that he has been appointed to guide ourdebates  because he represents here the commitment ofdeveloping countries  and in particular those of theGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States  tomultilateral efforts to achieve peace  respect for humanrights  and sustainable development.Stability and security  in their broadest sense  arethings to which all humanity aspires. We will neverachieve these objectives  however  if  in attempting toshape this new world  we counter the aspirations of ourpeoples or attempt to base it on the systematicdevelopment of grand military alliances. Humansecurity  which is sought by all States  large and small depends exclusively on our dedication to the collectivesecurity architecture that we have concentrated in theUnited Nations. Our duty  then  is to defend andstrengthen at all costs our Organization’s objectivesand purposes  in particular the integrity and authorityof our international legal system.The world has been through an extraordinaryexperience this year  one that was hotly debated and thefallout from which is still far from clear. It is not toomuch to say that the trepidations over the events in Iraqthat were felt here in the United Nations and beyondhave had a number of repercussions both on theinternal work of this Organization and on the conductof international relations.Nevertheless  Panama is convinced that thedifferences that were aired in the Security Council area clear demonstration that it has functioned as itshould; that the diversity of opinions and approachesthat exist in the world were aired there withoutreservations; and that  although differences remained atthe end of the process  it had the marginal benefit ofhighlighting the measurement and control requirementsthat must be taken into account in the Security Council.Apart from these differences  the SecurityCouncil acted appropriately in establishing a pragmaticrelationship with the occupying Powers in Iraq bymeans of resolution 1483 (2003) of May 22. Inaddition  our Organization is demonstrating that it hasan irreplaceable role to play in the humanitarian field just as it has in the political  diplomatic  economic andfinancial spheres.The shocking slaughter that took place inBaghdad on 19 August and the killings of 22September — painful acts of terrorism that took thelives of many national and international civil servantsof the United Nations  including Special RepresentativeSergio Vieira de Mello — must move us to considerand adopt urgent measures to ensure that theinternational community takes concerted action as soonas possible towards the reconstruction of Iraq. To alltheir colleagues and to the great United Nations family we express the most sincere condolences of MireyaMoscoso  President of Panama  her Government andthe people of Panama.During the Millennium Summit  Panama askedMember States  among other things  to return to theoriginal spirit of the United Nations Charter. Consistentwith that request  we hope that all of us will accept theobligation to reconcile ourselves with the generalinterests of the international community and to avoidacting solely in light of our particular strategic military or political interests.We repeat that request today  and call attention tothe urgent need for strengthening the multilateralsystem as the guarantee of stability and security  whichare fundamental for peaceful coexistence. Today perhaps more than ever before  we must tackle the taskof reforming our Organization so that the GeneralAssembly can fulfil its proper function as the principalpolitical body  and the Security Council can have agreater capacity to deal with the new challenges thatthe end of the cold war has brought with it.To achieve this objective  Panama stresses thecontents of the Declaration on the Strengthening of theUnited Nations and Security Council Reform  adoptedat the Eleventh Summit of Heads of State andGovernment of the Rio Group  which met at Asunci n Paraguay  in August 1997  calling upon Member Statesof the United Nations to correct the present imbalancesin the composition of the Security Council  improve itsdecision-making mechanisms  and bring greatertransparency to the conduct of its work.21We firmly believe that an extremely importantelement in this and other tasks facing us is theannouncement by the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan that he will establish a high-level panel comprisingeminent personalities from all regions of the world.Panama and the world congratulate him on havingproposed this initiative.We also wish to have the General Assemblybecome the forum in which to seek a solution to theproblem between the People’s Republic of China andTaiwan. As Panama has noted on previous occasions Taiwan has  in a sense  been left hanging in time andspace  protected and yet unprotected. Recently  inresponse to the need to combat the severe acuterespiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic  the WorldHealth Organization was able to provide direct andeffective assistance to Taiwan without violating orweakening the fundamental elements of the positionsof the parties to that controversy. We believe that theUnited Nations system could act in several ways tohelp the People’s Republic of China and Taiwanresolve their dispute in a peaceful way  while we fulfilour most cherished objective of responding  withoutexception  to the social needs of humanity.Last July we held here the first Biennial Meetingof States to Consider the Implementation of the 2001Programme of Action on Small Arms and LightWeapons in All Its Aspects. We are still quite far fromachieving our objectives  both nationally andinternationally  but we believe that that biennialmeeting injected new vigour into the efforts that wemust all make to keep our commitments.We repeat our position  put forward at thatmeeting  that the purposes and code of conduct putbefore Member States in the first two articles of theCharter must be crucial for securing peace andunderstanding among the nations of the world.We would also stress that the massive clandestinetrafficking in small arms and light weapons  whichfuels internal conflicts  dictatorships  guerrillamovements and international terrorism  can only beblocked through close international cooperation. Withequal determination  we must pursue the networks oftraffickers in narcotics and diamonds  which use bogusfirms and banks  thrive by corrupting public officialsand are constantly working to destroy our societies.In a follow-up to the Monterrey Summit  we inthe countries of the South renew our call for creating amore just and efficient financial system  for eliminatingthe inequities of globalization and financing fordevelopment  and for raising the depressed prices ofour raw materials and other export products. As wehave stated on previous occasions  there is also anurgent need to agree on the proper mechanisms forforestalling financial crises and finding a solution tounsustainable external debt burdens  in accordancewith resolution 57/240.We now approach the High-level Dialogue onFinancing for Development  which will be held in thiscity on 29 and 30 October 2003. We must seize thisopportunity to reinvigorate this part of our activity  andto review the progress achieved in ensuring effectiveSecretariat support  pursuant to resolution 57/273.At the second meeting of the Ad Hoc Committeeto consider proposals for a comprehensive and integralinternational convention to promote and protect therights and dignity of persons with disabilities  it wasdecided to create a working group to prepare andsubmit a draft text for negotiation among MemberStates and accredited observers.Panama’s position is represented in theDeclaration of Quito of 11 April 2003  which  in brief called for promoting and protecting the rights anddignity of the 600 million persons living withdisabilities around the world  the great majority ofwhom suffer constantly from poverty and lack ofunderstanding. The international convention that weseek  as noted in the Declaration  must reflect “theuniversality  indivisibility and interdependence of allhuman rights and the principle of non-discrimination.”These concepts are thoroughly established in theUnited Nations Charter  the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights  international human rights agreementsand other related instruments.It is timely to refer here to the persistent andgrowing worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic. LatinAmerican and Caribbean countries  too  are confrontedwith a serious situation in this area. The Pan AmericanHealth Organization met in Washington on 11 June toaddress this issue  and noted that the demographic andsocial impact of HIV/AIDS in our region threatens toundermine the ability to carry out developmentprojects.We therefore call on the United Nations system tomake available to Latin America and the Caribbeanadequate resources to prevent this scourge. As is well22known  our region today has some 2.5 million peoplesuffering from this terrible disease.It is clear that the moral and technical presence ofthe United Nations is essential in efforts to eradicatepolitical  racial and religious intolerance  and insupport of negotiations for pacification  reunification self-determination and reconstruction  in order toensure that the peoples concerned can enjoy thebenefits of development.Having said this  I urge our Organization to findexpeditious ways of helping those who are committedto the so-called road map for resolving the conflictbetween Palestine and Israel to secure the activecooperation of the countries of the region and of theGovernments of Israel and the Palestine NationalAuthority  so as to overcome the current scepticismover any imminent possibility of seeing the twopeoples living in peace  within secure boundaries  astwo sovereign States.Ensuring that that urgent task is carried outsuccessfully will require the ongoing participation ofall of the neighbouring States. They must demonstratea joint willingness to become guarantors of the stabilityand security of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples andguardians of strict adherence to the Charter of theUnited Nations and to Security Council resolutions.I would like to conclude by referring briefly tothe International Criminal Court. With the election ofits Judges and Prosecutor  the Court has become areality. We recognize the concern that has beenaroused  particularly among the States parties to theRome Statute  by the fact that the Security Council  inits resolution 1487 (2003)  renewed for one year theprovisions of resolution 1422 (2002) with regard toimmunity in cases relating to peacekeeping operations as well as by the fact that bilateral immunityagreements have been negotiated separately by severalcountries on the basis of article 98 of the Statute.Panama  a firm supporter of the InternationalCriminal Court  believes that these pragmaticagreements are a response to a temporary situation  andthat they cannot and must not detract from the purposesand objectives of the Rome Statute. As States parties we cannot shrink from the obligations imposed by ourdomestic jurisdictions in matters relating to warcrimes  and we are therefore convinced that thepolitical concerns and suspicions of today willdisappear as it becomes apparent that persons whocommit monstrous crimes against humanity can neverbe shielded by any State or protected by dreams ofimpunity. Any State that holds to a differentinterpretation on this point will be swimming againstthe tide of human progress and international law."
"134",5540,"PER",58,2003,"﻿Peru has no doubt that multilateralism is the bestinstrument for confronting global challenges  as well asfor guaranteeing peace and international security. Forthat reason  the United Nations is indispensable. AllMember States must have the conviction to strengthenit  to contribute to its institutional regeneration and toreform it. With a reformed United Nations  we willcontinue our struggle against poverty; we will maintainthe world development agenda; we will assuredemocracy; and we will fight decisively against drugtrafficking and international terrorism.The terrorist attacks taking place in differentareas of the world and the threats to peace in severalregions create an international climate of instabilityand insecurity that calls for urgent solutions. Terrorismconspires against the democracies of the world.Terrorism conspires against the health of the worldeconomy. Terrorism contributes to making the pooreven poorer. Peru strongly condemns the terroristattack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdadand wishes to pay sincere tribute to all the victims  inparticular to Sergio Vieira de Mello  SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General.We cannot accept terrorism as a political tool. Inour case  the 20 years of violence bequeathed by theSendero Luminoso is a hard lesson to cope with.According to the final report of the Truth andReconciliation Commission  recently submitted to myGovernment  thousands of lives were lost and morethan $30 billion in losses were reported. This report is13the result of a resolute political decision of ourGovernment to make sure that Peru never again has toface irrational acts of terror.Truth must also be a means to prevent impunityand to lead us to reconciliation with justice. MyGovernment is firmly struggling against impunity. Thatis why we consider that the fugitives who fled Peruwhen the corrupt regime of the past decade wasoverthrown should answer to justice for the gravity ofthe crimes they committed. We will insure these peoplea fair trial and all the guarantees of due process  withinthe framework of the Inter-American Convention onHuman Rights and Peruvian law.That is why we hope that our requests forextradition will be taken into account. DemocraticStates have the responsibility to avoid impunity. In thisregard  the Peruvian State wishes in this Assembly tothank the 20 friendly countries that have announcedtheir decision to detain anyone on the list ofextraditables if they enter their territories.Poverty  social exclusion and fundamentalistideologies are among the causes of the current crises.The hopes of our countries to be part of an inclusiveglobalization are not bearing fruit. Despite someachievements at the national level  there is a widechasm to bridge if we are to build such an inclusiveglobalization. For example  in the case of Peru  despitean unfavourable international environment theeconomy grew by 5.2 per cent last year  one of thehighest rates in Latin America. Inflation was below 1per cent  international reserves rose to their highestlevel yet  and exports reached unprecedented figures.However  we must concede that all theseindicators are not enough to make the common peoplefeel the benefits of such macroeconomic achievementsin their own pockets. Today  it is necessary for theglobal economy to reach an annual average growth of 7to 8 per cent if we wish to reduce poverty and to createemployment. If we in the developing world particularly in Latin America  grow by 6 or 7 per cent it will barely be enough to recover the per capitaincome of 1970. We have to achieve adequate growthas soon as possible. The poor cannot wait another 15years for their economies to grow in a sustainedmanner that will reduce poverty.Democratic governance in Latin America is atrisk. There is no doubt that there is a correlationbetween the health of the world economy  socialinclusion and democratic governance. World leaderscannot close their eyes. There is no possiblegovernance without a reduction of poverty. We must becreative and courageous in order to ensure that WallStreet's macroeconomic requirements meet theexpectations of Main Street.Last year before this Assembly  I highlighted theneed to defend democracy from market turbulence bycreating innovative financial mechanisms. We said thatthe time had come to build a new global consensus toreaffirm democracy and re-evaluate development withsocial equity. Since then  Peru has been working on aseries of initiatives in this regard. Last May  19democracies of Latin America and the Caribbean members of the Rio Group   over which I have thehonour to preside   approved a key document that wecall the Cusco Consensus. This document comprisesfour Peruvian initiatives on innovative financialmechanisms that allow us to finance democraticgovernance in the region; to increase public investmentin roads  hospitals and schools; to create jobs; and tosupplement private investment.In relation to one of these proposals  last August jointly with the President of Brazil  Luiz In·cio Lula daSilva  we decided to work together on theestablishment of the South American InfrastructureAuthority project  which will operate as a fiduciaryagency to facilitate the financing of investment projectsfor the integration of South America. I am sure thatthat experience can be duplicated in other parts of theworld.Likewise  we have signed a memorandum ofunderstanding on physical and economic integration toset into motion three axes of developmentintegration   in Peru  Bolivia  Brazil and Ecuador  on the road to South America's integration.Accordingly  Peru signed an agreement that will lead tothe creation of a free trade zone with MERCOSUR.From this international forum  we would like reiteratethat those efforts and achievements in the area ofintegration constitute decisive steps on the pathtowards building a South American community ofnations. However  I wish to point out that  beyond thedecisions that two or more countries of the subregionmay take  it will be essential for the internationalcommunity to commit itself to the initiatives emanatingfrom an exercise in collective reflection.14Developing nations are concerned about thealarming increase in external vulnerabilities resultingfrom instability in financial flows and their impact oninvestment levels and economic growth in our region.Those countries also perceive the presence ofprotectionism in the area of trade  in particular on thepart of certain industrialized nations. I would like to befrank in this connection: we ask developed countriesnot to demand that we open our markets while theyprotect their products with billions of dollars insubsidies every year  especially in the agriculturalsector. Our countries can no longer withstandasymmetrical relations in the area of trade. The timehas come to build a two-way business highway that ismore transparent and predictable. We are being askedto open up our markets in the agricultural sector whilethere are still countries that are investing billions ofdollars every day to subsidize their own products. Donot ask us to practice something that you do notpractice yourselves. Our countries are aware of the factthat we have to be competitive  but we must build thattwo-way commercial highway.Peru is especially concerned about the negativeresults of the recently held ministerial conference ofthe World Trade Organization in Cancun  which despite some progress  was unable to reach consensus.There is a continuing desire for multilateralism andfree trade in Peru. We therefore trust that there will bea return to negotiation in the next few months so as torealize the goals set out at Doha  which placeddevelopment foursquare on the agenda of the WTO.We have an obligation to build a more just  secureand humane world. That is why today I ask the UnitedNations and our great friend of peace  Secretary-General Kofi Annan  to exercise their great authorityand prestige to promote within the World Bank  theInternational Monetary Fund  the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank and the member countries of theGroup of 8 a wide debate on the innovative financialmechanisms that will make it possible to financedemocratic governance in the region; increase publicinvestment in schools  hospitals and roads; generatejobs and promote private investment. That is the onlyway by which globalization can be inclusive  and bywhich governance can be strengthened. May God blesspeace in the world."
"135",5587,"PHL",58,2003,"﻿On behalf of thePhilippine delegation I would like to extend warmestcongratulations to the President and the members of theBureau on his election to the leadership of the fifty-eighthsession of the United Nations General Assembly.The past twelve months have been a mostdifficult and challenging period for the United Nations.A community of cynicism has formed regarding theability of the United Nations to rise above the morassof disunity and disruptive competition among majorPowers to fulfil its catalytic role in promotinginternational peace and security and development.But  while it is undeniable that the UnitedNations has struggled over the past twelve months  itspredicted decline is greatly exaggerated. Economiclinkages among nations have widened and deepened inmany sectors. The interconnectedness of the globalvillage continues to infringe upon traditional politicalboundaries. For instance  the tentacles of internationalterrorism have spread insidiously all over.These and current developments have displayed thatwithout the centripetal pull provided by internationalcooperation and partnership through the United Nations the world would tend to drift apart. The rich wouldbecome richer and the poor poorer. Conflict anddisharmony would erupt along political  ethnic andeven religious fissures. We face the paradox of a worldcontracting through advancing technology and  at thesame time  drifting apart along the seams of inequality.Three years ago  146 heads of State andGovernment and 189 Member States blazed the trail tothe future by crafting the Millennium Declaration. Inthe three years since the millennium started  in thethree years since the Millennium Summit  much hasbeen done  though much remains to be accomplished toachieve the goals that the United Nations set for thetwenty-first century.I am pleased to report that the vision of theMillennium Summit and pursuit of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals in my country have begun to bearfruit  as they have been applied in our peace processfor the southern Philippines  in Mindanao.The Philippine Government and the Moro IslamicLiberation Front (MILF)  the Muslim separatist groupin the southern Philippines  realize that the prescriptionof the United Nations is the only correct and viableone: that peace is an indispensable condition for9economic development  just as development is anessential component of peace. Nothing will do more tolift the Philippines out of poverty than peace itself.That is why we are negotiating peace with the MILF.The Government of Malaysia has been a prime moverin helping us negotiate peace  and I thank them.To complement these efforts  the Philippines haslaunched its bid for observer status in the Organizationof the Islamic Conference (OIC). I will be attending theOIC conference next month in Malaysia and hope touse that time to advance the peace process in Mindanaoand advance understanding among all faiths.I wish to take this opportunity to thank the UnitedNations community for its support for the Philippinesas a non-permanent member of the Security Council forthe term 2004-2005  and to ask for your continuedsupport during the elections to the Council.We wish to contribute our long experience in theUnited Nations system  as an original foundingMember of the Organization. We have activelyparticipated in the Council's initiatives towards thepreservation of global peace and security throughoutthe past six decades  both as a past non-permanentmember and as a contributor to United Nationspeacekeeping operations and other Council activities.The Philippines has actively contributed militaryand police personnel to United Nations peacekeepingoperations in Africa  Asia  the Americas  the MiddleEast and Europe over the past half-century. We are nowpreparing to contribute a contingent to join the latestUnited Nations operation  the deployment to Liberianext month.Our guiding principles for our Council participationinclude the following. The principle of collectivesecurity established under the Charter should beobserved. The Security Council should maintain andpursue a multilateral approach towards the performanceof its primary role of maintaining international peaceand security. Observance of the rule of law is ofparamount importance in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security.I believe that there is a strong role for the UnitedNations to play in Iraq and welcome and encourageUnited Nations involvement to share the burden withother nations  like the Philippines  that are alreadyparticipating in the reconstruction of Iraq.It is heartening that we adopted an importantresolution on conflict prevention at the last session ofthe General Assembly. As long as conflicts occur  thereis a need to strengthen our capacities for peacekeeping peacemaking  and peace-building.International security  which in recent experienceis mostly threatened by imploding and failed States must be animated by the need to protect individualsand communities from violence. It has also been amplydemonstrated that democracy is the condition mostconducive to a flourishing rule of law.Erecting mechanisms and infrastructure for therule of law should be included as a key part of any exitstrategy of United Nations peace operations. It is ourview that the Security Council should provide theleadership in moving the United Nations to a strongercommitment to the rule of law in areas where theUnited Nations is conducting peace operations.Meanwhile  the challenges posed by the globalthreat of terrorism are being effectively addressedthrough growing international coordination andcooperation  particularly in the exchange ofinformation  best practices and lessons learned.We are actively assisting the work of the SecurityCouncil's Counter-Terrorism Committee in fighting thespectre of global terrorism  and we are in the process ofratifying the important international conventions onterrorism. At the same time  I am working with otherheads of State to ensure continued cooperation in ourbattle to rid South-East Asia of the threat of terrorism.What is required of us today is to link up oncemore with the vision that our leaders charted at theMillennium Summit and other recent internationalconferences  and we should do this under the banner ofthe United Nations.The United Nations was created 58 years ago toserve as the multilateral forum of the internationalcommunity to join hands in confronting challenges. Itis sobering to remember that no country  big or small rich or poor  can feel safe or think that it can remainunaffected by violent conflicts  environmentaldegradation and human suffering. The United Nationsmust continue to adapt to changing conditions to fulfilits envisioned role  and we support the call of theSecretary-General for reforms in the structure of theUnited Nations.10The United Nations is a sui generis globalinstitution that can play a catalytic role to confront allthese challenges now and in the future. Therefore  itbehoves every Member of this Organization to makethe United Nations increasingly relevant and to invigorateit to become a modern  nimble and determined agent forchange  which benefits mankind's condition.We should instil the concept of strength andgreatness  not in terms of the ability to achieve ormaintain dominance over others  but in terms of theability of nations to work with others in the interest ofthe international community as a whole.We favour the strength of consensus in which thefuture of world peace  security and prosperity lie."
"136",5606,"PLW",58,2003,"﻿I bring to theAssembly greetings and good wishes from thePresident of the Republic of Palau  Tommy E.Remengesau  Jr.  and from the people and theGovernment of the Republic of Palau.Nearly 60 years ago  in his final inauguraladdress  United States President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt reflected on the lessons of the first half ofthe twentieth century. He said:“We have learned that we cannot live alone at peace; that our own well-being is dependent onthe well-being of other nations far away. ... Wehave learned to be citizens of the world  membersof the human community.”Those words have more resonance today than everbefore as Palau and the rest of the world enter into thetwenty-first century. The Republic of Palau is enjoyingrapid development  which came with its independenceon 1 October nine years ago. However  at a time ofrapid globalization  when events halfway around theworld — and most recently in our own backyard — canprofoundly affect our safety and prosperity  Palaurealizes that it must join the international community inthis new challenge to protect our people at home andour way of life.To that end  the Republic of Palau reaffirms itsunwavering support for the war led by the UnitedStates against terrorism. We all benefit when nations12come together to deter aggression and terrorism  toresolve conflicts  to prevent the spread of diseases andthe spread of dangerous weapons  to promotedemocracy and human rights  to open markets and tocreate economic and financial stability  to raise livingstandards and to protect the environment — to facethose myriad challenges that no nation can meet alone.Globalization  however  also brings about risks.Outlaw States and ethnic conflicts threaten regionalstability and progress in many important areas of theworld. Weapons of mass destruction  terrorism  drugtrafficking and other international crimes are globalconcerns that transcend national borders. Otherproblems originating overseas — such as the depletionof resources  rapid population growth  environmentaldamage  new infectious diseases such as severe acuterespiratory syndrome (SARS)  pervasive corruptionand uncontrolled refugee migration — haveincreasingly significant implications for every nation’ssecurity. National economies will suffer if the globaleconomy is unstable or if markets collapse  and thehighest environmental standards — such as those setout in the Kyoto Protocol — will not protect small struggling island countries like Palau if other countriesdo not join the global effort to bring about peace andstability.Protection of the environment is a major concernto us. Decisions made today regarding the environmentand natural resources can affect every nation’s securityfor generations. Environmental threats do not respectnational borders  but they can pose long-term dangersfor every nation’s security and well-being. Scarcity anddepletion of natural resources can trigger andexacerbate conflict. Environmental threats — such asclimate change  the depletion of stratospheric ozone the introduction of nuisance plant and animal species the overharvesting of fish and of other living naturalresources  and the transnational movement ofhazardous chemicals and waste — directly threaten thehealth and economic well-being of every people of theworld. For Palau  the immediate danger is the rise insea level.Another issue that we wish to address is that ofthe cloning of human beings. We believe that anyglobal and comprehensive ban on human cloning mustinclude a ban on the cloning of human embryos forresearch purposes. While the goal of finding cures tochronic illnesses is laudable  progress and economicgain achieved by creating and destroying human lifecome at too high a price. We believe that adult-stem-cell research is a promising field of study that canprovide an ethical source of stem cells for scientificinvestigation. The international community must notallow human life to be devalued in any way  and weencourage all States to adopt such measures as may benecessary to prohibit techniques of genetic engineeringthat may have adverse consequences on respect forhuman dignity.In public health  we note that many peoplesaround the world are suffering and dying each dayfrom the scourges of HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis  malaria cancer  polio and similar diseases. Combinedinternational support for public health beyond theclinic walls must be advocated and put into practice ifwe are to eliminate some of those challenges to qualityhuman life.Such international support and collaborativeefforts were recently manifested during the spread ofsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). I also urgeall members of this body to support and ratify theFramework Convention on Tobacco Control adopted bythe World Health Assembly this year. Moreimportantly  we should combine our efforts toimplement the mission of the Convention to controltobacco use  which contributes to diseases and deaththroughout the world.The United Nations is to truly represent allpeoples  with discrimination and exclusion eliminatedfrom its operational practice. To be effective atensuring international peace and security  all nations large and small  must be represented in the UnitedNations. The Republic of China on Taiwan can nolonger be kept on the sidelines of the most importantinternational Organization and the leading forum forinternational dialogue. Over the past half-century  thehard-working people of Taiwan have transformed theircountry into the world’ s seventeenth largest economyand a vibrant democracy. In 1996  Taiwan had its firstdirect presidential election and  in 2000  accomplishedits first peaceful transfer of executive powers. Sincethen Taiwan’s popularly-elected Government has actedin accordance with United Nations resolutions tocombat international terrorism and to supporthumanitarian relief in countries throughout the world and yet it is still excluded from the process. Ourexperience with SARS has shown us that exclusion canbring no benefits to anyone. The 23 million Taiwanesepeople have an equal right to a voice in the United13Nations and should be welcomed by all members ofthis body.The central purpose of the United Nations is thepreservation and advancement of world peace. Itaccomplishes its peacemaking and humanitarianassistance efforts through international cooperation. Its191 Member States  large and small  rich and poor  andwith different political views  strive collectively toaddress global challenges and advance world peace.Together  they consider and decide on the world’s mostpressing problems. Thus  in this regard I ask the worldhere today  at the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly  to study and discuss the roots of terrorismand possible solutions  including inter-religiousintervention; to promote conservation standards toprotect our Earth’s environment; to promote worldpublic health; to protect the human dignity by banningthe cloning of human embryos; and to continue ourquest for peace and security for all peoples of theworld."
"137",5647,"PNG",58,2003,"﻿Letme from the outset congratulate the President of thisfifty-eighth General Assembly on his election. I haveno doubt that his election by the internationalcommunity is a recognition of his vast diplomatic skillsand leadership qualities. His election is alsorecognition of the coming of age of small island States.I also wish to thank his predecessor Mr. Jan Kavan forhis stewardship of the work of the fifty-seventhGeneral Assembly.16Please allow me also to pay tribute to the UnitedNations Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan and hisstaff for their dedication and commitment in dealingwith many pressing international issues that confrontus today.I join others delegations in expressing ourGovernment’s sincere condolences to the families ofthe United Nations staff  including the late SergioVieira de Mello  the former United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights  who lost their livesin Baghdad on 16 August 2003.The attacks were barbaric and against theprinciples of freedom  democracy and peace asenshrined in the United Nations Charter. They must becondemned in the strongest possible terms.In pursuit of our commitments to combatinternational terrorism  I am happy to report that PapuaNew Guinea has substantially complied with UnitedNations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).Our Parliament recently ratified many of theconventions and protocols to combat global terrorism.Yesterday  I personally deposited four conventions withthe Office of the United Nations Secretary-General.Having fulfilled these requirements  Papua NewGuinea is now faced with resource constraints andother challenges to implementing the treatyobligations. This situation is further exacerbated byother threats  such as illicit drug trafficking proliferation of small arms and light weapons smuggling of humans and money-laundering.In the Pacific Islands region  we have takenpositive initiatives to collectively deal with thesethreats. The Nasonini and Biketawa Declarationsagreed to by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders providethe framework for cooperation in dealing with thesethreats.In the wider Asia/Pacific Region  the SouthwestPacific Dialogue has met twice  in addition to theannual Bali security meetings  to discuss political andsecurity issues facing the region. The Dialogue partnersinclude Indonesia  the Philippines  New Zealand Australia  Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea.Whilst issues of greater political and securityrisks are of concern to us  the real threat at this stage isthe proliferation of small arms and light weapons.Small arms and light weapons have not onlydestabilized regions  sparked  fuelled and prolongedconflicts but also obstructed relief programmes undermined peace initiatives  exacerbated human rightsabuses  hampered development and fostered a cultureof violence. There are no international treaties or otherlegal instruments for dealing effectively with thiscategory of weapons.In this context  Papua New Guinea welcomes thecall for the immediate and full implementation of the2001 Plan of Action on small arms aimed at curbingand eradicating the flow of small arms and lightweapons.Let me place this in the context of the crisis inour province of Bougainville where the proliferation ofsmall arms and light weapons contributed to theprolonging of the conflict in the province.With regard to progress in Bougainville  we havecompleted the second stage of the arms disposalprogramme  which has been verified by the UnitedNations. The regional Peace Monitoring Group (PMG)has now been wound down and replaced by theBougainville Transition Team (BTT). With the help ofthe United Nations the Team will maintain logisticalsupport for the peace process and assist in otheroperational areas.I would also like to inform this Assembly that thepeace process under the Bougainville Agreement hasreached the crucial third stage under the constitutionalamendments agreed to by the Papua New GuineaNational Parliament. While there are delays  everynecessary step is being taken by all parties concernedto ensure that the momentum built to date is not beingunduly hampered.My Government therefore seeks theunderstanding of the international community especially the members of the Security Council  to helpus fully achieve all tasks agreed to under theBougainville Peace Agreement. This will signal a win-win story for all  the United Nations  our Governmentand the people of Bougainville.I express our Government’s profoundappreciation to the Secretary-General for the invaluableefforts of the United Nations Political Office inBougainville (UNPOB)  including those ofAmbassador Noel Sinclair.I also acknowledge and thank our regionalneighbours — Australia  New Zealand  Fiji  Solomon17Islands  Tonga and Vanuatu  for their immensecontribution to the peace process.With regard to the conflict in the SolomonIslands  the package of assistance developed andagreed to by the Pacific Islands foreign ministers andlater adopted at the Pacific Islands Forum leadersmeeting in Auckland  New Zealand  last month hashelped restore peace and normalcy in that country. Itwas undertaken at the request of the Government of theSolomon Islands under the Biketawa Declaration.The Australian-led operation includes thedeployment of both civilian police and armedpeacekeepers from many of the Pacific island memberStates  including my own. The cooperation amongmember States underlines the strength of regionalpeacekeeping  if done properly.On the Israeli and Palestinian issue  we wereencouraged by the general positive signs of progresstowards resolving and securing peace based on theUnited States-led road map. However  this hasdeteriorated in recent weeks. We call upon all partiesinvolved to exercise maximum restraint and worktowards the peaceful settlement of this crisis.We are pleased that the Quartet has recentlyconvened in New York to review the road map. Welook forward to their strong leadership in assisting toresolve this long outstanding issue. Fighting andviolence will not resolve the conflict. We join theinternational community’s call for both the Israeli andPalestinian leadership to make renewed efforts at thenegotiating table  to cease all hostilities by both sidesand to find a permanent solution to the problem.Our belief is that diplomacy is the only means bywhich States may join as partners and co-operate inbringing about changes which promote peace economic and social progress for all people  both inprinciple and  more importantly  in practice.We believe that this too should apply to thesituation in Iraq. We support the work being done inthe Security Council to adopt a new resolution on arole of the United Nations that would provide aframework for the widest possible participation ofUnited Nations Member States in the reconstruction ofIraq.Regarding United Nations reforms  Papua NewGuinea commends the leadership demonstrated by theSecretary-General in the current work being done toreform the main organs of the United Nations  theGeneral Assembly and its subsidiary bodies and theSecurity Council.We support the expansion of the Security Councilin both permanent and non-permanent membershipcategories. Reforms should take into account theinterests of both developed and developing countries.All permanent members in an expanded Councilshould have similar rights and privileges. However  theuse of the veto power should be curtailed and appliedonly to Chapter VII issues. In doing so  we must moveswiftly to complete the reforms of the United Nationssystem — including the Security Council — so we canrestore the capacity of the multilateral system to betterserve us all.Papua New Guinea fully endorses the recentDeclarations and Plans of Action of the Doha Monterrey and Johannesburg Conferences. We areresolved to meet the challenges of poverty eradication;hunger; illiteracy; environmental degradation; climatechange; and HIV/AIDS  malaria and other preventablediseases. We are also committed to addressing issues ofgood governance. It is the desire of the Government ofPapua New Guinea to incorporate the MillenniumDevelopment Goals into our national developmentpriorities. We are in the process of adopting themedium-term development strategy  which is aimed atredirecting development to the rural areas where themajority of our people live. We encourage theinternational community — including all stakeholdersin developed and developing countries — to continueto make resources available to fully implement thoseDeclarations and Plans of Action.Like other developing member States of thePacific Islands Forum  Papua New Guinea is firmlycommitted to the Barbados Programme of Action forthe Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States. We fully support its 10-year reviewprocess  which will take place at the internationalmeeting to be held in Mauritius in August 2004. Wecall upon our regional and international developmentpartners to support the review process  as was the casewith the recent conferences of the least developed andlandlocked developing countries.The recent breakdown in the World TradeOrganization negotiations in Cancún is of greatconcern to us all. However  that should not be a barrierto further negotiations to arrive at a fair and equitable18arrangement that provides for the interests of allnations.On a more targeted front  the African  Caribbeanand Pacific (ACP) group of countries — of whichPapua New Guinea is a member — are now negotiatingwith the European Union for a possible economicpartnership agreement. It is important that the mainobjective be the eradication of poverty  and thereforethat trade preferences enjoyed by ACP countries undersuccessive Lomé Conventions and under the currentCotonou Agreements not be eroded.The small island developing States of the Pacificregion are among the custodians of the largest oceanspace. The Pacific Ocean is rich in natural marineresources. The recent Pacific Islands Forum LeadersMeeting in Auckland  New Zealand  again reaffirmedthe Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy  which aimsto ensure the future sustainable use of our oceans andtheir resources by our island communities  in closecooperation with our development partners.The countries of the region  however  havelimited human  financial and technological capacitiesto control  manage and secure those resources for thebenefit of our current and future generations. Inprotecting our vast marine resources  the PacificIslands Forum leaders reiterate their serious concernsabout the shipment of radioactive materials through theregion. They also call upon States engaged in thoseactivities to accept full responsibility and liability forcompensation for any damage that may result  directlyor indirectly  from the transportation of radioactivematerial through the region. The two accidents thathappened in the Atlantic Ocean last year underline thereality of our concerns.Papua New Guinea  together with other smallisland developing States  continues to express deepconcerns about the adverse impact of climate change climate variability and sea-level rise  particularly onthe small  low-lying islands that are alreadyexperiencing extreme hardships. We will continue tostress the urgent need for developed countries to exertstrong leadership in the reduction of greenhouse gasemissions.Papua New Guinea has signed and ratified boththe United Nations Climate Change Convention and theKyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol paves the wayforward for developed countries to fulfil theirobligations under the Climate Change Convention. Webelieve that the larger developing countries also havean obligation to take concrete actions in reducing theirgas emissions. We welcome the support of Japan  theEuropean Community and China for the KyotoProtocol. We urge the United States  the RussianFederation and Australia to join the global effortsaimed at addressing that issue  including ratification ofthe Kyoto Protocol.Papua New Guinea is also not immune to theHIV/AIDS pandemic. Tuberculosis and malaria areagain on the rise  so there is an urgent need to findpreventive measures for those diseases. I am  however pleased to report that the Papua New GuineaParliament this year enacted legislation aimed atdealing with the scourge by assisting with preventionand awareness programmes to reduce and limit thespread of HIV/AIDS  which threatens the lives of ourpeople  particularly mothers and children. In thatregard  we thank Australia for its substantial assistance.We also acknowledge continuing support from otherdevelopment partners  including the United NationsChildren’s Fund (UNICEF)  the Joint United NationsProgramme on HIV/AIDS and the World HealthOrganization.We also support the work of the United Nationsin relation to the protection and advancement of therights of women and children. While we have ratifiedthe appropriate conventions  we realize that we must domore. We acknowledge the support being provided byour development partners  including United Nationsagencies such as the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme and UNICEF.Papua New Guinea fully concurs with the calls bythe international community to reform and restructurethe charters and mandates of the two Bretton Woodsinstitutions. Their lending policies should be mademore lenient and flexible with regard to assistingdeveloping countries in their developmental efforts.Among the greatest achievements of the UnitedNations is the process of decolonization. But thatprocess will not be completed — as it must be — untilthe remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories haveexercised their inalienable right to self-determination.The United Nations should continue to monitordevelopments in New Caledonia  Tokelau and the other14 Non-Self-Governing Territories on the UnitedNations decolonization list on a case-by-case basis.Neither size  remoteness nor population density should19be allowed to limit the exercise of this inalienableright. The Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting heldin Auckland last month once again reaffirmed itssupport for that principle.In conclusion  I want to reaffirm Papua NewGuinea’s firm commitment to the timeless principlesenshrined in the United Nations Charter. We alsostrongly advocate that it is Papua New Guinea’sposition that diplomacy  through positive dialogue  isthe key to addressing these challenges.Finally  Papua New Guinea believes that a greaterchallenge for all United Nations Member States is towork together as genuine partners. That will serve asan effective tool for implementing our collective goal:to create a better and more secure world  both todayand for future generations."
"138",5693,"POL",58,2003,"﻿At the outset  likemy colleague from Armenia  I would like to expressmy highest tribute to the memory of the outstandingindividuals whose tragic loss is a blow to the internationalcommunity that is absolutely beyond repair.The assassination of Anna Lindh  the ForeignMinister of Sweden  has demonstrated once again therisk involved in noble dedication to public service in aworld exposed to senseless acts of violence and hasfilled people all over the world with the deepest sorrow.The death of Sergio Vieira de Mello and his staffmembers came as a shock to the international community.The question is  why were they killed? That horrible actof terror seems to be highly symbolic because  in thewords of the Secretary-General  it directly challengesthe vision of global solidarity and collective securityrooted in the Charter of the United Nations. Sadly  thatis the context in which we must address the concernson our domestic and international agendas.Last year  when addressing the Assembly  I putforward a proposal to prepare a new act for the UnitedNations at the dawn of the twenty-first century. I waspersuaded then  as I am now  that such a documentcould give fresh impetus to the principles andmechanisms of the United Nations in a changing world.It should entail the elaboration of a new catalogue ofnorms of international conduct in the face of thesecurity threats and global challenges of today.Developments on the international scene since Iput forward that initiative have strengthened my beliefthat the United Nations would only benefit from a new strong political signal reconfirming its role as a beaconof stability and a reliable instrument for managingchange.I believe that the best way to create the properconditions for an unconstrained debate on the future ofthe United Nations is to engage outstanding publicfigures of international stature in an informal setting. Isuggested at the time that a group of eminentpersonalities be charged with the task of producing anoutline of the document  which would then be submittedfor assessment by Member States. The composition of thegroup should ensure its independence  appropriateintellectual format and knowledge of internationalaffairs. In addition  such a group's excellent moralstanding and political weight would guarantee that thedocument designed to serve as an inspiration toMember States would be of the highest value. Thus  anessentially intellectual exercise initiated outside theinstitutional framework of the United Nations could betransformed into a political process  culminating in theadoption of the new act by the General Assembly.I remain deeply convinced that despite the rapidchanges in the international environment precipitatedespecially after 11 September 2001  the United Nationstoday   almost 60 years after its foundation   shouldretain a central role as a mechanism for resolving globalproblems and as a guarantor of international legitimacy.33 It is a great source of satisfaction for me that thePolish initiative corresponds to the thinking of theSecretary-General and his efforts to increase theeffectiveness of the United Nations and safeguard theposition of the Organization as the most importantinstitution of international security and cooperation. Iwholeheartedly support his views on the need forreview  and possibly a radical reform  of theinternational security architecture  as reflected in hislatest report on the implementation of the UnitedNations Millennium Declaration (A/58/323)  as well ashis timely proposals voiced at the outset of our debate.Indeed  we can no longer safely assume that ourcurrent multilateral rules and institutions have thecapacity to confront the current array of old and newthreats to peace and security.Since I presented my proposal last September  wehave consulted extensively with governmentalrepresentatives from a number of countries. A richcollection of suggestions and comments has beencompiled that will be invaluable in developing theinitiative. In the consultation process  we wereencouraged by the shared view of many countries as tothe need to adapt the United Nations to currentchallenges.Taking into account the initial outcome of theconsultations  the Government of the Republic ofPoland has produced a memorandum in which we havesketched a proposed outline of the mandate of theGroup of Sages.The initiative  as reflected in the memorandum  isin effect an invitation to a conceptual and holisticreflection on the nature of changes in the internationalsystem and on the most desirable vision of a new  moreeffective international order. It deals with the questionsposed by a whole spectrum of present-day challenges including security risks related to globalization and theemergence of non-State actors  the development gap andinternational solidarity  governance and subsidiarity.The novel character of today's challenges callsfor new ways of thinking and an innovative approach.It is true that protracted regional conflicts remain avery serious source of instability. Yet  along with thosetraditional threats  today's security environment hasbeen increasingly dominated by a combination of newthreats of a more diverse and unpredictable nature.They originate mostly within State borders rather thanamong States  notably in failing and failed States thatare unable to control their own territories  and they areoften posed by non-State actors.To use the Secretary-General's terminology today's threats are both hard' and soft'  and theytend to reinforce one another. We are confronted withterrorism that has a global reach  motivated byextremist ideology and unconstrained in its readiness toinflict massive casualties. We are facing a growing riskof proliferation of deadly weapons and the spread oforganized crime that often accompanies State failure.These hard' challenges are compounded by chronicunderdevelopment in many parts of the world.Soft' threats  such as widespread poverty deprivation  hunger  malnutrition and rampantinfectious diseases  take their tragic toll on peoplesliving in countries with poor economic growth. Theseare usually found in regions where development isoften thwarted by bad governance and violent internalconflicts that result in large-scale humanitarian crises massive abuses of human rights  political and socialdisruption and  ultimately  the collapse of State systems.In the face of the new realities confronting theinternational community  we need to forge a consensuson the conceptual and political framework for theoperation of the United Nations in upcoming decades.In this context  let me stress that my initiative is notintended to revise or change the United NationsCharter  which should remain the basis of internationalrelations. Instead  the New Political Act should placethe Charter in the context of the ongoing transformationstaking place in the international environment. It shouldprovide a new conceptual framework for  and politicalinterpretation of  the Charter  adapting the UnitedNations to present-day realities and regulating theOrganization's activities in those areas that are notcovered by the Charter. It should accomplish that goalby redefining the objectives of the United Nations identifying new tasks and specifying operationalmodalities for the Organization.The Millennium Declaration was a clearmanifestation of the ability of the Organization to takeup new tasks and confront the most pressingchallenges. We must make every effort to increase thecapacity of the United Nations to achieve the goals setout in that landmark document  and I believe that theNew Act could add a political impetus to thecontinuous work under way to fully implement theDeclaration. Yet our experience in the post-cold-war34 era made clear not just problems related to the capacityof the United Nations  but also the lack of clarity andconsensus on certain principles essential for effectiveaction in the new security environment.A source of serious concern is the fact that thelack of an agreed and common interpretation of manyterms and principles which are fundamental in theinternational domain could lead to chaos ininternational relations. The New Act for the UnitedNations   while taking into account the currentchanges in the international order   should thereforereflect the relations between numerous principles andthe international conditions dominated by non-traditional threats. It should examine  for example questions related to issues such as respect for humanrights and the principle of State sovereignty  the rightof self-determination and territorial integrity  conflictsand crisis management  and the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. It should also addressthe possibility of inscribing newly emerged concepts such as human security and the responsibility of Statesto protect the vulnerable  into the conceptual basis ofthe international system.It is a painful reality that the United Nations isdeeply divided. This limits its effectiveness andoccasionally even calls into question its ability to act.The basic question is  therefore  how can we restore tothe United Nations the sense of unity and cohesionembodied in the very name of the Organization? Howcan we prevent paralysis in management by the UnitedNations of international security? And how can weadjust the operating principles of the Organization soas to enable those countries that are able and willing torespond adequately to new threats to act within theinstitutional framework of the United Nations?In my view  this difficult goal is unattainablewithout a reaffirmation of the United Nations as acommunity of shared values and shared goals. Such areaffirmation could reintegrate the Organization andinfuse it with a new sense of purpose. Hence  at thecore of my initiative there is a need for a profoundreflection on the values and principles that bind theinternational community together and define thebehaviour of States towards each other  towards otheractors on the international scene and towards theircitizens.Let me reiterate once again that Poland stronglysupports the Secretary-General's intention to establisha high-level panel of eminent personalities to examinethe role of collective action in countering currentsecurity challenges and to review the operation ofmajor United Nations organs  with a view torecommending necessary reforms. This idea is inperfect conformity with my initiative. I believe that theideas which we collected in the course of last year reflected both in the memorandum of the PolishGovernment and in the responses of leading expertsand scholars  could provide a good starting point andmake a useful contribution to the work of the panel.I wish to affirm the strong commitment of mycountry to ensure the successful outcome of theSecretary-General's initiative. I intend to convey theaforementioned collected comments of eminentintellectuals on the future of the United Nations to thePanel for its consideration.The war against the murderous regime of SaddamHussain has exposed  in a painful way  the challengesrelated to the principles and practice of multilateralaction and has revealed the unresolved dilemmas inthis domain  which   in my view   should beaddressed in the New Political Act for the UnitedNations. For the time being  though  the internationalcommunity must focus its attention on the situation onthe ground. I believe that the United Nations should bea key factor in post-war Iraq's transition to the rule oflaw  democracy and independence. The tremendoustask of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraqshould be shared by the entire international community.We must work out arrangements which will helpIraq assume  as soon as possible  its rightful  dignifiedplace among the nations of the world. For its part Poland remains committed to the stabilization effort inIraq. Our participation in that endeavour is guided bythe need to create the conditions for the Iraqi people todetermine freely their own future and to begin a newchapter in the history of that great nation  leading it todevelopment and prosperity.On Monday  29 September  the United NationsConvention against Transnational Organized Crimewill enter into force. I am proud that the idea putforward by Poland during the World MinisterialConference on Organized Transnational Crime  held atNaples in November 1994  was transformed   withthe broad support of the international community  into a binding United Nations Convention.35 "
"139",5719,"PRK",58,2003,"﻿I would like at the outset on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea  to congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia  on hiselection to the presidency of the General Assembly atits fifty-eighth session.I would also like to express appreciation for theefforts made by the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  to strengthen the functions and role of theUnited Nations  as required under currentcircumstances.The political situation today is more unstable thanever. We are confronted by new challenges as we try tomake this century one of peace and prosperity forhumankind. Countries have been designated  on thebasis of extreme national chauvinism and hostility  aspart of an axis of evil and as targets of pre-emptivenuclear attacks. Unilateral military attacks are beingopenly perpetrated against sovereign States under thepretext of the war against terrorism and on the basis ofsuspicions that they possess weapons of massdestruction.The principles of respect for sovereignty andsovereign equality are being violated  and internationalrelations plunged into increasingly severeconfrontation and antagonism  because of neo-imperialist practices that are based on the supremacy ofpower.26As we are well aware  this situation is a productof unilateralism  which is compelling countries to besubservient to the high-handedness and unreasonabledemands of the super-Power. My delegation is of theview that the pressing common task before StatesMembers of the United Nations is to rejectunilateralism and build a new world in which allcountries  large and small  coexist peacefully.I would like to draw the attention of theAssembly to the principled position and sincere effortsof the Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea to ensure a fair solution to thenuclear issue between the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea and the United States  which is nowthe focus of attention of the international community. Ibelieve that it will be a positive contribution to thework of the current General Assembly.The nuclear issue is  in its essence  an outcome ofthe hostile policy pursued by the United States toisolate and stifle the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea politically  economically and militarily. Itoriginated from this deep-rooted hostility  which deniesour system and refuses to co-exist with my country.My country’s consistent position is to resolve thenuclear issue peacefully through dialogue andnegotiations. Denuclearizing the Korean peninsula isthe ultimate goal  the initiative of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea and the earnest aspirationof the entire Korean nation.Accordingly  at both tripartite and six-party talkson the nuclear issue  my country advanced proposalsaimed at achieving the denuclearization of the Koreanpeninsula. The announcement of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea — United States JointStatement of 11 June 1993  the adoption of theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea — UnitedStates Agreed Framework on 21 October 1994 and thesubsequent process of their implementation haveclearly testified to our peace-loving stand and itsjustness.The Korean people as well as the entire worldwelcomed the historic inter-Korean summit meeting inJune 2000 and its resultant adoption of the June 15North-South Joint Declaration. They also sincerelyhoped that these developments would lead to peace andstability in the region.However  the welcome atmosphere and theexpectations for peace and stability  raised for a while suddenly disappeared  and one party has resumed acuteconfrontation. My country has been singled out as partof an axis of evil and the target of pre-emptive nuclearattack. That was then adopted as a policy and put intoaction. In particular  following the visit by the UnitedStates presidential envoy to the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea in October 2002  the United Statesreversed black and white  alleging that my country hadadmitted to have a secret nuclear weapons programme.It also proceeded to unilaterally halt the supply ofheavy fuel oil from November 2002 in violation of theAgreed Framework  and eventually it nullified all thebilateral agreements.The United States even put pressure upon mycountry to give up its nuclear programme and acceptnuclear inspection with the aim of disarming thecountry  while openly attempting to overthrow theGovernment by force. The peace now maintained onthe Korean peninsula is entirely thanks to the powerfuldeterrence to war  which has been built up by ourpolicy of independence  the songun policy. Ourdeterrence policy is not intended to attack anyone  butto serve as a means of self-defence to safeguard oursovereignty in all intents and purposes.In order to resolve the nuclear issue peacefullythrough dialogue  the hostile policy towards mycountry should be changed fundamentally. That is thekey to the solution of the nuclear issue. At the six-partytalks in Beijing in late August  my country set as a goalthe abandonment by the United States of its hostilepolicy towards us in exchange for renunciation of ournuclear programme. To achieve that goal  we proposedto take all necessary measures through a package dealand to work towards the implementation of thesemeasures on a step-by-step basis  following theprinciple of simultaneous action.Our proposal contains a detailed account of thepackage deal and the order of simultaneous action for acomprehensive and fair solution of the nuclear issue including abandonment of the hostile policy towardsthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  theconclusion of the non-aggression treaty between theDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the UnitedStates  renunciation of the nuclear programme andnormalization of bilateral relations.27Simultaneous action is a realistic way todenuclearize the Korean peninsula  and any oppositionto it is tantamount to rejecting denuclearization. OtherStates participating in the Beijing talks also demandeda package solution and simultaneous action  urging apeaceful settlement to the nuclear issue. However  theUnited States alone repeated its unilateral call for mycountry’s abandonment of nuclear weapons programmefirst  with no reference to the change of its hostilepolicy which is the key to the solution of the nuclearissue. The United States even behaved imprudently asserting that a non-aggression treaty is neitherappropriate nor necessary and that it is not interested insuch a treaty.The United States went so far as to insist that ifbilateral relations are to be normalized even after mycountry scraps its nuclear programme  a full range ofother issues such as missiles  conventional weaponsand human rights should be addressed. In a word  theposition of the United States is that it will discuss thesteps that it will take only after we have taken everyaction. Under the present circumstances  in which mycountry and the United States are levelling guns at eachother  asking the other party to put down their gunsfirst does not make any sense. This demand can only beconstrued as having the ulterior motive of disarmingand eliminating my country.The result of the six-party talks has convinced usonce again that the United States is seeking to disarmus by means of pressure and that it is still pursuing thehostile policy of stifling our country. Since it has beenproven that the United States is only interested inturning the six-party talks into a ground for completelydisarming and eliminating my country by all means instead of co-existing peacefully with us  we have beencompelled not to maintain any interest in orexpectations for such talks.As clearly stated  we have never made anypromises with regard to the next round of the six-partytalks. All developments concerning the nuclear issueprove well that pressure can never be a means forsettlement of the nuclear issue and multiparty talks canbe fruitful only when there is commitment to theabandonment of the hostile policy towards my country.Our demand is modest and simple. We just want bothsides to drop their guns simultaneously and co-existpeacefully.Having reaffirmed the position of myGovernment  which I believe is the most reasonableand just in addressing the nuclear issue  I hope that thePresident and the United Nations Member States have acorrect understanding of our position and activelycooperate for a fair solution of the nuclear issue and forpeace on the Korean peninsula and in the region as awhole.The Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea remains steadfast in its policy anddetermination to realize peace and the reunification ofKorea and thus contribute to peace and security in theregion and in the rest of the world. Thanks to the ideasof national independence and great national unity ofthe great leader General Kim Jong Il  the inter-Koreansummit meeting was held in Pyongyang for the firsttime since the national division and the North-SouthJoint Declaration was made public on 15 June 2000.That marked a turning point in accelerating nationalreunification through the concerted efforts of the entireKorean nation. Despite ups and downs in recent years there are active efforts to realize independent andpeaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula underthe banner of the June 15 North-South JointDeclaration.This year alone  a series of North-Southministerial-level talks were held and a groundbreakingceremony to re-link interrupted railways and roads tookplace. Reunions of separated families and relativestook place  and various economic exchanges are nowunder way.On 15 August  independence day  a splendidnational meeting for peace and reunification was heldin Pyongyang that demonstrated once again theaspirations and determination of all Korean nationals inthe North  the South and overseas for reunification.The Government and people of the DemocraticPeople’s Republic of Korea will achieve nationalreconciliation  unity and reunification and contribute tosecurity in the region and the rest of the world by fullyimplementing the 15 June North-South JointDeclaration  upholding the great idea of the respectedGeneral Secretary Kim Jong Il.An important task before Member States atpresent is to establish a just and equitable internationalorder and relations  in keeping with the aspirations anddesire of all humankind.28To that end  it is important  among others things to ensure that the principle of respect for sovereigntyand equality is fully observed in international relations.Unilateralism and high-handedness should be totallyrejected and opposed  as they contravene the Charterand principles of international law.In order to establish just international relations the functions and the role of the United Nations mustbe enhanced and democratized. Democratizing theUnited Nations means decisively enhancing theauthority of the General Assembly and reforming theSecurity Council.The General Assembly should be empowered toreview resolutions of the Security Council on suchissues as sanctions and the use of force directlyaffecting international peace and security and to submitits relevant recommendations.Regarding Security Council reform  we believethat priority should be given to ensuring fullrepresentation of the non-aligned and other developingcountries that constitute an overwhelming majority ofthe United Nations membership.Our people graciously celebrated the fifty-fifthanniversary of the founding of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea on 9 September  thus demonstratingthe dignity and the might of the Kim Il Sung nation firmly united single-heartedly around the great leaderGeneral Secretary Kim Jong Il.The Government of the Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea will continue  on the basis ofindependence  peace and friendship — the fundamentalideals of its foreign policy — to contribute actively tointernational efforts for a just  equitable and new worldorder by further intensifying cooperation with allMember States."
"140",5764,"PRT",58,2003,"﻿In September of each year the Member States of theUnited Nations politically rediscover the Organizationof which they are shareholders and beneficiaries.The practice of business as usual should not markthis session of the General Assembly. The Secretary-General suggested that the heads of State andGovernment come to New York to make theircontribution towards the strengthening of the UnitedNations. Portugal  as a committed member of thisOrganization  wishes to take part in this debate with aclear objective: to recognise  as does Kofi Annan  thatthe United Nations is an indispensable tool  and also torecognise that we must re-examine our practices andour working tools. Inactivity is not an option that thisOrganization should contemplate.Rethinking the United Nations means  first of all reaffirming and rethinking its Charter. Maintainingpeace and international security will continue to be ourmain objective. But the reaffirmation of our faith infundamental rights  in the dignity and worth of humanbeings  in equality between men and women and inequality between nations  is also part of our vision forthe United Nations  as is the determination to promote together  social progress and better living conditionsfor our peoples.These objectives must not be overlooked whenthe Organization faces crises of confidence from timeto time. The Secretary-General is correct in hisencouragement to us to persevere. But a positivemental attitude is not enough. It is also essential thatwe do not ask more of the Organization than it canprovide at any given moment. Otherwise  greatexpectations will lead to great disappointments.Realism and pragmatism are necessary  but wemust not lose sight of the ambitious objectives that thisOrganization is intended to serve. It is time for us tolook at the United Nations as a reflection of what weare collectively  and not as a convenient scapegoat tomask the incapacity that the Member States sometimesstill reveal when we should  but are unable  to acttogether.24We are also bound to understand  sooner or later that we are facing common threats that requirecommon responses. At the forefront of these threats isterrorism. In fact  a new type of terrorism has emerged:the terrorism of mass destruction that constitutes acrime against humanity; the terrorism that kills blindlyand indiscriminately in New York  in Bali  inCasablanca and in Nairobi  in the name of non-valuespresented as values on ideological and religiousgrounds; and the terrorism that did not spare the UnitedNations itself  as we so tragically witnessed inBaghdad.The crime which claimed the lives of SergioVieira de Mello and his collaborators was an attack onall of the values which the United Nations represents. Itwas an attack against us all. If there were still lingeringdoubts or illusions when some thought that terrorismwas aimed essentially at some States  they disappearedin Baghdad.It was not the Iraqi people who murdered SergioVieira de Mello and United Nations personnel.Terrorists are responsible for that crime. It is not theIraqi people who are opposed to the United Nationspresence in their country. Again  it is the terrorists. TheUnited Nations must not bow to terrorism.Portugal believes that the United Nations shouldhave a central role in the definition of a global strategyfor fighting terrorism  largely because maintaininginternational peace and security depends on theoutcome of this fight. It is a fight we must undertakewithout losing our souls  that is to say  the values onwhich this Organization is built. It is for this reasonthat more security is necessary  but also moredemocracy  more dialogue between cultures andcivilizations  more development  more and betterenvironmental protection measures and a drasticreduction in poverty.It is also vital that this fight be undertaken in thename of  and with respect for  our law — internationallaw. The concept of the rule of law should have realglobal resonance. This is why we defend theimprovement of the laws in force  namely through thenegotiation of a global convention on internationalterrorism. But we must also bear in mind thatinternational law will be irrelevant without theimposition of its norms  by force if necessary.New challenges and new threats requireinnovative responses from the United Nations. It seemsblatantly obvious that the composition and decision-making process of the Security Council are obsolete.But changes are also needed in this Assembly  whicheach year automatically re-adopts hundreds ofresolutions instead of adopting only those that arestrictly necessary. As for the Economic and SocialCouncil  the most that can be said is that the externalimpact of its actions is not perceptible  while theTrusteeship Council is nothing more than a relic devoidof any relevant objective.In his report on the implementation of theMillennium Declaration (A/58/323)  the Secretary-General focused on this point with particular insight.The proposals that he put forward should guide ourthinking and joint action. But there is a particularlyworrying aspect  on which we can  and indeed must act without delay.I am referring to the need for the establishment ofa real preventive culture by the United Nations inmatters of armed conflict. In this context  we agreewith the relevance that the Secretary-General attributesto preventive diplomacy  to disarmament and non-proliferation measures  to peace-building  to respect forhuman rights  to good governance and to thedevelopment agenda.In the final analysis  we must be fully aware thatthe usefulness of the United Nations will always bejudged as a function of its capacity to avoid and handleconflicts. In the implementation of that mission  thefundamental role lies with the Security Council  whichhas  over the years  authorized various peacekeepingoperations. The overall result has been positive.Portugal has contributed significantly to thoseoperations and remains available to continue tocollaborate with the United Nations.But conditions on the ground are not alwaysclear-cut  and it is not always possible to separate whatis and what is not a conflict  and what would justify ornot an intervention by the Security Council. There is animmense grey area that can be perilous in pre-conflictand post-conflict situations.We must also create the tools for dealing withcountries and situations that do not need support interms of security  namely through a peacekeepingoperation. The intervention of the United Nations at thecritical phase of a conflict  followed by a prematurewithdrawal  may well end in failure  which will25essentially lead to the waste of the investment made bythe international community up to that point.This assessment recommends  for example  thatthe United Nations continue to monitor closely thesituation in East Timor. It is a country whosedemocratic institutions are still in the consolidationphase. Without a tradition of self-government  it hasmade uncommonly rapid progress in several areas butis still in need of our help and attention. If we trulywant East Timor to be a real success story for theUnited Nations  it is important to give the people ofEast Timor time to consolidate their institutions.However  in other cases in which a peaceoperation is not yet justified and where Stateinstitutions are fragile  where there is an enormous lackof basic services and development has not taken off  itis advisable to have a strong United Nations presence coordinated on the ground by the Secretary-General.I would also like to take this opportunity tomention Guinea-Bissau  which is frequentlyoverlooked and which once again requires ourattention. Having avoided falling into a destructivespiral as has happened to so many countries in theregion  that country is still fighting to recover. It mustbe helped  not ignored. They are a people who can andshould be helped by the international community —and indeed deserve to be. For that reason  we supportthe efforts of the Secretary-General on behalf ofdemocracy and development and applaud the originalcontribution of the Economic and Social Council.Under the present conditions  the SecurityCouncil does not take into account all the factorsinvolved in prevention: security  nation building anddevelopment. Each one follows a more or lessindependent path.There is one other factor to add: the Council isfully absorbed with the management of the mostpressing matters on the international agenda and attimes demonstrates a notorious lack of attention tosome countries in pre- or post-conflict situations.We believe there is a solid case for advocating thecreation of a new institutional mechanism: a newcommission with the mandate to routinely monitorcases of conflict-prevention and the creation ofconditions for peace and development. In conjunctionwith the Security Council and the Economic and SocialCouncil  which would both preserve their respectiveareas of competence  this commission could identifyand deal with the most pressing needs. For each of thecountries in situations of risk  it would draw upintegrated strategies allying the objectives of securityand strengthening institutions and economic and socialdevelopment. While other decisions of great importanceare being prepared  we can — and should — begin hereto deal with pre- and post-conflict situations.It is not enough for the United Nations to affirmits relevance. It is absolutely indispensable that theOrganization is seen as relevant by the Member Statesand that States act accordingly. The credibility of theOrganization must not be questioned. Otherwise itsfunctioning and effectiveness may be severelycompromised.Iraq is undoubtedly the case that requires of usall  in particular the members of the Security Council that we carefully evaluate the Organization’s capacityfor action. A collective turn of the page is necessary since there is no valid alternative to a policy thatenables the Iraqi people to freely define their system ofGovernment and political leadership and that maintainsthe country’s political and territorial integrity. To builda democratic society on the ruins of one of the mostviolent dictatorships of the past century is a challengethe international community must not shrink. It is atask that demands much realism with respect to thedifficulties to be confronted.For that very reason  Portugal has always been infavour of the progressive involvement of the UnitedNations in Iraq’s stabilization process  with acorresponding gradual transfer of power to Iraqirepresentatives. We also encourage the SecurityCouncil to come to a rapid understanding on thismatter. For our part  we are already taking concretesteps  including in the security field  to support allthose that are already locally assisting the Iraqi peopleto live in freedom.A larger commitment by the internationalcommunity is indispensable for resuming the MiddleEast peace process. The road map cannot be shelved. Itis up to us to demand a proactive attitude from allinterested parties. Also  we should not be indifferent tothe Palestinian people’s legitimate desire for libertyand self-determination. Israel and Palestine will have tocoexist in peace and in security  within recognizedborders. But here again  terrorism  which only benefits26the enemies of peace  must be condemned withoutambiguity.Great challenges generate great opportunities. Itis up to us  the Members of the United Nations  tocreate the conditions that will allow this Organizationto function in accordance with its potential and theideas that were an integral part of its creation. Thoseideas remain valid  and Portugal stands ready to giveits contribution."
"141",5810,"PRY",58,2003,"﻿Two hundred years after the first cry of freedom inLatin America  our peoples are propelled by new windsof emancipation. A fresh generation of leaders hastaken up the old flags of our heroes to demand realglobal interdependence through an economic orderinspired by solidarity and by the building of a lastingpeace.I would like to take this opportunity tocongratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan for the commendable work that he has done to upholdand promote the principles that were enshrined in theCharter 58 years ago.For too long  Latin America had been on themargins of history. It had been reduced to playing thepart of providing inexpensive labour and raw materialsto more developed economies  while its most brilliantminds were lured away and absorbed by large urbanmarkets. Our region has also fallen victim tomercenaries  soldiers of fortune and heartless peoplerepresenting dehumanizing and destructive transnationalcorporations that overthrew Governments  provokedwars between friendly countries and squandered ourcountries’ resources.Nevertheless  we are not here to complain aboutthose ignominious days. Nor are we here to cling to theglories of the past. On the contrary  we have come toexpress our firm will to work together for a dignifiedpresent and a secure future for those who are nowdying from hunger  thirst  cold and easily preventableand treatable diseases. Our voices today arise from ourroots  cultures and traditions  and proclaim a LatinAmerica that is integrated into the world  with a freshsense of fraternity  to make the lives of our peoplesmore humane and enriching.We must seek a multipolar world in whichcultures enhance rather than confront one another andregional production promotes peace and prosperity inthe world to save present and future generations fromthe terrible scourge of new major conflicts. Let usmake a renewed commitment  without scepticism andwith the intrinsic dignity that God has bestowed onevery human being.In Paraguay  a small but dignified country  we aremaking a major effort at capacity-building with respectto national and international communities. A sine quanon is to revive production  attract investors back andsell our products on world markets.Although our peoples have suffered long years ofrecession and deprivation because of the foreign debtburden  my Government has managed to redirect publicresources towards education and to coordinate theefforts of civil society and the State to democratizeyoung people’s access to the world of knowledge. Onlyeffective human capital  with ethical principles  willenable us to survive and grow in a climate ofglobalization. Towards that end  we fervently hope fora globalization that involves not simply economics butalso justice  science  technology and development. Ourchallenge is to achieve global progress.I come from an island surrounded by land  asParaguay’s renowned writer Augusto Roa Bastos soaptly described the country. But with the advent ofdemocracy  to the credit of the people’s self-sacrifice our country has restored its identity  memories anddreams. We Paraguayans accept our geographicaldisadvantage as an opportunity to be creative andindustrious  as our development requires. For thisreason  we appeal for international solidarity to help toimplement the plan of action of Almaty  which isdesigned to overcome the limitations of landlockeddeveloping countries  including Paraguay.We have a strong ethical belief in this historicobjective. The inequality that impoverishes most of theworld is immoral. There is not a trace of Christianity inthe lack of solidarity with the destitute. In that regard the individual must be treated as a whole person  sothat he may in turn bring well-being to his family  forthe sake of all society. If leaders do not provide a moralexample  it will not be possible to advance towards ademocracy that is embraced by the people and fosterstrue participation in a society that is distinguished byits moral capital  the essential basis of a humanistic andhumanizing economy. A world in crisis requireshumanism  not humanitarianism. The world seekssolidarity  and not mere charity.We must understand that the impoverishment of alarge share of humankind jeopardizes world balance. Itis true that many countries have become impoverishednot simply as a result of outside influences but alsobecause of corruption and impunity on the part of localleaders. But it is equally true that without an ethicalbelief in the international order and the strong will of5leaders to praise God and renounce historical patternsof greed of rich countries  the world that we leave toour children will not be fit for living.Unfortunately  while we are shaping a futurebased on ideals and utopias in this hallowed chamberof world peace  we have not figured out how to endwar  since in various parts of the world the arms racecontinues  as does growing poverty. It bears repeatingthat  as leaders of our respective countries  we mustcease speaking in terms of friends and enemies  whichhas a weakening and destructive effect. We must usethat energy and those resources to ensure just socialdevelopment in economically less-developed countries.Without pluralistic and equitable participation incrucial international policy decisions discussed here inour Organization and a commitment to multilateralism the United Nations and  in particular  the SecurityCouncil  will inevitably fail in its noble objective ofmaintaining peace in the world.In this context  Paraguay supports the aspirationsof Latin America and other continents to berepresented in the Security Council  where the presenceof Brazil as a permanent member would fulfil the greatand legitimate interests of our region.Paraguay would like to reiterate here its fullsupport for the efforts and aspirations of the Republicof China on Taiwan to become a fully-fledged memberof the international community through the UnitedNations. In this regard  we appeal to the principles ofuniversality contained in the Charter so that this long-overdue and heartfelt desire of the sister Republic ofChina on Taiwan may be fulfilled.As I said some weeks ago in my own country —and as I reaffirm here — the ethics of fraternity andmutual respect must govern international relationstoday if humanity is to make progress towards lastingpeace inspired by the rule of law and reason.With the same vigour with which we advocateworldwide peace  we condemn terrorism in all itsmanifestations and sources. In Paraguay  we havepledged — a pledge we are resolutely fulfilling — tocombat the breeding grounds of terrorism and itsfinancial support  drug trafficking. We shall not deviatefrom that commitment. Likewise  we energeticallydenounce the terrorist action against the UnitedNations headquarters in Baghdad that occurredyesterday and that of 19 August. We mourn the deathof outstanding United Nations staff members  includingthe distinguished Brazilian and Latin American citizen Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights. In that same line ofaction  in Paraguay we are dismantling organized crimeand money-laundering  regardless of who promotes conceals or commits those crimes.I reiterate that our country will no longer be abridge  corridor or end point for such criminaloperations. With the same energy with which wecombat crime and illegality  we reaffirm ourunwavering commitment to respecting human rights which is an increasingly important part of our domesticand foreign policies  promoting full enjoyment ofpublic and individual freedoms for the peoples of theworld.The fight for freedom  democracy  social equityand world peace will be of no avail if we do not moreresponsibly face the challenges for the preservation ofour environment. Let us seek the well-being of ourpeoples today but not forget that our children will liveon this planet tomorrow. In Paraguay and LatinAmerica  we are determined to be the protagonists andarchitects of a shared destiny of responsibility  justiceand equality.Finally  may the new global order be morehuman  supportive  responsible and participative  andmay its essential purpose be to promote development progress and the well-being of all the peoples of theEarth in an environment that is truly more just  fair andbalanced. May God bless us and may we build togetherthe peace that our children and future generations need."

I also pay tribute to your predecessor Mr. Jan Kavan  President of the General Assembly atits fifty-seventh session  for having successfully led thedeliberations of that session.In addition  we should like to express ourappreciation for the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and for his commitment tothe Charter of the United Nations with a view toenhancing international peace and security.After the 1980s  Israel began unilaterally todelineate borders through the Seven Star SettlementPlan  initiated by Mr. Sharon when he was HousingMinister. The plan involves building Israeli settlementsalong the Green Line   the line of the old armistice  in order to obliterate the Line  which separates theterritories occupied in 1967. Israel has used agreementsas an opportunity to build more settlements  which nowtotal 187 in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.The holy city  Jerusalem  has been subjected to anextensive Judaization campaign with a view toimplementing the Greater Jerusalem plan to increasethe number of settlers within Palestinian areas. Underthat plan  land has been confiscated and a wall isolatingJerusalem from neighbouring areas is being built.Israeli settlers have occupied Palestinian homes inmany Palestinian neighbourhoods. In Jerusalem  Israelhas confiscated 70 kilometres of land in order to buildbypass roads in the West Bank under the pretext ofredeployment. Therefore  Israel has taken the first stepsin implementing a plan aimed at establishing cantons which  Mr. Sharon had planned long ago to isolatePalestinian cities and villages by building settlementsand bypass roads to prevent any geographic contiguityamong population centres in Palestinian areas.The building of the wall is part of the Israelipolicy of imposing a fait accompli  of exploitingsecurity conditions to attain certain objectives bycreating bantustans and enclaves and by isolatingPalestinian villages from their surroundings  includingseparating such villages from Jerusalem. Thus theseparation wall has isolated the cities of Eizariya andAbu Dis on all sides. All entry and exit into and out ofthese two cities is through Israeli military checkpoints.We condemn you  Israel  for such actions.An article in the 10 August 2003 edition ofHaaretz reads:The Palestinian children who will be thenext generation are being raised under extremelydifficult circumstances in comparison with thosewho preceded them. They see only the ugly faceof Israel; therefore  they will be consumed byblind hatred and a desperate desire for revenge.'Another article in the same newspaper this monthnotes:Israel lays the blame on Arafat  after itforced him to win the chairmanship of thePalestinian Authority by democratic means inaccordance with the Oslo Agreement  ignoringthe fact that it must  first and foremost  do its partto alleviate the tension by giving up the occupiedterritories.'The article continues:Can Israel ignore the regrettable fact thatthe European Union was among the majority thatsupported the General Assembly resolution?Israel's diplomatic defeat at the United Nations isthe inordinate price that Israel paid as a result of astupid decision by its Government   a decisionthat was no more than a declaration of itsintentions. Its hope to eliminate Mr. Arafat is astark embodiment of Israel's inclination to shirkresponsibility and then to blame fictitiousdevelopments on the Palestinian side for theproblem. Instead of taking the necessary action tocalm the situation  Israel uses the working plansof its adversary as a pretext and then  should itfall short of meeting its goals  complains thatthere is no party to negotiate with on the otherside.'30First of all  Israel must contribute its share tosettling the dispute   that is  it should make everypossible effort to defuse the tension. According toHaaretz  there is a Palestinian ceasefire proposal  butthe Israeli Government has refused thus far to respondpositively to the offer. It continues to repeat itshackneyed position that an agreement is not possiblewhile Arafat is in power and as long as the Authorityfails to dismantle the terrorist organizations. Israelimposes those conditions without making any changein the general conditions surrounding the conflict.Haaretz continues to say that the world has despairedand wrung its hands in frustration. The Israelis do notexpress condolences when our sons are killed; they donot denounce such killings  nor do they even establishany contacts.Before the road map was announced  thePalestinian Authority had been called upon toundertake certain reforms  such as drafting aconstitution  creating the post of premier andtransferring certain powers from the President of thePalestinian State and the Chairman of the PalestinianAuthority to the Prime Minister. Chairman Arafat mademany concessions to assist the Palestinian Governmentin carrying out its duties. The Government of Israelmade several attempts  under various pretexts  to delaythe declaration of the road map: first  it was holding theIsraeli elections at the beginning of the year; then itwas establishing the Cabinet; then it was waiting forthe Iraq war. Finally  when Israel hesitantly acceptedthe road map  it rejected 14 of its provisions.At the Sharm al-Shaikh Summit and at the AqabaSummit of 6 June  the representative of the PalestinianAuthority   who at that time was Prime MinisterMahmoud Abbas   committed himself toimplementing the road map  pledging to meet itsrequirements before President Bush of the UnitedStates  King Abdullah of Jordan  the King of Bahrain and President Mubarak of Egypt. He announced thePalestinian Authority's commitment to a ceasefire andits readiness to recognize Israel within secure borders.However  in his statement Mr. Sharon refused tomention Israel's commitment under the road map to thevision of two States   the establishment of anindependent Palestinian State that is viable andsovereign  living side by side with Israel in peace andsecurity  as expressed by President Bush. Mr. Sharondid not accept the immediate cessation of all acts ofviolence against the Palestinians. All that Mr. Sharonsaid were a few words regarding a Palestinian Statewithout any mention of an independent  viable andsovereign State of Palestine. Nor did he declare animmediate cessation of Israel's acts of violence.Despite that  the Palestinian Authority  togetherwith all other resistance factions  declared a ceasefireon 26 June. That ceasefire was to remain in place forthree months. Regrettably  Israel continued its terroristpractices  and the Israeli army of occupationassassinated 86 Palestinians. To sabotage the declaredceasefire  Israel assassinated the political leaders of theresistance factions. The situation then slipped intotension and confrontation  one month after theceasefire had been announced.International reports state that the majority ofPalestinians in the occupied territories now depend tosome extent on food rations. In May of this year  theWorld Bank reported that the volume of internationalcontributions to the Palestinian territories had grown:since the beginning of the Palestinian intifada  externalcontributions accounted for more than $1 billion of thebudget of the Palestinian Authority. They havetherefore provided sustenance to more than half amillion people   the families of the employees of thePalestinian Authority. Those contributions staved offan enormous  acute humanitarian crisis. Donors whohoped for reconciliation had no choice but to makecontributions because the Palestinian Authority'snetwork of services collapsed and the living conditionsof Palestinian citizens deteriorated. It is not strange then  that the Palestinians persevere throughinternational assistance.However  this generosity on the part of theinternational community ultimately profited the Israelienemy. International support provided a protectivenetwork through which Israel was able to afford anexpensive occupation of the West Bank. Israel controlsthe areas militarily for free  without assuming anyresponsibility for the lives of the citizens there.Fighting terrorism is an arduous task. However we do not see anyone keenly seeking the root causes ofor motivations for terrorism  nor even concerned aboutthe international isolation that Israel is sufferingbecause of its practice of State terrorism. It is as if thestifling Israeli economic crisis were a predestined divinely ordained phenomenon. In the search for theculprits  Arabs and the resistance are held to be thecause of the crisis.31There was a real chance for the United States toembrace all the peoples of the world  not only throughthe compassion of those peoples for the people of theUnited States but also through the unified effort tofight terrorism. The United Nations should have seizedthat opportunity through a programme objectively andreasonably implemented  not by using cannons orfighter jets or by mobilizing huge forces to destroy ahated regime. The real reason for that was well knownpolitical and economic ambitions. The world wasoutraged at the military action  but it stood idly by observing the consequences of the misuse of force.The United States Administration expressed itskeen interest in implementing the road map andestablishing an independent Palestinian State.Regrettably  it did not  as a sponsor of peace  addressthe crisis with the required effort and effectiveness. Itis not enough to stress the vision of President Bush orthe commitment of his Administration to such a vision while continuing to employ a policy of doublestandards. That Administration continues to blame andwarn the Palestinian Authority. It continues to urge theAuthority to combat the resistance  which they can seeonly as terrorism against the Israeli occupation  despitethe fact that all international norms stress the right ofoccupied and colonized people to self-determination bywhatever means. The United States Administrationoverlooks the Israeli leader's terroristic practices andIsrael's failure to implement its commitments inaccordance with the road map.The shortcomings of the United States role reflectnegatively on the peace process. They obstruct theprocess and make success very difficult  such as byrefusing to deal with President Arafat  the legitimate elected President of the Palestinians. Mr. Arafat is theonly leader who has shown conviction and flexibilitywith respect to the peace process. As a result of that Mr. Arafat shared the Nobel Peace Prize withMr. Yitzhak Rabin  who was assassinated by dirtyhands in Israel in order to prevent the continuation ofthe peace process  spreading anxiety and doubts amongPalestinian and Israeli citizens alike.The Arab side accepted the initiative of HisHighness Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz forthe establishment of comprehensive peace with Israelafter its total withdrawal from all the occupied Arabterritories. The Crown Prince carried that initiative toWashington  D.C.  in his historic meeting withPresident Bush in April 2002. The initiative was basedon the agreed terms of reference for the road map along with the resolutions of international legitimacy the Madrid terms of reference and the principle of landfor peace.In conclusion  peace in itself is not an objectivefor Israel. That will be true as long as Israel continuesto receive all forms of assistance from major Powerstrying to maintain their strategic interests in the MiddleEast region  and opts to settle issues militarily  outsidethe framework of the United Nations and theresolutions of the Security Council.Israel has laid siege to the Palestinian people. Ithas paralysed the apparatus of the PalestinianAuthority  preventing it from operating. The Israeliarmy assumed responsibility for security. But how didit do that? By killing  assassination and destruction.What is required first is the withdrawal of the Israeliforces from the occupied territories to the borders of 28September 2002.The Security Council should adopt the road mapand work to implement it through the Quartet. Thesiege against the Palestinian people and their electedPresident Yasser Arafat must be lifted. The UnitedStates must cooperate positively and effectively tofacilitate the task of the Quartet and to warn Israel ofthe consequences of obstructing its tasks. Deployinginternational forces into a buffer zone created betweenthe two sides will facilitate implementation of the roadmap and the Palestinian Authority's task of maintainingsecurity in the area from which the Israeli forces willwithdraw. Those forces will receive completecooperation from the citizens of Palestine."
"143",5875,"QAT",58,2003,"﻿Itgives me great pleasure to extend to you  Sir  oursincere congratulations on your election to thepresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. Allow me to wish you and the members ofthe Bureau every possible success. I should also like toexpress our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor Mr. Jan Kavan  President of the fifty-seventh session  forhis great efforts in conducting the work of the GeneralAssembly. It also gives me pleasure to recognizeSecretary-General Kofi Annan  who deserves our sincerethanks  respect and admiration for his tireless efforts.Today  the world is experiencing a difficult critical and highly complex phase in internationalrelations  marked by political and strategic changesaffecting the elements and objectives of those relations.This is the result of the emergence of a new complicated and multifaceted set of problems and acuteregional and international crises  whose root causes wemust deal with promptly and in a serious manner.Moreover  we must prevent such crises from worseningand spreading. We must therefore strive to strengthenthe role of the United Nations  enhance its institutionsand provide it with the essential resources so it canfulfil its mission throughout the world.First  it is imperative that we mobilize thepolitical will needed to enable the Organization toshoulder its responsibilities and carry out its duties.That is particularly important for the permanentmembers of the Security Council because thosecountries bear the primary responsibility for achievingthat goal  which will enable the Organization toperform its functions in a genuinely democratic spirit reflecting the new international conditions and theinterests and aspirations of all peoples of the worldwithout exclusion or preference.In that context  we underline the need to reachagreement on a new formula for the composition of theSecurity Council and to modernize its workingmethods  as it is the international body charged withthe primary responsibility for maintaining internationalpeace and security. The Council’s current composition working methods and decision-making process do notrespond to the needs of the international community orgive Member States an opportunity to speak on thevital and critical issues that affect us all.In the State of Qatar  we were shocked andsaddened by the horrific attack on the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad. That attack claimed the livesof many innocent victims: the United Nations staffmembers who were carrying out their humanitarianmission  foremost among them the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  Mr. SergioVieira de Mello  and many Iraqis. That heinous act ofterrorism illustrates in our view the nature of thechallenges and the seriousness of the threats besettingthe work of the United Nations and internationalhumanitarian organizations in Iraq and elsewhere. Wealso strongly condemn the terrorist act targeting theUnited Nations headquarters in Iraq earlier this week.The difficult and tragic circumstances nowprevailing in the brotherly country of Iraq compel us tocooperate in order to help the Iraqi people overcomethat situation and its consequences.I must underline once again the fundamentalprinciples underlying our position with respect to the Iraqicrisis and the means necessary to deal with it. We haveconsistently affirmed our commitment to the territorialintegrity  national unity and sovereignty of Iraq and tothe right of Iraqis to self-determination  to the restorationof their independence and sovereignty and to thereconstruction of their homeland  as well as to their rightto live in dignity and freedom in their own land.In that context  we look forward to the success ofthe international efforts to strengthen security andstability in Iraq. We call upon the coalition forces to10achieve that essential objective and to intensifycoordination with the competent international bodiesand institutions in order to pave the way for thecountry’s return to normalcy. We call upon thecoalition forces to allow the Iraqi people  of all factionsand political trends  to exercise their legitimate right tochoose their own political leadership through free democratic elections  giving expression to theiraspirations  hopes and wishes.In that regard  we also welcome the establishmentof the Interim Governing Council and the interim IraqiGovernment that emerged from it; they mark animportant positive step  and we hope that they willcontribute to achieving the desired transition towardsconsolidated democracy in the country and thereconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraqi Stateinstitutions. That should be accomplished by drafting anew constitution  holding free democratic elections putting an early end to the occupation through aspecific timetable and allowing Iraq to reclaim itsrightful position in the region and in the largerinternational community.We urge the United Nations to play an effective essential role in helping Iraq achieve those objectives.Moreover  the international community is urgently calledupon to help in Iraq’s reconstruction and to meet the Iraqipeople’s needs in various areas in order to build a newIraq of democracy  equality and respect for human rights.With regard to developing Iraq’s infrastructure ofhigher education  it is noteworthy that the consort ofHis Royal Highness the Emir of the State of Qatar  HerRoyal Highness Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Misnad Special Envoy for Basic and Higher Education + 5 of theUnited Nations Educational  Scientific and CulturalOrganization (UNESCO)  launched a lofty initiative ina statement before the World Conference on HigherEducation  held in Paris at UNESCO headquarters. Theinitiative called for the establishment of aninternational fund for Iraqi higher education  with theobjective of providing both immediate and long-termassistance for the rehabilitation of higher education inbrotherly Iraq. The State of Qatar has made the firstcontribution to the fund  in the amount of $15 million.My country has also been participating ininternational efforts to rebuild Iraq. It has developed aspecial programme that includes the building ofhospitals and educational and residential units. Inaddition  we have a special programme in Afghanistanthat assists in the rebuilding of that country; theprogramme’s cost has amounted to $62 million thus far.The Arab-Israeli conflict and the question ofPalestine are at the top of the list of the conflicts thatneed concerted action in order to achieve a just  finaland comprehensive solution  particularly in the light ofthe continuation and acceleration of the bloodyconfrontation that has raged between the Palestinianpeople and Israeli occupation forces for so many years.It must be noted that we in the State of Qatar havewelcomed the road map. We expressed our support forthe Quartet’s efforts to have both sides beginimplementing the various stages of the road map  inkeeping with the vision articulated by Mr. GeorgeBush  President of the United States  as a basis for thefinal solution of establishing two States living side byside. We did so despite the many difficulties  obstaclesand setbacks encountered by those efforts in the pastfew weeks. We must also firmly stress thatimplementation of the road map cannot be undertakenby only one side — the Palestinian people. It requiresthat the Israeli side also fulfil its obligations and takethe necessary actions in that regard.All of the aforementioned requires that theinternational community and the members of theQuartet — particularly the United States of America —intervene  intensify their efforts and increase theirpressure on the Israeli Government so that it will do itspart  in return for the Palestinians’ commitment to dotheirs. Thus  Israeli occupation forces must refrainfrom carrying out assassinations  must lift the siege thatthey have imposed on Palestinian territories  enable thePalestinians to live in security  peace and dignity on theirown land and to move freely in their own areas  put anend to the policies of starvation  humiliation and housedemolition  and cease construction of the buffer wallcurrently being built by the Israeli authorities.In that connection  I cannot fail to note the positivegesture that we witnessed a few days ago by the LibyanGovernment’s closing of the Lockerbie file  an outcomethat was achieved in cooperation with the other partiesconcerned and in the context of United Nationsinstitutions. We should also note the positive responseof the Governments of the United States  the UnitedKingdom and France to that gesture  which bore fruitand ultimately led to the conclusion of an agreement.The phenomena of terrorism and extremismcontinue to be among the most important challengesfacing the world. As we express our total rejection andcondemnation of those subversive phenomena — in alltheir forms and manifestations  and regardless of theirsources or motivations — we reaffirm that we stand bythe side of the international community and that wesupport whatever efforts and measures are required toeliminate terrorism and to strengthen the foundationsof security and stability.Democracy is an expression of responsibleparticipation in political decision-making. It involvesthe establishment of State institutions and adherence tothe rule of law within the State; it provides foraccountability and for assessment of the performance ofgovernmental institutions; it ensures good governanceand safeguards the rights of citizens. As such  it is thebest way to achieve the priorities of nationaldevelopment and the objectives of modernization andreform  to which our peoples and societies aspire. Onthe basis of those principles  the State of Qatar recentlyconducted a referendum on a political Constitution thatgives women the right to political participation  both asvoters and as candidates for Parliament  which will beelected through the ballot box for the first time. TheConstitution also governs the relationship between theGovernment and the people and provides for theseparation of the three branches of government.With regard to human rights  an independent humanrights commission has been established in the State ofQatar. The commission submits its recommendations tocompetent State authorities with a view to developingand improving civil liberties. As promoting awarenessof civil rights requires that we improve education andupgrade its standards — as well as expanding it toinclude all segments of society — we have restructuredour educational system. Moreover  a number of well-known universities based in developed countries haveset up branches in the State of Qatar.In conclusion  the fulfilment of our aspirationslies in affirming the role of the United Nations  inenhancing its position and in maximizing its potential.It is through the Organization that we hope to establishinternational relations on the basis of understanding cooperation and common interests. And it is throughthe United Nations that we hope one day to succeed insettling crises and disputes; eliminating threats ofviolence  the use of force and terrorism; and ending thewasting of resources and energies on wars andconflicts  directing them instead to the service ofdevelopment  progress and prosperity. Similarly  weaspire to a new world built on the principles of justice equality  liberty  democracy and peaceful coexistenceamong all the world’s peoples  nations and cultures.That is an aspiration that our peoples  our youth andour future generations fully deserve. It is an aspirationto which we are wedded and which we cherish  becausethat vision occupies the highest priority in building theworld of the future: the world that we all seek anddesire. It is a world that we hope one day to attain as aninternational community — as one family livingtogether on this planet  God willing."
"144",5921,"ROU",58,2003,"﻿I wishto add Romania's voice to the heartfelt congratulationsof others to His Excellency Mr. Julian Robert Hunte onhis election to the important position of President ofthe General Assembly  wish him every success andassure him of our delegation's full support.The political debate of this session of theAssembly is being held in an international setting thatrequires us to take a long  hard look at the way theUnited Nations can respond to the challenges facing us.The recent terrorist attacks in Baghdad  whichtook the lives of Ambassador Sergio Vieira de Melloand other brave members of the United Nationscommunity  as well as of Iraqis who had committedthemselves to restoring stability in their country proved once more that the only language that fanaticsuse is that of crime and terror. The best way to pay38tribute to the memory of those victims of terror is tocarry out  with redoubled determination  the mission towhich they had dedicated their life.Today  the United Nations is called upon tocontinue to play a greater role in the service of good.Over the course of the past decade  theOrganization has accomplished a great deal  despite theseemingly insurmountable difficulties and certainevident limitations. Those obstacles sometimes grewout of a lack of shared perspectives regarding theproblems confronting us today. Yet  we have managedto keep world security under control.(spoke in English)As always at the United Nations  we are facedwith a challenge brought about by differing viewstowards common problems. There is nothing new here except for the magnitude of the consequences. Wecannot afford to do nothing simply because we do notagree on everything. The United Nations is not aboutagreeing on everything. It is about building consensus.We can do just that if we concentrate on negotiation  not language  but substance.Irrespective of how important the debate mightbe  we should not be distracted today by talk of aunipolar  multipolar or even bipolar world. Rather  weshould concentrate on how we can govern our world ina way that benefits the individual  brings aboutopportunity and pre-empts  deters and fights terrorismand aggression. If we are true to the principle of aninternational community dedicated to preserving peaceand increasing prosperity  we should discuss how toachieve higher levels of international understanding rather than the relevance of the United Nations systemtoday  for we have to remember that true security isshared security  and true prosperity is sharedprosperity.To achieve this  we should also keep in mind thatlegitimacy brings credibility that leads to predictabilityand predictability  brings long-term commonality ofviews that is the cornerstone of lasting coalitions.This is why we share the assessment of theSecretary-General  that The United Nations is not anend in itself. Rather it is an instrument for achievingcommon ends.' (A/58/1  para. 10)Our belief that we  the Member States  must keepthe United Nations working with efficiency  withpurpose and with result prompted Romania to putforward our candidature for membership in theSecurity Council starting next January. We thank theEastern European Group and others for their supportfor us. This is a responsibility that we do notunderestimate. Our mission will be to uphold thevalidity of the United Nations as an essentialinternational actor in preventing and resolvingconflicts  eliminating poverty and promoting humanrights.As befits a State that will soon be a member ofboth the European Union and NATO  we believe in themultilateral approach to tackling terrorism  theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction  organizedcrime and violations of human rights.As a country that has struggled to rebuild ademocratic society based on the rule of law  a marketeconomy and respect for human rights  we understandthe complex challenges of transition that othercountries are also facing. It is not an easy process  butin our view it is the only way to guarantee durableeconomic prosperity and social cohesion for thecitizen. We want to see a strengthening of the centralrole of the United Nations in coordinating worldwideefforts to this end.Romania's international profile is defined by ourlocation and our history and capability in Europe andby our transition experience. We are determined to playa responsible role in connecting the West and East ofour continent  and in reaching out to countries on theEastern shore of the Black Sea  the Caucasus and thegreater Middle East. We pledge to contribute tospreading Euro-Atlantic values beyond NATO and theEuropean Union areas by consistently promoting theculture of dialogue and regional cooperation.Terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction  the rising number of failing States andglobal disparities are some of the most worryinghallmarks of our times. The speed and unevenness ofglobal processes intensify the complexity andpervasive nature of these threats to our commonsecurity and prosperity.We already possess an important range of tools totackle threats like terrorism and weapons of massdestruction. They should now be used in a moreresponsible and effective manner. For example  theCounter-Terrorism Committee should be given moreprofessional resources so it can act more effectively to39streamline national legislation on uprooting thefinancial resources of terrorism and monitor itsimplementation. International non-proliferation legalregimes should be strengthened in order to preventdetermined proliferators from breaching theirinternational obligations. Countries of concern withregard to proliferation could be subjected to diplomaticand economic pressure  which is most effective whenapplied multilaterally.Challenges to the security and stability of ourworld also emerge as globalization processes expand.Sustainable development is increasingly related tosustainable peace and security. Globalization isinevitable. Provided that it is combined with goodgovernance  proper development assistance andawareness of environmental issues  as well as with fairtrade through open markets  globalization is a force forprogress. But global disparities are not disappearing.The ratio of per capita incomes of the richest andpoorest countries now stands at more than seventy toone. So it is especially disappointing that the WorldTrade Organization talks in Cancun ended in deadlock.We call on all parties to redouble their efforts inDecember to resume dialogue and close the gap. Thesuccess we need is not just that of freer and more openmarkets  but also that of equitable trade  creating addedvalue to regions  nations and communities.Sustainable development demands first that wemanage globalization responsibly so that it benefits all.It is time to focus on implementing the concrete goalsof eradicating poverty and accelerating development.The challenge will be to prioritize our work. Our focusat the High-level Dialogue on Financing forDevelopment at the end of next month should remainsquarely on achieving results.We also must redouble our efforts to put an end toconflicts  and we must find a way to rebuild thosecountries that have survived conflict but are strugglingto survive peace. Africa is a particularly worryingexample of how dangerous it can be to ignore theconsequences of conflicts. The grave humanitariancrises on that continent are foreboding a bleak futurefor many countries and fomenting despair and far-reaching frustrations.The international community has to be moreengaged in addressing poverty  intolerance and ethnichatred. We would like to see the United Nationsenhance its peace operation capabilities and emphasizein particular the reconstruction and rehabilitationprocesses. We have done this in Afghanistan  yet itremains a test of our ability and willingness to secure asuccessful democracy offensive in the fight againstterrorism. I think we have enough at stake to stand bythat commitment.In the Middle East  the new wave of violence ispreventing the full implementation of the agreed roadmap. Romania strongly condemns suicide bombingsthat are carried out by the enemies of peace andsecurity in the area. We urge the new PalestinianGovernment to act effectively against further terroristattacks targeting Israel and its citizens  but it is equallyimportant that the Israeli Government stand by itscommitments in the framework of pursuing a politicalsolution to this bitter conflict. We fully support theactions of the Quartet that are meant to contribute toovercoming this dangerous situation. We shall followwith utmost interest the ministerial meeting that isscheduled for this week.In Iraq  we believe it is time for the internationalcommunity to work together to stabilize andreconstruct that tragic country  whose people havesuffered so much under tyranny for so long. Thesuccessful conclusion of negotiations on the newresolution concerning Iraq is not a mere option   it isa must.We need now to concentrate on what mattersmost: the steps that must be taken next by theinternational community to empower the Iraqi peopleand to ensure the democratic functioning of institutionsin that country and stability  not only in Iraq  but alsoin the greater Middle East as a whole. As aparticipating country in the Coalition ProvisionalAuthority  Romania is already engaged and ready tocontinue to contribute to achieving these goals. We arelooking forward to participating in the comingministerial conference on assistance for the Iraqipeople in Madrid this October.Many conflicts in the world stem from thebreakdown of nation-States. Porous borders  weaknational institutions and the development of alternativeallegiances based on religious  economic and otherfactors often lead to the collapse of State structures.The principal feature of such States is the absence ofpolitical legitimacy  coupled with an uncontrolled orunaccountable security sector and contempt for the ruleof law. That leads to violent conflict over control of40resources or between different ethnic groups and toviolation of human rights and humanitarian law. Illegalarms become readily accessible  organized crime andviolence flourish and economic prospects die.A good example of where the internationalcommunity has been successful in preventing therelapse of a post-conflict situation is South-EastEurope. The past year has seen real progress in thisregion  due principally to the increased efforts of thecountries themselves  in partnership with the regionalcommunity and with support from internationalorganizations and partners. But certain problemspersist. It is vital to press ahead with full commitmentto meeting the responsibilities and timelines that havealready been accepted and to creating truly democraticand multi-ethnic societies. Combating organized crimeand illegal trafficking  including the most degradingkind that turns human beings into commodities  is apriority in our regional approach.We need to look at all these challenges with anew determination to tackle them  making full andeffective use of the tools available to us within theUnited Nations system. There has been muchdiscussion of the ability of the United Nations torespond to crises. The disadvantages of the presentworking methods of its structures and mechanisms which were conceived more than half a century ago call for radical reform. The real debate is abouteffectiveness  adaptation and evolution. It is about ourcommon will  as responsible members of theinternational community  to act together. Everythingelse   especially the badly needed strategies   willsimply follow  and this will make it possible toapproach the new and old threats alike.The United Nations must increasingly serve as acatalyst for collective action. This requires closecooperation among its Member States  dialogue andpartnership with the vibrant constellation of new non-State actors: civil society  non-governmentalorganizations  the business community and academia.Finally  the Organization must become more effective efficient and accessible to the world's people.We must weigh up our differences  gauge ourability for joint intervention and act in coordination.Just as the nature of current problems affects people ineverything they do  so too must we put people at thecentre of everything we do."
"145",5967,"RUS",58,2003,"﻿Once again I am delighted to have this opportunity to address thisrepresentative audience. At the outset  however  Ishould like to wish the fifty-eighth session of theGeneral Assembly fruitful work — work tosuccessfully harmonize the actions of peoples andStates; work on behalf of peace  security and progress.Those purposes were set out in the Charter of theUnited Nations by our predecessors  but  as we can see they are still relevant. Even now  they provide a solid long-term foundation for the activities of the UnitedNations. And  although the structure and the functionsof the Organization took shape in an internationalenvironment fundamentally different from ours  timehas only reaffirmed their universal importance. Today the instruments of the United Nations are not merely indemand; they are  as life itself has shown  simplyirreplaceable in crucial situations.That has been made abundantly clear by thefollowing important fact: despite sharp differencesconcerning how to resolve the Iraq crisis  the situationis ultimately returning to the legal sphere of the UnitedNations. Russia’s position in that regard is consistentand clear. Only direct United Nations participation inIraq’s reconstruction will enable Iraq’s people to decidetheir future. And only with active and — I want to stressthis — practical United Nations assistance in Iraq’seconomic and civil transformation will Iraq assume atruly new and worthy place in the world community.It is clear that  in recent years  the United Nationshas increasingly been obliged to carry outfundamentally new tasks and to tackle threats that aredifferent from  but just as serious as  those it facedbefore. Three years ago  at the 2000 MillenniumSummit  I said here that the common enemy of theUnited Nations was terrorism. Was Russia’s voiceheeded then? Did everyone understand the seriousnessof the threat  and were our joint actions adequate? Theevents of 11 September proved that  unfortunately  theywere not.To us in Russia  however  the style of themurderers who committed terrorist acts in Moscow  inChechnya and elsewhere in Russia and in New York  aswell as against United Nations staff in Baghdad  haslong been painfully familiar. That style is identicaleverywhere  and the fact that the inciters of terror areeasily recognizable — with regard to both the events ofAugust this year and the terrorist attacks of previousyears — only attests to the global nature of this threat.It is true that now we are listening to one another.And we understand that the United Nations mustbecome — and is indeed becoming — the basis for aglobal anti-terrorist coalition. Here  I wish to takeparticular note of the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee. Terrorism is a challenge to theplanet’s security and to its economic future. Therefore the Committee must become a real and practicalinstrument for effectively fighting the terrorist threat.I should like to focus in particular on thehumanitarian activities of the United Nations. That areaconsumes the lion’s share of the Organization’s energy time and resources  but it does not always appear in theheadlines  nor is it always familiar to the citizens of themore prosperous States. But it is precisely that area ofUnited Nations work that is so fundamental andirreplaceable. The United Nations is helping millionsof destitute people throughout the world — victims ofhunger  of disease and of conflict — to survive and notto lose hope. That work is exceptionally important; itlends indisputable political and moral authority to theentire Organization. And it is here that theinterrelationship between the moral and political contentof international activities is particularly evident.I should like to take this opportunity to thank allstaff members of the United Nations  all non-governmental organizations and  of course  the manyvolunteers who are participating in this noble work.Because we understand how valuable theOrganization’s humanitarian mission is  Russia views itas a major political endeavour. We are alreadycontributing to this work  and we are committed toincreasing our contribution. Over the past three years Russia has forgiven a total of $27.2 billion in debt of5 developing countries  and we are currently grantingsignificant tariff preferences to such countries.For the first time in many years  as our countryhas grown  it has become a donor to the United NationsWorld Food Programme. The horrors of starvation arewell known to us from our own history. As a result ofthe civil war of the past century and the forcedcollectivization of the 1920s and 1930s  millions ofpeople died of starvation in the Volga region  in NorthernCaucasus and in other parts of our country. Hungerbecame a national tragedy for the peoples of Ukraine aswell. We consider it our moral and ethical duty toexpand our participation in food aid programmes.Russia intends to work actively to resolve acuteenvironmental problems. A milestone will be achievedin that area by the World Conference on ClimateChange  scheduled to convene next week in Russia’scapital  Moscow. We also believe it is essential that aglobal system be established to monitor and neutralizedangerous infectious diseases  and we consider thework done by the Global Fund to be a realdemonstration of international solidarity in fighting thespread of AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria.Of course  the United Nations  like any systemwith a complex structure  needs to be improved. Butthe Organization’s past and current problems have neverbeen problems of only the Organization per se; they havealways been created by — and they continue to reflect —contradictions in the very system of internationalrelations  particularly the system of international law.After all  politicians  including those represented in theUnited Nations  including the Security Council  do notalways have at their disposal adequate and effectivelyfunctioning legal instruments — instruments that wouldenable them to deal effectively with the international andregional crises that arise. International law must  ofcourse  be fluid and living  reflecting the realities ofthe contemporary world. I believe that many of theprocesses that are under way within the United Nationsalso attest to the constant changes that are taking placein the world. Such changes dictate a logic of evolutionin the United Nations.Members of the Organization know very wellthat  as a rule  all of the achievements of the UnitedNations are shared successes  and that our failures areshared miscalculations. Such knowledge  however brings with it great responsibility. First and foremost we must be extremely careful about interfering with thefabric — the mechanisms — of the work of the UnitedNations. Clearly  behind any such decision there shouldbe more than general political rhetoric — mere wordsabout so-called fair policies.I am convinced that any attempt to modernizeUnited Nations instruments must be preceded byserious analysis and careful calculation. Such anapproach should be taken  first and foremost  withregard to the principal international legal instruments.After all  guaranteeing that they remain effective is theonly way to avoid a legal vacuum. As long as thenorms of international law remain unchanged andoperative  we must observe them. We must ensurecontinuity of security guarantees for States and for theworld as a whole.We must analyse United Nations structures andmechanisms and try to understand which have provedeffective and productive  as well as which have donethe job they were intended to do and which now remainunused. We should remember that much of thepotential of the United Nations has still to be tapped.There are many resources that we are only nowlearning how to use.I would like in particular to comment on the needto enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council. Iam convinced that  given the deep-rooted nature of thecurrent differences of opinion and the importance ofensuring that the Council remain effective  we mustwork gradually and very cautiously.We believe that at this stage we should be guidedabove all by the broadest possible agreement on allaspects of the expansion of the Council  as well as bythe need to ensure that it maintains its current highstatus and the legitimacy born of agreed actions. Afterall  the Security Council  as the Charter makes clear acts on behalf of the United Nations. The SecurityCouncil is endowed with a specific mechanism forharmonizing political will and for protecting thenational interests of a great variety of States  and through this  the interests of the entire internationalcommunity.It is true that we often hear that the developedcountries bear special responsibility for the destiny ofthe world. Such leadership  however  entails majorobligations  primarily to ensure that the interests of theinternational community as a whole are reflected.Being a world Power means working together with theworld community. Being a truly strong  influential6 State means seeing and helping to resolve the problemsof small and economically weak countries.In that connection  I believe that it would beuseful to intensify the work that is being carried out bythe United Nations in cooperation with the regionalinternational structures. That will lead directly towardsincreased economic prosperity in various parts of theworld  and thus contribute to the containment ofpotential threats and the maintenance of a commonglobal strategic balance.We welcome the emergence of regional centresfor coordination and cooperation in a united Europe.We favour the strengthening of integration processes inthe Asia-Pacific region. And of course  we support thework of the Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS)  as well as that of the Collective Security TreatyOrganization and the Shanghai CooperationOrganization  whose authority and effectiveness arecontinuing to grow.Russia is not the only country that is interested inregional integration. Our CIS partners have alsodemonstrated their practical commitment to that samegoal. This was reaffirmed during the recent CISsummit. We consider the development of ourinteraction with the European Union  which ismultifaceted in nature  to be important. Likewise  withregard to security issues  we attach importance to thesearch new forms of cooperation with the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization.We should counter current threats to civilizationonly by means of collective responses whose legitimacyis not in doubt. In this respect  we need a systemic visionthat combines political with  when necessary  militarymeasures. Such measures should be agreed upon inadvance  and be sensible and appropriate.The need to improve the peacekeepingmechanisms of the United Nations remains on theOrganization’s agenda. The United Nations must beable to deploy peacekeeping — and  where necessary peace-enforcement — operations more quickly andefficiently  in strict compliance with the United NationsCharter. I should like to note that Russia  which hasalways supported the peacekeeping functions of theOrganization  is prepared to step up its participation insuch operations  both under United Nations auspicesand in coalition operations authorized by the SecurityCouncil.The proliferation of weapons of mass destructionand their delivery systems remains a serious challengeto the modern world. The most dangerous challenge isthe possibility of their falling into the hands ofterrorists. We know what steps must be taken in orderto eliminate such threats. These include the furtheruniversalization of the existing non-proliferationregimes  the strengthening of international verificationinstruments and the introduction of safe technologies innuclear energy production. In general  this requires therenunciation by States of excessive arsenals andmilitary programmes that could undermine the politicaland military balance and trigger an arms race.Russia believes that it is extremely important toprevent the militarization of outer space. We believethat a comprehensive agreement should be elaboratedon this issue  and invite all countries possessingpotential in this area to join our initiative. The Russianinitiative to set up  under the auspices of the UnitedNations  a global system to counter these new threats hasalready been supported by the General Assembly. Wepropose the adoption of a new resolution during thissession setting out specific further steps in this direction.In conclusion  I should like to recall that the solidstructure of the United Nations has enabled it towithstand all of the many crises of the second half ofthe twentieth century. It has helped to overcome threatsof global confrontation and  most importantly  helpedto promote human rights. It has also helped to assertthe principles of mutual respect and good-neighbourlinessamong States. The main thrust of the United Nationsapproach is that humankind has no alternative but tojointly construct a safer  fairer and more prosperousworld. That is our duty to succeeding generations. Inthat important task we can have no better help thansuch time-tested instruments as the work of the UnitedNations  an Organization that  for half a century  tookdecisions that were crucial for the entire world.Russia is convinced that the United Nations mustmaintain its central role in international affairs. This isparticularly relevant  and particularly important  forresolving conflict situations. This is our choice and ourstrategic position of principle."
"146",6014,"RWA",58,2003,"﻿Thissession of the General Assembly is being held at a timewhen the world is confronted with the most seriouschallenges of its history in all areas.The Assembly has chosen Mr. Julian Hunte topreside over our work and for my delegation it is a signof recognition of his qualities and competence. I wouldtherefore like to join my voice to those of otherdistinguished heads of delegations preceding me inconveying to him my sincere congratulations as well asmy hopes for his complete success  and we pledge tohim the support of my country to assist him inaccomplishing his task. We also wish to pay a tribute tohis predecessor  whose success was tremendous inconducting the work of the fifty-seventh session  whichhas just ended. We ask him to accept ourcongratulations and our gratitude and we hope he willcontinue to impart to us the benefits of his experience.We would also like to respectfully convey ourthanks to the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  for thewisdom that he has shown and for his tireless effortswhich he continues to deploy  sometimes in extremelydifficult situations  so that the Organization can  asmuch as possible  reach the objectives which have beenassigned to it under the terms of its Charter.During this fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly  we are going to commemorate the tenthanniversary of the genocide which  in less than 100days  from April to July 1994  in plain sight of theentire world  claimed the lives of more than a millionRwandans and caused the internal displacement or theexile of thousands of others. We hope that this will be17 an occasion for the General Assembly to collectivelyrecommit our efforts  as Governments and peoplesacross the globe  so that these types of horrors neveragain occur. Toward this end  we suggest that 7 April2004 be declared  by this distinguished Assembly  as aday to commemorate the tenth anniversary of theRwandan genocide.While the advent of this sad anniversary obligesus to recall this genocide as something we must rememberand as a sign of respect and of international solidarity  itis not the only reason we have taken the floor here. Onthe contrary  we wish to share an experience which isvery hopeful  namely the rebirth of the Rwandan nationwhich  in our opinion  has been a test of stamina and ofthe determination of an entire people. In fact  in the lastfive months Rwanda  which in 1994 looked very muchlike a failed State  courageously undertook itsreconstruction and now has experienced somepromising events  the most promising of its post-colonial history.Since its accession to independence in 1962  thefirst pluralist presidential elections have just been heldand they took place in an atmosphere of unprecedentedpeace and calm. The stunning victory of HisExcellency Paul Kagame as President of the Republicin the vote that was held on 25 August  exactly onemonth ago  is part of the democratic process set inmotion since 1999 by local elections  followed in 2001by municipal elections and in May 2003 by theconstitutional referendum. This marks  de jure  the endof the transitional period  begun in the aftermath of theRwandan tragedy in 1994.These free and transparent elections  as well asthe legislative elections which are ongoing even now aswe speak  are not only an important step in the processof democratization  but also and especially arerestoring Rwandans to their right and sense of pride atbeing able to make and write their own history  ahistory  which has turned its back forever on genocideand which is instituting  as critical values and objectives unity  peace  justice  democracy and development.These consultations  we are reminded  are not theresult of chance  and would not have taken place norknown as much success as the international communityhas seen  had it not been for the firm will of theRwandan leadership and the Rwandan people tocommit themselves with determination to peace andsecurity of individuals and property throughout theentire Rwandan territory; unity and reconciliation ofthe Rwandan people; and good governance which  inthe end  is our policy engine and which has allowed usto dismantle the structure of a State that was toocentralized and totalitarian and which stifled positiveinitiatives  as well as the involvement of the people indecisions concerning their own development.We have also set up principles of accountabilityand transparency at all levels of public life by creatingstrong autonomous institutions to combat corruption nepotism and abuses of power. The success of theseinitiatives can be measured today by the fact that arecent study of the World Bank Institute has citedRwanda among the developing countries that are thebest managed  the best governed and not corrupt. Suchpublic transparency would not have been possiblewithout our having eradicated the culture of impunitywhich had taken root in our country.We had to take steps to completely overhaul theclassical legal system and introduce a legal system thatis participatory and traditional called Gacaca'  whichis inspired by Rwandan know-how and whose majorobjective is not only to punish crimes committedduring the genocide  but also  and especially  toreconcile Rwandans.It should also be pointed out that the 1948Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of theCrime of Genocide obliges the international communityto prevent  stop and punish genocide. While theinternational community came up short in its obligationsunder this Convention  we did greatly appreciate thesubsequent establishment of the International CriminalTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)  established to bring tojustice and punish the perpetrators of this crime.Our country was particularly pleased and satisfiedwith the recent decision of the Security Council toappoint a full-time prosecutor for the ICTR in order toimprove its performance and its effectiveness. We areof the view  however  that other reforms could still beinitiated to obtain this objective which  in our view would help restore human dignity.Regionally  the political and security situation inthe Great Lakes Region in Central Africa has tangiblyimproved since last year. Rwanda is pleased with theongoing peace process in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo  which has led to the formation of aninclusive transitional Government and the reunificationof that country.18 We are disposed to work with this newGovernment  as well as with the United NationsOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo (MONUC)  to achieve disarmament demobilization and effective repatriation  as called forin the Agreements of Lusaka and Pretoria  of the ex-FAR and the Interahamwe militia  whose belligerentactivities are at the heart of the two regrettable clashesbetween our two countries.With respect to the situation in Burundi  thisrequires more attention on the part of the internationalcommunity. Rwanda  at this point  is calling on all theparties to consider the best interests of the Burundiansand to join with the ongoing peace initiatives supportedby countries in the region so that we can put an end tothe unspeakable suffering of the Burundian population.This being the case  at a time when these differentAfrican peace initiatives are beginning to take form  itis time to call on the international community toaccompany them and support organizing aninternational conference for peace  security anddevelopment in the Great Lakes region. Thisconference would hopefully produce a kind of MarshallPlan for the development of the region.Elsewhere in Africa and throughout the world Rwanda condemns the fact that conflicts  oftenconflicts that have been going on for some years continue to claim many human lives and deflectenormous financial and material resources that couldbe allocated to developmental projects.We are of the view  however  that these conflictswill not disappear on their own  unless we payattention to them and unless we attack the root causesof these conflicts and  in particular  unless we put intoplace effective and appropriate mechanisms to prevent manage and resolve these conflicts.Indeed  we must all work together  resolutely  topromote dialogue in good faith  solidarity among nations non-exclusion  the human dimension  international lawand diplomatic activities as a means worthy of theindividual and of nations to resolve their differences.The point concerning United Nations reform is onthe agenda of our Organization and has been forseveral years  although we have never been able toagree on the scope and content of the necessaryreforms. That the United Nations needs to be reformedis without doubt. In fact  as the United NationsSecretary-General indicated  when the stakes change we must adapt our responses to them.It is certain that the challenges facing theinternational community today are different from thosethey faced from the 1940s to the 1980s. Rwanda is alsoconvinced  therefore  that the institutions  thestructures and the working methods of the UnitedNations  which have been adopted over the years mustbe adjusted and fine-tuned to the realities of the day.Would it not be fair  for example  in a worldwhich has fundamentally changed  that we question themembership and the decision-making methods in theSecurity Council? At a time when we are requiring allnations to have democratic governance  is it notlegitimate to require the Security Council itself to bemore representative and more democratic in itsmethods of work?Rwanda supports the proposal submitted by otherMember States to increase the number of members ofthe Security Council to better reflect regional realitiesand therefore to allow a better representation ofdeveloping countries. Nevertheless  in order to do that we must bear in mind the fact that the Security Councilhas been placed as a body under the General Assemblyand that its enlargement can in no way compromisethat order.We must therefore better reorganize the UnitedNations so that it can achieve the goals of ensuringpeace and security among nations  developing moreequitable international relations in the areas ofcooperation and friendly ties and inspiring andguaranteeing the international order and internationallaw. In doing so we must ask ourselves why the UnitedNations has been unable to respond collectively andeffectively to such recent crises and tragedies as the1994 Rwandan genocide and the situation in Iraq. Whyhas the United Nations been unable to prevent or stopvarious crises throughout the world or to fulfil itsprimary mission of ensuring peaceful co-existence amongnations? Why has the United Nations been unable to be aneffective and efficient catalyst for harmonious political social and economic development in all nations? Webelieve that the answer to all of those questions  andmany others  will determine the nature and scope of thereforms to be undertaken. In that regard  we welcomethe Secretary-General's decision to establish a high-level panel to address the question of reform and tomake proposals to the General Assembly.19 As I said at the beginning of my statement  themajor challenges in the world today include poverty;poor governance; economic  political and socialinjustice   which give rise to many internal conflicts  international terrorism; globalization and theHIV/AIDS pandemic and other widespread diseases.Those challenges cannot be successfully addressedwithout greater and more effective cooperation on thepart of all countries. Nevertheless  the developmentgoals for the new millennium  the New Partnership forAfrica's Development  the current series ofnegotiations in the Doha round to allow greater accessto world markets for products from developingcountries  the recent decision by the World TradeOrganization (WTO) to allow poor countries to importlow-cost basic generic medicines to combat suchillnesses as AIDS  and the various tools established bythe United Nations to combat international terrorism allrepresent the beginning of collective responses to thosechallenges. However  those initiatives will only bearfruit if all nations abandon selfish reflexes  such asthose that were at the heart of the recent failure ofWTO negotiations at Cancun.Rwanda would like to take advantage of thisforum to reiterate its steadfast determination to commititself and to contribute  however modestly  to addressthose challenges. We are committed to working with allthe nations of the world to begin that undertaking inour region and in our dear continent  Africa."
"147",6057,"SAU",58,2003,"﻿It gives me great pleasure to convey to you Sir  and to your friendly country  Saint Lucia  ourcongratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly. I would like to express myappreciation to you personally and my full confidencein your ability to effectively conduct the work of theAssembly at this session.I would also like to express our gratitude to yourpredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  who led the work of theAssembly at its last session with wisdom and expertise.I also wish to take this opportunity to pay tributeto the Secretary-General and to express the gratitude ofthe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his continuous andtireless efforts to establish peace and security in theworld  strengthen the role of the Organization  increaseits efficiency  preserve its credibility and enhance itseffectiveness.It is saddening and distressful that this session isconvening while the echo of the horrendous attackagainst the United Nations offices in Baghdad that tookthe life  among others  of one of its prominent andtowering figures  Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello is stillresonating in our hearts. I avail myself of thisopportunity to convey to the Secretary-General  to thestaff of the Secretariat and to the families of thevictims of this tragic incident my sincere and deepestcondolences. I would also like to express the hope thatneither this incident nor the most recent one that tookplace a few days ago will impede the efforts aimed atpromoting the role of the United Nations inconsolidating stability and prosperity in Iraq.The hideous attack on the United Nations officesin Baghdad represents a challenge that can be dealtwith and contained  and the necessary securityconditions to minimize such occurrences in the futurecan be established. However  our Organization is  atthis juncture  facing other challenges that are moreserious than what happened in Baghdad  challengesrelated to its raison d''tre and to the principles andfoundations stipulated in its Charter. These principleswere not heeded and the responsibility for this is ours.This has in many instances impeded its effectivenessand credibility.Nevertheless  its ability to exist and perform andthe contributions it has provided and continues toprovide in various humanitarian  cultural and socialfields through its specialized agencies are sufficient toencourage support for the Organization and provide itwith every assistance it needs.In the comprehensive speech he gave at the outsetof this session  the Secretary-General referred withclarity and transparency to the growing trend towardsunilateral action outside the realm of internationallegitimacy in dealing with current problems such asterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. This expanding trend to resort to unilateralaction on the basis of the right to self-defence couldundermine the principle of collective security on whichthe Charter was founded. We stressed this in theMillennium Declaration that was issued by the GeneralAssembly three years ago.Nevertheless  we have to admit that notconfronting such actions effectively and withseriousness and steadfastness when faced with dangersand threats such as those that emanated from the21regime of Saddam Hussein  have led  it seems  toconfusion. This confusion has provided the advocatesof collective action and the defenders of unilateralaction with parallel arguments that each group is nowusing against the other. Whoever wants to criticize thepolicy of unilateral action will find no difficultyproving that such a policy could only exacerbate andincrease problems.On the other hand  those who criticize theinternational community for being lax in actingcollectively to confront such problems that threatensecurity and stability will also come up with argumentsto prove that such reluctance and negligence in facingchallenges is behind the eruption of the major crises ofour contemporary history.It was therefore natural that  due to suchdivergence in views  a situation was reached whereinthe focus turned to debate and theorization rather thanto dealing directly with current problems and decidingon practical measures to resolve them. This is exactlywhat happened with respect to Iraq immediately beforethe war.International terrorism  in all its manifestationsand forms  represents a very dangerous challenge toour international Organization and to the internationalcommunity at large. It deserves our condemnationwhich must be resolute  categorical and unequivocal.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has expressed thisposition at different forums and internationalgatherings.The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  which hassuffered and continues to suffer from acts of terror  haslaunched a relentless war against terrorism  enactedregulations that punish perpetrators  inciters andsympathizers with terrorist activities and hasintroduced counter-terrorism as one of the mainsubjects in the curricula of its schools. It has also takena series of measures to close any loopholes in the waycharities collect money  in order to prevent funds frombeing diverted for unlawful purposes.However  regardless of its effectiveness  theinternational effort directed against terrorism will noteradicate this phenomenon without addressing its rootcauses and the reasons for its spread.The Palestinian issue  which has become aconstant item on the agenda of all the sessions of theGeneral Assembly over the past five decades  continuesto be a cause of instability and turmoil in the MiddleEast region  whose nations yearn for peace  prosperityand development. I don't think I need to go into thedetails of this issue  of which you are completelyaware  but we should remember Israel's persistence inits provocative policies and practices  which focus onrepression  persecution  political assassinations settlers' issues and the ominous fence. This is anapproach that has subverted all initiatives andproposals aimed at solving the Palestinian issue including the Arab peace initiative and the road map.The solutions that were presented on thePalestinian issue were harmed mostly by the SecurityCouncil's contradictions  especially among itspermanent members  in dealing with resolutions in thisregard. We see resolutions being adopted but remainingmere ink on paper  and when the time comes for theirresolutions on implementation  the veto power isinvoked to abort implementation.The only way out of this vicious circle  from ourperspective  is for the permanent members to pledgenot to use the veto power when dealing withresolutions or measures aimed at implementing thesubstance of resolutions previously adopted. Thismatter may be one of the issues that the reform teamproposed by the Secretary-General should consider inorder to invigorate the role of the United Nations inhandling current issues and challenges.The people of Iraq look to our Organization toend the confusion  anarchy and chaos that resultedfrom the collapse of the previous regime. The majorproblem facing Iraq now is the absence of a clearvision as for the future of Iraq and the fact that Iraqcannot control its own destiny. Iraq faces a grave andcomplicated internal situation  coupled with a delicateand sensitive geographical location.It is therefore of utmost necessity that we set aclear timetable that would assure the Iraqis that theyare close to restoring their sovereignty andindependence through an accelerated political processlinked to specific commitments  whether with regard toconsolidating the power of the transitional IraqiGovernment or drafting a new Iraqi constitution thatwould pave the way for the formation of a legitimatenational Iraqi Government under which all citizenswould enjoy equal rights and responsibilities.Based on this premise  my country views theTransitional Governing Council in Iraq as representing22a positive step paving the way towards this goal. Whilewe give utmost importance to the role of the UnitedNations in Iraq  we are hopeful that any debate on Iraqwill focus on determining its needs and findingeffective means to respond to them  includingcontributions by all Member States to this noble effort namely the stability of Iraq.That must be done speedily  efficiently and in away that would conform with the needs of Iraq. Iraq isa country of pivotal importance  geographically andhistorically  in our region. It possesses natural andhuman resources that qualify it to take a prominent rolein the international community. All it needs from us isan initial push to allow it to regain its sovereignty stability and growth.The manifestations of the proliferation ofweapons of mass destruction are a cause of greatconcern and tension in the Middle East. This meansthat we must declare the Middle East and the Arab Gulfregion a zone free from weapons of mass destruction.With regard to the need to increase theeffectiveness and universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its system ofsafeguards  monitoring and inspection  we also believethat certain standards and controls must be put in placeto assure progress in all fields of the elimination ofweapons of mass destruction. Based on this  we callupon all countries that have yet to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to take the necessary stepsto do so  especially Israel  and to submit their nuclearsites and installations to the international safeguardsregime.The international situation looks again as it usedto be during the time of polarisation  includingincreasing tensions  crises and divisions that haveparalyzed the Security Council. Despite the fact thatwe have entered the third millennium  we still lack theneeded commitment and collective political will totranslate our commitments into reality. Internationalpeace and security are still but a hope and an aspirationfor many people and countries. Comprehensivedevelopment is still a dream for many and a distantobjective we all hope to achieve.In the Middle East  where countries suffer fromthese symptoms  we see in the ideas presented byPresident Bush  for the promotion of development inthe Middle East many positive signs  whichcollectively present a model for fruitful cooperationbetween rich nations and developing countries.In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  His RoyalHighness the Crown Prince presented an initiativeaimed at reforming the situation in the Arab region inthe economic sphere  with structural reforms as well asexpansion of political participation at its core. If theregion succeeds in benefiting from these twoinitiatives  its future will be promising.The fact that there are still chronic issues on theagenda of our Organization  like the Palestinianproblem  issues of comprehensive development and theemergence of issues like Iraq makes it incumbent uponus to embark on two parallel tracks: credibility inupholding the principles of the Charter  and seriousnessin implementing United Nations resolutions. We mustnot substitute futile and senseless arguments whichwould be useless to us all for practical solutions.Our deeply rooted belief in of the important rolethat the United Nations can play in dealing with crisesand its efforts to avoid the horrors of war and toprovide means for international cooperation make usmore determined than ever to support this Organizationand consolidate its constructive role. We want theUnited Nations to take a greater role in handling crisesbefore they occur through the implementation of whatis known as preventive diplomacy rather than throughpre-emptive wars  in order to preserve stability andmaintain international peace and security."
"148",6096,"SDN",58,2003,"﻿I shouldlike to begin my statement with a quotation from theKoran:“O mankind! We createdYou from a single (pair)Of a male and a female And made you intoNations and tribes  thatYe may know each other(Not that ye may despise(Each other). VerilyThe most honoured of you in the sight of AllahIs (he who is) the mostRighteous of you.” (The Holy Koran  XLIX:13)Peace be upon you.I should like at the outset to congratulate Mr.Julian Hunte on his well-deserved election to thepresidency of the General Assembly at this session. Ishould also like to express the gratitude of mydelegation to his predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan.We would like to express our appreciation for theimportant role that the Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan  continues to play in revitalizing thework of the Organization. In this connection  wewelcome his ideas regarding the institutional reform ofthe Organization. I would also like to take thisopportunity to express to the United Nations ourheartfelt condolences for the untimely deaths of Mr.Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues.When I addressed the Assembly from thisrostrum last year  I made clear that my Governmentand my country were eager to achieve peace in theSudan. I am very pleased  therefore  to inform the23Assembly that our words have been matched withdeeds  and peace is now on the horizon — peace thatwill put an end to an armed conflict that hassquandered the human and natural resources of thecountry and hindered the development of the Sudanesepeople.My country has continuously reiterated its desirefor dialogue and negotiation with the Sudan People’sLiberation Army Movement (SPLM). Our efforts together with those of the mediators  have beencontinuing for more than 10 years and have recentlybeen crowned with success in the form of an agreementby both parties as a result of an initiative put forwardby the countries of the Inter-Governmental Authorityon Development  under the patronage of the sisterlycountry  Kenya  and with much appreciated positivesupport by the IGAD partners.At the most recent round of negotiations  HisExcellency Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha  First Vice-President  led the Government delegation  and Mr. JohnGarang led the SPLM delegation. Four days ago  itresulted in an agreement on security arrangements andthe extension of a ceasefire. It is expected that thatagreement will pave the way for a final round ofnegotiations that will lead to just and lasting peacethroughout the Sudan as soon as possible.I would like to take this opportunity to expressour gratitude to the IGAD member countries for therole they played in the Sudan peace process  under thestewardship of the President of Kenya and his specialenvoy. Our thanks and appreciation also go to IGADpartners  namely the United States of America  theUnited Kingdom  Italy and Norway. We would like toexpress particular gratitude for the positiveintervention of the Government of the United States ofAmerica at the most critical juncture in the negotiationprocess. We also appreciate the considerable effortsthat Egypt and Libya have continued to make in theinterests of peace in the Sudan  as well as those of theArab League and the African Union.We are confident that Members will understandhow important the ceasefire agreement is for thehumanitarian situation. The report of the Secretary-General on the humanitarian situation in the Sudandemonstrates the extent of the progress made in thisarea. Next month will mark the one-year anniversary ofthe cessation of hostilities. Peace remains a basicrequirement for the rehabilitation of the areas affectedby war and will allow for the transition fromhumanitarian relief to comprehensive sustainabledevelopment.We would like to reiterate our full conviction thatthe peace  security and stability of the countries of theregion are directly linked with peace in the Sudan. Thatis why my country has endeavoured to heal the woundsof the past in its relations with neighbouring countries in particular Egypt and Ethiopia. Our relationship withthose two countries has moved beyond thereconciliation stage; we now have exemplary strategicsecurity ties with them  thereby protecting the interestsof our peoples and consolidating peace and security inthe entire region.We would like to express gratitude to our friendsand brothers and to the United Nations in general fortheir humanitarian assistance during the conflict. Wecall upon the international community to help in thepost-conflict reconstruction of our country and therehabilitation of internally displaced persons andrefugees  and to assist in the achievement ofsustainable development in support of the fledglingpeace.It gives me great pleasure to tell the Assemblythat we have made appreciable constitutionalachievements that will open the door wide forparticipation by all the Sudanese people in all areas ofpolitical life. Economic plans and policies adopted bythe Government have started to bear fruit  whether inthe form of reduced levels of inflation  high rates ofgrowth or the stabilization of exchange rates. We willcontinue to enhance those policies with a view toreducing poverty and achieving sustainabledevelopment within the framework of the 25-yearcomprehensive development strategy for the period2003-2027.In his report on the work of the Organization  theSecretary-General reminded us that  as the challengesfacing us change  so must we alter our methods ofdealing with them. It is high time  therefore  that wesummon the political will to reform the SecurityCouncil by dealing with the double issues ofmembership and the right of veto so as to make it morerepresentative and democratic in its membership and inits decision-making. While touching on SecurityCouncil reform  we warmly welcome Council24resolution 1506 (2003)  which lifted the sanctionsimposed against fraternal Libya. In that connection  wewish to stress the need to lift all unilateral sanctions used as a means for the political and economiccoercion of States. We urge the Security Council not tobe quick to impose sanctions on countries  particularlythe developing countries  because of their adverseimpact on their people.The high-level participation at this session todiscuss various international issues is clear evidence ofthe General Assembly’s importance. We stronglysupport its efforts to rearrange its priorities and agendaitems  in order to improve the administrative andprocedural aspects of its work  to enhance its relationswith the Security Council  the highest organ in theUnited Nations  to contribute to the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and to face ongoingchallenges.Another challenge of great concern to us lately isthe increasing acts of terrorism. Terrorist acts thatoccurred in various parts of the world last year clearlyprove that no country is immune to terrorism. All of us regardless of our religion or beliefs  could be thevictims of such crimes. As I mentioned earlier terrorism has no religion or country. Hence  in order toface this grave threat  we need to reach an internationalconsensus on its definition  root causes and means tocombat it  under the auspices of our internationalOrganization.In that context  we express our support for thecall of His Excellency Mohamed Hosni Mubarak President of the Arab Republic of Egypt  to convene aninternational conference  under the auspices of theUnited Nations  to address the issue of terrorism. In thecontext of its international and regional role  the Sudanwill have the honour next year to host the Non-AlignedMovement ministerial conference. We hope that theconference will consider issues of collective securityand challenges.The deteriorating socio-economic situation of theleast developed countries requires the internationalcommunity to make every effort to extricate them fromthe labyrinth of poverty  hunger and disease. Ourexperience in the Sudan has proved that  regardless oftheir endeavours  the least developed countries cannotachieve the objectives of the Brussels Programme ofAction without substantial assistance from theirdevelopment partners. I commend the tireless efforts ofthe High Representative of the Secretary-General forthe Least Developed Countries in mobilizinginternational support for initiatives on the subject. Wejoin the appeal to the international community by HisExcellency Joaquim Alberto Chissano  President ofMozambique  as Chairman of the African Union  toextend support and assistance to the New Partnershipfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  the frameworkadopted by the African continent and endorsed by theUnited Nations and donor countries as a tool for copingwith development challenges in the continent.I am pleased to inform members that the Sudan as Chairman of the Intergovernmental Authority onDevelopment (IGAD) and Common Market for Easternand Southern Africa (COMESA)  has tried its best toformulate policies and take steps that will furtherconsolidate and promote links of cooperation betweenEGAD and COMESA member States. Such efforts arein line with the NEPAD initiative aimed at achievingpeace  development and prosperity for the peoples ofthe entire African continent. To that end  a number ofspecialized conferences have been convened in theSudan to address issues of economic cooperation disarmament and combating terrorism  as well as issuesof internally displaced persons and refugees  all withthe aim of attaining the NEPAD goals.Another agenda item subject that we think willnegatively impact the future of humankind if notproperly addressed is that of human cloning  which isnow at the centre of a heated scientific  religious  legaland ethical debate. The Sudan strongly supports thecall for an international convention against thereproductive cloning of human beings. We alsocondemn all medical ventures that disdain humandignity and the sanctity of the Creator.Statements over the past few days clearlydemonstrate the keen interest of the internationalcommunity in maintaining international peace andsecurity. While adding our voice to those calling for therevitalization of multilateral diplomacy  we also callfor the prompt handling of the critical security andhumanitarian situation in Iraq. Furthermore  we call forthe empowerment of our Iraqi brothers so that theymay exercise their right to sovereignty  as guaranteedto them by international law  and live in peace andharmony with their neighbours. It gives me pleasure toremind the Assembly of the important resolutionadopted a few weeks ago by the Council of Ministersof the League of Arab States  which recognized the25transitional Governing Council of Iraq. Suchrecognition is a significant step that will  hopefully enable Iraq to regain its sovereignty and to play itsregional and international role.The question of Palestine has been a deepconcern to the human conscience. For more than fivedecades  it has been a major threat to internationalpeace and security. We have been firmly convinced thatIsrael’s maintenance of a huge military presence  itsaggression and its killing and suppression of thePalestinian people  will only aggravate a situation thatis already deteriorating. The only viable way to achievepeace is to adhere to the relevant resolutions ofinternational legitimacy and international law. Theinternational community  particularly the influentialparties in the peace process  are urged to exert pressureon Israel.The conflict in Somalia has been a bleedingwound in the Horn of Africa and the time has come tostop that painful bleeding. We call upon the leaders ofall Somali factions to join hands to preserve the unityand stability of their country  and to achievedevelopment and prosperity for their people  in order toprotect them from the scourge of war and fighting. Weremain confident that the neighbouring and otherinterested countries will spare no effort to help reachan agreement that will preserve the unity  security andstability of Somalia.The Sudan is now a genuine partner in theinternational efforts aimed at the prohibition ofchemical weapons. One of the significant roles playedby the Sudan in that regard was its hosting last Augustof the First Conference of the African NationalAuthorities of the Chemical Weapons ConventionStates Parties. We are committed to implementing therecommendations adopted at the conference particularly to creating a chemical-weapon-free zone inAfrica and to enhancing international cooperation inthe peaceful use of chemical materials.I call upon the international community to makerenewed efforts to declare the Middle East a zone freeof nuclear weapons and of all other weapons of massdestruction. That inflamed region must abide byinternational agreements banning nuclear weapons. Thenuclear facilities of all States  without exception andwith complete fairness  must be subjected to thecomprehensive safeguards of the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA).Here we recall  shortly after its fifth anniversary the unjust bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical andveterinary factory by the former United StatesAdministration which claimed that it was used tomanufacture weapons. It was a baseless accusation  asMembers are aware  that has been refuted by Americanscientific and academic institutions before relevantinternational organizations. The Sudan’s complaint isstill alive in the Security Council. In that connection  Icall upon the current United States Administration torectify the serious mistake that it inherited from itspredecessor  by compensating the Sudan morally andfinancially.I hope that before the end of this session mycountry will finally bid farewell to the longest Africanconflict  an achievement that would enable the Sudanto play its role at the regional level and to contribute tothe stability and sustainable development of theAfrican continent.In conclusion  I reaffirm our deep conviction thatthe United Nations is the sole  irreplaceable mechanismfor administering and promoting internationalcooperation in all fields. Therefore  we should distancethe United Nations from serving narrow interests andfrom attempts to exploit it to pursue special agendas. Inthat connection  we express our readiness and ourcommitment to assist the United Nations system inachieving the lofty goals enshrined in the Charter."
"149",6141,"SEN",58,2003,"﻿As a Vice-President at this session  Senegal  through me expresses to the President its heartfelt congratulationson his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth regular session. In thatelection  I see a mark of confidence and a tribute to hiswonderful country  Saint Lucia  but also to our entiresister community  the countries members of theCaribbean Community. He may therefore be assured ofSenegal's full cooperation in the exercise of hisimportant duties. Let me also express my sincerethanks to his predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan of the CzechRepublic  for the decisive results achieved during histerm of office.I should like to express my fraternal and friendlygreetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan and to tell him how proud I am of the spirit ofinitiative  commitment and resolve that he hasdisplayed with vigour and determination in his noblemission in the service of our common aspirations topeace  universalism and solidarity.It is precisely in the name of those shared idealsthat my country  Senegal  reaffirms once again itsfervent support for the readmission of the Republic ofChina on Taiwan as a full-fledged Member of theUnited Nations. By doing that   without calling intoquestion the participation and the legitimate status ofany other Member of the great United Nationsfamily   we would do justice to that country's 23million hard-working and disciplined inhabitants deeply attached to the values of peace  freedom anddemocracy enshrined in the Charter of the UnitedNations.Two years ago  on 11 September 2001  the worlddiscovered the new face of international terrorism right here and in all its horror. Certainly  other bloodyattacks have taken place  here and elsewhere  beforeand since those tragic events; even the United Nationshas not been spared. The attack that cost the life ofMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  High Commissioner forHuman Rights  and those of many other United Nationsstaff  is a sinister reminder that the terrorist threat isnow global in its targets and pernicious in its means ofaction. Indeed  a defender of human rights has beendeprived of the most basic human right: the rightto life.11Consequently  a collective  united  coordinatedresponse is required at all levels. In that spirit  Senegaltook the initiative on 17 October 2001 to call for anAfrican anti-terrorism summit with a view tostrengthening cooperation in that regard at thecontinental level  thus joining its efforts with theAlgiers Convention on the Prevention and Combatingof Terrorism. It is still our conviction that Africa mustnot remain the soft underbelly of the system that isgradually being established to combat internationalterrorism in all its forms  in the wake of the armedconflicts and the humanitarian tragedies that have beencausing bloodshed in the world.With regard to the situation in Africa  Senegalsalutes the significant progress achieved in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Liberia.Those two friendly countries  afflicted by so manyyears of civil war  seem at last to have embarked on thepath of negotiation and dialogue  an essential conditionfor a definitive return to peace. Moreover  Senegalwelcomes the Security Council's decision to send apeacekeeping force to Liberia in support of the troopsof the Economic Community of West African States(ECOWAS)  including the Senegalese troops already inplace.In the sisterly Republic of CÙte d'Ivoire  Senegalwelcomes the progress made in the nationalreconciliation process on the basis of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreements  in the hope that the incidentthat occurred two days ago will prove to be only ahitch. I encourage my Ivorian sisters and brothers topersevere on the path of reconciliation  cooperation andmutual confidence in order to safeguard that country'snational unity and territorial integrity with the help ofthe ECOWAS interposition force under Senegalesecommand.In many respects  sources of concern persist onthe continent  particularly in West Africa  formerlyknown for its stability. I am thinking in particular ofthose who would call into question democraticallyelected regimes. We must say forcefully that the timemust be past for coups d'Ètat in Africa. Everyone mustunderstand from now on that legitimate power  whosesole agent remains the people  cannot be acquired preserved or transferred except by means of the ballotbox   that is  through the force of law  not the law offorce or that of weapons.Senegal  for its part  is complying strictly withthe Declaration of Algiers of 1999  which enshrines theprinciple of excluding from the proceedings of theAfrican Union any regime established in violation ofinternal constitutional order. Last July  it was on thebasis of that Declaration and thanks to the vigorousreaction of African countries   including mine   thatconstitutional legality was re-established only a fewdays after a coup d'Ètat in Sao Tome and Principe. Thatexample   that precedent   should serve as a lessonto anyone who might yet be tempted by this practice which runs counter to democratic values.Only 10 days ago in Guinea-Bissau  ademocratically elected President was deposed by agroup of officers. As soon as I was informed of this  Icited the position of the African Union in calling forthe military to relinquish power. President Kufuor Chairman of the Economic Community of WestAfrican States; President Chissano  President of theAfrican Union; President Obasanjo of Nigeria; and Iimmediately took the situation in hand. This led to theestablishment of an entirely civilian Government. Fromthis rostrum  I should like to make a solemn appeal tothe international community. Guinea-Bissau  a fraternalcountry bordering on Senegal  needs immediateassistance. Only diligent and consistent economicassistance can create the conditions for a lasting returnto social peace and political and institutional stabilityin that country.As Chairman of the United Nations Committee onthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the PalestinianPeople  Senegal remains gravely concerned by thedeadlock in the peace process in the Middle East. Toomuch blood has been shed and too much sufferingendured in that land holy to the three great revealedreligions. And yet  one must face the fact that apeaceful solution is the sole  best guarantee of survivalfor all the peoples affected by daily death and anguish.We must pursue efforts to ensure a return to thenegotiating table on the basis of the relevantresolutions of the Security Council  the principle ofland for peace and the parameters established in theroad map so that  at last  this long nightmare can yieldto the oft-aborted dream of peoples who cherish peaceand freedom.However  if the words attributed to one Israeliauthority are well founded  my country would warnagainst any attack on the physical integrity of PresidentYasser Arafat and against any decision of expulsion.12Any such act would have incalculable consequences.Senegal rejects and condemns violence in all its forms regardless of who the victims and perpetrators may beor the reasons invoked  and reiterates its unfailingsupport for the establishment of an independent andsovereign Palestinian State within secure andinternationally recognized borders  just as we havealways recognized Israel's right to exist in the sameconditions. I have the feeling  however  that if weconfine ourselves to issuing statements without makingany real effort to find a concrete solution  the tragedythat is unfolding before our eyes in cycles of violencewill last a very long time.The Israeli and Palestinian authorities have askedme  without my seeking it  to help them to settle thisconflict  which is beginning to look like the ThirtyYears War or even the Hundred Years War. Thoseauthorities may recall simply that Senegal has resolvedfor itself one of the greatest contradictions of our time:the coexistence in one land of Muslims and Christians who live in a ratio of 95 per cent to 5 per cent in ourcountry. Christians  far from suffering from anydiscrimination  are fully integrated into national life  tothe extent that a Christian has been the President of ourRepublic for 20 years and supported by Muslims. Thatis why I myself have turned to great thinkers andtheoreticians on the issue of conflict to see if theirwords might be useful to us.A compatriot of Jacques Chirac  Mr. GastonBoutoul  invented the science of war and  moregenerally  of conflict known as polemology  theobjective of which is to understand  through scientificanalysis  the motivations and mechanisms of war andconflict. A sociological approach includes individualpsychology  collective and social psychology economics and the environment. I should like tosubscribe to this approach and  in the light of theIsraeli-Palestinian conflict  to make a modestcontribution.It seems to me that there are two possibleapproaches to the conflict: that of the aggressoraggressed' theory and that of the occupier occupied'theory. If we seek to identify who is in one categoryand who is in the other  we find ourselves in a completeimpasse. Unfortunately  that is what each of the partiesis doing. In the first scenario  Israelis and Palestinianseach claim to be the aggressed and accuse each other ofbeing the aggressor. In the second  while Israel isundeniably the occupier  it justifies this state of affairsby pointing to the so-called aggression of Palestinians.Hence  we return to the first theory and set in motionan endless cycle.Let us not play this game  which is one ofmassacre for the parties to the conflict and of hide-and-seek on our side  where political and diplomaticinterests cloud the search for an equitable solution.The aim of my proposal is to move beyond thesubjective approaches of the two parties by introducingexternal action  specifically on the part of theinternational community. Instead of pursuing thecourse of mutual accusation   which  it may be noted leads nowhere because each party is subjective   Iwould simply propose that we eliminate the twoproblems by merging them into a single  uniqueproblem. The dispatch of international forces to secureuncontested borders and the placing on stand-by'status of the parts of the territory on which there is noconsensus would eliminate de facto the two approachesof occupier occupied' and aggressor aggressed'. Ibelieve that this approach is all the more feasible andrealistic in that Israel has declared itself prepared toreturn all the occupied territories   90 per cent ofthem first and then negotiating a border correction tocompensate for the other 10 per cent. That would allowus to abandon the two theories  which can onlyeternally pit the two parties against each other anddivide the international community.The greatest war of all time  that of 1939-1945 pitted French against German. Today  they no longeragonize over the question of who was the aggressorand who the aggressed  or of who was the occupier andwho the occupied. All such issues have today beenconfined to history. All the parties have decided to joinefforts in a cooperative project: the European Union. Iwould ask  therefore: Can we not dream of a post-warperiod in which Israel and Palestine can embark on realcooperation to the benefit of their two peoples?As Members know  the Fifth MinisterialConference of the World Trade Organization ended inacknowledged failure just a few days ago in Cancun.Beyond that specific event  we need to reflect more indepth on the international trading system. There issomething paradoxical in this system based on a liberalphilosophy  but in which the rich countries spend over$1 billion a day in various subsidies for their ownagricultural sectors. This ruinous practice leads to thefreefall of the prices of our peasants' agricultural13commodities and threatens millions of jobs and thelives of over 2 billion human beings.The hypothetical mechanism of limiting theperverse effects of subsidies can in no way be acredible solution to the enormous damage done to thedeveloping countries. I believe that the time has comeradically to rethink the mechanisms of internationaltrade in order to break away from this implacable logicof injustice and inequity. In that context  I have takenthe initiative of proposing to convene  every two yearsin Senegal  an agricultural Davos' an agriculturalDakar  rather  to encourage thinking on a crediblealternative to the current system.It is indeed in no one's interest for the presentimbalances to persist  because they promote poverty favour unemployment and destitution  and fuel thefeelings of exclusion and despair that lead toextremism of all types. Once again  for us it is aquestion of calling not for assistance  but forthe implementation of a minimum level of fairness intrade   free trade  but fair trade.The challenges of globalization andinterdependence that it entails forces us to devise newapproaches that go beyond the obsolete assistancepolicies to create the conditions for a new kind ofpartnership  which alone is capable of breaking thevicious cycle of poverty. Senegal reiterates itscommitment to implementing the 2001-2010 BrusselsProgramme of Action for the Least DevelopedCountries and renews its support for the Office of theHigh Representative for the Least DevelopedCountries  whose activities deserve to be strengthenedby the donor community in the framework of a trustfund established for that purpose.The vision put forward by the New Partnershipfor Africa's Development (NEPAD) is also relevant tothe new kind of partnership just mentioned. For twoyears now  our continent has been carrying out a quietrevolution to firmly take its destiny in its own handsagainst the background of key factors such as peace stability  good governance in the public and privatesectors and regional cooperation. Specific plans havebeen developed and are available to all our partners.We have been learning as we go along  bycreating a gas pipeline in West Africa  for example which will supply along 600 kilometres 3 640 000cubic metres of gas starting from Nigeria to Benin Ghana and Togo. The electricity grids in southernAfrican that brings together the national electricitycompanies of 12 countries of the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community (SADC) is another exampleof Africa's will to pool our resources. Today NEPADhas designated 14 000 kilometres of roads and just asmany kilometres of railways to be laid  and this is oneof our top priorities. In the area of new information andcommunications technology  fibre optics now linkEurope and the United States to Dakar  Pretoria andKuala Lumpur  with connections extending inside thecontinent. Those specific examples fully show ourdetermination to make NEPAD a reality rather than agood intention or unrealistic plan.On a continent where everything still needs to bebuilt  it is not a matter of the need to identifyopportunities but rather to seize them. On the whole we are committed to creating an environment in whichthere will be a clear interest in investment and securebusiness operations. On a different order  the AfricanPeer Review Mechanism has been launched  andcolleagues before me have already spoken about it.Together with our partners  we are ready to fulfilthe goals of NEPAD. In a few days  some Africanheads of State will be in Tokyo to establish cooperativeties between Japan and Africa through the TokyoInternational Conference on African Development.In a report on the state of the internationalcommunity  the Secretary-General made an analysisthat sounded alarm bells: the world does not seem to besharing much anymore. The collective securitymachinery established by the Charter is alreadythreatened. The United Nations system inherited fromthe Second World War no longer sufficiently meets thechallenges of the twenty-first century. He thereforecalls for the implementation of reform  as spelled outin the Millennium Declaration.Let us explore together the guidelines that wereestablished by the Secretary-General. Let us make wayfor a culture of peace and dialogue among civilizations which bears the fertile seeds for consensus understanding and peaceful coexistence. Let us resistthe temptation of isolationism and rule of force  for asJean-Jacques Rousseau rightly said in The SocialContract': The strongest is never strong enough to bealways the master  unless he transforms strength intolaw  and obedience into duty.' Let us ensure that however diverse we may be  the universal values of14peace  freedom  democracy and respect for humanrights will always be safeguarded.I take this occasion to voice my support for theposition expressed by President Bush against theheinous sex trade and other forms of slavery. Instead ofvague  futile statements of intention  let us all agree toa realistic platform and guarantee that specificmeasures are taken. In that regard  we can justly raisequestions on the follow-up to commitments undertakenat the Monterrey International Conference onFinancing for Development.Concerning all these issues vital to humanity'ssurvival  the United Nations must  in accordance withthe Charter  ensure that its mission remain clearly insight  a mission that is a focal point at which ourefforts towards humanity's common goals areharmonized.I strongly believe that this need corresponds tothe legitimate aspirations of all the peoples whom werepresent here."
"150",6188,"SGP",58,2003,"﻿I would like tocongratulate Mr. Julian Hunte  the Foreign Minister ofSaint Lucia  on his election as the new President of theGeneral Assembly. Singapore is delighted that a fellowsmall island State and member of the Forum of SmallStates holds that office.I also join others in paying a tribute to UnitedNations personnel who have fallen victim to violenceor attacks  including a special tribute to the lateSergio Vieira de Mello. The terrorist attack that causedhis death has outraged the entire civilized world.Sergio dedicated his life  and ultimately gave his life in the service of the United Nations. He is mourned andmissed by his many friends around the world. We canbest honour his memory by reaffirming ourcommitment to the ideals that he served.The run-up to the war in Iraq saw a heated debateabout the role of the United Nations. The UnitedNations is  of course  no stranger to controversy  butthat debate was notable for being framed in particularlystark terms. The rhetoric was inflamed and inflated. Ithas been variously asserted  with glee or gloom  thatthe United Nations was irrelevant or irreplaceable  athreat to national sovereignty  the sole source ofinternational legitimacy  merely a tool of the remainingsuper-Power  or the only way to restrain that super-Power. There are indeed serious issues that requiredebate  but the simplistic manner in which that debatewas framed — in particular the portrayal of a strugglebetween unilateralism and multilateralism — is  in myview  unhelpful. Unfortunately  that rhetoric hasobscured  rather than clarified  the issue. It hasoversimplified the debate and glossed over the morecomplex reality. The danger is that we may believe inthe rhetoric and arrive at wrong conclusions about therelevance  or irrelevance  of the United Nations. I amtherefore joining that debate with some trepidation  andI do so only to highlight some of the complexities  inthe hope that it will contribute to a more balancedappraisal of the United Nations. I shall start byrestating some basics.In the 58 years since its formation  the influenceand role of the United Nations in world affairs hasalways flowed and ebbed in accordance with shiftinggeopolitical tides. The role of the United Nations hasbeen indispensable on some crucial internationalissues; on other occasions the United Nations has hadno role  or only a marginal role. If that meant that theUnited Nations was irrelevant  then it was irrelevantlong before the recent war in Iraq. The ability of theUnited Nations to act and the kinds of actions it tookhave always been contingent on how States  and in30particular the permanent members of the SecurityCouncil  perceived whether the United Nations servedtheir interests. But the United Nations and the UnitedNations system have always endured.Neither the variable fortunes nor the survival ofthe United Nations should surprise anyone. The UnitedNations functions in an international system consistingof sovereign States. Multilateralism and unilateralismwere never mutually exclusive alternatives; they aredifferent options in every State’s menu of policychoices. Few States  large or small  would agree toentrust their security or other vital national interestsentirely to a multilateral institution. On the other hand no State  however powerful  can always succeed inachieving its objectives without the help of others.Every State will choose the option that serves itsinterest best.Furthermore  the United Nations as a total systemis bigger than the General Assembly and the SecurityCouncil. As we debate the future of internationalorganizations we should not forget that the world hasnever been more interdependent  and therefore more inneed of global governance. The United Nations nowhas more than 190 Members and has never been closerto the ideal of universal participation. There has neverbeen a period in world history when there have beenmore international legal regimes and norms regulatingState behaviour. The Secretariat is the depository forover 500 international treaties covering the entirespectrum of global activities.International legal regimes and norms areimperfect in their efficiency and observance. Someinternational norms are hotly contested. Still  theconduct of international relations today does not takeplace in a vacuum  but within that framework of laws rules  standards and norms. Nevertheless  there is noescaping the fact that the maintenance of internationalpeace and security is first among the purposes of theUnited Nations  and the most contested andcontroversial of its roles. It is also the focus of thecurrent debate over Iraq. It is here that the rhetoricalexaggerations I mentioned earlier stand most in theway of clear and rational thinking about the strengthsand limitations of the United Nations.Traditional international law recognizes only twogrounds for the use of force: self-defence underArticle 51 of the Charter and authorization by theSecurity Council. That seeming clarity is deceptive.Even before the latest Iraq war  traditionalinterpretations of the Charter had been questioned. Thedoctrine of self-defence has long been the subject oflearned debate. The current controversy over the rightto pre-emption is only the latest manifestation. Thedoctrine of humanitarian intervention — or“responsibility to protect” — so boldly brought to thefore by Secretary-General Kofi Annan  has for severaldecades challenged the conventional concepts of non-intervention and the sovereign equality of States.Another challenge to traditional approaches hasbeen the threat posed by non-State actors  especiallythe contemporary menace posed by perpetrators ofinternational terrorism. The problem posed by rebelgroups in civil conflicts is another example.In its efforts to respond to egregious violations ofhuman rights  starvation  anarchy and chaos  theSecurity Council had already stretched both theauthority of the United Nations to intervene and thedefinition of “threats to the peace” and “aggression”.The war in Iraq was not the first time  and will not bethe last time  that the Security Council was unable toact. The hope of the late 1980s and early 1990s that theend of the cold war would at last enable the SecurityCouncil to discharge its primary responsibility for themaintenance of international peace and security haslong been shattered.In retrospect  Iraq’s invasion and annexation ofKuwait in 1990 represented an unusually clear-cutviolation of fundamental Charter principles. Thatgreatly eased the task of securing Security Councilauthorization for military action.But the consensus on Iraq was short-lived. By1994  France and Russia began to call for a road mapfor the lifting of sanctions. By 1998  the withdrawal ofthe United Nations Special Commission and OperationDesert Fox marked the end of the Security Council’sconsensus on Iraq. Thereafter the Security Councilacted in accordance with a complex balance ofprinciples and national interests  resulting ininconsistent and incoherent decisions. In the oil-for-food debates humanitarian concerns about theconsequences of sanctions were mixed with thecommercial and business interests of some of thepermanent members.That did not  however  make the Security Councilirrelevant. It merely meant that the Council served as aforum for managing competing interests  an important31role that it has played for all its history. After all  whileSecurity Council resolutions have the force of law  theyare  at the end of the day  first and foremost politicaldocuments indicating the degree of consensus that canbe achieved among its most powerful members at anyone time.I do not think that it is self-evident that the 2002-2003 clash of interests over Iraq was qualitativelydifferent from the differences between the permanentmembers during the previous decade. I do not thinkthat the disagreement over Iraq has permanentlydamaged the United Nations.The 2002-2003 crisis over Iraq in the SecurityCouncil only underscored what we have known allalong  namely  that the Security Council can authorizeintervention only when the permanent members are inagreement  and that all States  big and small  will dowhat they must to protect their vital national interests.This is not the occasion to revisit old debates overwhether the war in Iraq was authorized on the basis ofa continuity of authority from 1990 to 2003. Certainly as resolution 1441 (2002) recognized  Iraq had been inmaterial breach of several resolutions. My point is that whatever its eventual outcome  the intense diplomaticeffort to secure another explicit resolution for the useof force was itself testimony to the importance attachedby all to the Security Council’s legitimizing role. InMay  only weeks after a formal end to major combatoperations was declared  resolution 1483 (2003) wasadopted without any dissenting vote  recognizing thatthe United Nations had a significant role in post-warIraq.More balanced views are now beginning toemerge  albeit still tainted by the bitterness of thedebates in the run-up to the war. It will be some timebefore consensus can be reached on the role of theUnited Nations in post-war Iraq. Some are loath togrant ex post facto legitimization of military action. Atthe same time  there is reluctance to cede power wonwith blood. But the legitimacy that the United Nationsbrings is unique.The debate on the role of the United Nations willcontinue. It can  and should  go on. But that does notmean that the United Nations should be in paralysis.We must at the same time press on with ourcommitment to fulfil the fundamental purposes of theUnited Nations  which  as stated in the Charter  are “Tomaintain international peace and security”  “To developfriendly relations among nations” and “To achieveinternational cooperation”.The starting point for that effort must beacceptance of the fact that  while the United Nationsstands for ideals that we must never relinquish  thereality is that the United Nations both reflects andshapes geopolitics. Underlying the debates in the run-up to the war  and still infusing the controversies  isacute uneasiness over the distribution of power in thepost-cold war international system. But can the UnitedNations escape that reality? The fact is that the UnitedNations can operate only on the basis of a hard-headedappreciation of the realities of power. If we allowexaggerated rhetoric about the role of the UnitedNations to obscure that fact  then we do the UnitedNations a disservice.The Charter of the United Nations has remainedessentially unchanged since 1945. But it has beencontinuously interpreted and re-interpreted to meetchanging geopolitical circumstances and newchallenges  many of which were unforeseen by thefounders of the United Nations.Today we are again faced with radically newthreats  not least of which are the global terroristnetworks that respect neither national boundaries nortraditional international law. Clearly  the UnitedNations needs to fashion new and more flexible rules todeal with these new threats. Yet  at the same time  wemust continue to ensure that there are adequatesafeguards to prevent abuse or a return to the law of thejungle.Finding the right balance between those equallyurgent imperatives will not be easy. But it is notimpossible  if we can find the discipline to debate theissues openly and realistically  with a clearappreciation of both the limitations and potential of theUnited Nations.Recent events in Iraq have shown that the UnitedStates needs the United Nations. It is also a fact thatthe United Nations needs the United States. Since thereis a convergence of interests for the two to cooperate inorder to achieve our shared interests and objectives  itis surely not impossible for us to negotiate and agreeupon a new paradigm of cooperation between theworld’s sole super-Power and the world’s only  andindispensable  United Nations.32The United Nations is not a panacea for all theworld’s ills. Neither is the United Nations a globalvillain. The United Nations is a political institution.Politics  as is often said  is the art of the possible.There is no need  therefore  to succumb to despair orcynicism. We should turn the page and move on."
"151",6221,"SLB",58,2003,"﻿I present the warmwishes of the Government and people of SolomonIslands on the election of Mr. Julian Hunte as Presidentof the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Ialso offer gratitude to his predecessor for presidingover the last session.And we salute the Secretary-General for his boldleadership of our Organization. Through him  SolomonIslands wishes to pay tribute to the members of theUnited Nations staff and others who lost their livesduring the senseless attack on the United Nations officein Baghdad last August and the recent incident a fewdays ago.Fifty-eight years ago  the United Nations wasfounded to  among others things  guarantee freedom peace and security and to promote economic and socialadvancement to all people. Over the years  manythreats to international peace and security have recededor been resolved. The cold war has ended. Security andarms control regimes are in place. Institutions such asthe World Bank  the International Monetary Fund andothers have been established to address the economicand social dimension of humankind’s needs.In spite of these significant achievements  peace security and our quest for sustained economic andsocial development remain the main challenges of ourtime. New and complex threats to international peaceand security have emerged at alarming and globalscales during the past decades.International terrorism continues unabated indifferent parts of the world  targeting and killingmainly innocent and vulnerable civilians. There can beno other option but for the international community toredouble efforts to fight this evil menace on all fronts.Solomon Islands remains committed to its obligationsunder Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). Stepsare being taken to enact relevant legislation and toaccede to international conventions to counter terroristactivities.Solomon Islands believes that a lasting settlementof the crisis in the Middle East will have positive15effects on global peace and security. We thereforesupport the efforts to bring lasting peace and stabilityto the region  especially to the Israeli-Palestinianconflict and the situation in Iraq. The United Nationsmust play a crucial role in the Middle East peaceprocess.The primary responsibility of addressing thedaunting challenges we face today lies with individualcountries. However  history proves that much morecould be effectively achieved through multilateralism.We all agree that this era of globalization brings newglobal challenges. And global challenges requirecooperative global solutions. The United Nations  asthe leading and legitimate multilateral institution  musttake equal responsibility in addressing the globalchallenges we now face and must therefore bestrengthened.This is why Solomon Islands supports theSecretary-General’s ongoing reform of the UnitedNations system as a process  not an event. Yes  thereform process has achieved positive results andgreater transparency  but we need to do more if ourOrganization is to remain effective and relevant to thechanging political environment.A reformed and restructured Security Council isalso necessary. Japan  Germany and others deservepermanent membership in the Council. They areequally capable of contributing constructively toachieving and maintaining international peace andsecurity. The use of veto power by the permanentmembers should be restricted to the provisions ofChapter VII of the United Nations Charter.Restoring law and order  economic recovery andsimply bringing normalcy to Solomon Islands havebeen difficult challenges which my Government facedwhen we took office in December 2001. But havingmade the commitment to address these challengesthrough the Government’s strategic plan and priorities we have engaged ourselves in a series of dialogues andconsultations with our development partners. Ourintentions are clear — we want outside assistance torestore law and order and economic recovery.Last July  with unanimous bipartisan support  theSolomon Islands National Parliament adopted enablinglegislation that authorized outside assistance to restorelaw and to help the economy to recover. Following anexplicit invitation by the Government  the RegionalAssistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI)led by Australia  was assembled and deployed underthe auspices of the Pacific Islands Forum’s BiketawaDeclaration and in accordance with the provisions ofthe United Nations Charter.I am pleased to inform you that the immediateimpacts of RAMSI have been significant and positive.Security in terms of law and order has been re-established and the Government’s finances arebeginning to stabilize. The course of action throughRAMSI is the best option we took. It is a uniqueregional cooperative and partnership arrangement thatis not merely limited to re-establishing and maintainingpeace and security. It accords Solomon Islanders thebest real opportunity to rebuild the country and addressthe deep-rooted problems we have had for years including fighting corruption  restoring the principlesof democracy  good governance and respect forfundamental human values and rejuvenating the socialcohesiveness of our people.RAMSI’s work ahead will be challenging  but weassure RAMSI of every support and cooperation. TheGovernment and the people of the Solomon Islands areequally committed to achieving this common objective.We deeply appreciate the overwhelming supportof the Pacific Islands Forum countries  expressedthrough the Forum Declaration on the Solomon Islands the Forum Foreign Affairs Ministerial Statement andtheir active contribution as Participating Countries inthe Regional Assistance Mission to the SolomonIslands (RAMSI). These countries are committed intheir resolve to help a neighbour recover and rebuild.For this  I say “Tagio tumas for helpem fren blongiufala”.We also appreciate the support RAMSI hasreceived from the wider international community  theCommonwealth  the United Nations  the EuropeanUnion and other individual bilateral donor partners. Welook forward to more active support to complement theimportant work RAMSI is doing in addressing theimmediate and long-term objectives and plans.The Government’s National Economic Recoveryand Development Plan of 2003 to 2005 will beformally presented to our development partners inNovember. Our immediate objectives are to restore andmaintain law and order  to bring about macroeconomicNote: Solomon Islands pidgin for: “Thank you for helping yourfriend”.16stability and income growth  to restore full services inhealth and education and to re-establish the foundationfor sustained economic growth and humandevelopment.While the immediate security situation andeconomic situation of the country are being addressedby RAMSI  the planned November meeting willprovide the opportunity for the rest of our developmentpartners to define their respective roles and assistancetowards achieving these key objectives.As a least developed and island State  oureconomic  social and environmental vulnerabilities aremajor constraints to achieving sustainable economicgrowth and livelihoods. But we place our hope ongreater international support and partnership to addressthese constraints in order to meaningfully andsuccessfully implement our national development plansand such key policy outcomes as the 2000 MillenniumDevelopment Goals  the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment (WSSD) Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation and other programmes within thedevelopment agenda of the United Nations.Implementation of the 2000 MillenniumDevelopment Goals has been slow. We have  however now incorporated those objectives into theGovernment’s Economic Recovery and DevelopmentPlan of 2003 to 2005  as priorities for nationalimplementation.The Solomon Islands looks forward toparticipating fully in the review process of theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. Weenvisage the outcome of the 2004 international meetingin Mauritius to be one that will focus on realcommitments and practical implementations of theProgramme at the national and regional levels.The Brussels Programme of Action for the LeastDeveloped Countries (LDCs) provides yet anotheropportunity and dimension for addressing the pressingproblems facing poor countries. Implementation of thisProgramme at the national level has been slow. Realcommitments from the international community toaddress our constraints  including capacity andindebtedness  have  however  not been forthcomingeither.We commend the work of the HighRepresentative of the Office for the Least DevelopedCountries in seeking international support andcommitment to implement the Programme. We furthercall on the international community to seriouslyconsider more resolute measures  such as cancellationof debts to highly indebted poor countries.As a member of the World Trade Organization(WTO)  the Solomon Islands is equally concerned thatthe Cancún meeting failed to yield positive results.Like other least developed countries  we have a keyinterest in the development dimension of the DohaRound  and we wish to re-echo what we stated inCancún  namely that a new  equitable and fair tradingsystem must take into account issues such as thedifference in income  economic size  technologicaldevelopment and private sector capacities of countries.The Solomon Islands attaches great importance toregional cooperation. The communiqué of the leadersof the Pacific Islands Forum last August  which hasbeen made available as an official document of thefifty-eighth session of the United Nations GeneralAssembly  reflects the range of issues that directlyconcern us in the Pacific region. Those issues includeclimate change and sea-level rise  fisheries and theprotection of our marine environment  trade sustainable development and security-related issues. Assmall States with inherent geographical and structuraldisadvantages  our strength lies in pooling ourresources to address these issues collectively. We callupon the United Nations to take more active part inregional initiatives.Allow me at this juncture to express once moreour strong support for Taiwan to be admitted as a fullmember of the United Nations. It is an undeniable factthat under international law  Taiwan is a sovereignstate. It has a transparent and democratic politicalsystem  a vibrant and progressive economy and ahighly efficient social system  all of which arecompletely independent with no control whatsoeverexercised by the People’s Republic of China.Taiwan is a willing partner  able to meet itsinternational obligations under the Charter. Itscontribution to the international community and theglobal economy are well known. Yet only a fortnightago  this body once again denied the wishes of thepeople of Taiwan to be considered for membership inthe United Nations. Over the years the internationalcommunity has discriminated against its 23 millionpeople. The delayed World Health Organization17assistance to Taiwan during the outbreak of severeacute respiratory syndrome early this year is anexample of how reasons of power politics prevail overtimely humanitarian assistance.I have made the assertion that the United Nationsmust remain relevant to the changing politicalenvironment. It must live up to the fundamental valuesand principles enshrined in its Charter. It must remain auniversal and all-inclusive Organization  capable ofserving all its Members  however big or small  howeverpowerful or weak and of whatever creed  religion orpolitical belief. Every country must be treated withequal respect and attention. The United Nations mustalso live up to its principle of equality of all nations inthis new millennium."
"152",6267,"SLE",58,2003,"﻿My delegationwishes to congratulate you very warmly  Mr. President on your assumption of the presidency of the worldbody  and to assure you of its unflinching andcontinued support for a successful tenure. We wouldalso like to extend our appreciation to your predecessorfor successfully directing the affairs of the GeneralAssembly during one of the most trying periods in therecent history of the United Nations.On 19 August 2003  the United Nations wasshocked to its foundations by a fatal bomb attack on itsheadquarters in Baghdad. On behalf of my Presidentand the Government and people of Sierra Leone  I extendour deepest condolences to the United Nations Secretary-General  the United Nations family and the families of allthose who perished in that attack. They died for the causeof peace and humanity and for the values andaspirations that the United Nations symbolizes.We call on all members of the United Nations andon other nations to spare no measures to respect thesanctity of the United Nations  because it is only whenthat sanctity is respected that the United Nations canfulfil its responsibilities to mankind.The majority of the world's poor and deprivedpeople live in Africa  bedevilled by hunger  disease mass illiteracy  ignorance  civil conflict  extremepoverty  bad governance  abuses of human rights inadequate educational opportunities  genderinequality  environmental hazards  poor transport andcommunications facilities and debt. The NewPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)embodies the vision of Africans themselves to rid theircontinent of those perils and to enjoy a standard ofliving befitting the twenty-first century. Those goalsare also in consonance with the MillenniumDevelopment Goals of the Millennium Declaration. Mydelegation believes that the world will be a better happier  more tolerant and peaceful place if the goalsof those two impressive declarations are attained.We also believe that to achieve those goals  wehave to come down from the lofty platform of rhetoricto the practical reality of sincere  honest and sacrificialpartnership and collaboration between the haves andthe have-nots. Tangible result is the acid-test of the20 sincerity and honesty of that partnership andcollaboration. My delegation wishes to reaffirm SierraLeone's commitment to the pursuance of the goals ofthose two development blueprints as the most credibleand realistic channels of  and guidelines for accelerated development.But we  the poor countries  execute thoselaudable blueprints with great trepidation  because ofthe devastating effect of the dreadful HIV/AIDSepidemic  which  without universal effort  is bound tocancel out  and even reverse  all development gains. Inthe light of that  my delegation proposes thatantiretroviral drugs be made available as a matter ofhuman right to everyone everywhere who may need it.Sierra Leone has in recent years repeatedlyreiterated its faith in the United Nations as the onlyOrganization that can hold the crisis-ridden worldtogether. My delegation wishes to reaffirm that faith which is built on the conviction that collective action isthe strength of the Organization. As we are all aware deviating from the principle of collective action cansubject the United Nations to tremendous strain; it caneven hamstring the Organization  leaving us a weakand divided family. My delegation calls upon allnations   big and small  rich and poor   to upholdthat principle as the Organization's driving force.The unity of purpose and collective action of theUnited Nations are even more imperative in the contextof the ever-increasing demands placed upon it by thenumerous conflicts and humanitarian crises to which ithas to respond. The expansion and complexity of thosechallenges reinforce the need for collaboration andpartnership with continental and regional organizationssuch as the African Union and the Economic Communityof West African States (ECOWAS) to resolve crises. It isthe considered view of my delegation that suchcollaboration and partnership  designed and financiallyand materially facilitated  can respond to conflicts andother crises much more speedily and productively thancan a distant and overstretched United Nations alone.We are of the firm conviction that the hundreds ofthousands of lives that have been lost in the WestAfrican subregion  especially in Sierra Leone and Liberia would have been saved if such a functional relationship predicated on proactive conflict prevention  had existedbetween the United Nations and ECOWAS.Two of the most worrying challenges to peace areterrorism and the proliferation of arms  includingweapons of mass destruction. We unreservedly deploreterrorism in all its forms and manifestations  and wereaffirm our commitment to resolving differences andconflicts through non-violent means. The proliferationof small arms in the West African subregion is ofspecial concern to Sierra Leone. While a multi-prongedstrategy to rid the country of small weapons  includingan arms-for-development project spearheaded by theUnited Nations Development Programme  has yieldedencouraging and hopeful results  we believe that only aconcerted regional approach that includes genuine andselfless political will can eliminate that scourge fromthe region.The Government and people of Sierra Leone haveaccepted the challenge to recover from the scourge ofthe war and to rejoin the path of development.Accordingly  a comprehensive national recoveryprogramme has been designed to respond to post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction needs and tolay the foundations to address the issues that generatedthe conflict.A priority component of the recovery process isthe consolidation of democratic governance.Preparations for nation-wide local governmentelections are in the ultimate stages. We attachconsiderable significance to those elections  becausethey will constitute a major step in the process ofdecentralization  around which the scheme of ourparticipatory governance is going to revolve.In order to tackle some of the root causes thatcreated the wedge between the people and successiveGovernments  which partly caused the conflict  wehave embarked on a fundamental governance reformprogramme that involves the judiciary  public service human rights  accountability and transparency  localgovernment and tackling corruption and abuse of power.We have made remarkable progress in the area ofsecurity  which is the prerequisite for our nationalrevival and development. An international militaryadvisory and training team led by the United Kingdomhas provided training that has considerably enhancedthe professional competence of our armed forces. Withthat training has come renewed confidence in thearmed forces  as indicated by the nationwidedeployment of personnel. With support from theGovernment of the United Kingdom  our police forcehas also been trained  restructured and equipped tocarry out its responsibilities. But with war anywhere in21 the subregion  Sierra Leone never feels safe and secure.That is why we welcome  with profound appreciationto ECOWAS and the United Nations  the initiative toput the region on a path to peace.While welcoming the relief provided by positivedevelopments in the Liberian peace process  mydelegation feels that we are duty bound to urge theinternational community to never again fall intocomplacency about conflicts  as it did in the case ofLiberia.My delegation is very conscious of the heavyinvestment of the United Nations and the internationalcommunity  which has yielded the peace Sierra Leonenow enjoys. The momentum to consolidate the hard-won peace and embark on a meaningful course ofdevelopment is our highest priority. That is why wewhole-heartedly welcome the Security Council'sprogramme for the phased withdrawal of the UnitedNations Mission in Sierra Leone  which is based on thecapacity of our security forces to discharge theirfunctions and on the overall security environment inSierra Leone and the subregion.I am happy to report that the re-establishment ofcivil authority throughout the country has been one ofour major post-conflict accomplishments. Legal andjudicial law-enforcement administrations have beenreactivated in parts of the country that were previouslyunder rebel occupation  and schools and healthfacilities  along with better social facilities  are beingrehabilitated and reopened.On the economic front  the certificate of originregime for the export of diamonds is producingpositive results  as proceeds from the sale of diamondscontinue to rise steadily. New areas of alluvial diamonddeposits have been discovered  and prospecting forkimberlite deposits continues. Various regulatoryprocedures  including legislation and expert advice  arein the pipeline to curtail illegal exploitation and toensure that Sierra Leoneans derive the benefit theydeserve from that resource.Two transitional bodies   the Special Court totry those who bear the greatest responsibility for thehuman rights excesses in the war  and the Truth andReconciliation Commission that was set up for victimsand perpetrators of abuses to tell their stories  therebylaying the foundation for healing  reconciliation andforgiveness   are on course to achieve theirobjectives.The future of 57 000 ex-combatants is a majorfactor in the management of the costly peace that is sorelished today in Sierra Leone. The process of re-absorbing those people into society as law-abiding peaceful  productive and patriotic citizens has beenslow  tedious and expensive. But we have had toattempt that character transformation exercise as aconflict-relapse prevention mechanism. With thatreorientation  our governance reform programme andour sound youth policy  which makes ex-combatantsand other young people stakeholders in society  thepossibility of resorting to violence and destruction asthe only way to vent grievances and resolve conflicthas been reduced.Our other area of grave concern is the welfare ofthe hundreds of thousands of children who missedopportunities for education because of the war. Themagnitude of the problem is such that we have had toform a special commission for war-affected children.Let me conclude by reassuring the United Nationsthat the heavy investment in peace in Sierra Leone hasnot gone  and will never go  in vain. We are determinedto do whatever we can to protect and consolidate thepeace for which we have all sacrificed so much. Wefully recognize our responsibility as the model ofsuccess for United Nations peacekeeping. We wish togive the same reassurances to our many friends fortheir wonderful contributions in various forms over theyears. Those include the British  Chinese  American Nigerian and Guinean Governments and the EuropeanUnion."
"153",6314,"SLV",58,2003,"﻿Before addressing the pressing issues before theinternational community and expressing our positionon the issues that have been discussed here  I wouldlike to begin by referring to the concrete example ofmy own country.On 6 January 2003  the people and Governmentof El Salvador received an official communicationfrom the Secretary-General informing us of thecompletion of the verification function of the UnitedNations vis-à-vis the Peace Agreement that ended 13years of war in our country. Eleven years have elapsedsince that historic Peace Agreement put an end to anarmed conflict that had been destroying our country forover a decade.Before the war we were a poor country. Sixty-percent of our fellow citizens lived under the poverty line.Our country has also been dealt a harsh blow by nature.Every generation of Salvadorans has had to rebuildtheir lives due to the fact that  throughout our history there has never been a twenty-five-year period withoutthe occurrence of a natural disaster of enormousproportions. We are also an overpopulated country with over 6 million inhabitants sharing 21 000 squarekilometres. That makes us one of the most denselypopulated countries of the American continent. Beingcompletely dependant on agriculture  fluctuations inthe prices of coffee and sugar have always determinedour prospects for development.A little over a decade ago we stood no chance ofmeeting our financial commitments. Our debts farexceeded our ability to pay. Poor  small  overpopulated indebted  dependent upon agriculture  afflicted bynatural disasters and immersed in a widespread armedconflict  El Salvador appeared not to have a futurebarely 12 years ago. Violence  coupled with the harshrealities of underdevelopment  appeared to havedoomed us to a vicious circle devoid of hope.We are a different country today. We view thefuture with confidence  for we have discovered ourcapacities. In just 12 years we have reduced poverty byhalf  from 60 per cent of our population  in 1991  to 33per cent today. Over 30 per cent of our population hadbeen living in extreme poverty. Today only half asmany  15 per cent  live in that distressing situation. Ourefforts have had a direct impact on the standard ofliving of all of our citizens. Twelve years ago 25 percent of Salvadorans did not know how to read or write.That figure is only 13 per cent today. The childmortality rate  which had been at 45 per thousandbirths  stands at 25 per thousand today.We have accomplished all that by dedicatingourselves to the most pressing needs of our people. Inorder to connect our most isolated towns  we have builtone kilometre of road every day for the last four years.We have also built three schools every day in the sameperiod  so as to educate our poorest children. Similarly 11we have built 106 houses every day for low-incomefamilies. And every five days we have built a newhealth centre.Having once been completely dependent onagriculture  today we rank number 3  out of 24 LatinAmerican countries  in terms of export growth. Duringthe difficult decade of the 1990s we managed to growat a much faster rate than our region at large. We havenow become the second-ranking country in LatinAmerica in economic growth.Despite the immense burden posed byreconstruction after the earthquakes of 2001  year afteryear we have reduced our budget deficit  bringing it tounder 1 per cent in 2004. This has allowed us to controlinflation  lowering it from 30 per cent to 2 per cent thisyear  and thus to avoid a decline in family income. Wehave zero risk of devaluation and today  after havingseen interest rates of 30 per cent  we have the lowestbank interest rates of our region — 6.8 per cent. For 11years now  we have had no fluctuation in exchangerates  allowing us to acquire a rate of investment that ismatched in Latin America only by Chile  Mexico andmy country.The living conditions of Salvadorans havechanged considerably. Rates of unemployment havefallen from 13 per cent to 6.8 per cent. Having hadonly 250 000 telephone lines in 1992  we now have 1.6million. It is less expensive to make a telephone callfrom El Salvador to United Nations Headquarters thanit is from Headquarters to El Salvador. In just over adecade  the number of automobiles has grown by afactor of four. We have managed to increase the supplyof drinking water and electrification in rural areas by50 per cent. We have achieved peace. We have devotedour energies to economic development and ourresources to the poorest among us.I have elaborated on developments in my countryin recent years because it seems to me that we in ElSalvador have discovered an effective way not only ofresolving violent conflict  but also of combatingpoverty. Such means  which the internationalcommunity is seeking to confront the complexities ofour world  are based on universally valid principles.Thus  to understand the case of El Salvador is tounderstand new possibilities for other nations andsolutions to other problems.The two most important challenges for a nationare learning how to live and understanding why we arealive. The former is an entirely practical matter requiring knowledge of the workings of the modernworld — how it works and what opportunities areavailable to a poor country in a world that is rapidlyevolving. The second is an entirely abstract matter  butit is all the more important for that  because only whenwe are clear about the meaning of our shared lives canwe develop a sense of purpose that allows us tochannel the energies of a community towards a nationalobjective.It is a paradox rich in significance that weSalvadorans  in order to find our commitment to thefuture  had to delve into the traditions that gave us ouridentity in the past. When we found ourselves in thedead end of war  we had to rethink our destiny. In spiteof our suffering  we had all the resources we needed tomove ahead: talent  energy  experience  faith and will.We had the prudence to avoid future dangers and thecourage to confront present challenges.The basic principle on which we have built ourcountry is that every Salvadoran has access to the truth.In every part of our land  it is possible for everySalvadoran to speak out  to express himself or herselfwithout any constraint based on status. It is on the basisof the views of our compatriots that we have built thenew El Salvador. We decided that  if this were tobecome a reality  three principles were needed:freedom  justice and the inalienable right to life. Theconcrete manifestations of these values are democracy economic freedom and the rule of law. This applies notonly to El Salvador and Salvadorans  but equally to allthe inhabitants of our world. Every human being hasaccess to the truth. It is in the human capacity forreason that we find our moral potential. That is why wemust be free.At a time when we wonder about the role of theUnited Nations  we must recall that the Organizationwas born to ensure those fundamental rights. Thisforum cannot be paralysed in debates when freeing anation from tyranny is at issue. We must all act in theface of oppression. Terrorism is a negation of all thevalues we share. We need a consensus on the valuesthat unite us and a renewed will for action.We can debate interminably here the issue of Iraqand the current circumstances of the Iraqi people  butwhat brooks no debate is the fact that this forum hasnot acted in a way commensurate with the demands ofan increasingly complex world. The United Nations12must be rethought and restructured so that it can meetthe objectives for which it was created.We Salvadorans speak with the solidity that wehave gained from having fully shouldered ourresponsibilities towards the international community.We are participants in the reconstruction of Iraq. Wespeak with the legitimacy of having been ourselves thebattleground of the last conflict of the cold war and weunderstand how the mediation of the internationalcommunity can help to find a solution to a conflict andgive hope to a desperate nation.In conclusion  we wish to express our sorrow atthe death of United Nations staff members in Baghdad.We reaffirm the right of all nations to have a voice inthis forum. The absence of the Republic of China in thedeliberations of this forum represents a rejection of thelegitimate aspirations of a nation that should speak inits own voice  just as we do  in this body and thecommunity of nations.The liberator of the Americas summarized  inwords far more eloquent than mine  the values thatmust inspire this forum and our discussions here. Hesaid:“Peoples  no one can take possession ofyour sovereignty  unless it be violently andillegitimately. Flee that country where one personalone seeks to exercise all powers. That will be acountry of slaves.”"
"154",6339,"SMR",58,2003,"﻿On behalf ofthe Government of the Republic of San Marino  let mecongratulate Mr. Julian Hunte on his election to thepresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. His election brings us great satisfactionsince he also represents a small country  Saint Lucia like ours.I also wish to express my country’s appreciationfor the fruitful work and remarkable abilities of formerAssembly President Jan Kavan. It has been a privilegefor us to cooperate with him.I cannot start my speech without mentioning thecowardly attacks on the United Nations offices inBaghdad  which took a heavy toll of lives includingthat of Sergio Vieira de Mello  Special Representativeof the United Nations Secretary-General in Iraq.On behalf of the Government and people of SanMarino  I take this opportunity to reiterate our mostsincere condolences to the Secretary-General and thefamilies of the victims. Furthermore  we would like toexpress our deep appreciation to the United Nations forthe fundamental role it is playing in Iraq during thisdifficult transition period for the Iraqi people. Thenecessary conditions for social and economicdevelopment will be established only through securityand stability  independence and democracy  the rule oflaw and respect for human rights.In light of the above  I wish to express the hopethat the transitional Iraqi Governing Council welcomed and supported by the Security Council  mayoperate efficiently so that Iraq can fully enjoy its rightto self-determination  its own sovereignty and establisha democratic and representative Government internationally recognized and able to guarantee theconditions necessary for the country’s reconstruction.We also hope that the United Nations may furtherstrengthen its active humanitarian and civil role infavour of the Iraqi population  so as to contribute to therebirth of that nation through democracy anddevelopment. We hope that all countries cooperating inIraq to improve security and order  under the aegis ofthe United States of America  after assuring a decisivecontribution to the liberation of the country from theprevious regime  will reach an agreement with thisOrganization.To this end  the drafting of a new SecurityCouncil resolution  the outcome of a lively debate thatis going on now  would be a major political anddiplomatic achievement. It would definitely pave theway to democracy and progress in Iraq and embody thewill of many different Governments under the aegis ofthe United Nations.29In line with its tradition of solidarity  and asdemonstrated in recent years through its support ofhumanitarian projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina Kosovo  the Middle East and in several Africancountries  often in the context of ad hoc programmesand United Nations special missions  my country willbe pleased to contribute to the reconstruction process inIraq. For the achievement of this objective  theforthcoming conference on the reconstruction of Iraq isparticularly interesting.The tragic  painful and unforgettable events of 11September 2001 have also marked the proliferation ofinternational terrorism and the escalation of terroristattacks.Today’s gathering in this important forum is aclear indication of our country’s position and itssignificance is increased by the universal character ofthis meeting.The creation of the United Nations nearly 60years ago  at the end of Second World War  attested toa unanimous desire for lasting peace and justice. Ibelieve that at the beginning of the third millennium itis the responsibility of the Organization to reflecteffectively the will of States to fulfil that originalcommitment and keep its original spirit alive throughdialogue  mediation and cooperation. Conscious of this San Marino reaffirms its decision to reject all forms ofterrorism and to contribute fully to its defeat  astestified to by the Republic’s accession to severalinternational instruments of the United Nations andEuropean organizations.Likewise  San Marino has promptly followed up onSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and will continueto monitor terrorism at the national level  as can be notedby the implementation of the guidelines to combat thephenomenon of terrorism and its related aspects.Unfortunately  it is evident that terrorism  asidefrom being inspired by fanaticism and fundamentalism is too often linked to underdevelopment and injustice;their victims can  in turn  become instruments ofviolence and oppression. However  terrorism can alsobe countered through the active support of internationalcooperation programmes to overcome disparities poverty  discrimination  the violation of the rights ofindividuals and peoples  a total absence of opportunities and  as a result  hopelessness  in particular among theyoung  who are the future of mankind.Our collective efforts to restore favourableconditions for dialogue and mutual acceptance mustnot be weakened by the growing concern of persistent serious obstacles to the road map for peace in theMiddle East  where negotiations and agreements arebeing jeopardized by renewed terrorist attacks  hatredand retaliation. We are convinced that the Israeli andPalestinian peoples must be ensured the indisputableright to live freely in their own territory  where theycan exercise their full sovereignty in security and peace.The success of the globalization process underway will ultimately depend on achieving peace anddevelopment for all. Within the framework of effectiveglobal cooperation  the role played by San Marino isinextricably linked to its tradition of freedom independence and democracy. Those principles  whichhave characterized the Republic’s 1700 years of existence continue to inspire its international policy today.In 1854 San Marino became the first Europeancountry to ban the death penalty. My country believesthat this issue  which is so important and topical  mustremain a top priority for the General Assembly  eventhough it is not on the agenda for this session.In the field of human rights  the ethics ofdiversity requires the acceptance of the humancondition. In that spirit  San Marino has followed withspecial attention the negotiations within the workinggroup for the drafting of an international convention onthe rights of persons with disabilities.San Marino continues to pay great attention to thefollow-up given to initiatives on HIV/AIDS beingcarried out by the United Nations and to the search foradequate responses so as to prevent the spread of newepidemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS). San Marino is also following with greatinterest the work of the working group for the draftingof an international convention against the reproductivecloning of human beings  spurred by the convictionthat the cloning of human beings is an immoral andinhuman degeneration of biotechnological developmentand that such an abhorrent practice would be contraryto human dignity. The important ethical and moralimplications of this issue cannot be separated frompurely scientific questions. We hope that the UnitedNations will continue to strive for the protection of thefundamental rights of human beings.Additionally  in the area of human rights  SanMarino recently extended a standing invitation to the30Office of the United Nations High Commissioner forHuman Rights to visit the Republic whenevernecessary in order better to carry out its mandate.I wish to recall that San Marino was the firstWestern European country to ratify the Statute of theInternational Criminal Court  confident that the Courtwould satisfy the widespread desire for justice and putan end to impunity for the perpetrators of the mostserious crimes against the international community as awhole. Let me also express our best wishes to theCourt  which is composed of authoritative judges  andconvey our hope that it will now be able to work inaccordance with the objectives of justice  security andpeace on which it is based. We are confident its workwill be fruitful and that it will always act independentlyand impartially.All the objectives set out in the MillenniumDeclaration could be achieved if an additional $50 billionper year were granted for development assistance  at atime when global military expenditures total $850 billion.We also wish to express our appreciation for the positiveachievements of United Nations peacekeeping missionsdeployed to many areas of the world afflicted byconflicts. Such results should encourage Governmentsto increase their support for those missions  whichpromote lasting  sustainable peace and the re-establishment of democracy and the rule of law.San Marino will continue to participate in jointaction for the total elimination of anti-personnel mines.In that context  San Marino urges countries that havenot yet done so to accede to the Ottawa Convention.The tenth anniversary of the International Year ofthe Family in 2004 will provide further incentive toreflect on and analyse the living conditions of ourpopulations  paying particular attention to children  theelderly and the most vulnerable in our societies. Suchgroups deserve greater consideration from society.Society must promote effective projects for education solidarity and adequate support.Only a few days ago  the United NationsCommittee on the Rights of the Child reviewed SanMarino’s initial report on its implementation of theprovisions of the Convention on the Rights of theChild. The relevant measures now in force will soon besupplemented by new ones in support of the family.In underlining the validity of the reformprogramme started by the Secretary-General  we deemit necessary to continue efforts to reform the GeneralAssembly  which is the most representative body of ourOrganization. Indeed  the Assembly should enjoygreater authority. We hope that agreement can also bereached on Security Council reform  and San Marinoreiterates its support for the inclusion of a largernumber of non-permanent members  in order to makethe Council more representative and democratic.Let me stress once again my country’sappreciation for and commitment to activities carriedout by the United Nations in building a world of peace solidarity and development.It is in that spirit that this morning I signed threeimportant international instruments: the Convention onthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination againstWomen  the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control recently adopted at the fifty-sixth Assembly of the WorldHealth Organization and the Second Optional Protocol tothe International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights  aimed at abolishing the death penalty.We need to continue our action at the internationallevel despite all the difficulties and tensions that exist bearing in mind that our joint efforts are essential tofinding a solution to the emergencies and concerns oftoday. Bringing about the necessary changes  we willbe able to reconfirm the validity of the basic principlesof this Organization. We will responsibly set theconditions for our future and thus meet theexpectations of our peoples and our hearts.While expressing my best wishes to you  MrPresident  to the Secretary-General and to all UnitedNations officers  as well as to all Member States. Iassure them that San Marino will be at their side inmeeting all of these challenges."
"155",6377,"SOM",58,2003,"﻿Allow me first of all tosincerely congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte on his electionas President of the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. Your election to the presidency is areflection of the high esteem the internationalcommunity reserves for your country  Saint Lucia  andyour good person.At the same time  I would like to express ourappreciation for the excellent manner in which yourpredecessor conducted the work of the fifty-seventhsession of the General Assembly.I would be remiss if I did not pay tribute toSecretary-General Kofi Anan for his strongcommitment to the principles enshrined in the UnitedNations Charter and for defending so courageously theideals on which this Organization is based.The destruction of the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad  with its unnecessary loss oflife  was a heinous crime against humanity and theUnited Nations. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his UnitedNations co-workers were in Iraq not as an occupyingPower  but to serve and address the humanitarian needsof the Iraqi people. This despicable act is tantamount tocutting off the hand that feeds. We offer our sincereand profound condolences to Secretary-General KofiAnan  the United Nations family and the bereavedfamilies. In memory of the fallen  it is imperative forus  Member States  to accelerate ratification of theConvention on the Safety of United Nations andAssociated Personnel.The recent high-level meeting at United NationsHeadquarters on the HIV/AIDS pandemic was oftremendous interest to the world and particularly tomany countries in Africa. The AIDS scourge  havingdevastated entire communities  has also negativelyimpacted the economic development of countries. Inorder to combat this scourge  it is incumbent upon theinternational community to make more resourcesavailable  even in those countries where the incidenceof the pandemic is reportedly low.My country  Somalia  is reported to be one ofthose countries in Africa with a very low rate ofinfection. However  this should not lead us intocomplacency. Countries like Somalia have a uniquechance to prevent the disease from spreading. An AIDSepidemic would be catastrophic for Somalia andseriously hamper efforts for peace and nation-building.It is therefore critical to put into place coordinated andstrategic AIDS education and early responseprogrammes to prevent the spread of the epidemic inSomalia. As the saying goes  prevention is better thancure.Recent developments in the international arenapresent the United Nations with unprecedentedchallenges. Whether we succeed or fail will dependprimarily on the manner in which we address thesechallenges. In our view  that should be through theUnited Nations. We have to reinforce the principles ofthe United Nations Charter through which we canfurther cement the pillars of international legitimacy onthe basis of the equality of nations big and small  richand poor; respect for the sovereignty of peoples; non-interference in each others’ internal affairs;renunciation of the use of force in resolving conflicts;and respect for human rights.21There are Members of this Organization whoviolate these lofty principles with impunity. Israel is anexample in this regard. Israel’s continued occupation ofArab lands seized by war; its denying the Palestinianpeople their dignity; the daily killings of Palestinianchildren; the siege of the legitimate leader of thePalestinian people and calls by Israeli officials for hiskilling; and the suffering and daily humiliationsinflicted on the Palestinian people are of great concernto the international community. We believe that thesegross violations of international law are not in theinterest of Israel or peace in the Middle East. Webelieve that the Arab initiative  which has the supportof Arab States  provides a unique opportunity forachieving a just and comprehensive peace in theMiddle East and specifically between Arabs andIsraelis.The situation in Iraq continues to be of greatconcern. The people of Iraq need peace anddevelopment. The people of Iraq need to recuperatefrom the trauma of war and its aftermath. As a countrythat has witnessed war and its destruction  we knowwhat the Iraqi people are going through. We empathizewith them strongly. There must be a commitment fromthe international community to respecting the unity sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. Thewithdrawal of the occupying forces from Iraq as soonas possible and the establishment of a trulyrepresentative Government for Iraq based on aconstitution acceptable to all Iraqis continue to beimperatives. In this regard  the United Nations can andmust play the central role in bringing peace to Iraq.A fresh wind is blowing throughout Africa  fromthe West of the continent to its Eastern and Centralregions. This fresh wind is one of hope and peace notonly for Africa  but also for the world. This wind ofhope and peace needs to be nurtured and sustained bythe international community.We welcome the progress made in the search forpeace in African countries — the Democratic Republicof the Congo  Burundi  Rwanda  Sierra Leone  Liberia the Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau. The latest andmost welcome progress towards peace is the 22September 2003 agreement signed in Naivasha  Kenya by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’sLiberation Movement/Sudan People’s Liberation Army.We encourage the parties to resolve the remainingoutstanding issues in a spirit of accommodation andmutual understanding. We also commend theIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) the Economic Community of West African States  theAfrican Union  the United Nations and individualcountries for their valuable assistance in bringing peaceto areas of conflict in Africa.I pause to share with the General Assembly thesituation in my country  Somalia. We express our deepgratitude to the Government and people of Kenya forhosting us and for their perseverance. We stronglycommend Kenya for its active role in promoting peacein Somalia. I also take this opportunity to thank theSecretary-General for his valuable support for thepeace process in Somalia. The IGAD Partners Forum the African Union  the League of Arab States  theOrganization of the Islamic Conference and IGAD areto be commended for their firm commitment and inputinto this process.The Somali National Reconciliation Conferenceat Mbagathi enters its twelfth month. A lot of groundhas been covered during this period. A declaration onthe cessation of hostilities has been adopted and theAfrican Union has put in place a monitoringmechanism. Today  African Union monitors crisscrossnearly all areas of Somalia to ensure theimplementation of the declaration on the cessation ofhostilities.Equally important is the completion of the firsttwo phases of the Conference. Despite such progress we have been struggling with the last and crucial phaseof the Conference for the past four months. This lastphase envisaged the adoption of an interim charter  tobe followed by the election of an interim head of Stateand the formation of an all-inclusive Government ofSomalia. However  disagreements regarding thecontent of the interim charter and other importantmatters continue to persist. The provisions of theinterim charter that raise the concerns of many touchupon the shape and very foundations of thereconstituted State of Somalia. It is for that reason thatthe Conference is currently in suspense and stalled with the Transitional National Government and at leastseven other groups refraining from participation.Any interim charter for Somalia  in our view must meet certain  basic criteria. First  it must haveSomali ownership. Secondly  it must be the result of afair and transparent process. Thirdly  it must have thesupport of the Somali stakeholders. Fourthly  it must beenforceable on the ground. Fifthly  it must reflect the22unity and indivisibility of the Somali nation. Finally any Government that is established under this interimCharter should be an all-inclusive one. By the sametoken  any agreements reached in Kenya must be on aconsensus basis  have the support of the Somalis aswell as of the international community  and beenforceable on the ground.To facilitate an agreement based on these criteria a re-evaluation of the manner in which the Conferenceis currently being run is called for. The IGAD frontlineStates must observe the principle of impartiality andneutrality  without which no mediation can be takenseriously. Furthermore  the IGAD frontline States mustconfine their role to that of an active facilitator andattempts to fast-track the process with a view toreaching any agreement in haste and at any price mustbe discouraged.In spite of the current difficulties  I am here toreiterate before this Assembly the sincere commitmentof the Transitional National Government to the IGAD-led peace process for Somalia. I hereby state that theTransitional National Government will rejoin the peaceconference in Mbagathi  Kenya  as soon as its concernsare fairly addressed. We do this not only for ourselves but also for the Somali people  who have suffered solong. I submit that the solution lies in assisting theSomali parties to come to an agreement that is ownedby all Somalis  rather than in imposing somethingagainst their will. We urge the international communityto engage itself in the realization of this goal. We mustall work together to ensure that the march to peace inSomalia is irreversible.The international community has an obligation tore-engage in Somalia in a very serious manner and tore-enforce its role as a promoter of peace there at theSecurity Council and other levels  as it has done withother conflict areas in Africa. It is not enough toobserve or to wait and see. Somalia needs serioussponsorship to push the peace forward. Finally  we urgethe neighbouring countries of Somalia to scrupulouslycomply with the arms embargo imposed on Somalia bythe Security Council. We strongly urge them to do so inthe interest of peace and security in the subregion."
"156",6414,"STP",58,2003,"﻿I begin by joining previous speakers incongratulating you  Mr. President  on your election. MyGovernment is deeply gratified by the recognition ofyour accomplishments as someone from a country thatis a member of the Small Island Developing StatesNetwork. We are confident you will lead the work offifty-eighth session with the same abilities as yourdistinguished predecessor  His Excellency Jan Kavanof the Czech Republic.On behalf of the people of Sao Tome andPrincipe  I would like to reaffirm the principles of theCharter and its role in promoting peace anddevelopment  and to pay tribute to Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan for his dedication and leadership.We all face daunting challenges. Violence hasinflamed international relations. On behalf of mycountry  I would like to express our outrage and regretthat the United Nations Mission in Baghdad wasbrutally attacked  with the tragic loss of suchoutstanding United Nations professionals as SergioVieira de Mello. We pay tribute to all those who dieddefending the peaceful path to peace and developmentin Iraq.As we all are aware  Africa  perhaps more thanall the world’s continents  faces enormous challenges.We are plagued by endemic diseases such as malaria which debilitate and kill our people needlessly. HIV/AIDS is devastating Africa’s families  societies cultures and economies. How can we have economicdevelopment when our people are too ill to work  orwhen the main breadwinner in the family is dying ofHIV/AIDS  without any medical treatment?Our economy has begun to feel the negativeeffects of these two deadly diseases. We urge allnations to work together to mobilize the necessaryhuman and financial resources for the critical task ofcontrolling these epidemics  which give rise to anunrelenting cycle of death and suffering for ourpeoples. There can be no hope for progress in Africa ifbasic health is not first ensured  so that the people canwork and build their own prosperity.Sao Tome and Principe  a small island State witha fragile economy  is struggling. We are proud of ourdemocracy  our free and fair elections  our humanrights and our rule of law. But in July of this year ourproud and stable democracy came under threat fromforces seeking to topple our constitutionally electedGovernment. They did not succeed  because theinternational community quickly intervened to supportour elected authorities and to negotiate a peaceful endto the coup attempt  which restored our constitutionalGovernment. I would like to take this opportunity tothank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his personalconcern for our country’s well-being. I wish also toexpress my appreciation for the support of the AfricanUnion  led by President Chissano of Mozambique  andfor the tireless assistance of President Obasanjo ofNigeria  as well as that of officials from Portugal Brazil  the United States  Angola  Gabon  Cape Verdeand the Congo  and the many others who rescued ourdemocracy from peril.But our democracy will remain under threatunless the Government can mobilize resourcessufficient to provide basic services to our long-suffering people. For this reason  the people and theGovernment of Sao Tome and Principe ask forcontinued international support  with development aid to improve the lot of our people and to ensure thesurvival of our young democracy.We must all work together to strengthenmultilateral cooperation and to ensure that the UnitedNations and all its agencies continue to be the forum inwhich all Member States can promote dialogue andensure world peace  security  democracy anddevelopment.My country regrets that international relations insome parts of the world have deteriorated to the pointwhere extreme violence is the daily norm infrastructures have been destroyed  and human rightsare daily violated. We lament the plight of the refugeesthat this violence creates  and especially the plight ofchildren  who often become the victims of those whotraffic in human beings.The tragedies in Iraq  the Middle East  Liberiaand Afghanistan — to name only the most egregious —can be overcome only within the multilateralframework of United Nations. Unilateral actions aredoomed to failure in the long run.At the same time  Sao Tome and Principesupports an urgent reform of the Security Council  tomake it into a body that reflects current realities andnot those of the cold-war era. The Security Councilmust be democratised  with the expansion of thecategory of permanent members.19We observe with great concern the spread ofterrorist acts across the globe  ranging from tragicexamples such as what happened at Bali in Asia  toPalestine and Israel in the Middle East  to Spain andthe United Kingdom in Europe  to Kenya and Tanzaniain Africa  to Colombia in Latin America  and right hereto New York and other sites in North America. Butfighting violence with violence is not enough. We mustgo to the root of the problem  and that is the task of theUnited Nations.The world is a less secure place today than it wasa year ago. The proliferation of weapons of massdestruction continues  non-proliferation treatiesnotwithstanding. We must ensure the universality ofthose treaties and compliance with them under theauthority of the Security Council.Sao Tome and Principe strongly supports theMillennium Development Goals  but much remains tobe accomplished. The rules of the internationaleconomy continue to be dictated by a small number ofcountries that promote free markets while closing theirown. The latest World Trade Organization meeting inCancún is the natural result of this hypocrisy.Developing economies like that of my country can becompetitive only if there is a level playing field  if allmarkets are open and if subsidies and protectionism areerased.As an island nation  Sao Tome and Principecontinues to see its very existence threatened by globalwarming. Our shorelines are eroding and our nationalterritory is shrinking as the seas rise. Is my smallcountry to end up as nothing but a tiny volcanic peaksticking up above the waves  with the last of our peopleclinging to the land left unclaimed by the rising sea?The Kyoto Protocol must be implemented by all for thebenefit of all.For many years  the people of Cuba have beenliving under an unjustifiable economic embargo. Thateconomic embargo is hampering development  andpeople’s lives would improve were it to end. The timehas come for both sides to improve confidence-building measures by going back to the negotiatingtable and normalizing relations.Mr. President  my country would once again askfor your attention with respect to the Republic of Chinaon Taiwan. This is a country with a democraticallyelected Government which has built a strong economyand which has strong ties with many Member States.Taiwan was recently affected by Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome (SARS)  but it was beyond thereach of the World Health Organization becauseTaiwan is not allowed to be a member — simplybecause Taiwan’s people do not accept the impositionof the “one China” principle.Despite its small size  Taiwan offers developmentaid to a large number of countries. Taiwan alsocontributes to international security by being a strongproponent of the fight against terrorism.I wish to call to the attention of the Assemblythat  under the universality rules set out in the Charterof the United Nations  the Republic of China onTaiwan must one day be here among us.Our goal is to leave a better world for the nextgeneration. We cannot go along with the concept ofusing force in international relations  and we denouncehuman injustice.We decry environmental degradation  whichultimately threatens us all. Sao Tome and Principeurges dialogue  tolerance and mutual understanding onthe part of all Member States. We ask all to respect theUnited Nations Charter."
"157",6455,"SUR",58,2003,"﻿On behalf of theGovernment and people of the Republic of Suriname  Iwould at the outset like to take this opportunity toextend to you  Sir  a fellow brother of the Caribbean and to the other members of the Bureau my sincerecongratulations on your unanimous election to guidethe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly.Suriname shares in the satisfaction experiencedby the Caribbean region. We are convinced that  givenyour vast diplomatic experience and skills  you will beable to guide the affairs of the fifty-eighth session ofthe General Assembly in a most effective manner. Inthis regard  I can assure you that Suriname will supportyou in every possible way.My delegation would also like to express itsgratitude to Mr. Jan Kavan  the President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session  for themanner in which he chaired the affairs of this organ.We wish him well in his future endeavours.Likewise  my Government would like to reiterateits support for Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Hisdedication to the goals and spirit of the Organizationhas been exemplary and has served him well inprotecting the interests of humanity.My Government strongly deplores the atrociousterrorist attack on the United Nations headquarters inBaghdad. Our thoughts are with the Secretary-Generaland with the bereaved families of those who perishedas a result of the incident. We especially mourn thedemise of Sergio Vieira de Mello  a dedicated UnitedNations staff member who laboured for the benefit ofmany troubled societies.The opportunities that arise from developments inthe world today are  unfortunately  not within reach ofall the world’s children. This world order  which iswell-developed on the one side  copes with seriousdevelopment setbacks in the economic and socialsectors on the other. Economic downfalls  declininghealth services and the persistence of an internationalnon-supportive environment are all circumstances thataffect the ability of Governments  in particular in thedeveloping countries  to adequately implement policiesthat are required. There exists a wider disparitybetween the haves and the have-nots  not only ineconomic terms  but also in terms of opportunitiesoffered by the rapid development in the digital sector.Globalization can become an avenue to globaldevelopment only if it becomes all-inclusive andassumes a human face.This idea was behind the sense of urgency andunderstanding that participants in the globalconsultative process for development cooperationbrought to the meetings in Doha  Monterrey andJohannesburg. These meetings generated the neededpolitical commitment and momentum  as did theMillennium Summit  at the highest political level. Wemust maintain this momentum and continue to5demonstrate the political will and energy to implementthe decisions carefully drafted at these meetings.To accelerate progress towards these goals  thereis a need for a set of policies that generate strongereconomic growth  complemented by action to enhancethe capabilities of poor people to participate in growthand to access key social services. As agreed in Dohaand in Monterrey  these efforts should enjoy strongersupport from the international community  in particularthrough increased market access for developingcountries.My Government also holds the view that it isnecessary for all relevant actors to continue to beinvolved in the process that should lead to thecoordinated and integrated implementation of theoutcomes of these meetings. Such an approach shouldput us on a path of economic and social developmentthat reduces poverty and works for all the world’speoples.International peace and security predominantlyoccupy the international agenda. The maintenance ofinternational peace and security is a major concern ofthe international community  as declining securityaffects the protection of human rights and the veryexistence of all human beings. It is therefore importantthat global security be based on a secured and justframework that promotes the peaceful coexistence ofall States. The Government of Suriname is of theconsidered view that the United Nations and its Charteroffer the best guarantee for the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. Abidance by thesecurity framework laid down in the Charter istherefore of utmost importance.Declining security affects every member of theinternational community. It is therefore essential toincrease the involvement of the general membership ofthe Organization in the agenda and work of theSecurity Council  while an increase in the membershipof the Council should reflect the international politicaland economic realities and security needs ofcontemporary global society.The principle of human-centred security mightoffer the best possible and most effective road to travelin order to meet the security needs of today’s world. Acommitment to human-centred security will generatemore integrated international cooperation in manyrelated fields  from conflict prevention to disarmament including respect for the rule of law and for humanrights.The United Nations must continue to beinnovative in its search for effective ways and means toincrease global security. We must continue to argue formore tolerance and understanding among peoples.Suriname is one of the most ethnically varied nationsin the world  where people of different religions andracial backgrounds live and work peacefully together and with a Government and Parliament in whichHindus  Muslims  Christians and Jews form one frontto collectively work on the development of our country.The dialogue among civilizations  in particularamong religions  must be encouraged. We mustfurthermore seek to remove those circumstances thatgive rise to situations that foster global insecurity. Thistask must be given a central place in any overallstrategy to increase international peace and security.Maintaining international peace and security mustincreasingly become a common responsibilityinvolving all actors  Governments and peoples alike.The restructuring of the United Nations must alsoresult in achieving a more effective General Assembly.It is important that the General Assembly beperceived by the general public as an importantinternational body contributing to its development andprosperity. A restructured General Assembly  as thesole universal deliberative body  must continue tospearhead the debate on development  but must alsoincorporate into its agenda other issues of a globalnature that are of special importance to humanity.The common task ahead is to collectively worktowards sustainable human development and to create aglobal society in which equity  equality and equalrights and opportunities exist for all human beings andextreme poverty can be eradicated. Achieving such aglobal society requires the involvement  determinationand commitment of every Government  civil societyand business sector  as well as coordinated andcomprehensive actions by all these actors in the globalfight against poverty and injustice."
"158",6479,"SVK",58,2003,"﻿I have the honour ofaddressing the General Assembly on behalf of HisExcellency Mr. Eduard Kukan  Minister for ForeignAffairs of the Slovak Republic.Slovakia as a European Union acceding countryfully endorses the statement made by the PrimeMinister of Italy on behalf of the European Union. Thepositions and ideas expressed in Mr. Berlusconi’saddress perfectly reflect the values of the Governmentand people of Slovakia. I will therefore concentrateonly on the topics that we consider the most important.At the outset  I warmly congratulate the Presidenton his assumption of the presidency and wish himevery success in discharging his important duties. Hecan rely on Slovakia’s support and cooperation. Let mealso add the voice of my delegation to those who havethanked his predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for hiscontribution to the work of this body.Amongst the most challenging issues before us the one that has drawn the closest attention of theworld community is the situation in Iraq. We shouldjoin our efforts to help the Iraqi people reconstructtheir country and build a democratic society  which isthe best course of action for stabilizing the situation which is still volatile on the ground.The unprecedented tragedy of the destruction ofthe United Nations Baghdad headquarters  whichripped from our midst many brave United Nationspersonnel  including Special Representative SergioVieira de Mello  to whom we again pay our undividedtribute  has shown us that no target is safe. Uniting tohelp Iraq has become a matter of common interest.Security Council resolution 1483 (2003) laid theimportant framework enabling the internationalcommunity to contribute to Iraq’s reconstruction. Atthe time of its adoption  Slovakia decided to participatein stabilization operations in Iraq by sending mine-clearing experts. Although this was only a tokencontribution  given our capacity and the number ofSlovak troops already deployed in active peacekeepingmissions around the globe  I believe that it showed ourcommitment to creating conditions in which the Iraqipeople can build their own future. As more troops areneeded on the ground  we support the efforts to wingreater participation from willing countries. TheUnited Nations  with a specific mandate  must play agreater role in the Iraqi post-war restoration.Iraq must show that a free and democraticcountry is the inevitable replacement for dictatorship.A democratic and prosperous Iraq is important to peaceand security in the Middle East  which directly affectsthe rest of the world.26The difficult economic and social situation inAfghanistan  where people continue to strive to build ademocratic and viable society  still leaves room for aresurgence of extremists. The international communitycannot move away from Afghanistan. It must staycommitted and continue to provide the necessaryassistance to the Afghan people. I am pleased toannounce that last July the Slovak Parliament decidedto extend the participation of Slovakia in OperationEnduring Freedom.Ten years after Israelis and Palestiniansastounded the world by signing the Oslo Accords  thetwo sides are again locked in a cycle of violence attacks  counter-attacks and revenge. It is unfortunatethat the latest wave of violence has come at a timewhen the road map had started to encourage feelings ofhope.Slovakia is deeply concerned over thedeteriorating situation. Recent tragic and violent eventshave caused enormous suffering and resulted in manyinnocent victims. In the face of the current situation both sides must act responsibly  with the utmostrestraint  and consider carefully the tremendouslynegative consequences of a complete breakdown of thepeace process. The only realistic way out of theimpasse is the creation of a viable Palestinian Stateexisting alongside Israel  with the security and survivalof each guaranteed. Every effort has to be made to keepthe road map on the table  because there is no otheralternative. Both sides must fully and without furtherdelay implement their obligations in accordance withthe road map. Slovakia reiterates its support for theroad map and sees the role of the Quartet in the peaceprocess as irreplaceable and essential.We will not relax our efforts in the fight againstglobal terrorism and the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction. Underestimation of this peril couldhave a fateful impact on the international community.The United Nations must continue to play a decisiverole in this fight. The Slovak Republic appreciates andfully supports the activities of the Counter-TerrorismCommittee. Slovakia  as a party to all 12 globalinternational conventions against terrorism  hassuccessfully implemented their provisions into itslegislation.As a party to various international conventionsand treaties  Slovakia supports joint efforts to adoptglobal international legal instruments and standardsconcerning the principle of the rule of law. Theratification process of the United Nations Conventionagainst Transnational Organized Crime is well underway in the Slovak Republic and should be completedby the end of this year.Over the past decade  we have witnessedexponential growth in peacekeeping activities in anincreasing number of conflicts throughout the globe.The recent comprehensive reform has significantlyimproved the effectiveness of planning andmanagement of the ever more complex and challengingUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. However  themost important factor for the success of United Nationspeacekeeping is still the political will of MemberStates and their readiness to contribute contingents andequipment. In order to support and sustain theincreasing number of peacekeeping operations  thetimely payment of financial contributions is necessary.Slovakia has been among the leading contributorsto United Nations peacekeeping operations since itbecame a Member of the United Nations in 1993. Ourpeacekeepers are currently serving in six UnitedNations missions in Africa  Asia and the Middle East.Given our clear understanding of the new threats to oursecurity and a willingness and ability to help tacklethem  our engagement in peace support operationsaround the world will expand even more when we jointhe European Union and NATO next year. Slovakia’sactive involvement in peacekeeping operationsconfirms the fact that the maintenance of internationalpeace is among the priorities of our foreign policy.In recent years attacks on humanitarian workersand on United Nations personnel have increasedalarmingly. We therefore welcome the unanimousadoption of Security Council resolution 1502 (2003) onthe protection of United Nations personnel  associatedpersonnel and humanitarian personnel in conflictzones. It emphasizes the obligation of each MemberState to take every step in its power to protect thoseworking under the blue flag and to bring to justicethose who attack or harm them. Slovakia has been aparty to the Convention on the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel since 1996  and weinvite those States that have not yet done so to becomeparties to this very important international legalinstrument  which provides for the protection of UnitedNations and associated personnel.27One of the most important steps towardsachieving international justice and putting an end toimpunity for the most serious violations of humanrights  war crimes and genocide was the establishmentof the International Criminal Court. Slovakia  which isa State party to its Rome Statute  is firmly committedto ensuring that the Court is an independent  fair andeffective institution. The election of 18 judges and ofthe Prosecutor and Deputy Prosecutor was essential forthe successful start of its work. We are convinced thattheir expertise and moral integrity will ensure thehighest standards in their performance and willguarantee fair and impartial justice.Slovakia views arms control as a pivotalinstrument of security policy. Here I would like toreiterate our continued support for the furtherstrengthening of major international disarmament andnon-proliferation instruments such as the Treaty on theNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It wouldbe most appropriate to reinforce this cornerstone ofnuclear non-proliferation by speedily bringing intoforce another significant instrument — theComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) —hence my delegation’s repeated call on those that havenot yet done so to sign and ratify the CTBT as soon aspossible.Slovakia also encourages those countries thathave not signed or ratified the Ottawa Convention to doso quickly. The terror that landmines cause  despitetheir limited military utility  continues to spread  alongwith the appalling humanitarian consequences of theiruse in actual conflicts.With its entry into the European Union  Slovakiais taking on moral responsibility for the poorercountries of the world. Just as Slovakia received aid inthe past  it is now in duty bound to help reduce socialtensions and poverty in other parts of the world. That isour contribution to achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Slovakia is systematically andconsistently preparing its compact and efficientdevelopment agenda. The Slovak Government hasrecently adopted a legal framework and strategy fordevelopment assistance. An important step in thedevelopment of official assistance was the approval ofthe first annual budget in December 2002.The current modest level of official developmentassistance reflects the potential of our growingeconomy  and we are convinced that the effective andefficient use  and sustained growth  of such officialdevelopment assistance will place Slovakia morefirmly within the group of new emerging donors.We endorse the appeals made for thestrengthening of the role of the United Nations and forimproving the efficiency and working methods of itsmajor organs. First and foremost  a comprehensivereform of the Security Council and a revitalization ofthe General Assembly is needed.In the past year  the international community hashad to deal with events whose significance have put tothe test the principles that have governed internationalrelations since the signing of the United NationsCharter. Though it is undisputed that the validity ofthese principles remains undiminished  we cannot shyaway from seeking answers and solutions to thefundamental global challenges that we face today including extreme poverty  drug smuggling  the spreadof deadly diseases and global climate change. Findingappropriate solutions to these and other issues requiresmultilateral cooperation  with a viable United Nationsat its core. We all wish to see a strong and decisiveUnited Nations that is capable of effectivelyresponding to current and future challenges. Slovakiaremains committed to multilateralism and to itsfundamental institutions."
"159",6504,"SVN",58,2003,"﻿The UnitedNations is a great and good idea  born of humansuffering and the universal desire for a better world.Despite the many difficult challenges it has facedthroughout more than half a century of its history  ithas always had an important role to play. It hassucceeded because it has been able to adapt andbecause  on meeting new obstacles  it has found a modusoperandi to achieve its objectives  although not always tothe desired extent. Particularly worthy of mention are itsachievements in peacekeeping  humanitarian assistanceand the development of international law and theuniversal values that international law upholds.The role that the United Nations has played todate is clear proof of the fact that not every issuefacing the international community can be resolvedunilaterally  or even bilaterally. In a time of growingglobal interdependence there are more and moreproblems that countries cannot solve alone  or even incooperation with a smaller number of other countries.The multilateralism of the United Nations musttherefore not be built on values that promote the short-term benefit of individual countries or interest groups.Instead  it must be grounded in the awareness that noone can be satisfied in the long term if we aresurrounded by people living in destitution and withouteven the basic necessities of human dignity. Valuesgrounded in that awareness must become an inseparablecomponent of relations between countries as the globalinterdependence of the human race increases.That increasing global interdependence is alsoevidenced in the sphere of security  the mostfundamental pillar of human welfare. Economic  inter-ethnic and religious tensions are no longer limited tosingle States or regions  but can now have potentially2global effects. The most drastic warning of that becameclear in the terrorist attacks on the United States. TheIraqi crisis and other areas in turmoil offer furtherwarnings in that respect. There is no doubt that we canonly effectively fight international terrorism and theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction throughthe broad cooperation of many countries. The UnitedNations played a central role in building aninternational coalition against terrorism  and it mustcontinue to play that role.As we fight against the universal evil ofterrorism  we must ensure that our eyes remain focusedon upholding the great gains of our civilization. Humanrights take pride of place among those achievements.Sometimes we cannot avoid the Hobbesian dilemmabetween security and freedom. Still  we must be awarethat the sacrifice of freedom for security frequentlyresults in achieving neither. We must therefore ensurethat international commitments to respect human rightsare upheld.The international community has taken animportant step in the protection of human rights withthe creation of the International Criminal Court. It isour sincere hope that the most serious crimes againsthumanity will not go unpunished and that the Courtwill succeed in putting an end to such crimes throughits independent operation.Over the past year  the international community'sfocus has been on Iraq. At first the course of eventswith regard to Iraq revealed the limitations ofmultilateral cooperation and decision-making. Thoseevents now illustrate the limits of engaging unilaterally given the immense challenges in the area ofinternational security and the inherent limits ofunilateralism itself. The complexity of the post-conflictreconstruction and revitalization of Iraq demands thewidest possible support from the internationalcommunity and Iraqis themselves. The United Nationsis the only body capable of serving as the embodimentof such support. Its role in Iraq must become moreactive while retaining its autonomy. Only a strongUnited Nations with a broadly defined mandate will beable to fulfil the role we require of it  namely  to serveas a factor for stability in Iraq and in the entire region.Performing that role would be the best means of payingtribute to the representatives of the United Nations whotragically lost their lives in Iraq  including SergioVieira de Mello and his colleagues. They will live on inour memories as well as in our actions.We should not allow the focus on the most visiblecrises and on the fight against terrorism to lead to theneglect of other dangers to global peace and security. Asingle example of that would be the areas of Africa thatrequire assistance in both ending conflicts and tacklingthe root causes of such unrest. Even Afghanistan where so recently all eyes were focused  has fadedfrom our minds. Yet there is a clear danger that thechronic instability of that country could revert todevastating civil war. Nor can we neglect the region ofSouth-Eastern Europe  which posed one of the mostserious threats to global peace and security throughoutthe 1990s. South-Eastern Europe is now peaceful.However  the success or failure of its post-conflictstabilization is still dependent on the activeinvolvement of the international community. We musttherefore devote sufficient attention to political andsocial consolidation in that region.The world cannot respond to the Iraqi crisis byreducing that issue to one of military security  or evenby engaging in the increasing militarization ofinternational security. We must focus on the source ofthreats to international security. We must work hardtowards responsible and sound development that doesnot widen the gap between rich and poor. We mustmove beyond a developmental pattern that worsensdifferences and tensions. Instead we have to ensuresound prospects for all  including those in the so-calledthird world. In the same vein  we must haveinternational trade rules that enable less developedcountries to use their resources to the maximumbenefit. The collapse of negotiations in Cancun shouldbe taken seriously. Developed countries should respondby accepting more of the requirements put forward bydeveloping countries. The Millennium Declaration andits Millennium Development Goals are an importantresponse to those challenges. We must thereforecontribute what we can to achieving those objectives.I would like  at this point  to make specialmention of the fight against HIV/AIDS. I warmlywelcome the special session of the General Assemblydedicated to that issue.The objective increase in global interdependencerequires a strengthened role for the globalOrganization. To that end  we must revitalize theUnited Nations and adapt it to meet new challenges.Secretary-General Kofi Annan has accomplished agreat deal thus far in the area of rationalizing UnitedNations operations and increasing efficiency. We3congratulate him on those achievements and willsupport him in his continued efforts to that end. Wealso welcome wholeheartedly his intention to establisha high-level panel of eminent persons to look at currentchallenges to peace and security and to review thefunctioning of the major bodies of the United Nationswith a view to recommending ways of strengtheningthe Organization.A number of questions and proposals relating tothe revitalization and reform of the General Assemblyhave already been identified  and they have the supportof the majority of Member States  including Slovenia.They now need to be put into practice. Let me alsoreaffirm Slovenia's belief that the Security Councilmust be enlarged to include representation for thecountries that have the most responsibility formaintaining international peace and security. At thesame time  there must be adequate representation forthe rest of the international community in order to givethe Council a satisfactory level of legitimacy.Putting aside the changes required in thefunctioning of the United Nations  it should be pointedout that many misconceptions about the United Nationsstem from a lack of information about the Organization.On the basis of the experience it has gained to date  theUnited Nations may do well to consider expanding itsown global network of universities. Such institutionswould be subordinate to national legislation and wouldoffer a high quality education in the spirit of the UnitedNations. Such a policy would have numerous benefits.Students would learn a great deal about the UnitedNations  while the United Nations would becontributing to increasing the level of education  aswell as disseminating its core values.Globalization has opened our eyes to the vitalrealization that the whole human race is interdependentin its very essence. We must respond to the newchallenges of globalization by strengthening our effortsto ensure that the values that the United Nations has doneso much to develop are also globalized: internationalpeace and security  respect for human rights  solidarityand environmental protection. The United Nationsmust continue to play a leading role in that all-important process. To that end  it is our responsibilityto make the United Nations capable of enacting thosevalues   and hence its admirable purpose   therebymaking the world a better place in which to live."
"160",6549,"SWE",58,2003,"﻿In the early morning of11 September 2003  our Foreign Minister Anna Lindhdied  murdered in a senseless crime. One of Sweden’smost prominent and respected leaders is gone. We havelost a part of our future. She spoke for the oppressed for the victims of human rights violations. She workedfor international peace and justice and for multilateralcooperation. The voice of Anna Lindh has beensilenced  but her burning conviction echoes with us.We meet at a time when the United Nations isfacing difficulties and doubts. The capability of theUnited Nations has often been in question. Despitecrises and shortcomings  the United Nations has alwayswithstood these tests. The United Nations wasindispensable in 1945 and it still is.Global security cannot be achieved by unilateralaction. Locking ourselves in will not bring peace development  democracy or respect for human rights.We must work together to define and address emergingchallenges for multilateral solutions.The Secretary-General recently said:“We can no longer take it for granted thatour multilateral institutions are strong enough tocope with all the challenges facing them”.(A/58/323  para. 4)I welcome Kofi Annan’s challenge to us. The Nordiccountries stand behind him. The United Nations andwe  the Member States  must adapt. Reform isnecessary to stay modern  responsive and efficient andto retain the trust of global civil society. Internationalsolidarity must be in focus when redefining ourcommon agenda. Attaining the goals of the MillenniumDeclaration is a shared responsibility.The legitimacy and authority of the SecurityCouncil must be regained. Its composition must betterreflect the world of today. I believe that an agreementon enlargement with a number of non-permanentmembers could be reached fairly quickly  withoutexcluding the possibility of additional permanentmembers at a later stage.We welcome the Secretary-General’s intention ofestablishing a high-level panel to consider threats toour security and the institutional reforms required forthe United Nations to respond.North Korea has withdrawn from the Treaty onthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) andremains unclear about its intentions. The nuclearprogramme in Iran  the possession of nuclear weaponsby India and Pakistan  and Israel’s refusal to sign theNPT continue to cause concern. In several countries nuclear weapons are accorded a growing importance inmilitary doctrines. Discussions in the United Statesabout the creation of a new generation of smallernuclear arms are worrying to us. Such weapons wouldnot contribute to a safer world  but risk lowering thethreshold for the use of nuclear weapons.The threats from weapons of mass destruction canonly be met by multilateral efforts. The negative armsspiral must be reversed. The non-proliferation Treatymust be universally complied with. Sweden continuesto work for this goal  together with its partners in theNew Agenda Coalition.We need new ideas on disarmament and non-proliferation and on how to strengthen existingregimes. To this aim  Sweden has initiated anindependent  international commission chaired by Mr.Hans Blix. Last June  the General Assembly adopted aforward-looking resolution on the prevention of armed33 conflict. Sweden will continue to work for astrengthening of the capacity of the United Nationspractical preventive work.Our focus must be the security of the individual.Violations of human rights can never be accepted. Statesovereignty also implies responsibility. If Governmentsfail to protect their people  the international communitymust be prepared to act. In its report The Responsibilityto Protect  the International Commission onIntervention and State Sovereignty points out importantissues for the international community to take on. Howcan we make sure that sovereignty and independencenever become a license to abuse people? How shouldthe international community live up to its responsibilitywhen States fail to protect their people?We must make full use of instruments available toavoid war. The Security Council must be ready to acton early warning signals on threats of mass violationsof human rights. Mechanisms to prevent such situationsmay be intrusive in character and need to bestrengthened based on accountability and internationallaw. As the Secretary-General said in his speech onTuesday  the Security Council needs seriously todiscuss the best way to respond to threats of genocideor other comparable massive violations of humanrights. Prevention of genocide will be the topic for theStockholm International Forum to be held in mycountry in January.There must be an end to impunity. TheInternational Criminal Court is now operational. TheCourt will act as a deterrent to perpetrators and auniversal and equal tool for justice.Two years ago  Foreign Minister Anna Lindh wasaccompanied to the General Assembly by her then 11-year-old son David. When he entered the Hall  heasked: “Mom  where are all the women?” He saw whatmany of us seem blind to. There are too few womenhere  as in very many decision-making bodies aroundthe world. Gender equality is about making use of allhuman resources.Women are strong  but they are made vulnerablethrough legal  economic and social discrimination.Women are made victims of violence in war  of abuseat home  of trafficking  of sexual exploitation. Forthese women  gender equality is a question of life anddeath. Women’s equal rights to education  to aprofessional career and to participate in politics are nota threat to us men. The absence of these rights is athreat to the progress of mankind.Peace operations require joint efforts to besuccessful. The cooperation between the UnitedNations and regional organizations  such as the recentexperience in the Democratic Republic of Congo —President Kabila’s discussion of which the other daywe listened to very carefully — the European Union-led police mission in the Western Balkans and themilitary operation in Macedonia  are all examples ofthis. We will continue developing the cooperationbetween the United Nations and the European Unionand welcome the political declaration on crisismanagement.Many painful lessons can be drawn from theviolent conflicts in West Africa. Sweden welcomes thelarge and broadly based United Nations peacekeepingMission in Liberia. The international community mustsupport the United Nations and the EconomicCommunity of West African States in finding sustainablesolutions for the entire region. The European Union istrying to strengthen such a partnership through the workof Hans Dahlgren  its Special Representative to theMano River Union countries.Women are crucial to peace and reconciliation. Iwelcome the fact that gender perspectives are nowbeing incorporated into mandates and activities of allpeacekeeping missions. The number of women in peaceoperations at all levels should increase. Theimplementation of Security Council resolution 1325(2000) and the strengthening of the United Nationscapacity in this field are vital.The decision to cut poverty by half by 2015 isimperative  but we are not doing well enough. The paceat which the goal is being realized is far too slow. Wenow need new financial mechanisms and partnerships.In this spirit  we welcome the initiative presented a fewdays ago by the President of Brazil.Official development assistance needs to treble.In Monterrey  the States members of the EuropeanUnion agreed to increase official developmentassistance. Sweden is increasing its assistance to 0.86per cent of its gross domestic product next year.Pledges must be followed by real cash money. We needto give the United Nations predictable  long-termfinancing. I entirely agree with what President Chiracsaid a few days ago: “Failing that  we will end up witha pick-and-choose United Nations”. (A/58/PV.7)34 The main responsibility for development is borneby every country itself in promoting democracy  goodgovernance and respect of human rights. Officialdevelopment assistance will always only besupplementary  as we all know. More important is thepromotion of open and fair trade rules  the dismantlingof tariffs and the reduction of subsidies. We expect thedeveloped countries to show the way and to bringforward the Doha Development Agenda. Indeed  wemust all see to it that the setback in the tradenegotiations in Cancún is turned into a new start.The Swedish Government presented a new bill inMay this year on a coherent policy for globaldevelopment. This is our way of translating theMillennium Declaration into national policy. We willput particular emphasis on the commitment to theeighth Millennium Development Goal  which isspecifically about the obligations of the rich countries.The consequences of climate change affect us all.The deterioration of the Kyoto Protocol must be halted.We need a global system for migration thatprotects immigrant’s rights and provides security forpeople who cross borders to study  research or work.Sweden and Switzerland support the Secretary-Generalin wishing to strengthen the role of migration on theUnited Nations agenda  including the establishment ofa global commission on migration and development.The General Assembly has rightly condemned theIsraeli decision to deport President Arafat. Both partiesmust implement their obligations in accordance withthe road map. We urge the Palestinian Authority to takeaction to cease the suicide bombings. Israel’sextrajudicial killings are contradictory to internationallaw and must be stopped immediately.The international community must do its utmostto assist the parties in the peace process. The road map as Jack Straw pointed out only a few minutes ago should be implemented immediately with a view to theestablishment of a peaceful and democratic PalestinianState in 2005. International monitors and observersshould be sent to the area and Sweden is willing to takepart in such a monitoring mechanism.Sergio Vieira de Mello and many of hiscolleagues lost their lives in the bombing of the UnitedNations headquarters in Baghdad about a month ago  aterrible loss for the international community. SergioVieira de Mello personified  better than most  thestrength and commitment of the internationalcommunity at its best.The situation in Iraq remains volatile anddangerous. We are concerned about the security of theIraqi people and of those who are in Iraq to ease theirsuffering. The bombing in Baghdad was aimed at thepurposes that the United Nations stands for — tomaintain international peace and security. It will notmake us waiver. The United Nations will stay in Iraq.The international community needs the legitimacy ofthe United Nations as the only authority to be derivedfrom in helping the Iraqi people recover self-government and rebuild their country. The handling ofthe conflict must remain an exception and not becomea rule.The future of the United Nations now lies in thehands of the Member States. If the United Nationsfails  we all fail. In the statements most referred to sofar in this year’s debate  the media have competed infinding differences and disputes  but there is one thingthat we all agree on. That is the belief in our UnitedNations. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has the worldbehind him."
"161",6587,"SWZ",58,2003,"﻿It is an honour andprivilege for me to present my country’s statement as28commanded by His Majesty King Mswati III and on hisbehalf. Allow me to convey the greetings and bestwishes of His Majesty King Mswati III and HerMajesty the Indlovukazi and indeed the entire Swazination.We are gathered here to chart the way forwardtowards the creation of a world fit for all of us by theturn of the century and beyond. Over the past year  wewitnessed dramatic events that brought old and newissues to the forefront. The international situation hasrelapsed into the old state of uncertainty. Internationalleadership  be it on the part of the major Powers or theUnited Nations  has become vague  as confrontations atthe interstate and intra-state levels have increased. Ourinability to stand collectively against many issues thatafflict each individual country differently has beencited by our detractors as marking the beginning of theend of the Organization and multilateralism.The United Nations needs to send a clear messageto its detractors that it is alive and well  and that it willindeed play a major role in the post-cold war era. Allmust know that the United Nations is a major forum forconsultation  coordination and collective decisions oncrucial socio-political issues among its Members andthat its strength and relevance has never come fromaffirming the designs of a few selected Membernations  but instead rests on the collective will of theinternational community that emerges from amultilateral process.In our interdependent world  the need tostrengthen the multilateral process is now more urgentthan ever before  if we are to achieve our common goalof a just and humane international order based oninternational cooperation and solidarity. This is achallenge that must be squarely and urgently addressed and remedial action must be taken here at the UnitedNations. We can stand tall and proud  knowing that twoyears ago  the response by the United Nations to a newand unprecedented level of terrorism was immediate united and effective. That response was a model forinternational unity of purpose and multilateral action; itwas a lesson that should not be forgotten as theOrganization tackles other problems confrontinghumanity.At this point  allow me to pay tribute toMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  Special Representative ofthe Secretary-General  and to the other United Nationsstaff and support staff who lost their lives in theterrible tragedy in Baghdad a few weeks ago. Oncemore  terrorism has shown its ugly face — indeed itsonly face — and how important it is to support theUnited Nations efforts to deal with it.Despite the best intentions and efforts of regionalorganizations and the United Nations  a scourge of adifferent nature continues to threaten many parts of theworld. I refer here to the threat of internal and inter-State conflicts around the world. Events in some partsof the world continue to be of grave concern to us all.People and countries continue to expend valuableenergy and resources in fighting each other. Theinternational community has a responsibility  not onlyto design appropriate strategies for a measured andearly response  but also to find ways and means ofaddressing those conflicts’ root cause and managingthem to a peaceful resolution.There are positive indications that politicalconflict and turmoil in Africa will be eliminated  andthere is hope for building stability and economicprogress. In the face of dwindling official developmentassistance and the lack of comparable resources  thecreation of the African Union and its New Partnershipfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) programme arecommendable initiatives to bring Africa closer to themainstream of international development  to generatesustainable economic growth and to eradicate povertyand the spread of disease.What is needed now are resources and we ask thatevery effort be made by our developed partners toensure that these initiatives achieve a breakthrough forAfrican development. Also  the internationalcommunity should concentrate its efforts towardmaking development more inclusive and must ensurethat particular groups of vulnerable countries  inparticular small developing States  are not left out ofthe global economy and the development process.With the ongoing revitalization of the GeneralAssembly and its integrated implementation andfollow-up to the outcome of major United Nationsconferences and summits  we are hopeful that theaspirations of our countries for sustainabledevelopment and peace will be met.The situation in the Middle East continues to be amatter of great concern. We urge both parties to renewtheir commitment to the road map for peace and toagree on a mechanism for achieving a lasting peace.We are pleased to note that a significant level of29consensus on the main elements of a settlement hasemerged. We further urge both parties to takeadvantage of this and proceed towards negotiationsinvolving the leadership of Palestine and Israel.It is regrettable that the threat of a nuclearholocaust still haunts us — even to this day — owingto the inability of the international community to workout a regime for the total elimination of nuclearweapons. Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty we have made significant gains on theissue of nuclear disarmament  but these alone cannoteliminate the threat of nuclear weapons. The Kingdomof Swaziland continues to hold the view that theinternational community must effectively address thismatter in order to establish a clear timetable to whichall nuclear Powers must commit.In addition to the struggle to outlaw weapons ofmass destruction  there is an urgent need to address theissue of small arms and light weapons  which havecontributed to conflict and insecurity in many of ourcountries. Their easy accessibility  fuelled by illicitbrokering  is a major cause for concern. We appeal toall countries to fully implement the recommendationscontained in the Programme of Action adopted by theUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in SmallArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  held herein New York in 2001  with a view to combating suchpractices.Economic growth is essential if we are to meetthe Millennium Development Goals  in particular thefirst goal of eradicating poverty. In our quest todevelop quietly and peacefully  according to the wishesof the Swazi nation  His Majesty King Mswati IIIlaunched  in June this year  the country’s first draftconstitution — a document that has been hailed bymany as a good framework for shaping a newSwaziland. The Constitutional Drafting Committee hastaken the draft to the people for their input  and it isour hope that it will be finalized and adopted soon. Weare grateful to our international partners for providingsupport throughout that exercise.Despite our best efforts  however  the Kingdom ofSwaziland is finding it difficult to achieve progressbecause of the huge obstacles that we face  the greatestof these being the threat to our future by the HIV/AIDSpandemic. Its devastating impact on Swaziland hasbeen well documented. No development sector isimmune from the consequences of the very high andincreasing HIV infection rate among our people  giventhe enormous strain that it places on our financial andhuman resources. We are grateful  however  to theGlobal Fund to fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria and hopes are now high. Notwithstanding the inherentdelays in processing our applications to the Fund  thearrival of the first disbursements from the Fund inAugust has increased hope for thousands among theaffected and infected population.We are now able to embrace the approvedmedical-care strategies  including the reduction ofmother-to-child transmission of the virus and theprescription of antiretroviral drugs for those who needthem. The recent high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS which was held here last week  was of criticalimportance to Swaziland. We are positive that theconclusions reached during that meeting will be criticalin our endeavour to find solutions to this pandemic.As part of His Majesty’s initiative to promoteglobal awareness of the pandemic and to raise fundsthat will help those of our countries that are sufferingfrom the dreadful consequences of the disease  themuch awaited album by international artists  entitled“Songs for Life”  was launched by His Majesty here atthe United Nations  in Washington and in Los Angelesin June this year. We look forward with greatconfidence to the success of the album  whose proceedswill go entirely to HIV/AIDS programmes.The food security situation that continues toaffect the Southern African region is closely linked tothe HIV/AIDS pandemic. The Kingdom of Swazilandhas been hard hit by food shortages  largely due to thefailure of the rains  particularly in the rural areas where communities are entirely dependent on farming.As food shortages grip us tighter  we are grateful to theUnited Nations and its affiliated agencies for theireffort to help us to arrest the crisis. As we approachthis farming season  it is our prayer that the situationwill improve.It could be safely said that the twenty-firstcentury has had an inauspicious start  withglobalization  terrorism  disease and weapons of massdestruction at the forefront of our minds. This placesall the more responsibility on the United Nations toharness the resources and commitment of its Membersfor the benefit of humankind. In this effort  there is acompelling need to include all the peoples of the world 30as envisaged by our founding fathers and as enshrinedin the principle of universality. Acknowledging theimportance of this principle  the Kingdom of Swazilandraises the issue of the inclusion once more of theRepublic of China on Taiwan in the activities of theUnited Nations and its associated agencies. Ourprincipled position on this important issue remainsunchanged.The Republic of China on Taiwan has shown timeand again its willingness to participate in efforts tobring about true global peace  development andsecurity  as well as its commitment to utilize resourcesfor the benefit of mankind. We therefore fail tounderstand why the people of Taiwan cannot be part ofthis great family of nations.Finally  I would like to thank the President of theAssembly for giving me this opportunity to speakbefore the Assembly. The Kingdom of Swazilandreiterates its conviction that the United Nations systemremains the best guarantee for international peace andsecurity. We pledge to work vigorously with theOrganization to ensure its success."
"162",6617,"SYC",58,2003,"﻿My delegation is proudand honoured to see Mr. Julian Hunte  a fellowislander  also from one of the smallest nations of theworld  presiding over the deliberations of this body. Weare well aware of his skills  experience andcompetence  and we are confident that he will lead ourwork to a successful outcome. Let me also pay tributeto his predecessor  Mr Jan Kavan of the CzechRepublic  for his excellent work during the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.Our appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his dedicated andsteadfast leadership of the United Nations during thesetrying times. We commend him for his tireless effortsto make the United Nations more effective andresponsive to the demands of its Members.In recent months  some have questioned therelevance and utility of the United Nations. For28Seychelles  the United Nations remains a unique indispensable and universal multilateral institutionwhere global issues affecting the entire internationalcommunity can be debated and addressed. We believethat  despite its shortcomings  there is no otherinstitution that is better equipped and better suited tomeet the diverse demands for justice  peace  security development and international cooperation or to ensurethat the voices of its Members are heard  irrespective oftheir size or economic power. We hereby reaffirm ourfaith in the principles and purposes of the UnitedNations in addressing the wide range of challengesconfronting the international community in theglobalized and interdependent world we are living in atthe dawn of the twenty-first century.We acknowledge the fact  however  that theUnited Nations system needs to be reformed andmodernized. We support the ongoing initiative torevitalize the General Assembly to make it moreeffective and efficient. Our Assembly ought to berestored to its rightful place at the centre stage ofmeaningful deliberations on problems and issuescommon to all of its Members. We ought to strive toensure that debate in our Assembly is translated intoaction. In this respect  my delegation calls for theestablishment of a follow-up mechanism to monitorand implement decisions and resolutions taken by theGeneral Assembly  as well as those of the major UnitedNations conferences of the past decade.The reform process will be inadequate if thetransformation of the Security Council into ademocratic and representative organ  reflecting itsuniversal character and present-day realities  is notachieved. My delegation supports an increase in bothpermanent and non-permanent members to includedeveloping countries from Africa  Asia and LatinAmerica. After 10 years of debate  it is imperative thatwe bridge positions and make progress. What isrequired is political will by all the parties concernedwith a view to arriving at an acceptable solution.We support the decision of the Secretary-Generalto establish a high-level panel of eminent persons onthe reform question. We hope they will provideinspiration and fresh ideas for the way forward.My delegation holds the view that developmentought to be central to the renewed United Nationsagenda. The reform process should focus onreinforcing the role of the United Nations system in thecommitment to international cooperation fordevelopment. There should be closer collaboration andcoordination between the United Nations system andthe international financial institutions in elaboratingnovel frameworks to address development funding. Theongoing dialogue between the Economic and SocialCouncil and the Bretton Woods institutions should bevigorously pursued.We welcome the dialogue between the leaders ofthe Group of Eight and their counterparts from thedeveloping world. Those consultations should be aplatform to engage the industrialized countries of theNorth in fulfilling their commitments to the outcomesof the major conferences  in particular the MillenniumSummit  the Doha Development Round  the MonterreyConsensus and the Johannesburg Plan of Action. Ourdevelopment partners should realize that theimplementation of their commitments is vital if we  thedeveloping countries  are to achieve sustainabledevelopment. Their words must  indeed  be matchedwith deeds. The allocation of the agreed target of 0.7per cent of their gross domestic product forinternational development should be an achievableobjective.This dialogue should also provide an opportunityfor us to candidly discuss issues that are of commoninterest and concern. Problems requiring urgentattention  such as HIV/AIDS  poverty  the root causesof terrorism  the debt burden  refugees  trade terms trafficking in humans  climate change andenvironmental degradation  to name just a few  shouldbe addressed as part and parcel of shared internationalresponsibilities.The situation of small island developing Sateswill feature high on the international agenda nextAugust when Mauritius hosts the International Meetingfor the 10-year review of the Barbados Programme ofAction. It will be a timely occasion to reaffirm thespecial characteristics  vulnerabilities and concerns ofsmall island developing States and to consider theirprospects for sustainable development. It will be anoccasion to remind the international community to paygreater attention to the social  economic andenvironmental vulnerabilities faced by small islanddeveloping States.The Mauritius review will present the opportunityto assess implementation progress to date and establishthe appropriate framework for further partnership and29cooperation in achieving the sustainable developmentaspirations of small island developing States. We willneed the required resources to advance implementation.We therefore appeal to our development partners fortheir fullest support in the review process and theimplementation of the outcome of the MauritiusInternational Meeting.My delegation notes with concern the breakdownof negotiations at the recent World Trade Organizationministerial conference in Cancún. Small developingcountries have no capacity whatsoever to distort worldtrade. It is therefore imperative that theirvulnerabilities and special needs be taken fully inaccount. Seychelles urges the international communityto heed the call for special and differential treatment tobe accorded to developing countries  in particular smallisland States  that have structural disadvantages. This iscrucial to the integration of our countries into themultilateral trading system so that we can achieve ourdevelopment objectives. Concessions to small vulnerable developing economies should include thecritical areas of market access and trade preferences.The second pillar of my country’s economy —tuna fisheries — faces a real threat. There will beconsiderable social and economic consequences for usif the preferential treatment on which the industry wasbuilt is to be abandoned. After all  the trade regime ismeant to provide benefits for all  not to condemn themost fragile and vulnerable groups of the internationalfamily to marginalization and economic strangulation.A subject of preoccupation to my delegation isthe adverse impact of climate change. Studies  as wellas experience  have revealed that extreme changes aretaking place in the climate patterns of the WesternIndian Ocean region. Over recent years my country hasexperienced unusual periods of drought and torrentialrainfall  the latter causing floods  landslides  thedestruction of agricultural crops and infrastructure andeven loss of life. It is estimated the 75 per cent of thecorals in our archipelago have been bleached due to anincrease in sea surface temperatures.Global warming is not an issue of our making.Small island nations like mine are not responsible forit  yet we have to bear the consequences. This growingthreat calls for renewed concerted international action as it is affecting the whole planet. All nations must takesteps to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Theindustrialized countries have the prime responsibilityand must be the first to take action. We urge them to beaccountable under the Kyoto commitments and toratify the treaty  as this is the only appropriatemultilateral framework that can address and respond tothis phenomenal challenge facing all nations on earth.Last year the General Assembly endorsed theNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as the framework for development for the continent.International support for the implementation of thishome-grown initiative is essential. We appreciate thepledges of support by the G-8 by means of their AfricaAction Plan. We hope that this will soon evolve intothe realization of concrete projects and programmes.My delegation is of the view that there should beprovision in the NEPAD development agenda to takeinto account the peculiar problems and specificities ofthe eight island nations that constitute the Africanfamily.The 19 August attack on the United Nationscompound in Baghdad serves as the latest reminder toall of us of the central importance of being vigilant andprepared to combat terrorism. Seychelles reiterates itscondemnation of terrorism in all its manifestations.We are in the process of finalizing our accessionto the 12 United Nations conventions and protocols onterrorism. We are actively cooperating with theCounter-Terrorism Committee in the implementation ofthe obligations of Security Council resolution 1373(2001).Complying with the obligations of this SecurityCouncil resolution is a daunting task for a very smallcountry like mine  with extremely limited capacity todeal with the relevant requirements. We will do ourshare as part of our responsibility  but to succeed weneed technical and financial assistance. There is alsothe need to ensure that the capacities of small Statesare enhanced through sharing of intelligenceinformation  training of personnel  and the provision ofappropriate technology and equipment  for example  todeal with and handle the new challenges we have toconfront. We hope the international community will beattentive and responsive to our predicament.The conflict in the Middle East has brought abouttoo much suffering and destruction. My delegationsupports the road map for peace and calls on all partiesto the conflict to embark on genuine and substantivedialogue and negotiations in the interest of durable30peace in the region. We reaffirm our belief in the rightsof the Palestinian people to their own independentState  with clearly defined borders. We welcome allefforts in facilitating the search for an enduringsolution to the conflict.As regards the situation in Iraq  my delegationhopes that full sovereignty will be restored to the Iraqisas soon as possible  and that a credible and widelyaccepted political road map will be drawn up andimplemented. We believe that the United Nationsshould have a central role to play in the process.When Assembly President Julian Hunte assumedoffice  he appealed for an action-orientated andproactive General Assembly. I give him the assurancethat  albeit in a modest manner  he will receive the full-hearted support of the Seychelles delegation for aproductive and fruitful session."
"163",6662,"SYR",58,2003,"﻿I should like at the outset to congratulateMr. Hunte on his election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am confident thathis wisdom  as expressed in the policies of his friendlycountry  will promote constructive dialogue amongMember States. In the final analysis  constructivedialogue remains the most valid means of addressingthe complex problems currently facing the internationalcommunity.It also gives me great pleasure to express to theSecretary-General and his staff our sincere appreciationfor the effort they have made and the hardships theyhave endured in preserving the status of thisOrganization  and for not submitting to attempts tomarginalize it in the international arena. It is with deepsorrow that we recall the great loss that the UnitedNations in general  and the friendly country of Brazil inparticular  suffered as a result of the death of8Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues in theattack against the United Nations headquarters inBaghdad last month.Many leaders and other representatives of thepeoples of the world have gathered together at thisinternational forum. That in itself proves beyond anydoubt that this edifice of international legitimacy  andthe resolutions that are adopted here  remain the mostacceptable and respectable political recourse availableto the various countries of the world  be they large orsmall  rich or poor. This is the only forum in which itwould be extremely difficult to pass an arbitrary or pre-emptive war resolution that would result in the deathsof innocent civilians and the destruction of theirproperty.Our world today faces daunting challenges thatthreaten the very foundation of the system ofinternational peace and security. World leaders aretherefore called upon to make a sincere and concertedeffort and to demonstrate unwavering political will tocommit themselves once again to the principles ofinternational legitimacy. Giving precedence to the logicof force  violating the sovereignty of nations and takingactions that affect people's future compromiselegitimacy and the principle of equality. Such policiesrepresent a miscarriage of justice and an abrogation ofthe rule of law. They will open the door to widespreadchaos in international relations and to crises that mightbe more dangerous than those we are currently facing.My country believes that the failure to reap theoptimal benefits of the remarkable scientific andtechnological advances that humanity has made in thepast two decades  coupled with the failure to achieveglobalization with a civilized  human face  havealienated our peoples and heightened theirapprehensions. It has obstructed the dialogue amongcivilizations and blocked further interaction with othercultures. Attempts by some centres of power in theworld to manipulate the profound changes that havetaken place in the international balance of power inpursuit of narrow national interests have added insultto injury. Cards have been shuffled and premises havebeen challenged. New concepts that are totally alien tothe Charter  such as pre-emptive war and unilateral andillegitimate use of force  have been invented. In brief that course of action has turned the clock back  contrary to the superficial claims that new prospectswere actually being opened.It is regrettable that in the twenty-first centurysome think tanks provide decision-makers withmisleading or false information on the basis of whichwars are waged outside the context of internationallegitimacy and blood is shed. Accusations are madethat completely lack credibility  and unbridled claimsare advanced in deliberate disregard of any logicdeveloped by States and peoples throughout theirhistory.Our region   the cradle of the divine religionsand the storehouse of two thirds of the world's oilreserves   has been victimized more than any other suffering greater injustice  being subjected to moredisinformation campaigns and enduring greater use offorce than any other region. It has to endure a greatmany external threats that continually lay waste itspotential and its material and intellectual resources. Nosooner had the peoples of the region begun to enjoytheir freedom and independence than they foundthemselves once again faced with violent and unjustchallenges   challenges that are worse than any theyhave known throughout their history.The scourge of the Israeli occupation andcontinued Israeli aggression has been the main reasonfor the suffering of our region since the concept ofinternational legitimacy first emerge in theinternational community. That is the concept on whichthe Organization was founded and which it came toepitomize. There is a profound paradox that hasbecome the hallmark of our region. Israel was the firstState to acquire its legitimacy through a resolutionadopted by the United Nations  yet Israel was also thefirst State to ride roughshod over internationallegitimacy   and it has continued to do so to theextent that Arabs and many others around the worldfeel as if Israel were a country above the law  one thatenjoys the same veto power in the Security Council asthe United States.It is regrettable that  after decades of occupation bloodshed and contempt for international legitimacy the representative of Israel has yet to realize that theroad to peace lies in Israel's implementation of the 37Security Council resolutions on the Arab-Israeliconflict and the nearly 600 General Assemblyresolutions on the same subject  all of which have sofar remained hostage to Israeli defiance of internationallaw.9It behoved the Israeli Foreign Minister to explainin his statement to the international community in thisHall a few days ago the reasons for his country'srefusal to implement this enormous number ofresolutions of international legitimacy on the MiddleEast  instead of ignoring them  considering them nulland void  items of the past. Are the Syrians  theLebanese and the Palestinians unrealistic in theirdemands  or are they asking for the impossible whenthey stress that the only way out of the spiral ofviolence and bloodshed is through ending the Israelioccupation of the Arab territories occupied since June1967  through negotiations to pursue a comprehensive just and lasting peace on the basis of implementingUnited Nations resolutions and the Arab Summit peaceinitiative adopted at Beirut in 2002?The nagging core question here is how muchlonger Israel continue can to mislead some intobelieving that it is being victimized while it continuesto occupy the territory of others by force  lay siege toPalestinians  destroy their homes  uproot their trees andassassinate them in their occupied land. When did thevictims of occupation  settler colonialism andpopulation transfer become outlaws and terroristswithout a just cause  whose killing by fighter jets andtank fire became sanctioned under the pretext of self-defence?Some people in Washington have asked Why dothey hate us?' Some authors with ulterior motives  orself-proclaimed pundits writing for reputable Americannewspapers or appearing on famous televisionprogrammes  volunteer their answers: They hate usbecause we have skyscrapers and noble values.' Theychoose to ignore that what is hated are the flawedpolicies  and not the country and its beautifullandmarks and cherished cultural and humanitarianvalues.The grave situation in Iraq has become a sourceof serious concern for our people  who are alreadyplagued by Israeli occupation and continued threatsagainst them. The situation is also a major cause ofconcern for the international community due to thethreat it poses to international peace and security. Thecredibility of our Organization suffered greatly whenthe United Nations was unable to prevent the waragainst Iraq  a war waged outside the context ofinternational legitimacy.For weeks and months  the Security Council wasdrawn into bitter strife  debating the war resolutionprior to the war. The marathon report of the inspectorscame out before the inspectors had accomplished thetasks entrusted to them. That situation notwithstanding most of the members of the Council were able to staythe course  upholding international legitimacy and theCharter. The war was ultimately waged outside theframework of international legitimacy and thosemembers chose not to its burden.Along with other neighbouring countries  Syriaremained committed to the principles of internationallegitimacy and the Charter. In an unprecedenteddÈmarche  our countries unanimously stressed theircommon concern that  should this war break out  itsrepercussions on regional security and internationalpeace would be more devastating than the precarioussituation prevailing in Iraq at the time.That said  Syria does not base its foreign policyon hatred  nor do we gloat over the misfortunes ofothers. We do not redefine our policy in response tothreats either. The real challenge  we believe is how toextricate Iraq from this predicament and mobilize allefforts to win the battle for peace in post-war Iraq.Our country is directly concerned withdevelopments in Iraq  given our historical andgeographic ties and our common national loyalties tothe Iraqi people. Syria affirms that finding the way outof this predicament does not lie in focusing onaddressing the lack of security in Iraq  therebyincreasing the number of troops and using force tobring about security  or on levelling accusations atneighbouring countries. The way out lies in aninternational commitment to the unity and territorialintegrity of Iraq  setting a clear timetable for thewithdrawal of the occupying forces from Iraq as soonas possible  drafting a constitution accepted by theIraqis and establishing a Government that isrepresentative of the Iraqi people  provided that theUnited Nations plays a pivotal role in Iraq in thevarious political  security and economic fields.This session of the Assembly has seen intensivediscussion among the permanent and elected membersof the Security Council on a new draft resolution onIraq. We must draw attention here to the requirementthat any draft resolution to be adopted by the SecurityCouncil should allay the misgivings of the Iraqi peoplein all their factions and affiliations. Therefore  the draft10resolution to be adopted by the Security Council mustbe brought to full maturity  so as to reassure the Iraqipeople about their future and to guarantee theirindependence and sovereignty over their land andresources. The members of the Security Council shouldunanimously accept such a resolution  and it mustenjoy the support of neighbouring States and theinternational community.Much has been said lately about the dangers ofthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  paid by countries that already have different types ofsuch weapons. Some have even waged a war under thepretext of eliminating such weapons. As is alreadyknown  this danger is not confined to a particularregion in the world  but can be found in many otherregions. What is truly regrettable  however  is thatsome international quarters selectively choose to levelfalse accusations against certain Arab and IslamicStates  but not against others  while ignoring the Israeliarsenal of weapons of mass destruction  includingnuclear  chemical and biological weapons. Alsoignored have been the repeated appeals by all thecountries of the region  with the exception of Israel  tomake the Middle East a region free of all weapons ofmass destruction.Syria this year translated its words into action bysubmitting an integrated draft resolution to the SecurityCouncil  calling for declaring the Middle East a zonefree of all weapons of mass destruction. It is notsurprising  however  that those who led the mediacampaign against Syria stood in the way of adoption ofthe Syrian initiative.Syria is aware that its membership in the SecurityCouncil is temporary. However  we appeal to theinternational community to continue to support theSyrian initiative calling for the elimination of allweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East region.Syria has condemned terrorism in all its formsand manifestations. We have supported the SecurityCouncil's efforts to counter international terrorismthroughout the time of our membership of the Council.Syria has also acceded to the relevant internationalconventions to combat terrorism  including the ArabConvention on the Suppression of Terrorism and theConvention of the Organization of the IslamicConference on Combating International Terrorism.Both instruments define the crime of terrorism anddistinguish between terrorism and the legitimate rightof people under foreign occupation to resistoccupation  in accordance with international law andthe Charter of the United Nations.Syria  which is not pursuing any political agenda believes that the international community's success inits overall battle against terrorism depends  to a largeextent  on its success in addressing the root causes ofterrorism  which are often found in poverty  ignoranceand injustice. First and foremost  eliminating injusticerequires an end to foreign occupation.As a member of the Security Council  Syria hascontributed to all the deliberations on the situation inAfrica. Syria has also presided over Council meetingsthat were dedicated in full to finding solutions to thepredicaments of the friendly people of Africa. On morethan one level  the Council has succeed in providingassistance to Liberia  the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Rwanda  CÙte d'Ivoire  Guinea-Bissau Burundi  Angola and Sierra Leone. My county wouldlike to express its satisfaction at the positivedevelopments that have made it possible to findpeaceful solutions to African questions  which haveguaranteed the security  stability and territorialintegrity of the African States concerned. Syriaexpresses its total solidarity with the African continent.We call upon industrialized States and others able to doso to provide assistance to the countries of that greatcontinent.Syria also expresses its satisfaction with theprogress made in the Sudanese peace talks  with thesigning of the agreement on security and ceasefirearrangements  and ultimately with the comprehensiveagreement that will end the conflict in that fraternalcountry in a way that would preserve the Sudan's unityand territorial integrity.We call for a total lifting of the embargo imposedon Cuba for decades outside the context ofinternational legitimacy.We also welcome the international efforts todefuse tensions on the Korean peninsula  and supportthe Korean people's legitimate aspirations to unity andprosperity.Acting upon the collective responsibility ofMember States to promote the role of this internationalOrganization  Syria has actively participated in thedeliberations on the reform of the United Nations. Inthat regard  the Millennium Declaration  which was11adopted three years ago  represented a good basis  allthings considered  to bring about that reform. We hopethat the reform will continue to be carried out in acomprehensive  transparent and non-selective manner.We believe that  in cooperation with the Secretariat Member States have a primary role to play in theconsultations on reform and in the decisions to betaken accordingly.In conclusion  our sense of the dauntingresponsibility that we must shoulder together asmembers of this international Organization shouldprompt us to raise some rhetorical questions. Do wehave at our disposal a better option than to enhance thepurposes and principles of the Charter and to pursuethe goal of reforming the Organization for theestablishment of a more just and more democraticinternational order? Should we not persevere tosafeguard the milestone achievements of internationallaw? Should we not aspire to a system that will notaccommodate the arrogance of power nor compromiseour fundamental principles? Should we not seek asystem that pursues fruitful cooperation among Statesand encourages openness and a dialogue amongcivilizations epitomizing the essence of a creativehuman interaction?"
"164",6707,"TCD",58,2003,"﻿As inthe past  and despite present ordeals  Chad  my country is very glad to take active part in this meeting ofpeoples united by the same fate and motivated by thesame spirit of peace  justice and equality.I am convinced that the wise choice of someonewith the experience and requisite skills of Mr. JulianHunte to preside over this historic meeting willguarantee the success of the session. My country hasassumed similar responsibilities within the previousBureau and knows just how consuming yet exaltingthey can be. My delegation would also like to expressits encouragement and congratulations to Mr. Hunteand other members of the Bureau. My delegation and I personally  would like to assure him of our completeavailability and full support for the success of hismission. We would like to reiterate our deep gratitudeto him and especially to his predecessor  HisExcellency Mr. Jan Kavan  for the skill and enthusiasmwith which he led the Assembly during the fifty-seventh session.Allow me also to express to His ExcellencyMr. Kofi Annan our sympathy and admiration for thecourage and the firm resolve that he places at theservice of the ideals and causes of the United Nations which is now confronting many exceptional challenges.Finally  the Government of Chad would like toassociate itself with other members of the internationalcommunity to condemn in the strongest terms theterrorist attacks against the United Nations offices inIraq  which claimed the lives of several staff membersof the United Nations  including the SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General  Mr. SergioVieira de Mello. These heinous acts of violence shouldin no way break our resolve to pursue the noble goalsof our Organization  foremost among which is to helppeoples in difficulty to fully regain their rights to lead3their lives in conformity with the values of freedom democracy and justice.I would therefore like to extend the condolencesof the Chadian Government to all United Nationspersonnel  and the Brazilian  Egyptian and otherGovernments for the deaths of those who sacrificedthemselves for the freedom of others.If the international community has beenthoroughly overhauled since the fall of the Berlin Walland the end of the cold war  it has been victim to a newkind of trauma since 11 September 2001. Since thattime  terrorism has been a dire threat to internationalpeace and security. Globalization has complicated therules of the game in trade between the North and theSouth  and new forms of conflict have emerged at theregional level.The best response to all this must be based oncollective and joint action. As a full member of theinternational community  Chad  which is faithful to itsquest for peace  strongly reaffirms its resolutecondemnation of any act of terrorism  act of violenceor any use of force — in the defence of any cause — toresolve disputes among nations.. Such actions must bedealt with by our regional organizations first andforemost  and  if they fall short  to our commonOrganization  the United Nations. Although it has beenthe subject of some controversy  the United Nationscontinues to be the only Organization in the world totruly enjoy international legitimacy.But to continue to best ensure that its mission andfunctions are carried out and to maintain its legitimacy our Organization must enjoy the full support of allMember States. We must all contribute to assisting it inregaining its principal mission. The United Nationsmust once again become a common tool for us all andno longer be seen as showcase  much less a soundingboard  for the will and power of the few.It will undoubtedly achieve this goal all the moreeasily if the long-postponed reforms are successful andreflected in the enlargement of the Security Council toinclude new or emerging Powers of Europe  Africa Asia and the Americas — in sum  in recognition of thetrue state of the world today. This would do justice tothose nations and render a service to the Organizationitself.In that respect  the Iraqi crisis has only furtherconvinced us of the need to pursue those reforms. Wecannot continually evade this crucial issue. Stabilityand international peace and security are at stake  forthe kind of globalization that our peoples seek cannotevolve in the interest of all if the international politicalsystem is predominantly unilateral in nature.Pending this revolution  which all peoples whocherish justice ardently seek  we still note withsatisfaction that our Organization remains active in allcrisis areas  particularly in Africa  where we urge it tobe more proactive. Indeed  Africa is confronted withmany difficulties that have ensued from both wars andother crises  as well as from a lack of good governance.The recent establishment of New Partnership forAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) promises to save thecontinent from the economic quagmire in which it hasbeen plunged. But the coherence of this extensiveprogramme is connected with the support of the entireinternational community. The anticipated outcome willdepend on true solidarity on the part of all economiesworldwide.My country  which has been committed to thepath of democratic pluralism since 1 December 1990 has made significant progress. These efforts will besustained until we have perfected the republicaninstitutions provided for under the Constitution of 31December 1996. The Government of Chad believes itimportant that this democratic process be achieved sothat the rule of law and also peace and prosperity which are the ultimate goals  might be attained.To that end  in 1999 the President of our Republicpromulgated  a unique type of law that sets outmodalities for the use of oil revenues. This has resultedin a system in which a substantial part of this directincome —10 per cent — is set aside for futuregenerations  and the remaining 80 to 90 per centremainder goes to priority sectors — those vital areas Imentioned earlier — and the region of productionreceives 5 per cent.Secondly  the law provides for an office for thecontrol and surveillance of oil income. It is made up ofnine members  including only one representing theGovernment  with five representing civil society andtwo the Parliament. As an independent body  that officewill have broad powers and prerogatives  includingauthorizing expenditures from oil revenue andverification of their proper use.In this new international context  in which Statesare increasingly interdependent and in which the world4has truly become a village  Chad  while addressing itsinternal problems  is endeavouring to open itself to theoutside world. It is following with great interestdevelopments in the international political situationand is working to make its modest contribution to theefforts of the international community in settlingconflicts  especially in Africa.Therefore  we note with satisfaction  in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  the new awarenessof the parties involved and the emerging understanding by the Congolese people themselves  of the enlightenedself-interest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.We fervently hope that the transition process willcontinue uninterrupted until the final return of stabilityto that fraternal country.In the Central African Republic  realities in thefield have shown positive change  but it is up to ourCentral African brothers to close their ranks to an evengreater extent in order to consolidate peace in theircountry. The national dialogue under way offers theman excellent opportunity for a deep and constructiveprocess of reflection on ways of bringing aboutnational reconciliation.With respect to our border with the Sudan  wewelcome most particularly the prospects for peace thathave been emerging in that long-suffering country.Accords were concluded on 3 September 2003 underthe auspices of President Idriss Deby at Abeche inChad  between the Government of the Sudan and thePeople’s Liberation Army of the Sudan  and theprotocol on security questions signed on 25 Septemberbetween the Government and the SPLA also is awelcome development on the path to peace. Chadencourages the two parties to do their utmost toconclude a genuine peace agreement that would put anend to the sufferings of that fraternal country.We note with satisfaction a trend towards peaceand stability in West Africa. For us  the Ivorian crisiswas a serious cause for concern. The Marcoussisagreements gave rise to a real hope finally to see apeaceful solution emerge. Today all eyes are turned toAbidjan  where the Transitional Government has theheavy responsibility of conducting nationalreconciliation in the interest of all the children of thatcountry. Chad encourages the Ivorian people to helpthe Transitional Government to carry out its mission so that peace might be consolidated in Côte d’Ivoire.With regard to Liberia  we hope that  withcontinued international assistance  its situation willbecome stabilized. The participation of the countries ofthe subregion in peacekeeping operations and thepresence of the Economic Community of West AfricanStates Mission in Liberia in Monrovia all give rise tohope and are a guarantee of political stability. Theadoption of resolution 1497 (2003) was very timely. Itrepresents a framework for settlement which should beused finally to break the infernal cycle of violence inthat country. We would therefore like to ask the partiesto the conflict to overcome their differences and worktowards the return of a just and lasting peace.I cannot conclude my words on Africa withoutjoining my voice to those of other delegations thatspoke earlier from this rostrum and welcoming finallythe wise decision of the Security Council to lift theembargo that for years had penalized the fraternalpeople of Libya.Outside of Africa  other hotbeds of tensionremain  especially in the Near and Middle East  thatrequire the involvement of the international communityin the quest for adequate solutions. In the Middle East the Israeli-Arab conflict has long been one of theconcerns of the United Nations. Today conditions seemto have been met for a constructive dialogue betweenthe two neighbouring peoples  since the road mapcontaining the peace plan was agreed to by the partiesto the conflict. This peace plan will  it is hoped  allowPalestine to achieve  by the year 2005  nationalindependence and international sovereignty.Regarding the Middle East  the Republic of Chadwelcomes the interest shown by the internationalcommunity in the restoration of Iraq’s sovereignty andindependence. We hope that the process of restoringpower to the Iraqis will continue pursuant to SecurityCouncil resolution 1483 (2003) in a way that bestserves the interests of the Iraqi people.In East Asia  the question of the proliferation ofnuclear weapons  territorial conflicts and terroristattacks are jeopardizing stability  not just for States inthe region but for the entire world. Nevertheless  weare pleased to note that a dynamic for peace hasdefinitely begun to prevail in that region. We welcome therefore  the holding of multilateral talks on the NorthKorean nuclear programme  and we encourage Statesin the region  whose role in this respect is crucial  to5become truly involved in order to facilitate the questfor a final settlement of that crisis.We welcome also with relief the significantimprovement that has taken place in the context ofrelations between India and Pakistan. This favourableclimate will no doubt enable the two nuclear Powers tomaintain good-neighbourly relations and to undertakethe true problems of development.Above and beyond these conflicts  which are allof great concern  there remain two major issues withwhich the international community has not dealt withcourageously  in spite of good intentions and of theresolutions adopted in various forums beginning withthe Millennium Summit. I am speaking of developmentassistance and of the fight against HIV/AIDS. Both areMillennium Development Goals with respect to whichcommitments were entered into here  in June 2001  atthe special session on HIV/AIDS  and at Monterrey inMarch 2002.While it is encouraging to note that the heads ofState or Government of the Group of Eight  at theirmost recent Summit in May 2003  gave their support tothe achievement of those goals  they still have totranslate such commitments into action  as wasemphasized by the Secretary-General in his report onthe work of the Organization.That means  inter alia  that developed Statesshould implement the outcome of the MonterreyConsensus and the results of the Johannesburg WorldSummit on Sustainable Development in August 2002.But the conclusions of the most recent World TradeOrganization (WTO) Conference in Cancún haveshown that we have not yet embarked on that path.We must all translate into action the Summit’sresolutions on HIV/AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis andother infectious diseases. Indeed  in spite of theincrease in resources and the strengthening of thepolitical commitment at the highest level — followingthe example of the commitment made by the Presidentof the Republic of Chad — the situation remains one ofgreat concern and calls for unfailing determination andexceptional efforts in order to stem this pandemic. Iwould almost say that we must invent a new kind ofcontainment in order to stem the spread of this disease.In any case  the disease is waging a brutal waragainst humankind  which must respond by utilizingthe means required to fight a global war. This is aprerequisite for the survival of many nationsthroughout the world and therefore for the stability ofour future world.I cannot conclude without drawing the attentionof the international community to the crucial issue ofthe representation of the Republic of China on Taiwanin our Organization. That country has diplomaticrelations and relations of cooperation with manyMember States  including Chad. Paradoxically however  with regard to the United Nations  it findsitself without any status. Its ostracism is unjustifiedand unjustifiable.Indeed  the Republic of China was one of thefounders of the United Nations and was representedhere from 1949 through 1971. The fact that this itemcomes up each and every year in the debates of theGeneral Assembly proves that a substantive issue is atstake. Chad deems it inadmissible for 23 millionTaiwanese to be discriminated against by the UnitedNations and its specialized agencies. It is thusunfortunate to note that  in the current context  theWorld Health Organization  for example  cannot lendTaiwan assistance in the event of epidemics  which wasrecently the case with severe acute respiratorysyndrome. Yet the Taiwanese also have the right to livein serenity  to lead a democratic life and to be insolidarity with the world’s other peoples. They needpeace — the very foundation of democracy and acondition for development. Peace presupposes theresolution of conflicts through mediation. That implies in both hearts and minds  a culture of tolerance andrespect for differences.We urge this session to put an end to Taiwan’sexclusion by restoring its status as a full-fledgedUnited Nations Member  and we take this opportunityto invite all States in the region to halt the militaryescalation."
"165",6753,"TGO",58,2003,"﻿Again thisyear  we are meeting to assess our actions and to defineapproaches that can breathe new life into theOrganization. Far from becoming a routine  our annualmeeting is the high point in the life of theOrganization  in that it offers to each Member State through a frank and constructive debate  an opportunity6to make its contribution to the building of peace andsecurity  which are indispensable to the just and lastingdevelopment of our countries. It is also an opportunityfor us to reaffirm the paramount role of the UnitedNations in the world and to find appropriate ways tostrengthen the Organization further.Before I proceed  let me express — on behalf ofthe President of the Togolese Republic  His ExcellencyMr. Gnassingbé Eyadema  and of the Government andthe people of Togo  whom I have the honour torepresent at this rostrum — my warm congratulationson the election of Mr. Julian Hunte as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. Ourcongratulations go also to the other members of theBureau. They can be assured of the full availability andcooperation of the Togolese delegation. I should alsolike to express our appreciation and profound gratitudeto Mr. Hunte’s predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  who led thework of the fifty-seventh session of the Assembly withdexterity and skill. To the Secretary-General  wereaffirm how much we admire him for the work that hecontinues to lead at the head of the Organization.This General Assembly session is taking place ata particular time of evolution for the United Nations.Indeed  in the light of the grave events beingexperienced by today’s world  the United Nationsneeds more than ever before to be strengthened so thatit can fully accomplish the primary tasks entrusted to itby the Charter: inter alia  maintaining internationalpeace and security and serving as a forum where theefforts of nations can be harmonized towards theachievement of collective development and sharedwell-being. It is obvious that the Organization’spurposes and principles retain all their relevance andremain guideposts for action on the part of theinternational community.In my delegation’s view  this session mustintensify its reflection with a view to defining newapproaches that will enable the United Nations tosearch for more viable and lasting solutions to theproblems of peace  security and development  whichdaily challenge the entire international community. Wemust therefore support United Nations actions especially at a time when peoples are aspiring to morefreedom and democracy and to greater involvement inthe management of civic affairs.The democratic wind that is blowing through ourcountry is far more than an irresistible movement forrenewal; it holds immense hopes for our people. ForTogo  that is what has justified the people’s support forthe political reform that the Government has beenundertaking for more than a decade and a half. Here  Ishould like to recall the faith and determination withwhich the Togolese Government — spurred on by of itshead of State — is striving to build a democraticsociety that will take everyone’s legitimate aspirationsinto account and that is rooted in the country’ssociological realities. In essence  we are engaged inthis democratization process in the conviction that thetask — which will be long-term — requires muchresolve  patience and self-sacrifice.From this rostrum  I should like to stress that through the recent presidential election — which wasfree  honest and fair in the general view ofobservers — a broad majority of the Togolese peopledemonstrated their political maturity and their keensense of the general interest  which must takeprecedence over partisan and personal interests. In anyevent  I can assure the Assembly that the Togolesepeople — who know how to go the extra mile — aredetermined to move forward. The Government  for itspart  is resolved to continue the process ofdemocratization and establishing the rule of law strengthening its foundations through the local andsenatorial elections whose preparations are now underway.One can never emphasize enough that thedifficulties related to the whole democratizationprocess are not limited to one country or to a specificgroup of countries; they are inherent in any endeavourwhose objective is to involve people in themanagement of public affairs. The path towardsdemocracy is long and fraught with pitfalls  but we areworking tirelessly to provide the country withdemocratic institutions which are indispensable to theproper functioning under a rule of law. The quest fordemocracy — a contemporary development that Togofully endorses — is a complex undertaking thatrequires time. Indeed  democracy can take shape onlyin an environment of peace and security  which alonecan guarantee gradual assimilation of democraticvalues that are well understood and that emanate fromthe wisdom of the culture and traditions of the peoplesconcerned. In that spirit  Togo is striving to establishthe rule of law in the hope that we will be understoodby our partners.7Today  we can affirm that  despite the difficultiesbesetting our march towards the establishment ofdemocracy  encouraging and concrete results have beenachieved. Above and beyond institutional development ensuring full human rights in all their aspects is aparamount necessity. Here  we wish to emphasize theTogolese Government’s primary concern to guaranteeand promote the economic  social and cultural rights ofall Togolese citizens. The realization of those rights isof particular importance  for in them lie the interests ofdemocracy and the stability of the Republic’sinstitutions.Indeed  if one takes a careful look at Africa’scontemporary history  one will note that the manysudden changes and various attempts challengingdemocratic institutions in some countries result lessfrom a misunderstanding of the democratic processthan from the economic and financial difficulties feltby various social strata. The success of the democraticundertaking is therefore a function of the economicpossibilities of the States that are engaged in it  andestablishing institutions requires considerableresources that our countries cannot muster at thecurrent stage of their development without foreign aid.If that observation is universally shared  why imposesanctions against — and suspend cooperation with — acountry that  like many other States  has encountereddifficulties in implementing its democratization policyand is undertaking notable efforts to establish the ruleof law? Does my country  Togo  deserve the treatmentthat it has received for the past 10 years?I would like  once again  to appeal for theresumption of cooperation with Togo. That is theappeal of an entire people. Peace and security  whichreign in Togo  and the outstanding efforts to ensureeconomic and social development  despite thesuspension of aid  clearly support the expectations ofthe Togolese people.While the elimination of poverty is considered anessential task to be tackled to help a people or acountry rebuild  it is also the same thing as giving it themeans to consolidate democracy  which is essential tobuild a more just and peaceful world.The need for solidarity  justice and equity mustlead the international community  particularly theEuropean Union and other development partners  toreconsider their position and to commit to supportingthe reconstruction effort in Togo  a country that hasmade peace and security the very foundation of itsinternal and external policies.That said  Togo believes firmly that the use ofsanctions  if not properly measured and without timelimits  will only increase people’s poverty  particularlythat of women  the elderly and children. Such sanctionsprovide  therefore  fertile ground for disorder andanarchy. The Assembly must  therefore  think aboutthis question more deeply.Our faith in peace and security is reflected in theconcrete results of a bold and visionary economicpolicy  which is carried out untiringly  despite adversetimes. This conviction is also justified by the fact thatpeace and social cohesion remain  undoubtedly  thebasic factors  without which any socio-economicdevelopment would be carried out ineffectively andwith only illusory results. Peace and security are therefore  priorities for all countries  whether they arein Africa or elsewhere in the world.At the African level  the head of State of Togo isvery engaged in the process of conflict settlement. Byway of example  let me recall prior outstanding andeffective mediation efforts in which he played a role insettling crises that have afflicted Chad  Sierra Leone the Great Lakes region  Guinea-Bissau and  mostrecently  Côte d’Ivoire.Regarding its contribution to peacekeepingoperations  I wish to recall that Togo is contributing ina meaningful and active way to the deployment ofmilitary or police contingents at the subregional levelor in United Nations peacekeeping operations; inNamibia in 1989  in Rwanda in 1993  in Haiti in 1993 in the Central African Republic in 1997  in Guinea-Bissau in 1999  and recently in Côte d’Ivoire andLiberia.With regard to Liberia  we welcome theestablishment by the Security Council  on 19September 2003  of the United Nations Mission inLiberia  which will be deployed on 1 October — in justa few hours. It will contribute to supporting in ameaningful way the peacekeeping force of theEconomic Community of West African States(ECOWAS).My country  which contributed to restoring thatpeace by sending a contingent  urges the wealthycountries to contribute to financing the United Nations8force in order to provide it with the necessary means toaccomplish its mission.In the Great Lakes region  particularly theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  the TogoleseGovernment hopes ardently that the new stage characterized by the establishment of a newGovernment and other transitional institutions  willlead to stability  unity and national reconciliation.In Burundi  my country welcomed the significantprogress made on the basis of the Arusha Agreement and it urges the parties to the conflict to workresolutely toward restoring peace to the country. Togois very involved in the settlement of disputes in Africa demonstrating clearly its firm determination tocontribute to maintaining and to consolidating peace inthe African continent. It was in that context that thePresident of the Togolese Republic advocated theestablishment of an African peacekeeping force at the1994 summit of the Organization of African Unity.It is worth noting that that idea made headway inthe Organization of African Unity  as is attested by theadoption at Durban  South Africa  of a protocol on theestablishment of the Peace and Security Council of theAfrican Union  which demonstrates the determinationof Africans to be the builders themselves of peace inAfrica. It is also comforting to note that  within thecontext of that protocol  the establishment of a pre-positioned African peace force and a continental earlywarning system are taking shape.My country is committed to making itscontribution to the implementation of this collectiveapproach to questions of defence  peace and security inAfrica  and calls on the international community tofirmly support the African continent with a view toguaranteeing the success of this effort.Outside of Africa  we are constantly watchingIraq and the Middle East  always in the grip ofviolence. Regarding the Middle East in particular  mycountry considers that the definitive settlement of thePalestinian question  which is at the heart of theconflict in the region  necessarily requires the cessationof violence and counter-violence and consideration ofthe legitimate rights of both people — the right ofIsrael to live in full security within internationallyrecognized borders and that of the Palestinian people tofully enjoy their national rights  including theestablishment of a State.In that context  we encourage Israelis andPalestinians to pursue dialogue  with a view toachieving a negotiated and comprehensive settlementof the Middle East question.Despite a new environment conducive toeconomic expansion  poverty continues to increase andremains a striking and paradoxical feature of our era.Peace and security will constantly be threatened ifmeasures of justice are not adopted to push back theborders of poverty that weaken the foundations of oursociety.The economic situation of developing countries particularly in Africa  is a matter of great concern. Theexternal debt burden  instability in export income andthe devastating effects stemming from deterioration interms of trade have largely contributed to aggravatingthe deterioration of socio-economic conditions in manyAfrican countries.Speaking of international trade  it is unfortunateto note that  despite liberalization of the economy industrialized countries continue to practiceprotectionist measures in the industrial and agriculturalsectors. These measures  particularly harmful todeveloping countries  particularly African countries impede the efforts made to restore increased exportincome.Like many other delegations  Togo demands therefore  that protectionist practices and subsidies beended. That would contribute significantly to thedevelopment of poor countries. We believe thatglobalization must be accompanied by a greater spiritof solidarity and by a policy aimed at the purchase ofproducts from the South at fairer and more lucrativeprices.In that regard  the Togolese Government wishesto emphasize that  if they are to benefit all  the rules ofthe World Trade Organization (WTO) must take intoaccount the deep aspirations of developing countries which demand that they be able to participate ininternational trade in conditions of equality and justice as recently emphasized at Cancún.At a time when our continent is doing its utmostto make the African Union the priority instrument toensure peace and security and economic and socialprosperity  the international community must becomemore involved to assist economic recovery efforts of9our States  in order to meet the challenges they face such as poverty  the AIDS pandemic and malaria.It is important that our common Organizationmobilize its efforts even more in order to fight the evilsthat afflict the world and make it vulnerable. Terrorismwould definitely be included among those evils. Theterrible events of 11 September 2001 and the recentdeadly attacks against the United Nations headquartersin Iraq and elsewhere  still alive within us  compel usto act promptly to eradicate this evil. My country which has frequently been the victim of terroristaggression  in 1977  1985  1986  1993  1994 and 1998 recognizes the importance of that challenge. This taskshould be one of our highest priorities if we wish togive future generations a sound world  in which respectfor human dignity  love and fraternity are thefoundation.In order to achieve those aims  the UnitedNations must assume greater responsibility and providemore resources. It certainly needs to be substantiallyreformed. We would like to welcome the relevantproposals of the Secretary-General to establish a panelof eminent personalities from civil society to addressthis issue. We remain convinced that our actions  takentogether  will lead to the reign of a society free fromselfishness  violence  terrorism  disease and the threatof nuclear confrontation. May the work of this sessionlead each of our States to resolutely follow the pathtowards peace and ensure that all peoples  withoutdiscrimination  can enjoy the fruits of progress madeby humanity in a climate of tolerance  justice fraternity and solidarity."
"166",6798,"THA",58,2003,"﻿At the outset  Iwould like to join the international community inpaying tribute to the late Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello all United Nations personnel who lost their lives andthose wounded by the terrorist attack on the UnitedNations headquarters in Baghdad. We stronglycondemn that cowardly terrorist attack and reaffirm ourcommitment to supporting the United Nations inpaving the way for the stability  security andsovereignty of Iraq.On behalf of the Government and people ofThailand  I wish to extend my sincere congratulationsto Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia upon his election tothe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am confident that  under his wise andexemplary leadership  this session  held at such adifficult time  will lead to a fruitful conclusion. I alsowish to take this opportunity to commend hispredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  whose tireless efforts havesteered the United Nations along a constructive pathduring a year of difficult challenges.This session meets at a most critical juncture or as the Secretary-General put it in his address: “We havecome to a fork in the road” (A/58/PV.7). This road wasmeant to build a multilateral system to ensure a betterworld for the human race. It is at this critical juncturethat the threats and challenges to multilateralism of thepast 12 months have underscored  more than ever  thatin order to collectively confront these threats andchallenges to global peace  security and prosperity  the23world cannot do without multilateralism. But  asechoed by many from this rostrum  the big question is:how?As the foremost multilateral institution  theUnited Nations needs to carry out its mission in thecontext of these realities. The Secretary-General hasexpounded his far-sighted initiative for the proposedreforms of the institutions and the establishment of ahigh-level panel of eminent personalities. Thailandlends its support to the Secretary-General’s nobleendeavour and hopes that  during the next session  hewill come up with a proposal that will take us on theright path.Many different views  agreements anddisagreements have been expressed in this Hall in thisgeneral debate. This illustrates that the internationalcommunity must learn to live with and be tolerant ofdifferences. We may differ in culture  religion andvalues  but our differences and diversities must notbecome the sources of hostility. They must be a sourceof our combined strength to enhance partnership andmultilateralism. We believe that the promotion of truepartnership and human security will help the UnitedNations mission in fulfilling its noble goals.From Timor-Leste to Sierra Leone and Bosniaand Herzegovina  the international community can beproud of forging partnership in peacekeepingoperations under the framework of the United Nations.Thailand is proud to be one of the 89 countriesparticipating in United Nations peacekeepingoperations and wishes to reiterate its commitment tocontinuing this partnership wherever and wheneverneeded through its participation in the United Nationsstandby arrangements system. For its part  Thailandremains firmly committed to supporting United Nationsreconstruction and peace-building efforts  as we havedone in the past in Timor-Leste and Afghanistan.Thailand has already contributed $250 000 to Iraqthrough the International Committee of the Red Crossand is committed to providing another $500 000 fordried halal food. Military construction engineers andmedical personnel are also being dispatched to Iraq toprovide further humanitarian assistance. We hope thatpeace can eventually reign in the region.No one deserves peace  stability and a prosperousfuture more than the peoples of the Middle East. Fartoo long have the people of that region suffered fromviolence  acts of terror and despair. We call upon theinternational community to come together inaddressing this problem. All sides must seize theopportunity to embark on the road towards a just andcomprehensive peace so that the people of Israel andthe people of Palestine can at last live in peace security and harmony.Terrorism spares no one  strong or weak  rich orpoor. To succeed against terrorism  there is no otherway but to be united. The Government of Thailand hasworked very closely with the international communityto rid the world of this scourge. Domestic legislationhas been amended in order to enable Thailand to copewith terrorist activities and to suppress the financing ofterrorism more effectively. We take no second chancesin our fight against international terrorism.As freedom from fear and freedom from want arethe two major components of human security  it is clearthat human security cannot be achieved simply becausea country wants to do it all alone. Rather  humansecurity is achieved because all countries decide to doit all together. It is achieved because countries arewilling to forge a partnership out of their differences tobuild strength for human security.That is why Thailand considers its membership ofthe Human Security Network an important partnershipstrength  complementary to the core values of theUnited Nations for the promotion of peace and security economic and social development  human rights humanitarian affairs and international law. Only twoweeks ago  Thailand was proud and honoured to havehosted the Fifth Meeting of States Parties to theConvention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines andon Their Destruction. It was the first time this Meetinghas come to Asia  where land mines are a threat to thesecurity of hundreds of millions of people. Throughoutour presidency of the Convention until the first reviewconference in November 2004  Thailand will do itsutmost to ensure much further achievements andconsiderable progress in the core objectives of theConvention: mine clearance  victim assistance stockpile destruction and universal acceptance of theConvention.Across the continent  as one of only three Asianpartners for cooperation with the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe  Thailand seeks tobuild bridges between Asia  especially the Associationof Southeast Asian Nations  and Europe. We believe24that not despite our differences in cultural and socialvalues  but because of those differences  Asia andEurope will learn the art of living together  creating aworld of human security.Narcotic drugs and pandemics transcend allborders and become as much of a threat to humansecurity as terrorism. Like terrorism  decisive andresolute partnership actions at all levels are required totackle these global problems to achieve sustainabledevelopment.The Thai Government has declared war againstnarcotic drugs since taking office in February 2001.This year  we made it the peak of our campaign. Ourbattle against the scourge of drug production andtrafficking  especially methamphetamines  must be allbut comprehensive. Within the permit of the law  wehave mounted an integrated strategic campaign incorporating prevention  treatment and rehabilitation and suppression. We hope to be able to declare a totalvictory by the end of the year.We have forged a more effective partnership withour neighbours and beyond to overcome this globalscourge once and for all. This past June  Thailandhosted a five-nation meeting comprising Thailand China  India  the Lao People’s Democratic Republicand Myanmar to discuss combating transnationalcrimes  including the issue of drug trafficking.Furthermore  Thailand is also forging partnership at theglobal level by working hand in hand with the UnitedNations Office on Drugs and Crime as a partner withshared responsibility to counter drugs and crime in theglobal context.Just as drugs tear at the social fabric of societies diseases such as HIV/AIDS cripple human resourcesacross the globe. Thailand commends the convening ofthe high-level plenary on HIV/AIDS on 22 September.We support the ongoing efforts undertaken within theframework of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria. We also remain steadfast inour partnerships with neighbouring countries particularly the Greater Mekong subregion  as well aswith related United Nations agencies  to help tackle theglobal challenge posed by HIV/AIDS. As host of theFifteenth International AIDS Conference in July 2004 we look forward to high-level representation of theworld community to share the experiences  as well asto forging strong partnerships and cooperation to builda united global front to deal with this pandemic.With regard to Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome (SARS) — the disease that crippled manycountries and affected the tourist industry so badlythroughout the world this year — we found that onlythe prompt response and commitment of ASEAN andthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)partnership enabled us to keep the pandemic undercontrol and quell the panic and fear  which were worsethan the disease itself.The non-traditional security threats of HIV/AIDS SARS and narcotic drugs — “soft threats”  in thewords of the Secretary-General — demonstrate onceagain that no matter what differences each country orregion may have  international cooperation andpartnership are crucial in order to combat bothtraditional and non-traditional challenges to humansecurity.Guided by the principle of deriving partnershipstrength from diversity  Thailand has embarked onvarious initiatives to bridge socio-economic disparitiesat the regional and subregional levels with a view toenhancing peace and prosperity. The Asia CooperationDialogue (ACD)  which is only in its second year ofexistence but already comprises 22 Asian countries representing East  West  South  North and Central Asia is a prime example. Within one year of its inception the ACD had achieved considerable progress withregard to various cooperation programmes  even in thearea of financial cooperation. The second ACDMinisterial Meeting in June this year adopted theChiang Mai Declaration on Asian Bond MarketDevelopment. The Asian bond market has beenheralded as the new financial architecture for the“world of differences”.Thailand continues to work for partnership basedon diversity and difference so as to promote socio-economic development among nations. Given theeconomic disparity among our immediate neighbours the economic cooperation strategy initiated by thePrime Minister  Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra  is the mostrecent partnership aimed at narrowing the economicgap between Thailand  Cambodia  the Lao People’sDemocratic Republic and Myanmar  with a view togenerating employment and income based oncomparative advantage and mutual benefits. It willcomplement other bilateral and regional cooperativeframeworks  and serve as a building block towardsadvancing ASEAN economic integration.25Thailand has chosen the theme  “A World ofDifferences: Partnership for the Future”  for the 2003meeting of the economic leaders of APEC  scheduledto take place in Thailand in October. The convening ofthat APEC leaders’ meeting reflects the belief that despite the diversity and differences that existthroughout the region  there is unlimited benefit andpotential that can be tapped through effectivepartnership. The meeting will discuss five sub-themes:a knowledge-based economy; the promotion of humansecurity; financial architecture for a world ofdifferences; small and medium enterprises; and actionon development pledges. In addition  we will focus onthe issue of counter-terrorism with a view to promotingeconomic stability in the Asia-Pacific region andbeyond. The choice of those sub-themes shows that despite the differences among APEC economies partnerships on those issues can be forged for thebenefit of the region and of the world.Last year  at the fifty-seventh session  I gave acomprehensive account of Thailand’s dual-trackstrategy to attain steady economic growth with socialequity. Before concluding  I would like this morning toreport to the Assembly on the success of our efforts tocreate economic and social partnership. That success isthe result of combining the diverse strengths of boththe grass-roots economy and the export-led businesssector as engines of growth. We are confident that oureconomy rests on a secure and firm foundation that willlead us along the path of economic growth andsustainable development.Last year  the Thai economy registered a 5.3 percent growth in gross domestic product  which wasfollowed by 6.7 percent growth in the first quarter ofthis year. That is our best economic performance sincethe 1997 crisis. On 31 July  Thailand paid back all ofits International Monetary Fund loans in full — twoyears ahead of schedule. The Government is committedto the eradication of poverty  as defined by the UnitedNations  by the year 2009. By placing human securityat the forefront of the Government’s policies  Thailandis stressing its determination to ensure for the Thaipeople a society free from want and free from fear.Living in a world of differences will entail miseryif we keep forging conflict out of diversity. It willentail hardship if we keep exacerbating disagreement.It will entail stagnation if we keep failing to makeroom for compromise. It will entail human suffering ifGovernments keep turning their backs on chances ofpartnership. And it will entail devastation if we use ourdifferences as an excuse to always differ.But we  Members of the United Nations  live in aworld of differences. It is incumbent upon all of us toensure that our world of differences has a future — afuture that will not entail misery  hardship and humansuffering as a result of those differences. It isincumbent upon every one of us to work with UnitedNations institutions so as to ensure that our differencesare turned into a source of strength for our future.Thailand is doing its part  and will continue to do so for such a future."
"167",6823,"TJK",58,2003,"﻿Exactly 10 years ago today  the Head of Tajikistanaddressed world leaders for the first time from the highrostrum of the General Assembly. At that moment following the collapse of the Soviet Union  our countrywas taking its first steps as an equal member of thecommunity of nations.The establishment of Tajikistan as a modern democratic  secular State coincided with the emergenceof the need to search for our own ways of interactingefficiently in a rapidly changing world. Against thebackground of the inter-Tajik conflict  we had but littletime to find effective methods of dealing with the hugepolitical  social and economic problems of thetransitional period.Today  full of pride in the peace-loving industrious and talented people of Tajikistan  I am ablereport to the representatives of the world’s countriesthat we have emerged with dignity from the toughesttrial that has ever befallen our nation. It stands toreason that Tajikistan  its people and its statehood wereable to withstand that trial largely thanks to support ofthe international community. The United States Russia  China  Japan  India and Iran  the EuropeanUnion and Central Asia States and many othercountries  large and small  supported the young TajikState during that dramatic period of our history. TheUnited Nations played a special role in this process.Tajikistan greatly appreciates this support  and isstriving in turn to be a responsible member of theinternational community.A decade may not be sufficient time to take fullstock of progress made on an international or nationalscale. However  trying to understand the lessons of themultifaceted and dramatic events at the turn of thiscentury could be very useful to our common quest tomake lasting improvements to the world order.For Tajikistan  the main lesson to be drawn isclear: the future lies with democracy within sovereignState borders and with the democratization ofinternational political and economic relations. Thelesson to be drawn is that establishing a democraticsociety is in many ways the same for all countries  buteach case is also unique. Our own experience hasshown that today there are no countries or peoplesunwilling to accept democracy or unprepared for it.2The peoples of Asia cherish the same values as thepeoples of Europe  America or Africa.It is also obvious that specific conditions  andeach nation’s historical heritage and cultural traditions clearly influence the pace and form of the democraticprocesses in each country. This issue was thoroughlydiscussed at the Fifth International Conference of Newor Restored Democracies that was recently held inMongolia. We believe that its outcome will give a freshimpetus to democratic processes everywhere  includingAsia.Establishing a democracy should not beconsidered as being easy to achieve  but rather as anextremely complex step-by-step process. In this sense the experience of developed democracies is indeedinvaluable. Nevertheless  even they are still strugglingto strike an optimal balance between the interests of theState and the individual and resolve the question ofhow to meet the basic needs of their citizens whilerespecting the primacy of the right to private propertyin a market economy.The people of Tajikistan won their independenceand democracy through enormous suffering andhardship. Peace prevailed in our country only when werecognized that national accord should prevail overpolitical ambitions and military confrontation  as thehighest goal of society  united not only by commonefforts to survive but also by a strong faith in itscreative capacity.The brightest prospects for Tajikistan lie in avision of a future developed democracy and prosperingsecular State  bolstered by a strong civil society.During his visit to Tajikistan last year  Mr. Kofi Annancould see the tangible outcome of the United Nationspeacekeeping activities and striking change in themood of the people  who now have hope for the futureof their children and their country.We are convinced that the democratic processesin Tajikistan will gain momentum. We have all theprerequisites for this. The restoration of peace inTajikistan in 1997 laid a solid foundation for a seculardemocratic State. The constitution was adopted by anational referendum. State bodies of authority havebeen performing efficiently at all levels  reflecting theentire spectrum of the extensive political life of thecountry.This does not imply that nothing threatens ouryoung democracy  or that it is invulnerable. As aPresident who knows the needs and problems of thepeople who have entrusted me with such a high office I will be sincere and share some of my thoughts. Theseconcern both domestic and international affairs including relations with the United Nations.First of all  we have no right to discredit the ideaof democracy itself  in which Tajik society continues toplace its hopes for a better life. However  experiencehas shown that there are no simple recipes forconverting the political process into economicdevelopment. Moreover  Tajikistan’s experiencecompellingly demonstrates the need for comprehensivepost-conflict rehabilitation. Enhancing the practicalbenefits of such efforts must be a priority for theUnited Nations system and the internationalcommunity. Conflict zones must be transformed intoareas of stability  and serve as examples to help toprevent new tragedies.Donors must make pledges that are responsible and do not merely raise hopes. The central coordinatingrole in this respect undeniably falls to the UnitedNations. We are deeply grateful to the numerousfriends of Tajikistan  including international financialinstitutions  for their support. We attach specialimportance to our cooperation with the United NationsDevelopment Programme and other United Nationsagencies. We believe that the United Nations TajikistanOffice of Peace-building is doing useful work to enablethe international community to better grasp the positivechanges in our country and its interests and needs.Now that Tajikistan has reached a new stage ofdevelopment  we especially appreciate the assistance toachieve our priority goals. Today  as never before Tajikistan needs assistance and practical support foreffectively tapping our rich human and naturalresources. We are resolved to making our economy upto date and competitive  inter alia  in order to overcomepoverty once and for all.I must note with regret that despite the manygains in international affairs these past years  theinternational community has still not managed to trulyresolve the problem of poverty. Though the item hasbeen discussed at many conferences and forums  nospecific actions towards eliminating poverty haveresulted. The growing gap between the rich and poorcountries is becoming a global challenge and threatens3to emerge as the main obstacle to the harmoniousdevelopment of both individual countries and thecommunity of nations as a whole.Of course  we must bear the primary burden ofaddressing social and economic problems. However developing countries are justified in their expectationsfor alleviation of the external difficulties encounteredin integrating into the world economy  which  in ourcase  is connected to access to investment  markets andhigh technologies. Equally pressing for us are theproblems of landlocked countries that have long beendiscussed at international conferences  particularlyclosed borders and the many barriers to the freeexchange of goods  services  capital and labour.I would like to draw attention to another suchissue: the problem of freshwater. We are glad thatTajikistan’s proposal to proclaim 2003 the InternationalYear of Freshwater was enthusiastically supported bythe international community. Experience has shownthat it was a very timely decision that met theexpectations of us all. The shortage of freshwater isone of the most urgent concerns of the newmillennium. Every year the demand for water increasesbecause of the need to produce sufficient food — and Ican provide statistics in support of that assertion. Some1.2 billion people have no access to freshwater. Morethan 5 million people die every year from water-relateddiseases. According to estimates of the United NationsFood and Agriculture Organization  meeting the foodneeds of the growing global population will require a60 per cent increase in food production over the next30 years. By 2030  one out of every five developingcountries will be experiencing enormous difficultiesbecause of current and future water shortages.A significant investment must be made inupdating technology and improving water resourcemanagement so as to support economic growth andlessen the burden of poverty.Guided by the Water Appeal  which was adoptedon 1 September 2003 by the participants of theInternational Freshwater Forum in Dushanbe  I proposethat the period 2005-2015 be proclaimed theInternational Decade of Freshwater.The adoption by the General Assembly of aresolution on this important matter would mean thelogical extension of the idea of the International Yearof Freshwater. It would also be in keeping with theprovisions of the Millennium Declaration  which setthe goal of halving  by 2015  the number of people wholack access to freshwater and sanitation.The International Decade of Freshwater wouldallow the international community to continue its focuson the issue of the shortage of water. Water  thecommon heritage of humankind  is vital for thepreservation of life on Earth and essential for ensuringsustainable development.It is well known that terrorism poses a threat todemocracy. Tajikistan has had first-hand experience ofthis problem  as for 10 years we have been a kind ofbuffer zone against the expansion of terror in CentralAsia and other countries. Precisely for that reason Tajikistan has taken an active part in all efforts to rootout that evil.We are equally resolute in our condemnation ofand desire to counteract all forms of terrorism. In thisstruggle  which we can win only through united efforts there can be no selectivity or double standards. It isclear  however  that terrorism cannot be curbed solelyby military methods. It would be equally erroneous tobelieve that the phenomenon is rooted in a singlereligion or culture. The rejection of democracy is notthe only source of terrorism; terrorism also takesadvantage of injustice and suffering  of the arroganceof some and the sense of humiliation felt by others.Terrorism shows up in places where one“absolute truth” is confronted by another. Althoughterrorism has nothing to do with the conflict ofcivilizations  the extension of the dialogue amongcivilizations that was begun by the General Assemblyin 1998 can contribute to better mutualunderstanding — the lack of which is quite evident.Dialogue is always more constructive than war.Dialogue conducted in all areas will liberateinternational relations from fear and mistrust and willmake international cooperation constructive andcreative.Our consolidated efforts have dealt a severe blowto terrorism as an organized phenomenon  but suchefforts have not yet defeated it. One of the lessonslearned in the course of this struggle — a struggle inwhich Tajikistan is an active participant — is thatinternational terrorism has no ideology  nation orhomeland. Furthermore  terrorism cannot exist withoutfinancial and logistical support. In this context  weshould note that democracy is threatened by another4phenomenon that is no less frightening — that of drugaggression.The illicit trade in drugs has become one of themajor sources of financing for international terrorism.The urgency and magnitude of the problems related tothe illicit drug trafficking provide clear proof that thisis a global menace that endangers international stabilityand security as a whole.Tajikistan has an extensive border withAfghanistan  and finds itself in a position between theworld’s major producer of opium and heroin and thedrug-consuming countries  to which internationalorganized crime is smuggling the “white death”.As President of Tajikistan  I consider the need tocurb drug trafficking through my country to be one ofour nation’s top priorities. During his visit to Tajikistanlast year  the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  hadthe opportunity to observe the great professional skilland dedication of the staff of the Agency for DrugControl that has been established there with the supportof the international community.According to United Nations data  Tajikistan isranked fourth in the world and first in theCommonwealth of Independent States in terms of thequantity of drugs withdrawn from trade. As a result ofour efforts in the past four years  more than $1 billionworth of opiates has been confiscated from drugdealers.The struggle against such narcotic aggression which generates multibillion dollar profits in countrieslocated far from Tajikistan  will be successful onlythrough the consolidation of collective efforts.Given the increased drug threat  and in order toexpand multilateral cooperation in combating it Tajikistan proposes the establishment of a globalpartnership to counteract the drug threat. Such aunique  broad anti-drug coalition could become areliable barrier to the expansion of this scourge.The Secretary-General could become coordinatorof such a partnership  and the United Nations Officefor Drug Control and Crime Prevention could becomeits central executive body. Such a global partnershipwould coordinate all efforts in the field at all levels including the regional level.I would like to take this opportunity to draw theattention of Members to another issue that is cause forconcern. Certain groups of people have been using theglobal communications media recently in an attempt toequate such grave threats to humankind as terrorismand extremism with the holy religion of Islam. Such aninterpretation represents a distortion of the peacefulessence of Islam and presents the religion to theinternational community as a source of evil andviolence  thus giving rise to hostility towards the entireMuslim world and encouraging neo-fascist and otherdiscriminatory attitudes.We would like once again to stress that the acts ofterror that are being carried out in a number ofcountries are crimes  committed by cruel  mercilesspeople who are driven by the lust for power andpersonal gain - people who have nothing to do with theholy religion of the world’s Muslims.Humanity must understand that Islam is not areligion of violence  but like the world’s otherreligions  calls upon people to show mercy andcompassion and appeals for peace and harmony.Tajikistan supports increased regionalcooperation in all areas. Our goal is to create a zone ofpeace  stability  harmony and prosperity in CentralAsia.Turning Central Asia into a zone free of weaponsof mass destruction is a matter of principle forTajikistan  and that is why my country endorsed theidea of establishing a nuclear weapon-free zone in theregion.Meanwhile  I would like to join the commonconcern about increased difficulties related to the non-proliferation of these types of weapon in the world including South Asia. I am convinced that the time hascome not to weaken  but rather to intensify  collectiveefforts and expand disarmament mechanisms.Another issue has become a challenge of thetwenty-first century — the increasing number ofterritories aspiring to the status of State but notrecognized as such by the international community.Those territories become criminalized from within establish external ties that are not quite legal andbecome catalysts for regional conflicts.For that reason  it is in the interest of theinternational community to start  in the short term  todevelop universal criteria for international recognitionof States. By doing so  it would be possible to preventthe provocation of separatist sentiments in certain5regions that are fraught with negative consequences forthe destinies of many peoples and States.Tajikistan notes with satisfaction the considerableprogress in the revival of Afghanistan. We areenthusiastic about how the international community isresolute in its support for processes of national accordand peace-building in our neighbouring country.Tajikistan is deeply aware of the need to renderinternational support to Afghanistan  and it willincrease its assistance to the efforts undertaken by theAfghanistan Government headed by Mr. Hamid Karzai.Meanwhile  we are persistent in calling on theinternational community not to lessen its attention tothe needs of that country  to renew its vigorouscommitment to rendering support for positive change to give fresh impetus to the peace process  making itirreversible  and to dramatically increase efforts touproot drug production in Afghanistan.Given the global danger of the drug problem  Ionce again call on the international community andrelevant international organizations to develop aunified programme of action aimed at eradicating theproduction  manufacture and dissemination of drugs inthat country.The situation in Iraq continues to be a cause forpain and concern. Conditions there are still far fromnormal. It is not only a matter of the post-militaryenvironment  the lost lives of military personnel  and even more sadly  of peaceful citizens. It is a matter ofthe lack of acceptable living conditions for many Iraqipeople.Though positive changes are obvious  restoringIraq’s sovereignty is the greatest priority. We share themajority opinion regarding the fact that the Iraqi peoplethemselves should determine their future and that theinternational community  embodied by the UnitedNations  should be called on to render assistance in theimplementation of that goal.Every people follows its own road to democracy.However  only together can we deal with thechallenges and the threats we face on this path.The United Nations remains the ultimate  indeedunique  mechanism for taking collective action toaddress global issues. The noble goals for humandevelopment set out in the Millennium Declaration which Tajikistan joined in signing  is convincing proofof that. The United Nations has united almost allcountries of the world. All of us  the United Nationsfounding Member States and recently admittedMember States  pledged to observe its Charter. Andthat is the way it should be.Our Organization is currently experiencinganother test — the search for efficient answers in newcircumstances with new requirements for worlddevelopment. The point is that the Organization and itsmajor bodies should keep up with the processesoccurring in a constantly changing world. Thoughreform of the United Nations is under way  the time hascome to channel the practical activities of all its bodiesinto real priorities.In the field of international peace and security the focus should be on the prevention of militaryconflicts  both intergovernmental and internal.The General Assembly  the Economic and SocialCouncil and all other components of the UnitedNations system are faced with the need to findconvincing answers to the globalization process  inorder to bridge the gap between the industrialized andthe developing countries.We expect improved professional skills fromSecretariat staff members and increased practicaloutcome of their work and of the work of all UnitedNations agencies  for the benefit of all Member States.The feeling that the United Nations is goingthrough a crisis that materialized at some point isalready fading. It is being substituted by an awarenessof the need to strengthen the Organization  as well asfor collective interaction within its framework. Thepreservation and the development of the Organizationis our common goal  as the international communityhas no another similar universal mechanism.The United Nations is the heritage of allhumanity. Tajikistan will be resolute in doingeverything possible for the successful implementationof the noble mission of the United Nations for thebenefit of all mankind."
"168",6858,"TLS",58,2003,"﻿At the outset allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election topreside over the work of this session of the GeneralAssembly. We are confident that you will draw on allyour experience and wisdom to conduct successfullythe work of this Assembly. I assure you of all thesupport and cooperation of my delegation and wish yousuccess in your task.I would also like to congratulate the formerPresident  Mr. Jan Kavan  for the exceptional way inwhich he presided over the work of the fifty-seventhsession.I speak today with a mixture of happiness andsorrow. I am happy to address the Assembly for thefirst time in this plenary in my capacity as PrimeMinister of my young country  after more than twodecades of having sought understanding and supportfor the cause of my people and having often lobbied forsupport in the corridors of this building. I am alsodeeply saddened  however  for having lost  just over amonth ago  an old friend — Mr. Sergio Vieirade Mello — an innocent victim of intolerance extremism and terrorism. I wish to pay tribute to hismemory and to all those who have served the UnitedNations and lost their lives in Baghdad and otherturbulent regions of the world.It was under the guidance of Secretary-GeneralKofi Annan  represented in Timor-Leste byMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello  that exactly one year agothe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste became the191st Member of this Organization. The President ofthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste Mr. Xanana Gusmão  and I bore witness to that historicact.Since then  our country has experiencedsignificant progress in the consolidation of our nascentdemocracy. My Government has presided over thestrengthening of national cohesion and has givenpriority to the unequivocal affirmation of the Republicas a democratic State founded on the rule of law bytaking normative measures in governance to implementthe provisions of a modern Constitution drafted by theTimorese and adopted by an Assembly democraticallyelected by the people.Open governance is one of the programmes of myGovernment. Based on the principles of goodgovernance  inclusion  participation of the individualand collective responsibility  open governance wasinitiated in January this year. It consists of bringing theGovernment to the people in the remote areas of thecountry to hear first hand their priorities  problems andneeds  as well as to clarify to the people the nationaldevelopment plan  the Government programme available resources and the challenges ahead. It alsoseeks to instil a greater sense of responsibility in thepeople and to make them better understand the need fortheir participation in the reconstruction of the countryvis-à-vis the implementation of the national plan  themethods of achieving the objectives of economicgrowth and of the reduction and eradication of poverty.In relation to the legislative process  we haveprioritized the adoption of laws for the foundation of6the State  above all in order to avoid takingdiscretionary and subjective measures that are withoutlegal foundation. Hence  more than 30 decrees andlaws have been adopted by the Government forapproval by the National Parliament. In this manner we will create an institutional culture of democracy giving basis to a democratic State founded on the ruleof law and the principle of good governance.The challenges are enormous  however. Of the900 schools destroyed in 1999  around 700 have beenrehabilitated and more than 30 new schoolsconstructed. Despite this  25 per cent of our childrenremain without access to education.In the tertiary sector  we have a nationaluniversity with more than 7 000 students. Hundreds ofcandidates are frustrated that their expectations ofgraduating from the national university have not beenmet. We now have a proliferation of institutions ofhigher learning that are not officially recognized by theGovernment. To deal with this situation  theGovernment has assumed the responsibility ofpreparing rules.In health care  similar challenges are being faced.Much of the infrastructure has been rehabilitated andmore is being built  but the people want moreassistance and means of support. They ask for moredoctors  more nurses  more midwives  moreambulances and health centres closer to their villages.A national health policy has been adopted by theGovernment. We hope soon to be able to reduce thedifficulties in this area with the cooperation of thePeople’s Republic of China and the Republic of Cubain the provision of doctors to operate in the rural areas.In agriculture  more than 60 per cent of theirrigation system has been repaired and new systemshave been built. It is important now to instruct farmersin the best methods of use for their systems and tomake them responsible for the maintenance of thosesystems while the remainder is being repaired.In infrastructure  in general  the repairs andmaintenance have been slow and difficult. There are6 000 kilometres of roads to be rehabilitated andmaintained  and our people are demanding the openingof many others. Many bridges need to be rebuilt completed or built outright.We also are facing problems in the electricalsector  which is in deficit. We have re-establishedelectricity production in all districts and in 55 of the 65sub-districts. Dili  the capital  has power 24 hours aday. In the meantime  it is the policy of myGovernment to identify and develop alternative sourcesof energy that are more accessible and sustainable.Currently  we are conducting a feasibility study of suchresources  in particular in the area of hydropower.Access to running water for consumption is verylimited. However  it is undeniable that the number ofpeople with access to running water is increasing daily more so than in 1999.In the area of telecommunications  we areimplementing an ambitious project overseen by Timor-Leste Telecom through a concession in the build-operate-transfer system.At the end of this year  all district capitals willhave at their disposal fixed and mobile telephones  forboth domestic and international purposes. With thecompletion and installation of the telecommunicationssystem  we will also create the technical conditionsnecessary for the development of television and radio delivering the best service in the media sector  which isfree  vibrant and responsible.The process of reconstruction is taking place inan environment of peace and stability. However  areasthat are key for guaranteeing the sustainability andcredibility of the entire process  such as the judicialsystem  defence and security  will continue to requiresubstantial assistance and support for some time tocome.In other sectors of the Administration  we needqualified people to assist in the development of thecapacity of the Timorese  in particular in theconsolidation of the financial and banking systems border control  legislative drafting and the definition ofa national policy  promotion of investment andtechnology transfer.With this in mind  I would like to reiterate that  inorder to guarantee the sustainability of the entireprocess and to meet two major aspirations – that of ourpeople for peace  democracy and development  and thatof the international community to continue to promoteTimor-Leste as a success story  we must not forget tosay the following.To our people  we would say — as we have beendoing — that they should be more patient. Above all 7we must demand their participation and that theyshoulder their responsibilities.We ask the international community forconsistency  continued dynamic partnership andsupport.To the General Assembly in particular  we askthat it endorse the Economic and Social Council’sdecision to include Timor-Leste in the list of leastdeveloped countries.In keeping with its history of struggling forhuman dignity  my country has ratified a number ofimportant international human rights treaties. We areaware that the ratification of these internationalinstruments creates legal obligations  and the TimoreseState will do its utmost to implement its commitmentsunder those instruments.With regard to external relations  we continue todevelop ties of friendship and cooperation with ourneighbours  namely  Thailand  Singapore  Malaysia Japan  South Korea and New Zealand  and in particularwith our two closest neighbours  Indonesia andAustralia.As Prime Minister  I have made official orworking visits to Malaysia  Singapore  the Philippines Indonesia  Thailand  New Zealand  Mozambique Angola  Portugal and the People’s Republic of China.At the beginning of this month  a meeting of theJoint Indonesia-Timor-Leste Ministerial Commissionwas held with a view to resolving a number of residualissues of recent years  as well as to promoting newcooperation in the areas of commerce  investment development  education  health and security. Themeeting had a positive outcome. We hope to finalizethe demarcation of our land boundary this year in orderto begin negotiations on our maritime boundaries.Boundaries  whether land or sea  define the territory ofa country. Within a territory  one can exercise powersof sovereignty or jurisdiction. For this reason  Timor-Leste  having as its neighbours two large and friendlycountries — Indonesia and Australia — hopes to see itsborders with both countries demarcated or delimited bythe end of my Government’s mandate  so that all theresources belonging to the people of Timor-Leste canbe exploited in a free and sovereign manner  for thebenefit of present and future generations of Timorese.The relationship between Timor-Leste and itsneighbours is developing in a constructive and dynamicmanner at the bilateral  trilateral and multilaterallevels.Timor-Leste enjoys special observer status in thePacific Forum and has participated as a guest in theAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).Timor-Leste is a fully fledged member of theCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries; theAfrican  Caribbean and Pacific-European Union; theWorld Bank; the International Monetary Fund; theAsian Development Bank; and various specializedUnited Nations agencies.The fight against terrorism  organized crime andtrafficking in human beings  drugs and illegal arms isat the top of the agenda  regionally and in Timor-Leste.We will make every effort to contribute to theeradication of these ills  which are turning into a realepidemic with the development of new technology.Timor-Leste is a country of South-east Asiawhich is linked to the Pacific by geography  history andculture. Our people are proud to be part of this greatgeographical region of Asia and Oceania — rich inhistory  culture and civilization  and comprising morethan one fifth of humanity. We are deeply grateful to allour Asian brothers — Japan  the People’s Republic ofChina  the Republic of Korea  the Philippines  India Malaysia  Singapore and Thailand — who haveresponded without fail to our appeal for assistance  ona major or modest scale  depending on the capacity andexperience of each country. We are grateful to all ofthem.I have just concluded a visit to the People’sRepublic of China. Within weeks  Timor-Leste willreceive the Prime Minister of Malaysia Mr. Mahathir Mohamad. In December  we will behonoured with a visit from the Prime Minister of theKingdom of Thailand.We continue to strengthen our relationships withother countries in South-east Asia  in particular BruneiDarussalam  Cambodia  Laos and Viet Nam.We deem it regrettable that the process ofdialogue and national reconciliation in Myanmar is at astandstill. Timor-Leste associates itself with theconcerns and disappointments of our friends inASEAN  and we join our voice with those of others inthe international community to appeal for theimmediate release of Mrs. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi andof all others who are being detained  and for the8resumption of talks and of the process of reconciliationand democratization.My Government takes note of the commitmentsundertaken by General Khin Nyunt  Prime Minister ofthe Union of Myanmar  in his speech of 30 August2003. We would like to express our deep concern at theabandonment by the Democratic People’s Republic ofKorea of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons (NPT) and its stated intention toproduce nuclear weapons. The Democratic People’sRepublic of Korea has three countries as its neighboursthat over the years have demonstrated friendship andsolidarity. None of those three countries presents anythreat to its security or sovereignty  thus the productionof nuclear weapons cannot be justified.Timor-Leste is a small country with a smallpopulation. Nonetheless  it has coastlines on twooceans and is linked to two continents. Historically  wewere for five centuries the only Portuguese colony inthe region  and  during a quarter century  a territoryoccupied by Indonesia. More than 90 per cent of thepopulation of my country is Catholic  and there are alsotwo minority religious groups — Protestants andMuslims.History determined that we would be different.Our geographical situation conferred on us conditionsfor converging and relating. We remain different and within that difference  we find our identity and sense ofopenness and tolerance. We know that we havesomething to give  but we also have much to receive.I am a Muslim of Arab descent and the PrimeMinister of a country with a Catholic majority. Our tinyMuslim community lives in peace and tranquillity integrated into society in general without losing itsidentity and without feeling alienated or discriminatedagainst. The Timorese Catholic leadership has beenexemplary in preaching respect and tolerance inrelation to all religious faiths  constantly searching fordialogue  cooperation  participation and mutual respect.My country does not intend to put itself forwardas a model of tolerance  mutual respect and coexistencebetween religions. I am speaking about our experienceonly to say that in this world of hate  violence intolerance and extremism  there are some oases oftolerance  peace and tranquillity that deserve to be thesource of new energy.Fanatics and extremists have existed throughouthistory and no region or civilization in the world canclaim exclusive rights to virtue or truth. In thisglobalized world  there is no place for racial orcultural  much less religious  superiority. Extremistsand terrorists have always existed. The fundamentaldifference is that the terrorists of today benefit fromglobalization and make use of modern technology as ameans of achieving their objectives.It is rhetoric  and unacceptable  to define differentcivilizations and religions as a target. The fundamentalreason for violence in the world is inequality indevelopment and  in particular  the injustice of theinternational economic order. The target of extremistsand Islamic terrorists is not the West  its culture anddominant religions. Rather  it should be stated that theWest is a target as a consequence of the global order.We are witnessing a new reality. The agenda ofthe extremists is primarily the toppling of moderate andelite regimes and the imposition of theocratic systemsin which the universal values embraced by ademocratic State are called into question  as theycontradict their views. Such an agenda would mean areturn to the Middle Ages  with the Islamic extremistsdetermining the fate of their citizens.The fight against extremism  fanaticism andterrorism must be waged on all fronts. One is themilitary front  where action must be seriously thoughtthrough and always implemented with great cautionand clear-sightedness. The other fronts include thepolitical  economic and social. The fight againstpoverty and exclusion must be integrated into ourglobal strategy in the war against terrorism.My Government congratulates the people of Iraqon the end of one of the bloodiest dictatorships inhistory. The people of Timor-Leste know only too wellthe significance of a dictatorship. In order to be free ofit  we sacrificed hundreds of thousands of our childrenin decades of unequal struggle.During our struggle for independence anddemocracy  we always believed that our efforts shouldbe focused on re-establishing international legality inour country  ensuring that the United Nations takeresponsibility and demanding that the internationalcommunity respect the Charter and United Nationsresolutions on Timor-Leste.9My Government defends the concept that thecentral role of the United Nations must be respected byall countries  in particular those with the means andresources to strengthen the role of our Organization.With regard to the situation in Iraq  it is urgentthat international legality be re-established in thatcountry. The only legitimate means of transferringsovereignty to the people of Iraq is to hand over powerto their democratically elected representatives.We believe that the Arab League must be aprivileged partner of the United Nations in the processof transition and reconstruction in Iraq. As it is aregional organization representing more than 200million people who mostly profess the same religion speak the same language and are of the same culturaland historical origin  it must not be ignored orbypassed when its own interests and that of the regionare at stake.My country is a good example of the kind of apartnership that can develop when the United Nationsand its obvious natural role in the resolution ofconflicts and the mobilization of internationalconsensus is recognized. Each process is unique andhas its own dimensions and characteristics  but ourpositive experience can be repeated in other places  andcan serve as a reference point for Iraq.I would like to comment on two issues related tothe Middle East  beginning with Palestine. We expressour deep disappointment that the peace process hasregressed and that violence has escalated in that part ofthe world. We feel encouraged by the presentation ofthe road map  and hope that it can assist in acceleratingthe peace process.We reaffirm our support for the road map and forthe right of the people of Palestine to self-determination  independence and the establishment ofan independent and sovereign State. We appeal to allthe parties in that bloody conflict to cease all forms ofviolence  to resume dialogue and rigorously to respectthe road map as agreed to with the Quartet.With respect to Western Sahara  the Arab andMuslim people of that former Spanish Territorycontinue to wait patiently for the holding of areferendum on self-determination  as agreed to by allparties in 1994. We appeal to the General Assembly the Secretary-General  the Security Council  the ArabLeague and the African Union to encourage bothparties to return to direct dialogue with a view toestablishing a definitive date for the holding of thereferendum on self-determination in the territory ofWestern Sahara.My Government is closely following the situationin Guinea-Bissau. While deploring the military coupthat toppled the elected President  we are relieved thatthere was no bloodshed or loss of life. My Governmentsupports the holding of new elections with a view tothe restoration of a constitutional democratic order  ifpossible within the framework of the United Nationsand the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries to achieve the necessary support for the bringing ofpeace  stable government and economic recovery.We regret the breakdown in talks during the mostrecent round of the World Trade OrganizationMinisterial Conference held in Cancun. Theindustrialized nations must understand that theinternational trade systems must be rectified. It isneither ethical nor moral for the rich countries topreach democracy  human rights and the dogma of afree market  while practising protectionist policies thatcondemn hundreds of millions of human beings toperpetual poverty and dependency. It is less thanethical when they teach the rules of the free marketwhile subsidizing their farmers with billions of dollars making the products of our countries  which have agreater comparative advantage  increasingly lesscompetitive.Timor-Leste has benefited from internationalsolidarity  and we are grateful for that. But we cannotremain silent in the face of injustices and anti-economic policies that impoverish the rest of theworld. We appeal for the renegotiation of debt and fordebt relief for the poor and indebted countries. But wealso believe that debt relief must be proportional to themeasures taken by each country in adopting strategiesfor sustainable development and focusing on theeradication of poverty. This means increasedexpenditure on public health and education  reducedmilitary expenditure  the strengthening of democraticinstitutions  the promotion of human rights and theindependence of the judiciary. Those are conditionsthat are indispensable for peace and prosperity.In conclusion  I would like to touch on the themeof reform of the United Nations. The creation of thisinstitution was the result of the collective experience ofhumankind  victim of the greatest scourge in history.10We congratulate the founders on their vision  but weare conscious that the institution reflects the reality ofthat period. In 1945 there were merely 51 Members and it was viewed as a club for the rich and powerful  a“white man’s club”. But the United Nations today is atruly global institution  with 191 Members.The recent experience of Iraq provoked a newdebate on the need for the structural reform of ourinstitution  beginning with the Security Council  whichis increasingly being called upon to provide opinionsand to intervene in many regions of the world. Wesupport an increase in the number of permanentmembers of the Security Council to reflect the currentdemographic reality and the new world balance.Many people are frequently asking themselves and asking out loud  a few questions  such as “Is it fairfor the Western Group to have three permanent seats inthe Security Council  while Asia has only one andAfrica and Latin America have none? Is it possible thatIndia  the largest democracy in the world  with morethan one billion inhabitants  does not have the samestatus as others? Is it possible that Brazil  with theworld’s ninth largest economy and Latin America’slargest  a crossroads of races and civilizations — Ibero-Latin American  African and indigenous people —does not have status as a permanent member of theSecurity Council?” Throughout its history  Brazil hasshown prudence and balance in the conduct of itsforeign politics  an active and constructive engagementat the regional and international level and always avoice of moderation and dialogue.There are certain procedures that may have beenunderstandable during the cold war period. But todaythe way must be made for principles of democraticdecision-making that are acceptable and universallypracticed. We must question these paradigms.We also believe that the term of the mandate fornon-permanent members must be reduced to betweensix months and one year. That will give the 191members of our Organization the opportunity to servein this organ. Besides  a shorter period will allow theless privileged to feel the desire to invest their humanand financial resources to serve on the SecurityCouncil.The reform and the democratization of a numberof organs of our Organization are necessary and urgent.The errors and failures of the past  when the SecurityCouncil was powerless and indifferent to humantragedy  should compel us all to have the courage toaccept a fair share of the decision-making that affectsus all.Let the big  rich and powerful know that humilityis the greatest virtue. Leadership means knowing howto dialogue  persuade and build alliances andconsensus. There are challenges ahead. There are manythreats. The resources of 191 countries are representedin this huge Organization. To respond to thesechallenges and threats  we must unite and build bridgesof consensus and active cooperation.Allow me to conclude by saying that the futurebelongs to the optimists. We are here today because wefavour optimism. That is why the struggle mustcontinue."
"169",6874,"TON",58,2003,"﻿Icongratulate you  Sir  upon your assumption of thishigh office. I also wish to extend my sincere gratitudeto your worthy predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for hisdedicated and committed tenure as president.I commend the resolute leadership of ourSecretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  during thesechallenging and uncertain times. It is a timely reminderof the dedication and commitment to the Charterrequired of us all as Member States.Tonga wishes to extend its deepest sympathy andcondolences to the Secretary-General  the Organizationand all affected delegations for the tragic loss of life inthe attacks of 19 August and this past week on theUnited Nations compound in Baghdad. We recall thecourage of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and too manyothers before him  who have fallen in the line of dutywhile embodying the United Nations commitment to and ultimate sacrifice for  a peaceful and better world.For its part  my Government will carefully study andexamine the Convention on the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel.Attacks such as that of 11 September 2001 andthose that befell the United Nations compound inBaghdad will continue to serve as stirring reminders tous all of the need for ever present vigilance andstrength to combat terrorism.Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)continues to be the beacon that guides the activities ofmy Government to develop and enhance appropriatemeasures in order to strengthen our compliance. Tongacontinues to support the work of the Counter-TerrorismCommittee (CTC) and has  to date  submitted all thenecessary country reports requested of it. I am gratefulto the CTC and the Security Council for their patience.After careful study of the United Nationsconventions on terrorism  Tonga is now a party to all12 instruments  but merely becoming parties to theseinstruments will not suffice. Concrete steps willcontinue to be needed for small countries like mine tofully and meaningfully implement those obligations.We have strengthened our legislative framework andtaken other measures in order to give domestic effect tosuch obligations. We continue to participate in nationaland regional activities designed to assist countries suchas Tonga implement viable counter-terrorism measures.The ongoing assistance of our traditional developmentpartners and other organizations such as theCommonwealth and the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF)Secretariat have been a boon in this regard.Last year  I referred to the signposts that line thedevelopmental path: the Millennium Summit  Doha Monterrey and Johannesburg. Together with the11outcomes of other United Nations summit andconferences  they have inspired hope and vision for ourcollective developmental aspirations. While recentevents in Cancun might not be encouraging  they haveserved to emphasize that implementing those signpostswill be critical and decisive.That is a timely reminder  as small islanddeveloping States (SIDS) proceed towards implementingchapter VII of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.That chapter refers specifically  among other things  tothe ten-year review of the Barbados Programme ofAction that is to take place in Mauritius in 2004.Indeed  Sir  under your presidency in particular Tonga hopes that this is one signpost that will give furtherimpetus to the achievements in Johannesburg last year  aswell as to the national efforts and endeavours of SIDS inachieving sustainable development. We will continue torefine our priority and capacity needs to take greateradvantage of available financial and technologicalsupport. An example of that is our attempt to improveour air transport services and international aviationlinks to combat what has been described as thetyranny of distance' in our region  by becoming themost recent party to the Multilateral Agreement on theLiberalization of International Air Transport.Regional activities which bear upon oursustainable development efforts include the Japan-Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting (PALM)Summit 2003 between Pacific Islands Forum memberStates  including Tonga  and Japan  where mutualdevelopmental issues are discussed and considered. Icommend Japan for its ongoing commitment to Tongaand the region through that process  and I look forwardto the fruitful results of the Okinawa Initiative.I also commend the initiative and recent visit tothe Pacific this year of President Chirac of France. Itwas an encouraging sign and created a solid foundationfor further dialogue and future partnership ondevelopmental issues. I look forward to participating inthe next summit meeting in Paris.As a developing ocean State  we remain interestedin ongoing developments in oceans affairs and the law ofthe sea. As I have mentioned earlier  Tonga has becomeparty to all United Nations conventions on terrorismincluding those that are maritime-related.We continue to value the work and decisions thisyear of the States Parties to the United NationsConvention on the Law of the Sea  the InternationalSeabed Authority and the work and role of the UnitedNations Informal Consultative Process at its fourthmeeting.I am pleased that the second informal meeting ofStates Parties to the United Nations Fish StocksAgreement recently resulted in a framework to enablethe concrete implementation of Part VII of theAgreement with particular attention to small islanddeveloping States and their aspirations for fisheries. Inthat respect  we urge other Member States to become aparty to that important AgreementAs emphasized during the special high-levelmeeting on Monday  22 September  HIV/AIDS remainsa devastating developmental and public healthchallenge for us all  particularly for small and remoteisland communities. Tonga welcomes the work of theGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malariaand the funding it has recently approved to assist Tongaand other countries in the region. That complementsour own national strategies and programmes to combatthose scourges.Earlier this year  my Government took thenecessary legislative  administrative and preventivemeasures to protect against the spread of Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome (SARS). I commend the untiringwork of the World Health Organization (WHO) in itscommitted efforts to address and combat that publichealth threat. I also commend the recent adoption bythe WHO Assembly of the Framework Convention onTobacco Control which  as of yesterday  has Tonga asone of its signatories.I was pleased to have been requested by theGovernment of the Solomon Islands and by other PIFForeign Ministers to contribute Tongan troops andpolice personnel to the Regional Assistance Mission tothe Solomon Islands (RAMSI) to restore law and order.RAMSI has enabled the Government to address urgentand varied concerns such as formulating new measuresto deal with the enormous economic and developmentalchallenges they now face.That endeavour  endorsed by the 16 PacificIslands Forum member States  is testament to what canbe done by a region to bring about peace in its part ofthe world. Each Pacific Islands Forum member Statehas contributed to RAMSI in accordance with its owncapacity. Taken together with Australian and NewZealand resources and command  it is producing12pleasing results. It is not the first such regional effort inthe field of security. Small might too readily beconsidered by some to be beautiful  but we  too  playour role in many fields of cooperation.Tonga continues to fully support the work of theSecurity Council and the call for the fullimplementation of its resolutions to ensure lastingpeace in arenas of conflict. In the Middle East  thepeaceful and lasting coexistence of two States livingside by side within secure and recognized borders willcontinue to be elusive until the cycle of violence endsand there is a return to constructive dialogue.Iraq is a sharp backdrop for the United Nations.One of the lessons of 11 September 2001 and Iraq isnot just that our Organization is in need of reform butthat reform is urgently and desperately required. As Istated in my Millennium General Assembly addressthree years ago  the Security Council needs reform.Otherwise we shall be dealing with today's realities bymeans of mechanisms of yesteryear. I continue tosupport the call for reforming the Council byexpanding the number of permanent and non-permanent members. In like terms  I support the call ofthe Assembly President for a proactive and action-oriented General Assembly. Let us hope that betweenthis session of the General Assembly and the next something concrete emerges."
"170",6914,"TTO",58,2003,"﻿It is indeed asignal honour for me to extend to you  Sir and to theGovernment and people of the sister CaribbeanCommunity (CARICOM) State of Saint Lucia ourheartfelt congratulations on your election to the highoffice of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. We are confident that  under yourexperienced and pragmatic leadership  the Assemblywill address in a forthright manner the many and variedchallenges which confront the international community.My delegation is equally confident  Sir  that thedeveloping-country perspective that your presidencywill bring to our deliberations will serve to highlightthe plight of the weak and the vulnerable among us  aswe struggle to come to terms with the realities ofcontemporary international relations.Mr. President  please allow me the opportunity toexpress our satisfaction at the astute leadership shownby your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan ofthe Czech Republic  and at the many initiatives that hepursued during his tenure  including those in the areasof institutional strengthening and the prevention ofarmed conflict  in an attempt to restore to this body itscentral role  as mandated by the Charter. I also applaudhis inclusive approach to advocacy  evinced by hisshort but fruitful visit to Trinidad and Tobago inFebruary this year to engage in a brief  interactivehigh-level dialogue with the heads of State andGovernment of the Caribbean Community on the workof the Assembly and on some of the major issuesbefore this global forum as they relate to small States.It would be remiss of me if I did not complimentthe Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  on his sterlingperformance in the face of the myriad crises since ourlast session. We have total confidence in his continuingstewardship of this unique world body. My delegationwishes to assure him of the total support of theGovernment and people of the Republic of Trinidadand Tobago for his untiring efforts to ensure thecontinued relevance of the United Nations in the10pursuit and achievement of the Organization’sobjectives.Trinidad and Tobago joins the rest of theinternational community in expressing our profoundsorrow at the tragic loss of life suffered most recentlyby men and women of the United Nations while on ahumanitarian mission in Iraq  as a result of thebombing on 19 August 2003 of the United Nationsoffice in Baghdad. We shall forever remember them inour prayers  together with those others who  over theyears  have made the supreme sacrifice in selflessservice to the Organization and  by extension  tomankind. We are of the view that consideration shouldbe given to the erection of a fitting memorial here  atUnited Nations Headquarters in New York  to honourall those who have given their lives in the field in theservice of the United Nations.The United Nations cannot retreat from its globalresponsibilities in the face of even such an atrocity. Weare firmly convinced that the United Nations — bornout of the destruction wrought by the Second WorldWar and representing the collective hope of mankind tospare future generations from the scourge of war —must rise to this difficult challenge and continue toplay an even more central and proactive role inmanaging world affairs  particularly with respect to themaintenance of international peace and security.The challenge before us is to make the worldpeaceful and secure. That is a particular concern ofsmall States  which must rely on the international ruleof law  on the strict observance by all States of thepurposes and principles laid down in the Charter of theUnited Nations  and on the collective securitymechanism of the Security Council in order toguarantee their right to a secure  sovereign andpeaceful existence. We must therefore work tostrengthen the rule of law worldwide as well as thecapacity of the United Nations to engage both inconflict prevention and in the management of globalcrises that disrupt international peace and security. It isalso of paramount importance that all Member Statescommit to and uphold the multilateral approach in ourcollective efforts to attain those ends.Nowhere is there a more pressing need for peaceand security than in the Middle East. Clearly  a just andlasting peace is in the interests of both the Palestiniansand the Israelis  who have been constant witnesses todeath and destruction in their respective societies andwho have watched as their once promising economieshave been devastated by the unceasing instability in theregion. Peace continues to be elusive  notwithstandingthe latest best efforts of the Quartet  whose road mapfor measured and reciprocal steps within a specifictime frame enjoys the support of the overwhelmingmajority of the international community.There can be no peace and prosperity for thatregion without the political will of leaders on bothsides of the conflict. Neither can there be progress onthe path of peace without focused and sustained efforton the part of the international community in providingthe necessary political support to the parties directlyinvolved. My delegation is of the opinion that  underthe present circumstances  consideration should begiven to deployment of a United Nations force so thatrealistic and mutually acceptable confidence-buildingmeasures can be put in place  thereby restoring somemeasure of security to Palestinians and Israelis alike.In Iraq  the goals of the international communityat this time must be the restoration of a climate ofpeace and security and the creation of the conditionsthat are necessary for the building by the Iraqi peopleof a peaceful  secure and prosperous society. TheUnited Nations has a pivotal role to play with regard toboth nation-building and the political transition in Iraq.We therefore call for greater coherence among themembers of the Security Council  and urge them toadopt such measures as are necessary in the securityinterests of all concerned to bring that situation withinthe parameters of international political legitimacy andso give free rein to the aspirations of the Iraqi people.Threats to international peace and security arecertainly not posed by State actors exclusively. Theactivities of organized criminal groups engaged in theillegal drug trade and in the illicit trade in small armsand light weapons pose a serious threat to the peaceand stability of some States  despite the efforts made atall levels.Since the events of 11 September 2001 Governments the world over have joined forces evenmore resolutely in their condemnation of terrorism andhave endeavoured to give effect to all the measurescalled for in the relevant decisions of the SecurityCouncil  including by subscribing to all internationaltreaties aimed at combating terrorism in all its formsand manifestations. The international community must however  also turn its attention once more to11addressing the root causes of this now-globalphenomenon with a view to alleviating — if notremoving altogether — the more pressing concerns thatprovide a basis for acts of terror.Even as we remain resolute in the war onterrorism  and focus on the traditional issues of peaceand security  we must be mindful of the need to makeprogress on the internationally agreed MillenniumDevelopment Goals  which world leaders outlined atthe Millennium Summit in 2000. The challenges weface are not confined to the issues of peace and securityas defined in their traditional sense. Indeed  success indealing with threats to international peace and securitymay ultimately depend on the progress we make inovercoming poverty and in dealing with injustice intolerance  deprivation and diseases such as malaria tuberculosis and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.The HIV/AIDS pandemic is one of those non-conventional threats that are fast approaching globalcrises. Even though Africa remains the hardest hit  thedisease is spreading fast in Asia and in Eastern Europe.In the Caribbean — which is second only to sub-Saharan Africa in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates —HIV/AIDS is a major development challengethreatening to reverse years of hard-won humandevelopment gains and increase poverty levels. TheGeneral Assembly has just concluded a high-leveldebate on HIV/AIDS  and my delegation trusts that thatmeeting will provide the necessary impetus and lay thegroundwork for further meaningful support for theGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria.Unless those with the capacity to contribute comeforward with additional resources  many  many morelives will surely be lost.Without a secure and peaceful internationalenvironment  and in the absence of a sustained efforton the part of our development partners to live up tothe commitments made at major United Nationsconferences  there can be no meaningful and sustainedglobal economic advancement for Africa as it seeks toimplement the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment  or for the least developed countries  thelandlocked countries or the small island developingStates.Trinidad and Tobago continues to attach highimportance to the need for the international communityto pay special attention to the unique challenges andproblems which confront small island developingStates and to full and effective implementation of theBarbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. It isfor that reason that we participated actively last year inthe preparatory process for the World Summit onSustainable Development. We were pleased that theJohannesburg Plan of Implementation reinforced theview that small island developing States are a specialcase in terms of both the environment anddevelopment.The Johannesburg Summit also recognized that although small island developing States continue totake the lead in the path towards sustainabledevelopment  they remain increasingly constrained bythe interplay of adverse factors such as their small size fragility  isolation and vulnerability.It is for this reason that Trinidad and Tobago willplay host next week to the Caribbean small islanddeveloping States regional preparatory meeting  one offour regional meetings being held by small islanddeveloping States in order to identify and developinputs for the review of the Barbados Programme ofAction. Implementation has been the Achilles heel ofthe Programme of Action. Small island developingStates have taken the lead in our efforts to achievesustainable development. We need  however  thesupport of the international community.We trust that the international meeting to reviewthe Barbados Programme of Action for the SustainableDevelopment of Small Island Developing States  to beheld in Mauritius in 2004  will not only better enableus to evaluate the Barbados Programme of Action  butultimately lead to an enhanced level of politicalcommitment and increased financial and technicalassistance for small island developing States on thepart of the international community.Another issue of the utmost concern to theGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago and  indeed  to allCARICOM Governments  is the continued trans-shipment of nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea.The reassurances of adequate safeguards do notconstitute guarantees against the potentiallydevastating impact of an accident on our economiesand ecosystems. We therefore once more call upon theStates concerned to cease this practice.Recent events have also pointed to the challengesfaced by many countries in the area of governance. TheGovernment of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago 12which was elected in recent multi-party elections thatwere peaceful  free and fair  is committed to efficientand transparent Government  to ensuring respect forhuman rights and the rule of law  to the devolution ofresources and decision-making to the local levels ofgovernment  and to the meaningful participation of allits citizens in the formulation of public policy.The Government has also set itself the goal ofachieving developed country status by 2020  with theaim of providing to all its citizens by that date a highquality of life in all areas  including education  health employment  housing  transportation  telecommunications water and electricity. This the Government hopes toachieve by allocating a sizeable portion of its nationalbudget to programmes of human-resource developmentand of economic infrastructure and institutionaldevelopment  as well as social programmes aimed atthe eradication of poverty.But our national goals can only be achieved if ourdomestic efforts are complemented by efforts at theinternational level to achieve greater internationaleconomic stability and a more equitable distribution ofresources among States  and if the benefits of free tradeare more widely shared  particularly by those countrieswhose incorporation into the world economy placesthem at a disadvantage vis-à-vis their developedcountry partners. The new opportunities occasioned byglobalization and trade liberalization  which weconsider to be a positive force for good  should beavailable to all  and not to just a privileged few. Wemust avoid further marginalization of the vulnerableStates among us. Given the central role of trade in theachievement of economic expansion  the failure of therecent World Trade Organization meeting in Cancún toagree on issues critical to developing countries doesnot augur well for our future economic well-being orfor that of the least developed  landlocked and smallisland developing States among us. We are hopeful forgreater flexibility on the part of our developedcountries’ negotiating partners in Geneva nextDecember  which is necessary if any progress is to beachieved.The quest for economic and social justice for allpeoples cannot be divorced from the fervent desire ofall peoples to live in freedom and without fear for theirlives. The growing religious and ethnic diversity of oursocieties highlights the ever-present need for mutualrespect for and tolerance of the diversity that today is acharacteristic of many communities. The lack of suchtolerance and respect has fuelled once again in ourlifetime the horrific crimes of genocide  crimes againsthumanity and war crimes.To deter the commission of such crimes in thefuture  and in order to deal with flagrant abuses of thefundamental human rights and freedom of theindividual  including the right to life  liberty andsecurity of the person  the international communityestablished the International Criminal Court (ICC) which this year has made substantial progress inestablishing its principal organs  through the electionof its Judges  Chief Prosecutor  Deputy Prosecutor andthe Registrar.The ICC does not represent victor’s justice  but auniversal and shared symbol of morality based on thefundamental principle that those individuals whocommit the serious crimes within the jurisdiction of theCourt will  with the broad support of the internationalcommunity  be brought to trial before such a tribunal but only where their national Governments are unableor unwilling to do so.Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to theefficient and effective functioning of this permanentInternational Criminal Court  and deplores all efforts toundermine its integrity and the commitment of itsStates Parties to carry out in good faith the obligationsinto which they have freely entered through theiradherence to the Rome Statute of the ICC. We call forwider adherence to the Statute by all States  so that itmay one day have universal application. Only auniversal commitment by all States to strive toeliminate the culture of impunity for such heinouscrimes will successfully stem the tide of the horrificevents that continue to mar our world.Several speakers in this general debate havereferred to the crisis in multilateralism and the need forthe reform of the United Nations to make it morerelevant to present day realities. It is in this context thatthe Government of the Republic of Trinidad andTobago welcomes the call made by the Secretary-General in his statement to the General Assembly on23 September for a thorough restructuring of the post-Second-World-War institutional architecture of theUnited Nations through the reform and strengtheningof its major organs. His stated intention to pursue anapproach through the modality of a panel of eminentpersons enjoys the full support of the Government ofTrinidad and Tobago. We would not wish at this time 13to prejudge the outcome of the work of such a panel but would hope that it will recognize the role that smallStates play in international affairs.We expect the panel’s final recommendations totake the form of specific proposals for amendments tothe Charter that will be able to command the widestpossible support of the international community at thehighest political levels. The reform exercise must haveas its ultimate objective the strengthening of the UnitedNations and an enhancement of its capacity to respondto the new global challenges.We must also ensure that the long overdue reformof the Security Council takes place. Expansion of theCouncil’s membership to make it more democratic andrepresentative can only confer greater legitimacy onthe Council and on the Organization as a whole.Most importantly  we must better empower theGeneral Assembly  the most representative of all theorgans of the United Nations  to play its role moreeffectively as the chief deliberative and policy-makingorgan of the Organization.No other institution has the inclusiveness or thelegitimacy that the United Nations has. We musttherefore spare no effort to make it a more effectiveinstrument in the service of all the peoples of theworld.In conclusion  the stark international situationcalls for more  not less  international cooperation infacing the countless challenges that confront countrieslarge and small. We must seek to implement urgentlynew and better policies aimed at the prevention ofarmed conflict. We must make fuller use of the fewopportunities for economic and social progress thatpresent themselves. We must demonstrate the necessarypolitical will to maintain a peaceful and secureinternational environment that is conducive to theuplifting and well-being of all humanity."
"171",6961,"TUN",58,2003,"﻿Itgives me great pleasure to convey to you  Sir  and toyour friendly country  Saint Lucia  our sincerecongratulations on your election as President of theGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. I amconfident that your great skills and abilities willguarantee the success of our proceedings at thissession. I also would like to express to yourpredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  deep appreciation for hisremarkable stewardship of the fifty-seventh session.I would also like to take this opportunity toextend to Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of theUnited Nations  our thanks and appreciation for histireless efforts to strengthen the role of ourOrganization in order to enable it to attain itsobjectives of achieving peace  security anddevelopment in the world.Since the opening of the previous Assemblysession  the world has witnessed a series ofdevelopments that have contributed to the furtherdeterioration of global security and stability. Crises andconflicts are proliferating  while there has been anincrease in poverty and exclusion and in the spread ofdisease in many parts of the world. Faced with thisarray of challenges  the international community iscalled upon to assume its responsibilities and takeresolute action. All Member States must renew theircommitment to the noble principles enshrined in theCharter of the United Nations  work together in theframework of an international consensus to strengthenthe role of our Organization in the maintenance ofpeace and security and find solutions to currentinternational issues. We are convinced that that is thebest way to ensure that the world is governed by theprinciples of dialogue  cooperation and consensus.The new challenges facing the internationalcommunity and the necessity of establishing relationsbased on justice  equity and harmony  demand that weunite our efforts to ensure that the United Nationsremains the framework for our common endeavours topreserve peace and security — the embodiment ofinternational law  to which all countries must becommitted and which they must implement in a non-selective manner  without double standards.These new challenges also require the UnitedNations to enhance its efficiency and improve itsworking methods  taking into account the nobleprinciples enshrined in the Charter  by strengthening itsmain organs  particularly the Security Council  whichmust regain its credibility with regard to the maintenanceof international peace and security  and by revitalizingand enhancing the role of the General Assembly in theinterests of peace  security and development.In this regard  we support the Secretary-General’scall to accelerate the introduction of necessary reforms and we stress that Tunisia  which has participated inthe past in the debate on these reforms  stands ready tocontinue to contribute effectively to internationalefforts aimed at achieving this objective  which is nowmore urgent than ever.We are convinced that the deterioration of theglobal situation requires the international community toadopt a comprehensive and multidimensional approach based on the interdependence of peace and security onthe one hand  and development on the other. Webelieve that peace and security cannot prevailthroughout the world unless the development needs ofall peoples are addressed. We also recognize thatdevelopment cannot be achieved in the absence ofsecurity and peace for all.Of course the pursuit of such an objective willrequire all members of the international community topool their efforts and show greater solidarity so as toeliminate the root causes of tension and to eradicatepoverty and deprivation  which are breeding groundsfor trouble and instability.Since the change of 7 November 1987  Tunisiahas called for the adoption of such an approach and haspresented  at the regional and international levels numerous initiatives and proposals  whose objective isto build the foundation for a world with a greatercapacity to attain the goal of peace  security anddevelopment and to spread the values of dialogue tolerance and solidarity among all peoples.20In this context  President Zine El Abidine Ben Aliof Tunisia called in 1989  from this lofty rostrum  forthe conclusion of a pact for peace and progress in theframework of the United Nations  drawing together thecountries of the North and the South and based onpeace and justice and the strengthening of cooperationamong all countries of the world.All the initiatives and proposals put forward bythe President of Tunisia since that date have beenconsistent with that call  as they stem from thedetermination of Tunisia and its President to ensure theeffectiveness of our country’s contribution toaddressing issues of peace  security and development particularly in relation to the phenomenon of terrorismand the means of combating it and to theimplementation of mechanisms for conflict resolutionin the Arab and African regions.In line with the comprehensive character of theTunisian approach  the President of Tunisia hasconsistently called on the international community tohelp developing countries strengthen their economiesthrough a number of regional and internationalinitiatives such as those related to debt relief  inparticular debt recycling for middle-income countries;the transfer of science and technology to developingcountries and a call for the convening of a worldsummit on the information society.President Ben Ali also called for thedissemination of the values of solidarity andcompassion as a means of contributing to theeradication of poverty  marginalization and exclusionin all parts of the world — a call that led to theestablishment of the World Solidarity Fund.Tunisia  which has succeeded in creating asecure  stable and well-balanced society that isintegrated into the mainstream of the modern world believes that the well-being of humankind is theultimate objective and  on the basis of its own nationalexperience  that the fight against extremism andterrorism  which constitute a serious threat to the entireworld  cannot succeed unless it is comprehensive andmultidimensional in nature and takes into account notonly the security dimension but also the need toaddress the root causes of the phenomenon.We therefore underscore the necessity of workingto develop a common international approach to fightingthe phenomenon of extremism and terrorism  takinginto account all relevant international conventions.In this context  pending the achievement of thenecessary progress in the adoption of a comprehensiveinternational mechanism to fight terrorism  we wouldlike to reiterate Tunisia’s call for the conclusion of acode of conduct to fight terrorism  to which allcountries adhere and which will include the principlesaround which a consensus could be built. Such a codeof conduct could constitute a common denominator incollectively confronting this phenomenon. Aninternational conference could be convened to lay thegroundwork for such a code of conduct.The wide international support enjoyed by theproposal to establish the World Solidarity Fundtestifies to the need for such a mechanism  which isaimed at reducing the suffering  poverty  exclusion andmarginalization endured by a great number of peoplesthroughout the world  particularly in Africa.While we reiterate our sincere gratitude toMember States for their support for this initiative  weremain convinced that  as the Fund was set up inFebruary 2003 and has become one of the officialmechanisms of the United Nations system  MemberStates will spare no effort in speeding up itsoperationalization  thus allowing it to begin itsactivities as soon as possible and thereby contribute tothe achievement of the Millennium DevelopmentGoals. We therefore urge the international communityand all relevant actors  including State and privateorganizations  to mobilize the necessary financialresources for the Fund so as to allow it to fulfil itsnoble humanitarian objectives. It is also imperative  inthis regard  to speed up the establishment of theproposed high-level committee  whose task is to definethe strategy of the World Solidarity Fund and tomobilize the resources needed for its activities.The widening digital gap between industrializedand developing countries requires us to take thenecessary practical measures to enable all countries ofthe world to take advantage of the broad prospectsprovided by the technological revolution in the field ofcommunications. In that context  Tunisia called for theconvening of a World Summit on the InformationSociety. We are now intensifying our preparation forthe second phase of that Summit  which will be held inTunis in November 2005.While expressing its determination to contributeeffectively to the first phase  which is due to be held inGeneva in December this year  Tunisia will do its21utmost to ensure that the Tunis summit will constitutean opportunity to elaborate a common approach  inorder to contribute to strengthening cooperationbetween all members of the international communityand to consolidate the role of information andcommunication technologies in development. We areconfident that the member States that chose Tunisia tohost the Summit will do their utmost to make thesummit a success.Convinced of the role of sports in strengthening thebonds of friendship  cooperation and rapprochementbetween peoples  and taking into account theimportance of physical education as an instrument toconsolidate the foundations of peace and promotedevelopment in the world  Tunisia decided to present tothis session of the General Assembly a draft resolutionproclaiming the year 2004 an international year ofsports and physical education in the service of peaceand development. We express the hope that thisproposal  which has already received the support of theAfrican Union and the Organization of the IslamicConference  will get wide support from the internationalcommunity and other international sports bodies.The Middle East continues to suffer from a cycleof violence and tension. The road map  which Tunisiasupported  revived hope for the resumption of thepeace process. However  that hope was soon faced withIsrael’s insistence on imposing the reality of occupationand continuous military campaigns against the Palestinianpeople  including the decision to expel President YasserArafat  despite the Palestinian Authority’s readiness tofulfil its commitments in the framework of the roadmap. In the face of the deteriorating situation  webelieve that the international community  particularlythe members of the Quartet  should not allow the willof peace to be defeated and should therefore spare noeffort to enhance the peace process.While reiterating its attachment to the peaceprocess and its determination to contribute effectivelyto its success  Tunisia stresses the need to respect thelegitimacy of the Palestinian Authority and itsleadership  chosen freely by the Palestinian people. Wealso believe that  given the continuing tragic conditionsof the Palestinian people  it is high time to heed the callmade by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali during theExtraordinary Arab Summit held in Cairo in October2000 to provide the Palestinian people withinternational protection  particularly as that call wassupported by many States.The ongoing suffering of the Iraqi people is asource of great concern and profound preoccupation forthe international community. While remaining attachedto the principle of the independence and territorialintegrity of Iraq  we wish to emphasize the need for theinternational community to join hands and for theUnited Nations to assume its central role to ensure thatpeace and stability prevail in that fraternal country thus allowing for the start of reconstruction and thereturn to normal life for the Iraqi people.In that regard  Tunisia hopes that the adoption ofthe first steps  which were welcomed by SecurityCouncil resolution 1500 (2003)  will lead as soon aspossible to restoration of the sovereignty of the Iraqipeople. Furthermore  while condemning in thestrongest possible terms the terrorist attack against theUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad  we pay atribute to the Secretary-General  who  despite thegravity of that painful attack  decided to let the UnitedNations continue to pursue its efforts of helping theIraqi people overcome their present predicament.Tunisia attaches great importance to the variousforms of integration and partnership within the regionalgroupings it belongs to. In that regard  we availourselves of this opportunity to express our deepsatisfaction following the agreement reached betweensisterly Libya and the United States  Great Britain andFrance on the issues relating to the Lockerbie andUnion de transports aériens incidents  followingTripoli’s fulfilment of all its commitments under therelevant Security Council resolutions. We have nodoubt that  now that the sanctions have beencompletely lifted  Libya will fully resume its role in theMaghreb and Mediterranean regions  thus contributingto reinvigorating the Arab Maghreb Union  which willhelp promote more complementarity and integrationbetween the countries of the region and willconsolidate the foundations of security  stability andprosperity in the Maghreb  Arab  African andMediterranean areas.The settlement of this dispute augurs well  as itcoincides with the preparations Tunisia is undertaking tohost the first summit of the 5+5 dialogue  to be held inDecember 2003  among the countries of the Maghreb andthe European countries of the western Mediterranean.We look forward to this event as a step towardsenhancing partnership between the countries of theregion and deepening the values of dialogue  toleranceand moderation among the peoples of that region.22Convinced of the need to strengthen commonArab action and to consolidate the role of the Leagueof Arab States to enable it to attain its noble objectives Tunisia shall endeavour  during its presidency of thenext Arab Summit in 2004  to further strengthen thebonds of cooperation  solidarity and complementarityamong the Arab countries.The most recent African Union Summit  held inMaputo in July 2003  marked the beginning of thelaunching process of the African Union. The AfricanUnion is determined to achieve the objective ofrevitalizing the African continent and to confront theserious challenges it faces. The Union hopes to get thenecessary international support in order to achieve itsgoals.Undoubtedly  the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment (NEPAD)  which is bringing a new visionfor a serious and constructive partnership with theUnited Nations system  its specialized agencies  thedeveloped countries and other relevant institutions deserves the support of the international community.Such support constitutes an incentive for the AfricanUnion to attempt to meet legitimate African needs andaddress all aspects of marginalization in our continent.The difficult global economic environment hashad an adverse impact on the economies of thedeveloping countries in general and the Africaneconomies in particular. Fierce trade competition andprotectionist measures  as well as currency fluctuationsand the exacerbation of the debt burden  constitutemajor constraints that have impeded progress of thedeveloping countries.In that regard  we emphasize the need for allinternational partners to show the political will necessaryto implement the commitments of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals  as well as the outcomes of majorUnited Nations conferences and summits  notably theInternational Conference on Financing forDevelopment held in Monterrey and the World Summiton Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg  ifwe are to overcome this difficult situation and providefresh impetus to development efforts.The difficult situation we face today should notdiscourage us or weaken our determination to achievethe objectives of peace  security and stability. We mustshow patience  resolve and perseverance andcollectively pledge to strengthen the United Nationsand make this session a new starting point for ourOrganization in order to enable it to effectively play itsrole and respond to our collective aspirations for amore secure and stable world."
"172",7008,"TUR",58,2003,"﻿I should like to start byextending our warmest congratulations to you  Mr.President  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session  as well as our fullsupport. I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Kavan the President of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session.The memory of the many innocent people wholost their lives during the horrors of 11 September  andthat of many other victims of terror all over the world including in my country  are still very fresh in ourminds today. We also mourn the painful loss of ourUnited Nations colleagues. They were working in theservice of the international community to secure peaceand to uphold human dignity in Baghdad. The loss ofSergio Vieira de Mello was particularly tragic for us  ashis visit to Ankara two weeks before his tragic deathunfortunately turned out to be his last. Terrorism is acrime against humanity. We are duty-bound toeradicate that evil from the face of the Earth  and soon.We must also not forget that there are other majorchallenges that remain to be addressed  namely poverty  illiteracy  organized crime  the problem ofnarcotics  ecological disasters  epidemics such asAIDS  the issue of refugees  the illegal trade in humanbeings  gender inequality  corruption  racism andxenophobia  among others.In the new global security environment  there is aclear and pressing need to strengthen internationalorganizations and institutions. The United Nations is atthe top of that list. The many challenges facing theworld today underline the central role of the UnitedNations  as has been highlighted so eloquently by theSecretary-General. The efforts to adapt this uniqueOrganization to the realities of today’s international lifeshould be resolutely pursued. The world needs a morerepresentative  effective and efficient United Nations.In close cooperation with the United Nations Turkey has accumulated vast experience over the yearsin the areas of regional cooperation  peacekeeping andconflict prevention. We have also shown a strong willto solve our bilateral foreign policy problems. Todaywe have very good relations with some neighbouringcountries with which we experienced difficulties in therecent past. We are also doing our best to contribute tothe solution of problems in the Middle East  theBalkans and the Caucasus.In order to promote harmony among civilizations we convened a meeting last year in Istanbul betweenthe European Union and the countries of theOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Nextyear  both the NATO summit and the OIC’s ministerialmeeting will be held in that city.My Government’s reforms at home reflect asustained effort to promote democracy  human rights 5the rule of law  civil society  good governance accountability and gender equality to the higheststandards set by the United Nations and the EuropeanUnion. The results show that national and spiritualvalues can be in perfect harmony with contemporaryliving standards. Integration with the world is notpossible without bringing our values and traditions intoharmony with modernity.It is on the strength of that increasingly relevantTurkish experience and on the strength of the richnessof our ties with the international community thatTurkey has decided to present its candidature for a seatin the Security Council for the years 2009-2010.The situation in the Middle East will remain ofcrucial significance for the evolution of theinternational environment for some time to come. Wedo not believe that the Middle East is condemned toeternal strife and suffering. This is one cradle ofcivilization that had enjoyed peace and prosperity forcenturies. That is why we believe that it is feasibletoday to transform the Middle East into a region ofsecurity  cooperation and prosperity. There is an urgentneed today for a fresh start in the region. The situationin Iraq and the Arab-Israeli conflict are at the core ofefforts to bring stability to the region.The events of this year have brought Iraq to thebeginning of a new era. All of us need to help the Iraqination in its formidable task of building a united  free democratic and prosperous future. It is therefore highlyimportant for the Security Council to agree on amandate responsive to the needs of stabilization andreconstruction. Iraq is our close neighbour. Thatcountry’s future and the future of the region’s stabilityare inter-linked.In the Middle East we are again witnessing acycle of terror and violence that is taking hostage allefforts towards peace. We view the restoration of thechannels of communication and dialogue betweenPalestinians and Israelis as the most urgent task athand. We believe that sending the elected President ofthe Palestinian National Authority into exile cannotserve any good purpose. We call upon the IsraeliGovernment to review its position. At the same time we urge the Palestinian side to make every effort toprevent further terrorist attacks. Turkey has close tieswith both Israelis and Palestinians. We remain ready tocontribute to the implementation of the road map  towhich we believe there is no alternative. We are alsowilling to contribute to the improvement of the securityenvironment as needed  and to the alleviation of theharsh living conditions of Palestinians.In order to achieve progress  resources have to beutilized rationally and to the benefit of the people  asthe Iraqi case has shown. The need for reform is not anovelty in the Middle East. What may be new is thegrowing recognition that progress is dependent onpolitical and social factors  as well as on economicones. Gradual steps towards more representative andaccountable structures are being taken by a number ofcountries in the Middle East. They deserve theencouragement of the international community.The world needs the elimination of weapons ofmass destruction. It does not need them to proliferate.The inherent logic of that argument has beenrecognized by the community of nations that haveadhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation ofNuclear Weapons. We strongly support the effortsaimed at increasing membership in non-proliferationagreements and regimes.My country’s regional policies are shaped by ourdesire to achieve durable peace and greater cooperationin our neighbourhood. I have already outlined ourapproach with regard to the Middle East.The Balkans  which is to our west  was in turmoiluntil recently. That region has come to enjoy relativepeace and stability in the past two years. Internationalorganizations  notably NATO  the European Union  theUnited Nations and the Organization for Security andCooperation in Europe  played a major role in thatturnaround. However  the situation in certain parts of theregion should continue to be monitored on an ongoingbasis  as it is a potential source of destabilization.We are determined to further enhance ourrelations with Greece within the current process ofconstructive dialogue. We are pleased with the progressachieved so far  as highlighted by my Greek colleague Mr. Papandreou  in the statement he made thismorning. We have already covered considerableground. We are convinced that the ongoing dialogueand the resulting atmosphere of mutual confidence willserve the interests of both Turkey and Greece.Turkey sincerely desires a lasting politicalsettlement establishing a new partnership in Cyprus.This issue has been with us since 1963. Attempts todistort the facts in the island will not help efforts aimed6at a comprehensive settlement. We continue to supportthe good offices mission of the Secretary-General. Anew partnership in Cyprus should be based on acompromise between Turkish and Greek Cypriots andon equal status. Furthermore  a settlement shouldpreserve the bizonal character of the island and ensurethe security of the Turkish Cypriot people.At the present stage of the situation in Cyprus itis necessary to create a basis for substantivenegotiations. The opportunity created by PresidentDenktas’ latest proposals  which are designed toovercome the lack of confidence between the twosides  should be seized. Indeed  the Greek Cypriot side instead of trying to take advantage of the prospect ofits unilateral accession to the European Union  shouldact in a spirit of goodwill and contribute to thenegotiating process. All embargoes and restrictionsimposed upon the Turkish Republic of NorthernCyprus should be lifted as a matter of priority.The Caucasus is another strategically importantarea of great interest to Turkey. The long-standingconflicts there must end  and good-neighbourlyrelations and regional cooperation should be given areal chance to flourish. The problems of NagornyKarabakh and Abkhazia still endanger peace andstability in the entire region. Turkey expects Armeniato fully comply with the relevant United Nationsresolutions in order to find a prompt and just solutionto the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. The peacefulsettlement of this conflict will contribute to thenormalization of Turkish-Armenian relations and toregional cooperation. As regards the Abkhazianconflict  Turkey believes that a peaceful settlementshould be reached within the context of the territorialintegrity  sovereignty and political unity of Georgia.Close historical and cultural bonds with CentralAsia constitute one of the pillars of our Eurasian vision.We have developed mutually beneficial bilateral relationswith the Central Asian States since their independence.We should make substantial efforts to improve regionalstability and security and continue to support thoseStates with a view to their further integration into theinternational community. We all know that the securityof Central Asia is inseparable from global security.Traditionally a close friend of Afghanistan  Turkeyhas contributed for many years to the rehabilitation of thatcountry. We are pleased that the Bonn process has so farbeen implemented successfully  despite numerousdifficulties. We commend the performance of theTransitional Administration in this respect. The successof the Bonn process will depend to a large extent ongreater support from the international community.We firmly believe that it will not be possible toestablish global stability unless peace  security democracy and sustainable development are promotedin Africa. Recent trends in the management of crises inAfrica  as well as the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment  give us fresh hope in this regard.In conclusion  I should like to stress that Turkeyis determined to remain a major contributor to peace security and stability in our region and beyond. Turkeypursues a multidimensional foreign policy that is activein various regions. We believe in the vital role of theUnited Nations and its increased relevance in the presentinternational environment  and we are committed topromoting the effectiveness of our Organization."
"173",7024,"TUV",58,2003,"﻿The people of Tuvalu on whose behalf I have the honour to speak  wish mefirst of all to convey their warmest greetings to thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Weexpress congratulations to you  Mr. President  on yourelection. Coming from a small island country as well we hold your election in high regard and wish yousuccess in your presidency. We also commend theoutgoing President  Mr. Jan Kavan  for his excellentleadership in the General Assembly this past year.A year ago  we reflected on the events of 11September 2001. On the eve of this session  we werehorrified yet again by the brutal terrorist attacks on theUnited Nations in Iraq  which killed some of theOrganization's finest  including its Special Envoy  Mr.Sergio Vieira de Mello. Tuvalu strongly condemnsthose acts and has joined in the great number ofcondolences to the Secretary-General  to his staff andto the families of the victims.The recent wave of terror attacks and the havocthey have created worldwide have instilled a sense offear and uncertainty. They have not only proved theexistence of forces bent on destroying the veryfoundation of the United Nations  they have alsounderscored the urgency with which we mustcollectively combat those forces. As a small islanddeveloping country  Tuvalu's greatest fear is that  in thewake of such events  developed countries will lack theresolve to address as well the developmental andenvironmental issues that are so fundamental to lastinginternational peace and security.In Tuvalu  and the Pacific in general  ourisolation  fragmentation and lack of infrastructure andmanpower leave us vulnerable to terrorism. Thisthreatens our security  especially the security of ourtraditional and cultural practices upon which our veryexistence depends. Likewise  this also threatens thesecurity of the world. We are therefore grateful for theanti-terrorism efforts of the United Nations incooperation with the Pacific Islands Forum and throughdirect contact with national authorities.For our part  I am pleased to say that Tuvalu iscommitted to acceding to the United NationsConvention against Transnational Organized Crime andits three protocols  as well as United Nationsconventions against terrorism  including theConvention on the Safety of United Nations andAssociated Personnel. In this spirit  we are alsocommitted to regional security arrangements  as set outby the Pacific Islands Forum.But to fulfil our international obligations on anti-terrorism  we need technical and financial assistance.More importantly  capacity-building throughappropriate education and human development  forwhich we seek the support of the internationalcommunity  is vitally important to strengthen ourresilience in the face of such vulnerabilities.Conflict prevention is vital to national  regionaland world peace. Tuvalu shares the view that conflictsare best resolved through dialogue and mutualunderstanding of the root causes. The United Nationsmust continue to address the underlying causes ofconflicts and be the common forum where nationsresolve their differences. Attempts to resolve conflictsby unilateral means outside the United Nationsinevitably result in ongoing mistrust and instability.The stakes are too high to allow this to happen. Wemust continue to engage in constructive dialogue.Let me briefly speak on a related matter. Eachyear  highly radioactive and toxic material passesthrough the Pacific by ship on its way to and fromnorth Asia and Europe. It is known that some of thematerials are weapons-grade. We are concerned about22these shipments because of the massive threat theypose to the Pacific Ocean   a vital source of ourlivelihoods and economic development. We would likethese shipments to cease for the sake of the inhabitantsof the islands and stability of the broader Pacific basin.We believe the United Nations has a veryimportant peacekeeping role to play  and are thereforegrateful for the progress made by the United Nations inrestoring peace in Bougainville  Papua New Guinea.We hope that the United Nations will continue itssupport there  to ensure meaningful opportunities andpeace for the people of Bougainville.Tuvalu noted  however  the manner in which theUnited Nations has handled the conflict in the SolomonIslands. As a small island and a least developedcountry  similarly susceptible to instability  we stronglyfeel that the United Nations must better respond toMember States' concerns  irrespective of politicalaffiliations. The United Nations is a body for allnations  and all nations should be afforded theassistance required of it.In the same spirit  Tuvalu places significantimportance on the need to treat everybody equally  asenshrined in the Charter. Accordingly  Tuvalu believesthat to deny representation at the United Nations to the23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan who are active and responsible participants in worldaffairs  especially in trade  commerce and internationaldevelopment  is unjust and morally wrong. Theirsignificant contributions to technology and their ownneed for access to international support to combat thechallenges of terrorism and health epidemics such asHIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) cannot be continually ignored.In our view the United Nations  which pridesitself on the protection of fundamental human rights including the right to self-determination  and whichupholds the dignity and worth of the human being cannot continue to turn a blind eye to ignore theobvious realities of the situation. Just as the people ofTaiwan have so responsibly contributed to internationaldevelopment  they also need the support of theinternational community. Their continuing isolationcould potentially give rise to serious conflicts.Tuvalu would therefore like to call on this augustbody to seriously and urgently consider the issue ofmembership of the Republic of China on Taiwan in theUnited Nations and its agencies.On 1 October  Tuvalu will mark the twenty-fifthanniversary of its independence. On reflection  we aregrateful for the support of the international community particularly from Tuvalu's traditional development andregional partners over the past quarter century. Guidedby the principles of good governance  respect for therule of law and human rights  democracy and self-determination  to which we are deeply committed  andwith the help of such support  Tuvalu has been able toprosper and enjoy a peaceful and equal coexistencewith the rest of the world. Our future survival as anation is founded on these basic United Nations values.Despite relative stability  we live in constant fearof the adverse impact of climate change. For a coral-atoll nation  sea level rise and more severe weatherevents loom as a growing threat to our entirepopulation. The threat is real and serious  and we likenit to a slow and insidious form of terrorism against us.In this respect  Tuvalu is actively participating inthe United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange and the Kyoto Protocol  and we are extremelygrateful to all the nations that have joined us inresolving this threat. Nevertheless  we are deeplydismayed that key industrialized nations do not shareour concern. Climate change affects all nations.This is not just a problem for small island Stateslike our own. We believe that all nations must takepositive steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.But we also believe that the industrialized world mustact first. It is the emissions from the past that arecreating the problems of today. Steps must be taken toaccount for and redress the emissions of the past. Weimplore all nations to ratify the Kyoto Protocol  as thisis the only appropriate process that will bring abouteffective collective action to resolve this growingthreat.As Tuvalu moves into the twenty-first century  weare also challenged by the many changes that are takingplace in the world  especially those brought about byglobalization. Never before have we faced suchcomplex challenges. Yet  for Tuvalu and others like us while we witness every day the forces of trade communications and travel creating a single globalcommunity  the problems of poverty  marginalizationand environmental decline continue to plague manyparts of the world.The recent breakdown in discussions oninternational trade in Cancun  Mexico  clearly shows23that we live in a very complex world. If nothing else the Cancun meeting was a significant step forward forthe voice of the developing world. No longer are thedeveloping nations willing to accept the rhetoric ofthose who want to impose a trade regime that tends tofavour the wealthy and marginalize the poor.Tuvalu and many island States are in aparticularly weak position to take advantage of theopportunities presented by globalization. There is agenuine need to better recognize the special case ofsmall island developing States and of their need toparticipate in a more equitable globalized world.Sustainable development  particularly for themost disadvantaged and vulnerable States  especiallyfor small island least developed countries is crucial. Ofcourse  we recognize that the primary responsibility forsustainable development rests with each country  on itsown terms. However  as a poorly resourced smallisland least developed countries  even the best effortsto escape the cycle of poverty and marginalization aredoomed without the support of the internationalcommunity  civil society and the private sector.Tuvalu and those like us are encouraged by thecommitment of the international community toaddressing poverty and development challenges  ascontained in the Millennium Development Goals Millennium Declaration and other various UnitedNations development frameworks. But these willremain mere rhetoric unless they translate into realdevelopment that can make a difference on the ground.In that regard  proper and effectiveimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Actionfor the Sustainable Development of Small IslandDeveloping States is crucial for the development ofcountries like Tuvalu. To that end  conducting a fulland comprehensive review of the implementation ofthe Barbados Programme of Action in the lead up tothe International Meeting in Mauritius next year isimperative. We kindly request the United NationsSecretariat to undertake this analysis as a matter ofhigh priority so that we can learn from the past andmove forward in a more positive way.That said  however  the overall decline in officialdevelopment assistance in real terms is cause forserious concern. Despite pledges at the MonterreyConference  major industrialized nations are notfulfilling the minimum target of 0.7 per cent of theirgross national product. For small island States  thatreluctance translates into lower economic growth  aswell as into widening the gap between the leastdeveloped countries and the industrialized nations.Tuvalu therefore appeals to the donor countries tomake serious efforts to meet the United Nationsminimum official development assistance target toenable the least developed countries to attain a betterquality of life for all their peoples.In conclusion  for atoll island States like Tuvalu efforts aimed at sustainable development  peace andsecurity will be meaningless unless the issue of climatechange is addressed with urgency. As has been warnedby the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change inits Third Assessment Report  the threat of globalwarming and rising sea levels is serious business.Addressing these threats requires a global effort byboth industrialized and developing countries  consistentwith the objectives of  and the commitments made in the Framework Convention on Climate Change.Again  Tuvalu's interest in enforcing the KyotoProtocol is not self-serving. The consequences of noturgently enforcing Kyoto will be felt everywherearound the world. Tuvalu appeals to the countries thatcan make the difference to ratify the Kyoto Protocol asa matter of urgency. As we in Tuvalu celebrate ourSilver Jubilee anniversary  and as we look forward intothe future  it is our hope that out of this great Hall therewill emerge better understanding and good will  tofurther solidify the foundation upon which the long-lasting security and survival of Tuvalu and many othersis built and for peace in the world."
"174",7070,"TZA",58,2003,"﻿Itgives me great pleasure on behalf of my delegation toextend to you  Sir  our heartfelt congratulations on yourwell-deserved election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. My delegation isparticularly pleased at the way you have beenconducting the work of the Assembly thus far. Theskills and experience that you bring to the Assemblyhave been amply proven in the past days of ourdeliberations. I wish to assure you of the continuedsupport and cooperation of my delegation.Let me use this opportunity to congratulate yourpredecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for a job well done duringthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.In the same vein  I wish to pay tribute to ourillustrious Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for hisvaliant efforts in bringing the United Nations closer tothe people and in fostering peace and developmentaround the world. He is discharging the functions of hishigh office in such a manner that he has won the heartsand minds of many people the world over.This fifty-eighth session of the General Assemblyis being held at a very momentous time in the historyof the United Nations — a time when multilateralism isfacing serious threats and a time when the UnitedNations  the main embodiment of multilateralism  hasbeen confronting formidable challenges. Never inhistory have the relevance and mandate of the UnitedNations been put to a greater test as in the past fewmonths.Certainly  the tumultuous events of the pastmonths have shaken the very foundation of ourOrganization  but fortunately have not broken it. Weare comforted by the fact that the United Nations haswithstood the test of time and emerged as not onlyrelevant  but indispensable in keeping world peace.Likewise  multilateralism has stood out as the onlyhope for all peoples. As we celebrate the UnitedNations and its success  we should always rememberthat it is our solidarity and steadfast adherence to theideals of the United Nations that have made ourOrganization survive the trials and turbulence of thepast year.I assure the Assembly that the Government andpeople of the United Republic of Tanzania take pride inTanzania’s membership of the United Nations. Weremain committed to its ideals and ready to worktirelessly towards its advancement  strengthening andsuccess.Peace and security still eludes the world  as gunsand explosives continue to thunder and cries of agonycontinue to be heard across the continents. These days violations of human rights have become commonoccurrences  even among the developed countries ofthe world. Wars continue to rage  with Africa and Asia sadly  claiming the largest share. Acts of terror  too continue to resonate all over the world. Since the lastGeneral Assembly session  for example  terrorists havestruck in 12 countries.As a country that has been a victim ofinternational terrorism  Tanzania condemns terrorism whatever the reason and wherever it takes place. MyGovernment remains committed to the war againstterror. In this regard  we will continue to cooperatewith world Governments and institutions of goodwill todefeat terrorism. I take this opportunity to inform theAssembly that Tanzania has ratified all the major anti-terrorism protocols. We have also enacted acomprehensive legislation to deal with terrorism andterrorist acts in our country.It is very saddening to note that even the UnitedNations has become a target of terrorist attacks  asexemplified by the recent tragic bombing of the UnitedNations headquarters in Baghdad  which resulted in thedeath of 23 United Nations staff members  includingthe charismatic diplomat and chief of mission  SergioVieira de Mello and his chief of staff  Nadia Younes.Once again  we condemn this senseless act  whilejoining in mourning our fallen heroes. They died forthe United Nations. They risked their lives and died fora just cause  for which they will be remembered forever in the history of our Organization. Tanzaniaproposes that the United Nations erect a fittingmemorial in their honour and memory.12I mentioned earlier that Africa has had an unfairshare of violent conflicts and wars  especially whenone considers the rampant poverty and low levels ofdevelopment on the continent. However  I dare say with a sense of guarded optimism  that we see aglimmer of hope in the evolutions of processes toresolve some of Africa’s seemingly intractableconflicts. I have in mind the conflicts in Liberia  theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  Burundi  the Sudanand Somalia  where encouraging progress has beenrecorded on the path to finding lasting solutions. Themost welcome development in these conflicts however  is the fact that African nations and leadershave taken the lead in the search for solutions. Theyhave done so under the auspices of the African Unionor their regional economic groupings. In several cases they have also intervened as individuals or as groups ofneighbours or like-minded nations and leaders.Tanzania appreciates the support of the UnitedNations and the international community for the effortsmade by African nations and leaders in the search forpeace on the continent. We appeal for continuedsupport to sustain the peace in the reconstructionphase. Equally important  I appeal for timely supportand action. Experience has shown that the support ofthe international community  including the UnitedNations  in the search for solutions to African conflictsis a bit too slow  or comes a bit too late.My delegation is extremely pleased to have beena witness  on 25 September  of the adoption of theprinciples of good-neighbourly relations andcooperation between the Democratic Republic of theCongo  Burundi  Rwanda and Uganda. It is a welcomeinitiative. We commend the Secretary-General forconceiving the idea. Once again  I register Tanzania’ssupport for the initiative and promise that we shall dowhatever is within our means to promote its success.I would also like to take this opportunity to callon the international community to extend the necessarypolitical  economic and financial support to theTransitional Government in the Democratic Republicof the Congo  under the leadership of President JosephKabila. We consider this critical to keep up themomentum and avoid reversals.The situation in Burundi  regrettably  remainsprecarious. While we welcome the smooth transfer ofpower from President Buyoya to President Ndayizeye we also take note of positive developments under theTransitional Government. However  the Governmentand people of Burundi need to be supported to achievecomprehensive peace and social and economicreconstruction. The regional leaders have been tryingto help on the peace front and will continue to do so.Some progress has been made  but serious challengesstill lie ahead.The unrelenting support of the internationalcommunity  especially the Security Council  istherefore essential. We also call on the internationalcommunity to do more by way of extending economicand financial support to the Transitional Governmentof Burundi. It needs that support to effectively respondto the humanitarian needs in the country.My Government welcomes the decision by theUnited Nations to convene the long awaitedinternational conference on the Great Lakes region.Preparations are progressing well under the ableleadership of Mr. Ibrahima Fall  the Secretary-General’s special representative for the Great Lakesregion. There is good cooperation between him  theAfrican Union and the six core countries of the region.Tanzania feels greatly honoured to be given theopportunity to host the Conference in June 2004. Westand ready to contribute to its success.The Conference will undoubtedly provide animportant forum to all concerned parties to deliberateon important issues of peace  stability and developmentin the region. We also hope that it will give due focusto the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the war-torncountries. I appeal to all in the United Nations toextend the requisite material  financial  political anddiplomatic support to the Conference.We welcome the latest Baker Plan on resolvingthe long-standing Western Sahara problem. We appealto the parties to extend the maximum possiblecooperation to Mr. Baker so that the people of WesternSahara can have an opportunity to determine theirfuture peacefully.Owing to our strategic position in a conflict-ridden region  and our history of stability andtraditional hospitality  Tanzania has played host tothousands of refugees from neighbouring countries.The influx began in 1959 and has not stopped to date.At present  we play host to more than 800 000 refugeesfrom Rwanda  Burundi  the Democratic Republic of theCongo and Somalia. We remain committed to ourinternational obligations under the 1951 Geneva13Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as thecornerstone of international protection. However  our42 years of experience of hosting refugees have madeus see the urgent need to review its relevance andapplication. We are particularly concerned with theconcept and practice of burden-sharing  which does notadequately alleviate the burden of hosting refugees inpoor developing countries like ours. We welcome thenew concept of “Convention Plus” espoused by theHigh Commissioner for Refugees. We hope that newand emerging realities will be given serious thought inthe discussions and conclusions of the HighCommissioner’s Executive Committee.The situation in the Middle East remains a matterof great concern to my Government. When the MiddleEast road map for peace was promulgated a fewmonths ago  we became hopeful. My Governmentsupported it because it addressed comprehensively theissue of the establishment of a viable Palestinian State living side by side and in peace with Israel. Despite thecurrent difficulties  we still believe that the road map isthe most reasonable and viable way of resolving thelong-standing Israel-Palestine conflict. It is imperative therefore  that the obstacles on the road map beovercome quickly. Violence and counter-violence willnot help.We are also of the view that the use of excessiveforce and recourse to extrajudicial measures in dealingwith Palestinian militants  or exiling President YasserArafat  would be counterproductive; it would inflamethe situation. We appeal to the Quartet and the SecurityCouncil to do everything possible to bring theimplementation of the road map back on track.As we all remember  at the dawn of the twenty-first century  the General Assembly at a special sessiondiscussed the challenge of poverty and development.At the end we came up with the MillenniumDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals which embodied a vision of engaging in acomprehensive offensive against poverty  deprivationand lack of development. The clear target of halvingthe scourge of poverty by 2015 was set.When we look back and evaluate what has beenachieved in the three years since the MillenniumSummit  we cannot fail to discover that not much hasbeen done. Provision of the estimated $50 billion to$100 billion additional resources required annuallyover a period of 15 years to finance the implementationof the Millennium Development Goals is far frombeing realized. The subsequent meetings in Monterreyand Johannesburg  as well as the successive G-8summits  have been unable to meet the requirement. Asit stands now  the Millennium Development Goals risknot being implemented as expected. Indeed  somethingneeds to be done quickly to save that historic summit.It is incumbent upon the developed countries todemonstrate greater political will. Certainly failure willnot be good for our Organization and surely it will bebad for all of us.The current wave of globalization is the greatesteconomic process of our time. The unfortunate collapseof the World Trade Organization meeting in Cancúnlast month demands that we face up to thisphenomenon. We hope that summit will be reconvenedsoon. The social imperative of the wave ofglobalization presents us with two interlinkedchallenges that are central to the work of thisOrganization. These pertain  on the one hand  tofighting poverty  and on the other  to working onconstructive and inclusive measures to promote theeffectiveness of global institutions in global issues andconflicts.These concerns have also been at the centre of thework of the World Commission on the SocialDimensions of Globalization  established last yearunder the auspices of the International LabourOrganization (ILO)  with a mandate to promote socialjustice and decent work  linked to economic and socialpolicies for global prosperity. This World Commission which my President is privileged to co-chair withPresident Tarja Halonen of Finland  is about tocomplete its work and is due to submit its report earlynext year.The Commission has been a forum of usefuldialogue between eminent personalities with a widecross-section of backgrounds  views and competencies.It has consulted widely and extensively. Its report isexpected to generate practical ideas for change that canmake the process of globalization more inclusive andmore equitable. It will address the needs of those whofeel marginalized  as well as those who have benefitedfrom globalization but feel uncertain about the future.It will speak of the significance of a value-basedmultilateralism and the role of this Organization.However  the recommendations  mandate andvision of the work of the Commission will not be14undertaken  pursued and achieved through the work ofthe ILO alone. They will constitute a wide remit forother agencies of the United Nations  other multilateralagencies  regional groupings  individual Governments non-governmental organizations and civil society. It isalso hoped that the report will be submitted to thisAssembly for consideration and appropriatepromotional direction.It is the hope of my delegation that theCommission’s report will be a welcome basis forcollective and concerted action towards the attainmentof the Millennium Development Goals and in renderingglobalization a process that works for all  in allcountries  within countries and between countries.I would like to associate myself with thestatement made this morning by the PermanentRepresentative of Finland concerning the launching ofa Helsinki process on global governance anddemocracy  with which my Government feels proud tobe associated.The fight against AIDS remains a majorchallenge to mankind today. It is a war that we mustfight and win. We realize the dire consequences of thepandemic on human life and on our economies. Thehigh-level plenary meeting held last week wasreassuring and most of us came away from the sessionmodestly optimistic. Certainly  our resolve to squarelyface up to the pandemic and to meet the set targets hasto be coupled with equal responsibility for leadershipinitiatives  accountability and more judicious resourcemobilization and management.Reform of the United Nations Security Councilhas been in the cards for some time now. Tanzania isconvinced that the reform of the Security Council isdesirable  to make this important organ of ourOrganization more representative  more democratic more transparent and more measured in the conduct ofits business. We believe that this will go a long waytowards renewing the confidence and support ofMember States in the relevance and effectiveness of theOrganization.Tanzania accepts the truism that reform is aprocess and not an event. We support the establishmentof the high-level panel of eminent personalities toreview the functioning of major organs of the UnitedNations. We look forward to its early constitution. Weattach special importance to this process and promiseto play our part."
"175",7113,"UGA",58,2003,"﻿On behalf of theUganda delegation  I wish to congratulate you Mr. President  on your election to preside over thefifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We areconfident that  under your able leadership  we shallachieve the objectives of our deliberations. Let me alsothank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for theexcellent leadership he has provided to the UnitedNations during a very trying and difficult year.My country attaches great importance to thecentrality of the United Nations in the maintenance ofinternational peace and security and in fosteringinternational development cooperation. In that regard Uganda hopes that this session of the GeneralAssembly will focus on the critical reform of theUnited Nations to meet the new challenges tomultilateralism.Terrorism has reached epic proportions as a threatto international peace and security. Particularly since11 September  terrorist organizations haveindiscriminately attacked  killed and maimed thousandsof innocent civilians in Asia  the Middle East  Africa Europe and the Americas. In northern Uganda  aterrorist organization called the Lords Resistance Armyhas killed hundreds  displaced thousands and abductedchildren into forced recruitment and sale in slavery.On 19 August  the terrorists chose to strike at theheart of the United Nations. They attacked the UnitedNations offices in Baghdad. That callous attack led tothe death of innocent Iraqis and many members of theUnited Nations staff  including the Secretary-General’sSpecial Representative  Sergio Vieira de Mello. Onbehalf of the Government and people of Uganda  I wishto express sincere condolences to the Secretary-General and to the bereaved families. We mustcondemn those acts of terrorism in the strongest terms and the international community must unite to fightthis scourge. Under no circumstances shouldindiscriminate use of violence be justified.We must acknowledge that the emergence of newthreats such as terrorism and weapons of massdestruction  combined with genocide and the massiveviolation of human rights  poses a clear and presentchallenge to the United Nations.My country  therefore  shares the view of theSecretary-General that the time has come to examinethe fundamental policy issues and structuralmechanisms that may be needed to deal with these newchallenges. We support his proposal to establish agroup of eminent persons to make recommendationsregarding the necessary reforms of the Security2Council and other United Nations institutions andprocesses.On the situation in the Middle East  Ugandawelcomes the Quartet-led road map for acomprehensive settlement. We support theestablishment of a Palestinian State living side by sideand in peace with Israel  within secure and recognizedborders  in accordance with the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions.I now turn to the Great Lakes region of Africa.We are pleased to note that there have been positivedevelopments as a result of regional and internationalefforts to build peace and stability in the region. In theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  the TransitionalGovernment of National Unity has been established inaccordance with the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement andthe related Pretoria and Luanda Agreements  as well asthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council.Uganda remains committed to supporting thepeace process in the Democratic Republic of theCongo  including ending the Lendu-Hema inter-ethnicconflict in the Ituri Province. Uganda encouraged theSecurity Council to establish a robust force of theUnited Nations Organization Mission in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)  underChapter VII  for peacekeeping operations in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo  including thedisarmament  demobilization  rehabilitation resettlement and reintegration of negative forces.In that regard  Uganda welcomes SecurityCouncil resolution 1493 (2003). My country providedEntebbe airbase for logistical support to the EuropeanUnion-led stabilization force in Bunia in July  2003.We have also concluded an agreement with MONUC toutilize Entebbe airbase  as well as the Kasese and AruaAirports  for United Nations operations in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.With regard to the situation in Burundi  theimplementation of the Arusha Peace and ReconciliationAgreement remains on track  under the regionalinitiative presided over by President Museveni ofUganda and facilitated by Deputy President Zuma ofSouth Africa. The African Union mission in Burundihas been established. We call upon the internationalcommunity  including the Security Council  to providethe necessary support for the mission.On the situation in the Sudan  the Government ofUganda commends the Government of the Sudan andthe Sudan People’s Liberation Army for the historicagreement on security arrangements  signed inNaivasha  Kenya  last week. We urge the parties toexpedite the negotiation of the remaining issues so thata comprehensive agreement can be reached. Therestoration of peace  security and political stability inthe Sudan is not only good for the long-sufferingpeople of that country  but also for Africa as a whole.Uganda particularly welcomed the initiative ofthe Secretary-General to convene a high-level meeting which adopted the Principles on Good-NeighbourlyRelations and Cooperation between the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo  Burundi  Rwanda and Ugandaon 25 September. Our countries pledged to refrain frominterfering directly or indirectly in one another’sinternal affairs  including making sure that none of theneighbouring countries’ territory is used to arm  supplyor host any hostile elements or armed groups againstthe other.These efforts  aimed at the restoration of peace security  political stability and good-neighbourliness are not only good for the Great Lakes region  but alsofor Africa and indeed the entire internationalcommunity. Uganda strongly believes that these arenecessary pre-conditions for regional integration andthe promotion of trade and investment to meet theneeds of our people. To that end  Uganda welcomesand supports the forthcoming United Nationsconference on the Great Lakes region.Despite many commitments already made atvarious international forums  the internationalcommunity has yet to demonstrate sufficient politicalwill to mobilize adequate resources to meet theMillennium Development Goals and to ensureequitable sharing of the benefits of globalization forall. The failure of the World Trade OrganizationMinisterial Conference  held at Cancún  vividlydemonstrates this.Since the Millennium Summit in 2000  importantplans of action  declarations and strategies have beenagreed upon  inter alia  in Brussels  Doha  Monterrey Johannesburg and Almaty  for the achievement ofsustainable development and the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. The challenge for the internationalcommunity now is to ensure their full and effectivefollow-up and implementation. The international3community must accord special priority to thedevelopment needs of the landlocked and leastdeveloped countries  in order to facilitate their fullintegration into the global system. Although officialdevelopment assistance will continue to play animportant role in development  Uganda regards trade asthe single most important external source ofdevelopment financing and productivity growth. In thisrespect  the Doha Development Agenda should ensurethat the least developed countries not only have accessto markets  but also attain capacity to producecompetitively for those markets. We call upon thedeveloped countries to show the necessary flexibility especially on the question of agricultural subsidies  toallow for the full and timely completion of thecomprehensive agenda agreed upon at Doha.The fifty-seventh United Nations GeneralAssembly endorsed the New Partnership for Africa’sDevelopment (NEPAD) as a home-grown Africanframework for international development cooperationwithin the continent. We reiterate the call made lastweek from this podium by the current Chairman of theAfrican Union  President Joachim Chissano ofMozambique  for strong and effective support forNEPAD by the international community.In summary  my country has supported the callfor collective action against terrorism and weapons ofmass destruction. We have noted the positivedevelopments in the Great Lakes region and expressedour commitment to building a peaceful and stableregion. We have also underscored the need for urgentand effective implementation of agreed upon plans ofaction to meet the Millennium Development Goals andto assure practical support for NEPAD. Finally  Ugandahas reaffirmed its full commitment to the purposes andprinciples of the United Nations."
"176",7160,"UKR",58,2003,"﻿I should like at theoutset to congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte on his electionto the high post of President of the General Assemblyat its fifty-eighth session. I should also like to paytribute to his predecessor  Mr. Jan Kavan  for hisprofessionalism and very fruitful work at the helm ofthe General Assembly during the previous session.Three years ago here at United NationsHeadquarters we solemnly adopted the MillenniumDeclaration  which embodied our hopes andexpectations for a more secure and just world. Shortlythereafter  however  the world had to face new anddaunting challenges. Unfortunately  the tragic events of11 September 2001 were not the last in a sequence ofhorrible acts of terror.Just last month  on 19 August  the United Nationssuffered irreplaceable losses in Iraq. With a feeling ofdeep sorrow  I bow my head in memory of the UnitedNations staff who lost their lives. We lost excellent talented and dedicated people  among them the Head ofthe United Nations Mission in Iraq  the outstandingBrazilian diplomat Sergio Vieira de Mello.It is a sad and disturbing fact that during recentyears United Nations staff have been facing growinginsecurity. This makes it all the more urgent for allmembers of the international community to fullycomply with the relevant international treaties  first andforemost  the Convention on the Safety of UnitedNations and Associated Personnel. As one of theinitiators of that Convention  Ukraine decisively callsupon all States that have not yet done so to accede tothe treaty.Our country joined the anti-terrorist coalition atthe very outset and has made a significant contributionto its activities. We are determined to remain in theranks of the coalition until international terrorism as aglobal threat can be taken off the world's agenda. Ibelieve  however  that not everything has been done todate to prevent terrorist activities.I have in mind first of all effective measures tocounter the proliferation of weapons of massdestruction. Ukraine unreservedly stands for acomprehensive strengthening of the system of universal9international treaties aimed at preventing the nuclearthreat.An effective response to new challenges requiresurgent action to reform the United Nations  first andforemost the Security Council. I am confident thatfurther delay in the long-overdue reforms could resultin a serious crisis of confidence for the United Nations.We cannot let that happen. There can be no viablealternative to the United Nations as a unique globalOrganization. As for the task of reforming the UnitedNations  we must admit that today there are morequestions than there are answers.In this context  the successful reforms in the areaof United Nations activities for peacekeeping andconflict prevention can serve as a good example for allof us. In many situations of armed conflict  the UnitedNations now acts flexibly  rapidly and effectively. I ampleased to note that over the past several years Ukrainehas been playing a leading role among the countriescontributing troops to United Nations peacekeepingoperations. I believe that conflict prevention shouldbecome a key element of the philosophy of the work ofthe United Nations in the new millennium. Ukrainefully supports the Secretary-General's efforts aimed atstrengthening that component of United Nationsactivities.In my address at the Millennium Summit  Istressed the need for the international community toelaborate a comprehensive strategy on conflictprevention. In my opinion  peacekeeping operationswith a preventive mandate from the Security Councilcould become one of the key instruments of such asystem. We also need to further develop and improvethe principles and mechanisms relating to theapplication of international sanctions aimed at curbingthe supply of weapons to conflict zones.With regard to the situation in Iraq  I would liketo express confidence that the tragic losses in Baghdadwill not diminish the international community'scommitment to providing support to the Iraqi peoplefor the renewal of their country. The sense of commonresponsibility for the destiny of the long-suffering Iraqination and for peace and security in that region was theimperative that guided our decision to dispatch amilitary contingent to the Persian Gulf.I hope that the adoption by the Security Councilof a resolution on the establishment of an internationalforce for the maintenance of peace and security in Iraqunder the auspices of the United Nations will enable asmany countries as possible to join those efforts.After many months of a slide towards the abyss  atruly historic opportunity arose for achieving peace inthe Middle East. Last May  the United NationsInternational Meeting in Support of Middle East Peacewas held in Kiev at the initiative of Ukraine. It became in effect  the first international forum at which the roadmap put forward by the Quartet gained the support of alarge number of States Members of the United Nations.We sincerely hope that the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian peace dialogue will not be blocked byobstacles created by the current controversies.Ukraine shares the concern expressed in thereport of the Secretary-General on the implementationof the Millennium Declaration that the internationalcommunity is not paying sufficient attention to tryingto resolve the chronic global development problemssuch as poverty  the HIV/AIDS pandemic  environmentpollution and other issues. Despite repeateddeclarations   primarily by the developed countries  of their readiness to increase the volume of financialand other assistance to tackle issues of sustainabledevelopment  the actual efforts that have beenundertaken have not been sufficient for the timelyattainment of the goals set forth in the MillenniumDeclaration.In this context  I would like to recall that Ukrainemade a tangible contribution towards a peaceful andsafe world in the twenty-first century by renouncing itsnuclear arsenal   one of the most powerful onEarth   and by decommissioning the Chernobylnuclear power plant. In assuming the burden of thelarge-scale effort to transform the area of thecatastrophe into an ecologically safe zone and toresolve unprecedented economic  social andhumanitarian problems  we relied upon theunderstanding and support of the entire internationalcommunity.Today  welcoming the work of this Organizationand its Member States with regard to theimplementation of the United Nations strategy onChernobyl  I express the hope that more decisive stepswill be taken in support of our efforts. I am confidentthat the adoption of a resolution on this question at thecurrent session of the General Assembly will provideadditional impetus for our cooperation on theChernobyl issue.10Finally  I would like to draw the attention of theparticipants of this meeting to one other matter.Seventy years ago the totalitarian Soviet regimeengineered an artificial famine in Ukraine  whichclaimed the lives of between 7 million and 10 millionof our compatriots.Unfortunately  the world did not respond to ourtragedy back in 1933. The international communitybelieved the cynical propaganda of the Soviet Union which was selling bread abroad while  in Ukraine hunger was killing 17 people every minute. From thisrostrum  I should like to call upon all Members tosupport Ukraine's initiative that the United Nations paytribute to the memory of those who perished. We donot want to settle scores from the past; we simply wantas many people as possible to learn about our tragedy.That knowledge will help us to avoid similarcatastrophes in the future.As the Secretary-General recently stated - andquite rightly - thanks to the past century'sachievements  the world became a world of increasingopenness and freedom; of growing mutual confidence;above all  a world of hope.' Today  we aredemonstrating the ability to take concerted andresponsible action in the face of conflicts  challengesand global threats. In that  the principal guarantee I seeis that we will be able to achieve the noble goalssolemnly proclaimed three years ago in the MillenniumDeclaration."
"177",7207,"URY",58,2003,"﻿Uruguay believes in the United Nations  has faith in theUnited Nations  will support the Organization and willcontinue to contribute to it  as it has been doing since itbecame one of its founding Members. It is comfortingto note that  at this time of crisis for the Organization virtually all the participants in this debate haveexpressed this same sentiment.Some six decades ago  the United Nations wascreated to promote and regulate multilateralcooperation  by which the international communityagreed to address and resolve common problems. Thestructure of the Organization  the functioning of itsorgans  and the rights and obligations of its Members as formulated in the San Francisco Charter  allreflected the international political reality of that time.But  over the course of more than half a century there have been profound changes in the structure ofinternational society. Its actors have multiplied andbecome more diverse and there have been new andmore dangerous manifestations of violence. Newthreats to peace that were not foreseen by the draftersof the Charter occur with increasing frequency. At thesame time  there has been an intensification of certaingrowing trends that seriously affect the well-being ofhumanity  such as the degradation of the environment 18the depletion of natural resources  epidemics and thecontrast between consumer societies and societies thatlive in extreme poverty.In recent years  and in particular during thisgeneral debate  special emphasis has been placed onthe need to reform and revitalize the United Nations inorder to adapt it to current realities. Uruguay sharesthis position  not only because it considers that thisOrganization has not been completely effective in itshandling of some recent crises  but because itunderstands that the scale of the changes in the worldtoday justifies the search for ways of adapting theinstitution.Although it is true that the system of collectivesecurity established by the San Francisco Charter hasnot always been able to respond to crises effectively  innumerous cases multilateral action by the UnitedNations has succeeded in restoring peace in manyregions and countries  contributed to the consolidationof democracy  and accelerated the reconstruction ofaffected countries. There are many more cases in whichthe Organization  through its various organs  hasexercised positive and decisive control over crises andconflicts  thus preventing the situation from becomingworse and ensuring a peaceful solution.The process of reform  which is indispensableand cannot be delayed  should in our view be based onthe following premises.The first is to preserve intact the purposes andprinciples of the Organization  as enshrined in theCharter of San Francisco. After all  if we all gatherhere every year as the United Nations  it is because ournations are united around the values and idealsenshrined in the Charter and shared by all mankind whose permanent and universal validity transcends thevicissitudes and accidents of history.The second premise is that the reform processshould be aimed principally at strengtheningmultilateral action  because never before has the needto cooperate and act together to deal with internationalproblems been so great. Common global responses areneeded to the proliferation and diversification ofinternational actors; the fact that the world is gettingsmaller and more and more interdependent  due to theincrease in trade and the extraordinary development ofinformation and communication technologies; andabove all the globalization of threats to peace  securityand the well-being of our peoples. To use the wordsemployed by the Secretary-General in this Assemblytwo weeks ago  Uruguay believes in “collectiveanswers to our common problems and challenges”(A/58/PV.7).Two years ago  the international community through the United Nations organs  offered a fineexample of solidarity by taking effective multilateralaction in reaction to international terrorism  whichthreatens Governments  peoples  ideologies  religionsand above all human reason  imbued with suchelementary values as tolerance  compassion  solidarityand respect for human rights.The attack on the headquarters of the UnitedNations in Baghdad — for which we wish again toexpress our most sincere condolences to the Secretary-General — is but another example of the barbarity andfanaticism that we can successfully fight only if wework together. With this attack  terrorism has given usa raw example of its destructive universality. Thedeaths of Special Representative Sergio Vieira deMello and of other colleagues is emblematic of thetragedy suffered.Just as in the fight against poverty  terrorismcannot be defeated as a conventional enemy would bewith a victorious battle. The eradication of terrorism isan ongoing objective whose achievement requires time patience and perseverance. Only through a jointapproach and multilateral action directed above all atthe roots of terrorism — not only at its atrociousmanifestations — will it be possible to reduce andhopefully to eliminate this perverse and ubiquitousenemy and at the very least ensure its total rejection.Uruguay  which is party to most internationalanti-terrorism instruments  attaches priority to theconclusion of a general convention againstinternational terrorism. In this respect  we wish toexpress our satisfaction to the Secretary-General forhaving chosen transnational organized crime andterrorism as an item in the signing and accessionceremony for treaties promoted by the Organization onthe occasion of this general debate.The third premise to which my country subscribesis that we must not forget that the United Nations hasfor years now been engaged in a process of self-criticism and self-reform based on the idea thatstrengthening an institution means strengthening itsorgans. Reforms are being implemented in three of themain organs of the Organization. The modalities of19each one of the respective processes differ. In theSecurity Council  we are pursuing reform of itsmembership to make it more representative and tostrengthen its democratic character. In the GeneralAssembly  we are pursuing its revitalization so that itsdecisions can regain the authority they had in the past.In the Secretariat  the purpose of change is to enhanceits effectiveness  an objective towards which theSecretary-General is working strenuously. These threeprocesses are closely linked to each other but  despitethis close link  we believe that they must continue to bepursued  as is now being done  separately  each one inits respective forum.For Uruguay  one of the most important aspectsof these reforms is the strengthening of the GeneralAssembly  over which you  Sir  are presiding with suchdignity and whose decisions are the most genuinemanifestations of the will of the internationalcommunity. Recent reforms are aimed at making thisorgan more effective  but more profound changes arerequired in order to restore the authority which theCharter grants it and which the Assembly has exertedin the past. We believe that there is still a great deal ofroom for reform. Obsolete structures and proceduresremain. We also need to re-examine and evaluate theorganization  conduct and outcome of the annualsession that brings us all here together every year including the idea of concentrating the negotiation ofdozens of resolutions into a few weeks. Uruguay willsupport far-reaching measures to revitalize theAssembly. A better relationship between the differentorgans is no doubt another of the necessary areas forreform.The fourth and final premise is that the efforts toreform our institutions must be complemented byequally vigorous efforts to change our own conduct asMembers of the United Nations. When we agreed tobecome Members of this Organization  we freelyagreed to fulfil in good faith the internationalobligations arising from the numerous treaties conventions and other instruments that have resultedfrom the comprehensive legislative work accomplishedby this Assembly  United Nations agencies and otherinternational organizations and conferences.However  the provisions of many of theseinstruments are not being implemented. At times  in amisguided defence of sovereignty  commonexpectations are thwarted in order to satisfy nationalinterests that frequently are not of decisive importance.Protection of the environment and the law of the seaare good  but not the only examples of areas in which asharp contrast can be seen between the extensivelegislation that exists and the degree ofimplementation. Consequently  year after year  thecompetent international agencies and organizations andscientific authorities report the ongoing deterioration ofthe general environment  the abusive exploitation ofnatural resources  pollution of the seas and reduction orextinction of marine species.The question of the fulfilment of obligationsassumed is the weak link in the chain ofmultilateralism. We must seek ways of ensuring respectfor international obligations. Over the long term  thesatisfaction of common interests is the best way ofsatisfying the national interest.Without prejudice to this profession of faith in theUnited Nations  Uruguay  a country of Latin America is actively participating in the Organization ofAmerican States and in the inter-American system ingeneral. Uruguay is also fully committed to regionalintegration processes  in particular to the CommonMarket of the South. We see in these mechanisms apromising avenue to help overcome the difficulties thatresult from our status as a developing country emergingfrom the most serious economic crisis of its history andtrying to overcome the obstacles preventing it fromachieving insertion into the global economy  such as for example  the huge subsidies that the industrializedcountries grant to their agricultural producers.In this connection  finally  we cannot but mentionthe recent ministerial conference of the World TradeOrganization  held in Cancún  whose lack of progress in our opinion  is a negative signal to a world that isdemanding fairer and more balanced rules  especiallyfor countries such as Uruguay  whose economies relyprimarily on the production of agricultural goods. Weare hopeful that renewed impetus in the negotiationswill permit us to achieve positive results in the comingweeks and months in Geneva  to the benefit of the lessdeveloped countries and the very future of internationaltrade.I close my statement conveying my country’ssatisfaction and pride in seeing you  Sir  the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia  a friendly country ofour region  presiding over this Assembly. I wish youevery success in your work."
"178",7254,"USA",58,2003,"﻿Twenty-four months ago  andyesterday in the memory of America  the centre of NewYork City became a battlefield  and a graveyard  andthe symbol of an unfinished war. Since that day terrorists have struck in Bali  in Mombassa  in9Casablanca  in Riyadh  in Jakarta  in Jerusalem measuring the advance of their cause in the chaos andinnocent suffering they leave behind.Last month  terrorists brought their war to theUnited Nations itself. The United Nations headquartersin Baghdad stood for order and compassion. For thatreason  the terrorists decided it must be destroyed.Among the 22 people who were murdered was SergioVieira de Mello. Over the decades  that good and braveman from Brazil gave help to the afflicted inBangladesh  Cyprus  Mozambique  Lebanon Cambodia  Central Africa  Kosovo and East Timor  andwas aiding the people of Iraq in their time of need.America joins you  his colleagues  in honouring thememory of Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and the memoryof all those who died with him in the service of theUnited Nations.By the victims they choose and by the means theyuse  the terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in.Those who target relief workers for death have setthemselves against all humanity. Those who incitemurder and celebrate suicide reveal their contempt forlife itself. They have no place in any religious faith they have no claim on the world's sympathy  and theyshould have no friend in this Hall.Events during the past two years have set beforeus the clearest of divides: between those who seekorder and those who spread chaos  between those whowork for peaceful change and those who adopt themethods of gangsters  between those who honour therights of man and those who deliberately take the livesof men  women and children without mercy or shame.Between those alternatives there is no neutralground. All Governments that support terror arecomplicit in a war against civilization. No Governmentshould ignore the threat of terror because to look theother way gives terrorists the chance to regroup  recruitand prepare. All nations that fight terror as if the livesof their own people depended on it will earn thefavourable judgement of history.The former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knewthose alternatives and made their choices. The Talibanwas a sponsor and servant of terrorism. Whenconfronted  that regime chose defiance  and that regimeis no more. Afghanistan's President  who is here today now represents a free people who are building a decentand just society. They are building a nation fully joinedin the war against terror.The regime of Saddam Hussain cultivated ties toterror while it built weapons of mass destruction. Itused those weapons in acts of mass murder and refusedto account for them when confronted by the world. TheSecurity Council was right to be alarmed. The SecurityCouncil was right to demand that Iraq destroy itsillegal weapons and prove that it had done so. TheSecurity Council was right to vow seriousconsequences if Iraq refused to comply. And becausethere were consequences   because a coalition ofnations acted to defend the peace and the credibility ofthe United Nations   Iraq is free  and today we arejoined by the representatives of a liberated country.Saddam Hussain's monuments have beenremoved  and not only his statues. The true monumentsof his rule and his character   the torture chambers the rape rooms and the prison cells for innocentchildren   are closed. And as we discover the killingfields and mass graves of Iraq  the true scale ofSaddam's cruelty is being revealed.The Iraqi people are meeting hardships andchallenges  like every nation that has set out on thepath of democracy. Yet  their future promises lives ofdignity and freedom  and that is a world away from thesqualid  vicious tyranny they have known. Across Iraq life is being improved by liberty. Across the MiddleEast  people are safer because an unstable aggressorhas been removed from power. Across the world nations are more secure because an ally of terror hasfallen.Our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq weresupported by many Governments  and America isgrateful to each one. I also recognize that some of thesovereign nations of the Assembly disagreed with ouractions. Yet  there was and there remains unity amongus on the fundamental principles and objectives of theUnited Nations. We are dedicated to the defence of ourcollective security and to the advance of human rights.Those permanent commitments call us to great work inthe world  work that we must do together. So  let usmove forward. First  we must stand with the people ofAfghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stablecountries. The terrorists and their allies fear and fightthis progress above all because free people embracehope over resentment and choose peace over violence.The United Nations has been a friend of theAfghan people  distributing food and medicine  helpingrefugees return home  advising on a new constitution10and helping to prepare the way for nationwideelections. NATO has taken over the United Nationsmandated security force in Kabul. American andcoalition forces continue to track and defeat al Qaedaterrorists and the remnants of the Taliban. Our effortsto rebuild that country go on. I have recently proposedto spend an additional $1.2 billion for the Afghanreconstruction effort  and I urge other nations tocontinue contributing to that important cause.In the nation of Iraq  the United Nations iscarrying out vital and effective work every day. By theend of 2004  more than 90 per cent of Iraqi childrenunder age five will have been immunized againstpreventable diseases such as polio  tuberculosis andmeasles  thanks to the hard work and high ideals ofUNICEF. Iraq's food distribution system is operational delivering nearly a half million tons of food per month thanks to the skill and expertise of the World FoodProgramme.Our international coalition in Iraq is meeting itsresponsibilities. We are conducting precision raidsagainst terrorists and holdouts of the former regime.Those killers are at war with the Iraqi people. Theyhave made Iraq the central front in the war on terror.And they will be defeated. Our coalition has made surethat Iraq's former dictator will never again useweapons of mass destruction. We are now interviewingIraqi citizens and analysing records of the old regimeto reveal the full extent of its weapons programmes andits long campaign of deception. We are training Iraqipolice  border guards and a new army so that the Iraqipeople can assume full responsibility for their ownsecurity.At the same time  our coalition is helping toimprove the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The oldregime built palaces while letting schools decay  so weare rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The oldregime starved hospitals of resources  so we havehelped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. Theold regime built up armies and weapons while allowingthe nation's infrastructure to crumble  so we arerehabilitating power plants  water and sanitationfacilities  bridges and airports. I have proposed toCongress that the United States provide additionalfunding for our work in Iraq  the greatest financialcommitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan.Having helped to liberate Iraq  we will honourour pledges to Iraq  and by helping the Iraqi peoplebuild a stable and peaceful country we will make ourown countries more secure.The primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-government for the people of Iraq  reached by anorderly and democratic process. That process mustunfold according to the needs of Iraqis  neither hurriednor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And theUnited Nations can contribute greatly to the cause ofIraqi self-government.America is working with friends and allies on anew Security Council resolution  which will expand theUnited Nation's role in Iraq. As in the aftermath ofother conflicts  the United Nations should assist indeveloping a constitution  training civil servants andconducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has aGoverning Council  the first truly representativeinstitution in that country. Iraq's new leaders areshowing the openness and tolerance that democracyrequires  and they are also showing courage. Yet everyyoung democracy needs the help of friends. Now thenation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid  and allnations of good will should step forward and providethat support.The success of a free Iraq will be watched andnoted throughout the region. Millions will see thatfreedom  equality and material progress are possible atthe heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region willface the clearest evidence that free institutions andopen societies are the only path to long-term nationalsuccess and dignity. And a transformed Middle Eastwould benefit the entire world by undermining theideologies that export violence to other lands.Iraq as a dictatorship had great power todestabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy willhave great power to inspire the Middle East. Theadvance of democratic institutions in Iraq is setting anexample that others  including the Palestinian people would be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause isbetrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding oldhatreds and destroying the good work of others. ThePalestinian people deserve their own State. They willgain that State by embracing new leaders committed toreform  to fighting terror and to building peace.All parties in the Middle East must meet theirresponsibilities and carry out the commitments theymade at Aqaba. Israel must work to create theconditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian Stateto emerge. Arab nations must cut off funding and other11support for terrorist organizations. America will workwith every nation in the region that acts boldly for thesake of peace.A second challenge we must confront together isthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Outlaw regimes that possess nuclear  chemical andbiological weapons and the means to deliver themwould be able to use blackmail and create chaos inentire regions. Those weapons could be used byterrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on ascale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combinationof outlaw regimes  terror networks and weapons ofmass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wishedaway. If such a danger is allowed to fully materialize all words  all protests  will come too late.Nations of the world must have the wisdom andthe will to stop grave threats before they arrive. Onecrucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials attheir source. For more than a decade  the United Stateshas worked with Russia and other States of the formerSoviet Union to dismantle  destroy or secure weaponsand dangerous materials left over from another era.Last year in Canada  the G-8 nations agreed toprovide up to 20 billion dollars  half of it from theUnited States  to fight this proliferation risk over thenext ten years. Since then  six additional countries havejoined the effort. More are needed  and I urge othernations to help us meet this danger.We are also improving our capability to interdictlethal materials in transit. Through our ProliferationSecurity Initiative  eleven nations are preparing tosearch planes  ships  trains and trucks carrying suspectcargo and to seize weapons or missile shipments thatraise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreedon a set of interdiction principles consistent withcurrent legal authorities  and we are working to expandthe Proliferation Security Initiative to other countries.We are determined to keep the world's most destructiveweapons away from all our shores and out of the handsof our common enemies.Because proliferators will use any route orchannel that is open to them  we need the broadestpossible cooperation to stop them. Today I ask theUnited Nations Security Council to adopt a newantiproliferation resolution. That resolution should callon all Members of the United Nations to criminalizethe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  toenact strict export controls consistent with internationalstandards and to secure any and all sensitive materialswithin their own borders. The United States standsready to help any nation draft these new laws and toassist in their enforcement.A third challenge we share is a challenge to ourconscience. We must act decisively to meet thehumanitarian crises of our time. The United States hasbegun to carry out the Emergency Plan for AIDSRelief  aimed at preventing AIDS on a massive scaleand treating millions who have the disease already. Wehave pledged 15 billion dollars over five years to fightAIDS around the world.My country is acting to save lives from famine aswell. We are providing more than 1.4 billion dollars inglobal emergency food aid  and I have asked ourUnited States Congress for 200 million dollars for anew famine fund so that we can act quickly when thefirst signs of famine appear. Every nation on everycontinent should generously add their resources to thefight against disease and desperate hunger.There is another humanitarian crisis  spreading yet hidden from view. Each year  an estimated eight tonine hundred thousand human beings are bought  soldor forced across the world's borders. Among them arehundreds of thousands of teenage girls and others asyoung as five who fall victim to the sex trade. Thiscommerce in human life generates billions of dollarseach year  much of which is used to finance organizedcrime. There is a special evil in the abuse andexploitation of the most innocent and vulnerable. Thevictims of the sex trade see little of life before they seethe very worst of life   an underground of brutalityand lonely fear. Those who create these victims andprofit from their suffering must be severely punished.Those who patronize this industry debase themselvesand deepen the misery of others  and Governments thattolerate this trade are tolerating a form of slavery.This problem has appeared in my own countryand we are working to stop it. The Protect Act  which Isigned into law this year  makes it a crime for anyperson to enter the United States or for any citizen totravel abroad for the purpose of sex tourism involvingchildren. The Department of Justice is activelyinvestigating sex tour operators and patrons  who canface up to 30 years in prison. Under the TraffickingVictims Protection Act  the United States is usingsanctions against Governments to discourage humantrafficking.12The victims of this industry also need help fromMembers of the United Nations. This begins with clearstandards and the certainty of punishment under thelaws of every country. Today  some nations make it acrime to sexually abuse children abroad. Such conductshould be a crime in all nations. Governments shouldinform travellers of the harm this industry does and thesevere punishments that will fall on its patrons. TheAmerican Government is committing $50 million tosupport the good work of organizations that arerescuing women and children from exploitation andgiving them shelter  medical treatment and the hope ofa new life. I urge other Governments to do their part.We must show new energy in fighting back an oldevil. Nearly two centuries after the abolition of thetransatlantic slave trade and more than a century afterslavery was officially ended in its last strongholds  thetrade in human beings for any purpose must not beallowed to thrive in our time.All the challenges I have spoken of this morningrequire urgent attention and moral clarity. HelpingAfghanistan and Iraq to succeed as free nations in atransformed region; cutting off the avenues ofproliferation; abolishing modern forms of slavery  these are the kinds of great tasks for which the UnitedNations was founded. In each case  careful discussionis needed and  also  decisive action. Our goodintentions will be credited only if we achieve goodoutcomes. As an original signer of the United NationsCharter  the United States of America is committed tothe United Nations and we show that commitment byworking to fulfil the United Nations stated purposesand by giving meaning to its ideals.The founding documents of the United Nationsand the founding documents of America stand in thesame tradition. Both assert that human beings shouldnever be reduced to objects of power or commerce because their dignity is inherent. Both recognize amoral law that stands above men and nations  butwhich must be defended and enforced by men andnations. And both point the way to peace   the peacethat comes when all are free. We secure that peace withour courage and we must show that courage together."
"179",7277,"UZB",58,2003,"﻿I should like first of allto join earlier speakers in congratulating you  Sir  TheHonourable Julian Robert Hunte  Minister for ExternalAffairs  International Trade and Civil Aviation of SaintLucia  on your election as President of the GeneralAssembly and to wish you every success as you carryout your duties. I would also like to extend ourappreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan for the very efficientway in which he organized the work of the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly.We would like at the outset to express ourprofound condolences to the whole family of theUnited Nations for the loss of Sergio Vieira de Mello  abrave and able diplomat  and the other United Nationspersonnel who died as a result of the deadly attackagainst the United Nations premises in Baghdad.I would like to take this opportunity to outline theposition of Uzbekistan on the key issues on the agendaof this forum. As is well known  since the events of 11September 2001  the world has been on the verge of afundamental transformation caused by new challengesand threats to security in many regions of our planet.This harsh reality unequivocally increases theresponsibility of the United Nations as a uniqueinternational institution whose role cannot besubstituted by anyone or anything. It also increases theresponsibility of each and every nation to preservepeace and stability in countering threats to moderncivilization such as international terrorism  extremism and the ever-growing illegal drug trade.Given our immediate proximity to Afghanistan we  the nations of Central Asia  know at first handwhat these threats are and what they can bring to theworld  if timely steps are not taken to prevent andeliminate them at their very core. In this context  it isdifficult to overestimate the significance of the actionsof the international anti-terrorist coalition led by theUnited States of America and of the InternationalSecurity Assistance Force  which are doing so much to12revive and restore peace and stability in long-sufferingAfghanistan.In the meantime  despite the prerequisites for afull-scale peace process in Afghanistan and sustaineddevelopment of the region  the peace in the country isstill fragile. We believe that the resources of theinternational community  major internationalorganizations and donor nations  as well as thecapabilities of neighbouring countries  should be moreintensely engaged  as they are essential to post-conflictreconstruction.Afghanistan should become a harmoniouslyintegrated part of Central Asia  and this will positivelycontribute to the enhancement of stability and securityin the country and region. In view of the exceptionalimportance of the socio-economic rehabilitation ofAfghanistan  Uzbekistan is rendering assistance to theAfghan people in the reconstruction of damaged roadsand the construction of new ones  as well as supplyingelectricity to the northern provinces of Afghanistan.Uzbek specialists have built eight large bridges alongthe road from Mazari Sharif to Kabul. Uzbekistan isalso delivering humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.More than 1 million tonnes of humanitarian cargo havebeen shipped through our country’s territory. We willcontinue to cooperate with international organizations foremost with the United Nations  in this regard.The lessons learned in recent years haveconfirmed that overcoming the consequences ofterrorism and extremism is more difficult than theirtimely prevention. Moreover  the aggressive drive ofterrorists to acquire weapons of mass destruction hasbecome a new reality. The international communityshould confront these far-reaching plans using aneffective and streamlined system of measures toprevent access by terrorists to arms  new technologies and dual-use material.Uzbekistan welcomes the progress made in thedevelopment of legal instruments aimed at combatinginternational terrorism. Tangible results  however  canbe achieved only by creating a global system ofcomprehensive cooperation. That is why we supportthe work of the Security Council Counter-TerrorismCommittee. We are confident that the regional anti-terrorism centre of the Shanghai CooperationOrganization  established to collaborate with othersimilar centres  will prove to be an importantcomponent of the global anti-terrorist system.To combat the threat of international terrorismand extremism  it is important to confront the hotbedsall over the world of extremism and the disseminationof the ideology of fanatical ideologies. Despite currentmeasures to isolate them  these centres still possesssubstantial financial resources and the capacity toinfluence the hearts and minds of young people andmobilize them for their far-reaching objectives. Inaddition to the measures being implemented today  itwould be desirable to establish a special UnitedNations programme to promote education andawareness among young people and develop in them astrong aversion to extremist ideology.Uzbekistan maintains that the United Nations canand must play a more significant role in resolving themost urgent issues of today’s world. For this purpose first and foremost  United Nations programmes mustbecome more concrete and effective so that they canbetter target the real needs of regions. In this regard  Iwould like to present the following views.First  Uzbekistan unequivocally supports furtherdevelopment of regional integration and considers theOrganization of Central Asian Cooperation (OCAC) asa crucial mechanism of multilateral collaborationamong the States of the region. We consider theOrganization’s economic component  as well as theestablishment of water  energy  transport andcommunication consortia within its framework  as apriority.The need to overcome the isolation of the regionin terms of transport and communication is of utmostimportance among the objectives vital for sustainabledevelopment of the Central Asian States. In thiscontext  I would particularly like to draw Members’attention to the multilateral initiative to establish atrans-Afghan transport corridor  which would providelandlocked nations that encounter difficulties inaccessing world markets with new access to seaports.Undoubtedly  the implementation of this project wouldboost trade and economic ties and fundamentallychange geopolitical and economic realities in theregion.We believe it is high time for relevant UnitedNations agencies  above all the United NationsDevelopment Programme  United Nations IndustrialDevelopment Organization and the Economic andSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific  to developprogrammes aimed at increasing the volume of aid to13the region’s States and Afghanistan for the purpose ofdeveloping transport infrastructure and providing realsupport in communications projects.Secondly  Uzbekistan calls for strict complianceby all nations with a global nuclear non-proliferationregime. Today  in our view  the significance of theinitiative of Uzbekistan and other countries of theregion to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone inCentral Asia has become paramount. We greatlyappreciate the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the United Nations Department for DisarmamentAffairs in supporting the expert group  which iscurrently working on a draft treaty.The establishment of the zone is nearly complete and  to legitimize it  Uzbekistan calls on all permanentSecurity Council members to develop a consolidatedposition with the region’s States on the provisions ofthe draft treaty and its protocol.Thirdly  Central Asia is facing a wide-scaleassault by international drug cartels  which are usingthe destructive power of international terrorism toprotect drug routes. Under these conditions  there is aneed for concerted efforts and effective internationalprogrammes under the auspices of the United NationsOffice on Drugs and Crime.We believe that the establishment in Tashkent ofthe regional information and coordination centre tocombat transboundary crime  proposed by PresidentIslam Karimov during the visit of Secretary-General toUzbekistan last October  could become a tangiblecontribution by the United Nations. We count on thesupport of the United Nations and donor countries inmaking this initiative a reality.Today  the United Nations faces the need to adaptits mechanisms to the realities of the new world which  we think  is dependent upon the promptcompletion of the process of reform of theOrganization. There is an urgent need to reorganize theSecurity Council so that it reflects current realities. Anexpanded Security Council should include bothdeveloped and developing nations. We reiterate our callfor inclusion of Germany and Japan in the SecurityCouncil as permanent members.In conclusion  I would like to note that theprincipally new approaches taken by the UnitedNations to the realities and prospects of Central Asiawill ultimately meet the fundamental interests of theentire world community. I am confident that thissession will give new momentum to the joint efforts ofMember States to counter the threats and challenges ofglobal and regional security."
"180",7324,"VCT",58,2003,"﻿The fifty-eighth session of the General Assemblyaffords me the special privilege  honour and pleasure ofcongratulating you  Sir  on your assumption of theoffice of President of the General Assembly. As adistinguished son of our neighbouring island  SaintLucia  you do great honour to your country and to thewhole Caribbean Community family. I take great pridein what you  Sir  a fellow Foreign Minister and my dearfriend  have accomplished  and trust that  under yourastute leadership  this fifty-eighth session will chart theright course  which will enable the Organization tofulfil the expectations of mankind for a secure peaceful and prosperous world. Who knoweth but thatby some divine order you have come to the presidencyof this body at such a time as this.Let me first express  on behalf of the Governmentand people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines deepest sympathy to Secretary-General Kofi Annanand the entire United Nations family on the loss ofSergio Vieira de Mello and other United Nationspersonnel in the terrorist attack in Baghdad. Thosededicated United Nations workers strived for peace andjustice for the people of the world. They lived for thatcause  and  tragically  they gave their lives for thatcause. We share the pain of this loss and thebewilderment over it  and pay tribute to all thoseUnited Nations staff members who put duty before selfin the service of mankind.My Government acknowledges with appreciationthe sterling work being done in difficult conditions allover the developing world by United Nations agencies from peacekeeping and the restoration of democracy todevelopment cooperation and humanitarian aid. I alsowish to single out for particular mention the UnitedNations Development Fund for Women and the UnitedNations Population Fund. We urge Member States tocontinue to give support and assistance to theseorganizations  which make such a difference particularly in the lives of women and children  in thepoorest sectors of the world.We have heard speaker after speaker  over thecourse of the past week  suggesting that the UnitedNations is in crisis. Many have proposed solutions forthe rectification of this unhappy state of affairs. It ismy Government’s contention that the GeneralAssembly needs to retake its place as the centralplatform of the Organization  because it is the onlytruly democratic arm of the United Nations. In thisregard  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines intends toparticipate fully in the ongoing debate on reform whichwill be led by you  Mr. President  and we are hopefulthat  with your able guidance  some real progress can2be made in this fifty-eighth session. Of particularconcern to small missions like my own is the volumeand variety of work between September and Decemberevery year. The way the work of the General Assemblyis designed makes it difficult for us to make the kind ofcontribution that we would wish for the effective andefficient operation of the Organization. The Secretary-General said in his report on the revitalization of theGeneral Assembly:“The proliferation of meetings and officialdocuments places excessive demands on both theSecretariat and Member States. Many smallerMember States now find it practically impossibleto play a meaningful role in even the most crucialactivities of the General Assembly and theEconomic and Social Council”. (A/57/387 para. 23)If the work of the General Assembly could beredesigned so as to spread the work load more evenlythroughout the calendar year  it would enable smallmissions like that of Saint Vincent and the Grenadinesto participate fully in the work of the Organization.The debate on the reform of the Security Councilis fraught with many difficulties and challenges. It ismy Government’s view that the simple enlargement ofthe representation on the Security Council may not byitself necessarily lead to greater democratization of thatbody. No matter how many reform theorems areadvanced  the will has to come from the permanentmembers of the Council that wield the veto. MyGovernment has already urged an increase in themembership of the Council  both permanent and non-permanent  but it seems to us that as long as the vetocontinues to exist  the Council will not be trulyrepresentative of the wishes of the States Members ofthis Organization and multinational diplomacy will beendangered. The Government of Saint Vincent and theGrenadines makes so bold as to say that the solutionmay also well lie in the removal of the power of veto to allow for more democracy  greater participation openness and transparency. Only then  perhaps  willthis Organization regain its integrity and respect.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines cherishes therelationships that it enjoys with all countries  both largeand small  represented here at the United Nations. TheUnited Nations Charter confers that freedom ofrepresentation on all peace-loving and democraticStates. Yet my country continues to be deeply troubledthat Taiwan is still being excluded from this body.While we seek to make the United Nations moreefficient and effective through much-needed reform we can advance the cause and the call for reform bymaking the United Nations more inclusive through theadmission to membership of Taiwan and its 23 millionpeople  who have no voice in the United Nations.Taiwan is an exemplary global citizen that maintainsfriendly relations with almost every country in theworld. We would wish for this Organization to be thecatalyst that promotes constructive dialogue andfriendly engagement so that the Taiwan situation canbe resolved in a peaceful  just and equitable way to thebenefit of the entire global family.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud to be aState party to the Rome Statute of the InternationalCriminal Court (ICC). We believe in the fundamentalrole that the ICC has to play in our collective quest forpeace and the promotion of the rule of law and justice.We are determined to uphold its integrity.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud of ourcontribution to the emerging Caribbean civilization.Let me quote from a recent speech by our PrimeMinister  The Honourable Ralph Gonsalves:“The reassembling of the African  Asiatic andEuropean fragments forms the basis of our veryCaribbean civilization itself  which is at onceshaped and yet evolving. Fundamentally  too  ourCaribbean civilization  like all civilizations  hasbeen built on labour — the producers — and thecontours of the society fashioned by the socialorganization of labour”.My small country has made the painfultransformation from colonialism to independentdemocracy in 25 short years. Our people chose not thepath leading to war and conflict  but rather opted forthe highway of democracy  racial harmony and respectfor human rights conducting us to peace  tranquillityand future prosperity. But we are hampered in ourquest. My country  like others in the region  is indanger of losing an entire generation to the scourge ofHIV/AIDS. We need the help of the internationalcommunity in the fight against this dreaded disease forthe preservation of our society.Our banana industry  which is the engine thatdrives our economy  is shortly to succumb to the greed3of certain multinational companies  with the activeassistance of the World Trade Organization. Withoutthe banana industry  whose doomsday rapidlyapproaches  our hardworking peasant farmers willbecome just another casualty of globalization. TheEuropean Union mandates that its sugar farmers getpaid 50 euros per tonne — or five times the worldmarket price. Their farmers then dump their product onthe market  thus depressing prices for farmerselsewhere. So we may shortly have to bid farewell tothe sugar industries of developing nations likeBarbados  Jamaica  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Mozambiqueand Guatemala. The United States of America spendsmore than $3 billion dollars of its taxpayers’ moneyevery year to subsidize its cotton growers. This naturally  signals death to the cotton farmers ofBurkina Faso  Benin  Mali  Chad and other developingnations. How can the developed world  whichcontinues to subsidize its farmers and which toutsglobalization as the cure for all economic ills  continuedefending the indefensible?Cancún  as we all now know  was an abysmalfailure. We went there hoping to be led into thePromised Land — only to find ourselves lost andabandoned in the wilderness. We will continue ourcrusade for economic stability and democratic harmonyin our country  but it is self-evident that we need thehelp of the developed part of the world in order to beviable. It will benefit no one if small countries likeSaint Vincent and the Grenadines are marginalized andleft to flounder. We are a vulnerable country. Thereasons why small island developing States areespecially vulnerable are too well known to be repeatedhere. Our requests for special and differential treatmentin the WTO are completely justified and  for the mostpart  largely ignored.My Government is cognizant of the fact thatterrorism threatens us all. We are therefore fullyengaged in the process of implementing SecurityCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) — a process which hasstretched our limited resources. The oft-repeatedpromises of help in this process are proving to be  likeso many other promises made within these hallowedhalls  just that — promises. Yet we read with graveconcern in the New York Times just last week that between them  two of the giants of this Organizationexport arms worth nearly $20 billion every year — themajority  of course  to developing nations. What doarms do in developing nations? They are the fuel thatfeeds the flames of conflict and terrorism.Unless we can collectively find the courage andwisdom to tackle the problems of poverty  disease anddespair  all the weapons in the world will not preventthe spread of terrorism. We need to move beyond usingthe United Nations as a talk shop and come together asresponsible nations to tackle the root causes ofterrorism.The security which the poorer nations of theworld desire is obtained not through the force of arms but in relief from burdensome debt  employmentopportunities  shelter  food  clean water  a healthyenvironment and access to medical care and life-givingdrugs.Despite its imperfections  the United Nations isthe forum that gives us hope. Let us work together sothat we can bequeath to our children and to ourchildren’s children an Organization that can be used  inthe words of the Secretary-General  to save succeedinggenerations from the scourge of war  to reaffirm faithin fundamental human rights  to establish the basicconditions for justice and the rule of law and topromote social progress and better standards of life inlarger freedom."
"181",7371,"VEN",58,2003,"I begin this speech with mixed emotions —happiness over the election of our friend Julian Hunte— Minister of our sister country in the Caribbean Saint Lucia — as President of this body; and pain because our United Nations lost one of its best people as did Brazil  an exemplary member of one of theworld’s soundest diplomatic systems. Sergio Vieira deMello died for peace and human rights  causes thatilluminated his life as a diplomat and a Brazilian.There are other unfortunate examples from othertimes. We lost Anna Lindh  Swedish Minister for ForeignAffairs  and daughter of the one of the countries mostclosely linked to social justice  who was educated inthe Nordic tradition of social advancement andcommitment to peace and democracy. Years earlier another Swede — Olaf Palme — died  a man of peace andgood will  to whom the international community badefarewell with the song of Chilean Violeta Parra  Gracias ala vida  as a tribute to his struggles on behalf of thepersecuted  the disenfranchised and the impoverished.At the beginning of the 1960s  while on a peacemission  United Nations Secretary-General DagHammarskjöld  also from Sweden  died in what wasapparently an accident  amid the tangled  politicalturbulence in a Congo assailed by its enemies at home as well as international factors that were depriving itssovereign leadership of vital oxygen. Still earlier Count Folke Bernadotte — also Swedish — was avictim of terrorism while on a peace mission for theUnited Nations in Jerusalem. Even before that  at theend of the Second World War  Swedish diplomat RaoulWallenberg  who  from Budapest  opened the way tofreedom for Jews who were being persecuted by Nazibarbarity  disappeared without a trace.It seems that nothing has changed. Socialinjustice goes on forever. Conflicts repeat themselves.The protagonists of historic change are physicallyeliminated or morally destroyed. The advocacy ofviolence is dragging us towards terrorism and war.Inspired by the values of social justice democracy and peace  on behalf of the President of theBolivarian Republic of Venezuela  Hugo Chávez Fr'as I wish to reaffirm our support for the United Nationsfrom a position that is critical yet unambiguous andtotally consistent with its loftiest goals. These samevalues inspire us in Venezuela  a country that prideditself on being the richest and most democratic nation inLatin America  but that squandered its privilegedhistorical opportunities and fell into a process of ethnicaland social decay that has brought us close to the abyss.As a result  we had to assume a profound process oftransformation towards peace and democracy.The sectors affected by the democratictransformation have resorted to force to frustrate thiscommitment of the majority. They have resorted tomilitary coup  oil sabotage  financial panic and mediaterrorism. Thank God that they failed  but they stillcaused much damage.The provisions of a Constitution approved by thepeople in a referendum that expands the basis ofdemocracy in a social State founded on law  and whichis truly our country plan for all  have generated violentand anti-democratic opposition. Opening the way toparticipatory democracy and to an economy that is free yet not anarchic  and that protects private freedomswithout bowing to the almighty market  has stirred upthe most egoistic and insensitive sector of our countryand of the international community — the neoliberals.On this subject  His Holiness Pope Paul VI  in hisencyclical Populorum Progressio  of March 1967  said“This unchecked liberalism leads to dictatorshiprightly denounced by Pius XI as producing ‘theinternational imperialism of money’. One cannotcondemn such abuses too strongly by solemnlyrecalling once again that the economy is at theservice of man.”Entrepreneurs who took no risks  protected by acolluding Government under a captive market  who didnot compete and who evaded taxation promoted aconspiracy against the legitimate Government ofVenezuela  allied with international sectors that hadbeen past beneficiaries.Now  therefore  our democracy  threatenedunsuccessfully by certain Venezuelan media magnates invites members of the international community to seefor themselves in Venezuela the strength of our societyand the immense civil liberties available in our country including the broadest freedom of expression in ourentire hemisphere. We will welcome witnesses to cometo Venezuela and watch our television  read ournewspapers  interview the owners of the private media listen to commentators and news anchors  and drawtheir own conclusions. We need them to familiarizethemselves with the most hidden threat againstdemocracy: the media dictatorship  a mirror of theculture of violence and mediocrity.Our process of social change in peace anddemocracy was interrupted by an assault againstlegality by the media and their hypnotized followers. Inscarcely three days  during their ephemeral de factoGovernment  all democratic institutions wereabolished  before people and soldiers in the streetsrestored normalcy. Today  we aspire to peace andreconciliation among Venezuelans. In our democracy there is room and hope for everyone.We want also peace for our sister Colombia andin Northern Ireland  in the Balkans  between Jews andPalestinians and throughout the world. Peace is also theaspiration of the Members of the United Nations  butthere will not be lasting peace without social justice; therewill not be stable democracies without social justice; andfreedom will be a fraud without social justice.We congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. KofiAnnan  on his balanced and firm guidance of theOrganization at the very difficult time that the world ispassing through and on his wise and heartfelt messageto this democratic Assembly.This year  our activities in the General Assembly areoverclouded by the attack on the United Nationsheadquarters in Baghdad  where so many faithful servantsof the Organization lost their lives  by the aftermath ofthe war and the tense situation existing in the Middle Eastand by the alarming world poverty indices  a scenario thatleads us to profound reflection and demands that westrengthen the Organization’s capacity to respond.Venezuela’s action has been aimed at restoringand promoting multilateralism as a means and ablueprint for the shaping of a more democratic world.Unilateralism is monochromatic  worn out  oppressiveand authoritarian; multilateralism is polychromatic animated  tolerant and democratic. In that conviction  weassumed the responsibility of chairing the Group of 77last year and the Group of 15  whose summit meeting wewill hold next year in my country. There are mechanismsthrough which the developing world is expressing itsmultilateral voice and its aspirations to the universalcommon good and to international social justice.37Historical developments since 1945 require thatwe have a more democratic and more representativeSecurity Council. We must strengthen the GeneralAssembly given its democratic and participatory nature.We want the Economic and Social Council to be thepowerful organ that it has not been allowed to be.The Charter of the United Nations cannot betailored to suit unilateral conveniences. War is not aromantic adventure that brings us to a happy ending inwhich the superheroes defeat the villains. Sometimes war turns into a death trap that causes harsher sufferingthan the suffering that  in theory  it intends to alleviate.Sometimes  it brings other wars  more violence andmore terrorism.Use of force by the State should not beundertaken at the discretion of those who happen to beinterested at the time. The responsibility of theOrganization’s Members is collective  as theinternational security that we want to protect andguarantee must be. We all desire a better world forfuture generations  and why not for ourselves? We areall protagonists in this world drama; hegemoniesappear archaic and authoritarian. Our objective is astrengthened  universal and democratic Organization.A year ago in this Hall  we condemned theabominable terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001  inwhich we lost thousands of citizens of the UnitedStates and of other countries. That sudden holocaustwas perhaps the product of religious fundamentalism but it is unjust to single out the believers of one faithfor acts of extremist minorities when other minoritiesof believers have also committed crimes againsthumanity in the name of the Lord. Terrorism destroyshuman lives  both of innocents and of combatants; ittorments family members  friends and peoples. There isno good terrorism  not in the name of an ethnicity or ofa nationality; not in the name of justice or of freedom;not in the name of God.Four days ago  on behalf of the BolivarianRepublic of Venezuela  I deposited the ratificationinstruments of the International Convention for theSuppression of Terrorist Bombings  the InternationalConvention for the Suppression of the Financing ofTerrorism and the Optional Protocol to the Conventionon the Rights of the Child on the involvement ofchildren in armed conflicts. Yesterday  the VenezuelanParliament made the Inter-American Conventionagainst Terrorism a law of the Republic. We hope thatthe ratification procedure will be completed within theOrganization of American States as soon as possible.Nevertheless  we must continue the frontal assaulton the most widespread and destructive forms ofterrorism: poverty and social exclusion. The developingworld is suffering from hunger  poverty and exclusioncaused by an unjust economic system enveloped in thepractices of savage neo-liberalism and in the globalizedeconomy with an unfair scheme of commercial tradethat generates unemployment  exploitation  inequalityand resentment. It is a system that attacks the dignity ofthe human person. Its leaders are not accustomed tospeaking of social justice in their statements.One initiative that the President of Venezuela hasundertaken to fight poverty is the creation of aninternational humanitarian fund that we proposed at theInternational Conference on Financing for Development held at Monterrey; at the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment  held at Johannesburg; and once again inthe General Assembly. The fund is designed to be aconsistent and innovative source for financing non-refundable resources coming from the reduction ofmilitary expenditures and money confiscated as a resultof narco-trafficking and corruption. It will be aneffective formula of international assistance to generateopportunities for economic and social progress incountries excluded from traditional financing schemes.Converging proposals make us optimistic in the light ofthis type of initiative.I conclude with a quotation from His HolinessJohn Paul II in 1994:“The world longs for peace and has adesperate need of peace. Yet wars  conflicts increasing violence and situations of social unrestand endemic poverty continue to reap innocentvictims and to cause divisions betweenindividuals and peoples. At times peace appears atruly unattainable goal! In a climate made cold byindifference and occasionally poisoned by hatred how can one hope for the dawn of an era ofpeace  which only feelings of solidarity and oflove can usher in?”That is how all Members of the Organization shouldconcentrate our efforts to find the necessary means thatwill enable us to ensure peace and democracy at homeand in the international community  availing ourselvesof the best antidote to violence: social justice."
"182",7410,"VNM",58,2003,"﻿On behalf ofthe delegation of Viet Nam  I wish to warmlycongratulate Julian Hunte on his assumption of thepresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly. I believe that under his able guidance thissession will come to a fruitful conclusion. I also takethis opportunity to express our great appreciation forthe significant contributions made by Mr. Jan Kavanduring the previous session of the General Assembly.Earlier last month  we were all shocked andshared in the boundless grief over the tragic demise ofour dear Sergio Vieira de Mello  United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and SpecialRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq  andhis colleagues in the barbarous bombing of the UnitedNations offices in Baghdad. We will not be discouragedby that loss. Instead  we should pursue even further theefforts of the United Nations to help the Iraqi people torestore stability and reconstruct their country.We are living in a world full of events withprofound implications for the various aspects ofinternational life. They include the war in Iraq  thebombing of the United Nations offices in Baghdad  theoutbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS)  increased violence in the Middle East  as wellas continuing terrorist attacks in various parts of theworld. Coupled with poverty  disease  floods  droughtsand conflicts  they continue to take many innocentlives. This breaks our hearts and should not becondoned  especially when mankind has entered thethird millennium of human civilization. We must makefull use of the great achievements registered in theareas of science and technology and economy andtrade  uphold the values of civilization  and serve thecommon development and prosperity of all nations.Strengthening international peace and securityand enhancing development remain our primary task.Only in an environment of peace and stability cannations concentrate their energy to meet the challengesof development and to achieve poverty eradication.Healthy  equitable international relations can be builtonly on the principles of the United Nations Charter23and international law  in particular the principle ofrespect for national independence  sovereignty andterritorial integrity and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States.Development cooperation and internationaleconomic and trade relations can be built only when allparticipate on an equal footing  on the basis of mutualbenefit and with favourable assistance to developingcountries. However  there continue to be certain egoistictendencies that are contrary to that good. Protectionistmeasures  including anti-dumping measures  have beenimposed to prevent developing countries’ products fromentering developed countries’ markets. That runscounter not only to World Trade Organization (WTO)agreements but also to normal trade practices.A typical case was that of the recent unfairlawsuit against the sale of Viet Nam’s catfish in theUnited States market. The same story recurs in the caseof cotton-growers in Burkina Faso and again in thecase of indigenous cultivators of medicinal herbs inBrazil. These examples should serve as a further lessonthat developing countries will always be at adisadvantage in the current international trade system as the Secretary-General himself recently observed. Bythe same token  the failure to reach agreement at thefifth WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancún is trulyregrettable. We must enhance efforts to restructure theworld trade and financial systems to make them moredemocratic and open  giving developing countries abetter chance.Despite the considerable efforts by the UnitedNations to achieve the goals set out in the MillenniumDeclaration  there is still a long way to go to meetcommon needs and expectations. Today  globalproblems increasingly affect human security andsurvival. The SARS outbreak and AIDS were examplesof how devastating such problems can be.We must be resolute in solving global problems especially those related to development  povertyeradication and disease prevention. Priority should begiven to building cooperative frameworks based onreliable partnerships  mutual respect  shared responsibilityand the serious undertaking of commitments. Practicaland effective measures must be taken to pursue the UnitedNations Millennium Development Goals and thecommitments made at various internationalconferences. In that regard  we welcome the efforts ofthe Secretary-General to elaborate a road map for theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.We also call upon developed countries to better fulfilthe commitment of allocating 0.7 per cent of grossnational product to official development assistance.Multilateralism is crucial to resolving globalissues. The United Nations  the universal Organization continues to play an important role in the fields ofpeace and development and in building healthyinternational relations; to meet the confidence andexpectations of nations  it must do so more effectivelyand practically. That requires a stronger and moredemocratic United Nations and Security Council ensuring the better representation of the developingcountries and those able to make a positivecontribution to common objectives. I wish to reaffirmViet Nam’s support for Japan  Germany  India andother capable members from various continents beingamong the future permanent members of a reformedSecurity Council.Following the events of 11 September 2001  theworld has made great efforts to combat terrorism. Themessage is very clear: terrorism must be condemnedand eliminated from human civilization. As thiscommon fight may be long and arduous  we need tocooperate on the basis of the principles of the UnitedNations Charter  as well as to join in an endeavour tosolve  inter alia  the problems of poverty  injustice andoppression  which give rise to terrorism.Viet Nam supports international efforts aimed atdisarmament and at the peaceful resolution of conflictson the basis of respect for the sovereignty andlegitimate interests of the parties concerned. We callfor an end to embargoes and sanctions imposed againstother countries  especially the unilateral embargoagainst Cuba that for many decades has caused itspeople to endure untold suffering.Peace  security and reconstruction are now themost urgent tasks in Iraq. Viet Nam reaffirms itssupport for Iraq’s independence and sovereignty. Wehope that stability will soon be restored and that aGovernment chosen by the Iraqi people will beestablished at an early date so that they can focus onnational reconstruction and development in keepingwith their self-determination. The United Nationsshould continue its worthy  active role in resolving theIraqi issue and in reconstructing the country. In thatregard  Viet Nam has decided to contributehumanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people.24Viet Nam reaffirms its consistent support for thejust cause and inalienable rights of the Palestinianpeople. We call upon the parties concerned to exerciserestraint  to persevere in negotiation and to acceleratetheir pace on the road to a just and durable peace in theMiddle East that takes due account of the legitimateinterests of the parties. Any unilateral action can onlyworsen the already volatile situation in the region.Viet Nam supports peaceful efforts aimed atdenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We hope thatthe negotiations initiated through the six-party talks inBeijing last August will lead to a satisfactoryconclusion for the sake of peace  stability anddevelopment on the Peninsula  in the region and in therest of the world.In our region  faced with complex and rapiddevelopments and challenges in the international andregional landscape  the Association of South-EastAsian Nations (ASEAN) has produced new initiativesand concrete steps to strengthen its solidarity resilience and equitable development while furtherintensifying its relations with friends and partnersabroad. At its forthcoming Summit  to be held earlynext month in Bali  Indonesia  ASEAN will redoubleits efforts to realize ASEAN Vision 2020  the HanoiPlan of Action and the Hanoi Declaration on narrowingthe development gap for closer ASEAN integration.As an outward-looking association  ASEANcontinues to attach great importance to broadening anddeepening its relations with other countries. China Russia and India will accede to the ASEAN Treaty ofAmity and Cooperation in South-East Asia  thusmaking the Treaty the code of conduct in inter-Staterelations. Having adopted the Declaration on theConduct of Parties in the South China Sea  ASEANand China are embarking on a search for concrete waysto implement the Declaration  thus contributing toconfidence and cooperation in that important part ofthe world. In the economic field  ASEAN has beendiscussing closer economic partnership  including apossible free trade agreement  with its dialoguepartners — the United States  the European Union Russia and India  to name only a few.Viet Nam consistently pursues a foreign policy ofnational independence  self-reliance  openness diversification and multilateralization of internationalrelations  and being a friend and reliable partner in theinternational community. Along those lines  Viet Namhas increasingly enhanced friendly and cooperativerelations with other countries as well as with regionaland international organizations. At present  we areactively preparing for Viet Nam’s early admission tothe World Trade Organization. With an annualeconomic growth rate of approximately 7 per cent  afavourable and secure investment environment hospitable people  beautiful landscapes and otherrewarding discoveries  Viet Nam continues to be amost attractive country for investors and tourists. Laterthis year  we will host the South-East Asian Games  thelargest sports event in the region. Next will be theAsia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit in 2004 followed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation(APEC) Summit in 2006. We are confident that we willlive up to expectations.Today’s challenges  both old and new  arebecoming global; they require measures of a moreglobal and multilateral nature. The United Nationstherefore plays an important role in coordinatinginternational efforts to effectively respond to thosechallenges and to work for peace and development. In thatregard  the principles of the United Nations Charter mustbe upheld  and their actual implementation must beensured. For its part  Viet Nam  as a responsible MemberState and reliable partner  will continue to contributeactively to that common endeavour."
"183",7441,"VUT",58,2003,"﻿Allowme to convey to this Assembly the heartfelt greetingsof the Government and people of the Republic ofVanuatu. I should like first of all to sincerelycongratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of thePresidency of the fifty-eight session of the GeneralAssembly. You have assumed the Presidency at anextremely difficult  unsettled and complex time. Aseries of regrettable events have imperilled the politicaland ideological authority which is the universalfoundation of the United Nations ability to work for themaintenance of peace and security in the world. Giventhe enormity of the challenges that now face us  mydelegation — and I personally — would like tosolemnly assure you of our support and fullcooperation.The job of the Secretary-General is one of themost difficult jobs  in particular when the veryfounding principles of the Organization are beingcompromised or simply discarded in favour of theinterest of some Members. The Government of Vanuatuadmires the outstanding authority and clear-sightednessas well as the diplomatic qualities of Mr. Kofi Annan the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Hiswisdom and his persistence have enabled MemberStates to step up their efforts to make the work of theUnited Nations more effective and better adapted to themaintenance of peace throughout the world  whilekeeping the focus on development priorities such as  inparticular  the small economies of island States such asVanuatu.Quite frankly  we are participating in this meetingsomewhat confused about the future of ourOrganization  since a minority of Powers areinfluencing the system to advance their own interestsand to the detriment of the principles and mandateswhich are the prerogatives of the United Nations. TheUnited Nations mission  inter alia  is to work forpeaceful coexistence among peoples and nations. Butthe United Nations is being thwarted because of theunilateral initiatives of certain Powers. This is theresponsibility of its Members  and this situation has tobe addressed in order to restore the central role of theUnited Nations in conflict settlement.We cannot conceive of any unilateral action in thefuture without the risk of paralysing the Organizationitself. The decline of order and justice and the variousconflicts that are occurring throughout the world areparticularly disquieting. If the international systemcontinues to be influenced by certain Powers  thefuture will remain uncertain  notwithstanding theindividual efforts made by Member States and despitethe countless resolutions adopted by this Assembly.In recent years  the international geopoliticalenvironment has been dramatically shaken.Irresponsible actions have unleashed much hatred and4bitterness  which jeopardizes world peace andharmony. The fundamental principles that justified theexistence of the United Nations are now being calledinto question and we are duty-bound explicitly andclearly to redefine the new objectives and to strengthenthe founding principles of the United Nations.Many tragic events have occurred and countlessinnocent lives have been destroyed. These are the factsof the world today. I would like to take this opportunityto pay tribute to the members of the Secretariat whotragically lost their lives in the line of duty and toconvey condolences to the United Nations Secretariatas well as to the families of the victims of that brutaland horrendous act. That barbaric and inhuman act ofviolence saddens us all. I join with previous speakersin condemning that brutal act.Unfortunately  some of us have contributed to thecurrent situation. A brief overview of past eventsdefinitely shows that various world conflicts  wars famines  droughts  epidemics  poverty andenvironmental degradation are on the increase. Manydeveloping countries are facing a variety ofdevelopment difficulties  such as the increase inunemployment that contributes to the degradation ofsocieties. In many cases  the destruction of social andcultural progress  caused by globalization andmodernization  has increased feelings of hatred andbitterness. The main outlines for future developmenthave been mapped out but the success of theimplementation of this remains dependant on politicalwill  particularly the financial commitments of theindustrialized countries. However  I am still optimisticand I trust in your wisdom  Mr. President  to guide usto a better future.While counter-terrorism and normalization insome countries are on the agenda  we should not divertour attention from the development issues that canundermine the future of developing countries.Considerable resources will be devoted to securityquestions  when only a tiny share of this amount wouldbe enough to meet the needs of the developingcountries.The environment is another area of concern. Wesupport previous statements by representatives of theisland States of the Pacific  and we continue toencourage countries that have not yet done so to ratifythe Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible.How can we explain to our peoples that certaininternational obligations are priorities only for thesmall States  whereas the super-Powers seem hardly tobe concerned about them  or are even hostile to them and yet do not hesitate to impose a series of conditionswhich contribute to the underdevelopment of smallStates and which we could describe as political andeconomic interference?The unilateral imposition and maintenance of theban on the sale of products containing kava in Europeis an example of this discriminatory attitude. TheEuropean countries involved do not seem to takeaccount of the scientific studies establishing theabsence of any link between kava and kidney disease  alink suggested by the health authorities of someEuropean countries.The threat of economic sanctions by theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) against tax havens in thePacific  while excepting European jurisdictions  leavesno alternative than to accept the conditions imposedwithout any consideration of the economies concerned.Since our acceptance in principle of the OECDconditions we have received no indication from thatorganization of any quid pro quo that it can provide inthe case of economic loss.Despite the opposition of the Pacific region to thetransportation of nuclear waste in the waters of ourregion  certain Powers show a complete lack of respectfor the sovereignty of the small islands States of thePacific. It is not only a question of the environment andof protecting our natural resources against any disaster;it is much more a question of ethics. In other words  weregret the complete lack of respect for the small islandStates of the Pacific as fully fledged members of theinternational community.It is generally recognized today that trade is theengine of development. However  like other countriesof similar size  Vanuatu is facing certain tariff and non-tariff restrictions which are causing our agriculturalproducts to be inaccessible to  in particular  marketsthat are often described as free.Bringing national laws into line with internationalconventions carries costs that are oftendisproportionate for the small countries. In almost allcases  national resource constraints  financial as well astechnical  are ignored  whereas they must be taken into5account for the success of any programme of actionresulting from international commitments.We must not lose sight of the basic principle ofthe right to self-determination. We reiterate that thecredibility of the United Nations rests on following upthe implementation of any reform aimed at recognizingthe right of peoples to self-determination  in thecontext of respect for others and for the United NationsCharter. We therefore applaud the efforts by theGovernment of Indonesia to open and maintaindialogue with the various social and minorityconstituents  as well as those in West Papua  in respectfor human rights and freedom of expression.We welcome the positive role and efforts ofAustralia and New Zealand  after an unprecedenteddecision by the countries of the region  to restore andmaintain order  security and peace in the region  and inparticular in the Solomon Islands.We applaud the French President  Mr. JacquesChirac  for having initiated a summit meeting of headsof State and Government of the South Pacific region held last July  in order to strengthen our cooperation.I trust in your wisdom  Mr. President  to makesure that all the theories expounded in the Assemblyare followed by concrete  practical action. We have aduty to work collectively through the multilateralinstitutions to help resolve and overcome thedifficulties and challenges that face us. In order to dothat  we need to constantly review the very structure ofthe United Nations. The various unilateral initiativeshave highlighted the limits of the current structurewhich have caused a weakening of the multilateralapproach. Many super-Powers are unwilling to shareeven a part of their authority within the United Nationsand seem to prefer the status quo. The principles ofdemocratization and transparency advocated by mostMembers must be taken into account in thereorganization and in the Organization’s decision-making process.My delegation supports changing the permanentmembership of the Security Council to include Japanand a representative of the African continent  of theMiddle East and of the Alliance of Small Island States.This reform would give the Organization greatertransparency  restore confidence in it and improveinternational cooperation. My delegation stronglysupports the proposals made  and in particular thenomination of a group of leaders representing thevarious regions and the main categories of economiesin order to launch this important proposal. This longawaited review will finally come about.We need to take this great opportunity to renewand strengthen the United Nations in order to give itthe qualities it needs to meet the challenges of ourtime. Strengthening the cohesion and unity of our greatcommunity of nations will be a daunting challenge  onewhich we are prepared to meet  while offering ourcomplete and unconditional support.We have aired our concerns in order to stress theinjustices and contradictions in the current situation but we assure the Organization of our support and ourcommitment to seeing the Organization revitalized capable of meeting the aspirations of all its Members whether large or small  rich or poor  strong or weak.The contradictions of principle  mountingterrorism  human suffering  and the emergence ofconflicts in regions that are normally peaceful combined with the injustices of globalization  are allingredients for a future catastrophe.In conclusion  my delegation remains convincedthat only a reinvigorated United Nations can contributein a lasting manner to world peace and security."
"184",7473,"WSM",58,2003,"﻿Samoa warmlywelcomes the well-deserved election of Mr. JulianHunte  given his leadership in his region and amongour community of small States. Let me also pay tributeto President Jan Kavan of the Czech Republic for hiseffective guidance during the fifty-seventh session.Unprecedented events since we met last year havetested the very foundation of our Organization. There istherefore great urgency for our membership to declareanew our faith in the purposes and principles of theUnited Nations. We need to assert  both in commitmentand in action  our support for fundamental humanrights and the peaceful coexistence of nations.The range of challenges that now confront theinternational community in our globalized andinterdependent world require that nations be united incommon endeavour. Only through cooperation andmultilateral joint effort can we hope effectively toguarantee human rights and achieve peace and security and social and economic justice  for all. Samoatherefore believes that the United Nations remainsuniquely suited to the pursuit and coordination ofglobal initiatives to attain these objectives.To this end  Samoa firmly supports ongoingefforts to reform and modernize the United Nations.Substantive changes are required with regard to boththe General Assembly and Security Council  as well asto other bodies of the United Nations system. Wecertainly support the expansion of the permanentmembership of the Security Council to include nationssuch as Germany and Japan.Samoa adds its voice to the condemnation of theatrocious terrorist attack on United Nations offices inBaghdad last month  which took the lives of manyUnited Nations personnel  including the esteemed HighCommissioner for Human Rights  Mr. Sergio Vieira deMello. On behalf of my Government and of the peopleof Samoa  I reiterate our very sincere condolences tothe Secretary-General and the families of those wholost their lives or were injured in that terrible event.Terrorism is an offence to humanity and goesagainst the core values of the United Nations. Terroristactivities around the world demand a continued andconcerted international response. States must bedetermined in their national and collective efforts tocombat terrorism in all its forms. I reaffirm the strongsupport of Samoa for the relevant Security Councilresolutions against terrorism. Those resolutions providea clear signal of our determination to suppress terroristactivities  including those related to training  internationalmovement and financing. In this area  Samoa continuesto align its domestic policies and legislation with thework of the Counter-Terrorism Committee  as well asto participate actively in the regional security measuresundertaken in the Pacific region.We commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan forhis determination and efforts for the reconstruction ofIraq. We recognize the enormous complexities andobstacles of this task. But substantive commitment andwork must continue in providing humanitarianassistance  as well as in restoring law and order. Wealso firmly believe that continued engagement in Iraqmust take place with the full endorsement of theSecurity Council. We pray for peace and security forIraq and hope that sovereignty will be restored to itspeople as soon as possible.Samoa is most seriously concerned about theproliferation of weapons of mass destruction   chemical biological and nuclear weapons. The determination ofsome countries to try to bring such weapons intoexistence   particularly nuclear weapons   is cause foralarm and constitutes a serious threat to internationalpeace and security. The internationally agreed instrumentsto control the manufacturing  transportation anddeployment of weapons of mass destruction must bestrengthened and implemented. Above all  States partiesmust adhere and honour their obligations to these treaties.Samoa joins the call for the effective disarmament andtotal elimination of weapons of mass destruction.We are appalled at the continuing suffering offamilies and communities in all parts of the world especially in the Middle East and Africa. We can onlyhope that the work to bring about stability in theseareas will succeed and that communities will finally beable to live in peace.16As part of its support for United Nations effortsto ensure peace and security  Samoa is contributing tothe United Nations peacekeeping mission in Timor-Leste. Together with members of the Pacific IslandsForum  and under the leadership of Australia and NewZealand  Samoa is also contributing to the RegionalAssistance Mission to Solomon Islands  which ishelping that country to restore law and order andassisting in its economic recovery. That regionalinitiative was endorsed at the Forum leaders' meetinglast month. Its implementation conforms to regionalresponsibilities under the Charter  and recognizes thesovereignty of the Solomon Islands.Samoa warmly welcomes the fullinstitutionalization of the International Criminal Courtand the election of its judges and officers. The Court isa major achievement in upholding internationalhumanitarian standards and the protection of humanrights. In order to ensure that it fully achieves itspurpose  however  every effort must be made to ensureits impartiality in bringing to justice those who commitgenocide  crimes against humanity and war crimes. TheCourt therefore deserves to be fully supported so as toendow it with the strength of universality and the ruleof law. We look forward to its service to humanity.Samoa reaffirms its commitment to achieving theMillennium Development Goals and targets pledgedthree years ago in this very Hall. While much has beendone  it is clear from the Secretary-General's reportthat more work remains to be carried out. The goals ofhalving poverty  halting the spread of HIV/AIDS providing universal primary education and reducingenvironmental degradation   all by 2015   can stillbe achieved in the 12 years that remain. In order forthat to happen  States must improve on the politicalmomentum of the past three years and make good ontheir promises.Samoa recently hosted the Pacific regionalmeeting as part of the preparatory work for theInternational Meeting that will be held next year inMauritius to review the implementation of theProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Developmentof Small Island Developing States. This ongoingpreparatory work in small island States is critical to acomprehensive review.The International Meeting next year will be aunique opportunity for the international community toassess progress to date and to focus attention on areaswhere the expected results did not materialize. Moreimportantly  it should identify remedial strategies andthe required resources to assist small island developingStates achieve sustainable development.While we accept the primary responsibility forachieving the goals of the Programme of Action  thereality is that the support of the internationalcommunity is indispensable to success. We thereforeurge the fullest support by development partners in thereview process and the implementation of the outcomesof the Mauritius International Meeting.Looking to 2004 and the work of the Commissionon Sustainable Development  we believe that theagenda for the twelfth session is extremely important.The Commission's work will incorporate preparationsfor the International Meeting  but   very importantly  it will also focus on the key issues of water andsanitation. The significance of these issues for basic needsand healthy communities cannot be overemphasized.We note with concern the collapse of negotiationsat the recent World Trade Organization (WTO)ministerial conference in Cancun earlier this month.Certainly from the perspective of a small islanddeveloping country like my own  trade is both a vital andunavoidable component of sustainable development. Wetherefore continue to urge that the vulnerabilities ofsmall States be taken fully into account in thenegotiations  particularly with regard to special anddifferential treatment  implementation issues  services agriculture and non-agricultural market access.I would like to express our appreciation to theSecretary-General for his steadfast and astuteleadership  particularly during the dramatic events thathave tested the Organization in recent years.Finally  the fifty-eighth session of the GeneralAssembly has a heavy and difficult agenda  and thePresident has the full support of Samoa in the dischargeof his important duties."
"185",7519,"YEM",58,2003,"﻿At theoutset  it is my pleasure to congratulate Mr. JulianHunte on his election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly  which demonstrates the trust that this bodyhas in him. We know that his skill and capabilities willensure the success of our work  and we have everyconfidence that he will be participating in strengtheningthe role of the United Nations at a time when theinternational community is undergoing profoundchange. I would also like to welcome the laudableefforts made by the outgoing President of the GeneralAssembly. I would like to stress that the delegation ofmy country  one of the Vice Presidents at this session will provide the President with every kind of support.I would also like to take this opportunity to expressto Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of the UnitedNations  our sincere gratitude and appreciation for histireless efforts to successfully carry out the huge missionand responsibilities entrusted to the Organization.At a time when we are witnessing a myriad ofchanges and surprising events  we would also like toexpress our sorrow at the horrendous and unjust attackon the United Nations office in Baghdad  an attack thatwe consider to be aimed at the fundamental principlesand values that the United Nations is championing.We meet here full of hope and in response to theaspirations and concerns raised by numerous importantissues before us for consideration during the presentsession. We must meet the difficult challenges andperils that confront us. We are at a crossroads in ahighly complex era  in which we cannot rest on ourlaurels. We must face the international tragic eventsand developments that are damaging to the credibility ofthe United Nations and its noble principles and values.We must do this collectively through multilateralinstitutions that will guarantee unified efforts and vision.We have met here today  and we must frankly andobjectively recall what took place during the lastsession of the General Assembly  in 2002. That sessiontook place one year after the odious terrorist attacks onthe United States. During our debate then  we wereunanimous in condemning and combating worldterrorism with a view to eradicating it.We tried strenuously to avoid a war in Iraq. Wewelcomed the road map and prospects for a peacefuland comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeliconflict. One year later  here we are asking whether wecan indeed say that we have accomplished what wesought or taken steps towards peace in the Middle Eastas we had wished. Now that the Iraqi regime is nolonger in place  does Iraq in fact enjoy a democraticand free system and a constitutional order  which we soardently desire or have we in reality made Iraq a stagefor violence and a hotbed of terrorism?When my country opposed the war against Iraq  itwas convinced that the United Nations was in aposition to locate and eliminate weapons of massdestruction there and that the regime could be made tocomply with the relevant resolutions based oninternational law.My Government believed that this war would notachieve its aims  not only because it was based onshaky foundations but also because it was difficult topredict its negative consequences. We note with regretthat it has led to increased extremism and terrorism.On the other hand  regarding the Arab-Israeliconflict  my country has developed a position based onthe principles laid down by the Quartet: working forthe advent of a Palestinian State that would exercisefull sovereignty over its territory  with Jerusalem as itscapital; withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Arabterritories occupied since 5 June 1967  and the return ofthe refugees. We were and are still convinced that asettlement can only be achieved if Israel ceases itsdelaying tactics and complies with United Nationsresolutions. We are convinced that Israel would onlyaccept a solution if it were imposed on it by a bindingresolution. This has not yet come to pass.The world remains silent in the face of ongoingIsraeli aggression against the Palestinians. The SecurityCouncil is paralysed  unable to adopt a resolutionbecause the United States did not use its influence despite its positive approach  as represented in the roadmap  to achieve the desired solution. Therefore wewonder if we can still say that everything is fine withthe world and that peace and security are within our21grasp when the Middle East  East and West Africa  andEast and South-East Asia have been battered by crisesand conflicts?If we tried to analyse these crises and theirramifications  we would find three major causes: first a lack of democracy and freedoms; secondly  povertyand ignorance; and thirdly  a global order in whichpolicies of hegemony dominate and practices ofpressure are exerted against Third World States.Will we be able at the United Nations to alleviatethese desperate situations? Is it sufficient to proclaimdemocracy  devotion to freedom and human rights as apanacea for all problems? Can these ideals eradicatepoverty and eliminate all that is negative in the realitiesof each country and in international relations? In fact to alleviate these problems in an effective manner  wemust take into consideration the three causes I havejust mentioned. Therefore  the rich and the powerfulmust heed the cries of the weak and the poor.A real partnership and war against injustice areguarantees of international peace and security and thebest way to prevent extremism and terrorism. If thingsremain as they are now  we will witness a revolution ofthe poor  a rebellion of the oppressed  a scenario that isquite removed from the one on the clash ofcivilizations  as advanced by some parties.My country believes that we need to seriouslyand positively cope with these crises and conflicts. TheMiddle East must no longer be a hotbed of tension andcrises. The following measures are necessary: first there must be an immediate halt to the occupation ofIraq  and its sovereignty  territorial integrity andresources must be preserved. The United Nations mustassume responsibility for rebuilding Iraq; a nationalGovernment must be formed with a nationalconstitution and a democratic regime; the Iraqis mustbe able to enjoy full rights and freedoms  and theLeague of Arab States must make a contribution tosuch efforts within international legality. We fullysupport the endeavours undertaken by the GoverningCouncil in Iraq.Secondly  the Security Council must shoulder itsfull responsibilities by implementing resolutionsrelevant to the Arab-Israeli conflict and byimplementing the road map  without any amendmentsby the Israelis. Tel Aviv must be prevented fromcarrying out the negative and pernicious act of killingor expelling Yasser Arafat  the elected President of thePalestinian people and the Palestinian National Authority.Thirdly  Israel must withdraw from Syrian and Lebaneseoccupied territory  for that is an integral part of anyattempt to have a just peace in the Middle East.We would like to recall that the Arab countries  inaccordance with the Arab initiative for peace  hadaccepted Israel as a State in the region and had agreedto deal with it on the basis of its real interest in peaceand in ending the occupation of the Arab territories.We would also like to recall that my countrysubscribes to the efforts made by the United Nationsregarding measures resulting from the Conference onDisarmament  which will allow us to adopt aninternational treaty putting an end to the arms race.There is a need to encourage confidence-buildingmeasures on the national and regional level. TheMiddle East must be a region free from weapons ofmass destruction. Israeli nuclear installations must besubmitted to international inspection. We must rejectthe policies of selectivity and double standards for thisissue and many others.The policy of embargo and unilateral economicsanctions that go beyond regional borders and areimposed on certain countries are flagrant violations ofinternational law. My country subscribes to the UnitedNations appeal to put an end to unilateral measuresimposed on the Sudan and Cuba  now that thesemeasures have been eliminated regarding Libya. Thiswill allow us to spread a culture of peace  dialogue andunderstanding  even in dealing with questions on whichthere has been disagreement. This would be areasonable means and a rational approach to settleconflicts and differences among countries.My country believes that this is also the approachand the means that must be adopted and implementedto settle the conflict in Somalia  in order to preservethe national interests of that country. The Republic ofYemen was one of the first countries to participate inefforts designed to achieve national reconciliation inSomalia. Therefore  my country urges the UnitedNations and the international community to play theirrole to ensure peace and security in Somalia.Yemen would also like to express its support forthe peace negotiations between the SudaneseGovernment and the various opposition factions  whichwould finally lead to peace  security and stability in thebrotherly country of the Sudan and would safeguard itspeople and territorial integrity.22The phenomenon of international terrorism is notunique to a single colour  religion or doctrine. It is anobstacle to world peace  security and progress. Variousinternational coordination efforts to contain thisphenomenon have failed because of lack of vision andfaulty approaches. The Republic of Yemen has greatlysuffered from terrorism. It has tried to take all possiblemeasures to cope with this ill. We hope that there willbe united efforts by the international community toeradicate this scourge and to finalize a comprehensiveconvention against international terrorism.Yemen renews its appeal for holding aninternational conference under the aegis of the UnitedNations to define the causes of this phenomenon and tofinalize a strategy that contains solutions to the originsof this destructive phenomenon. My country alsobelieves that the efforts of the international communitymust be focused on putting an end to any and allpolitical pressure exerted on certain countries and onopposing any attempt at threats or use of force andinterference   using terrorism as its excuse   in theinternal affairs of various countries. The Republic ofYemen joins many countries in calling for the need todifferentiate between terrorism as a phenomenon andnational struggle against foreign occupation by allmeans  as is the case with the legitimate and juststruggle of the Palestinian people.The developing countries are faced today withdevelopment challenges that can be overcome onlythrough concerted international efforts and support whichwould help effect political and economic reforms. Thereis a need for rich countries to grant development andfinancial assistance to poor countries in order to ease thedebt burden of the latter and to facilitate the use andtransfer of technology. Heads of State and Governmentwho met during the Millennium Summit in New Yorkin 2000 committed themselves to achieving this goal.The United Nations  together with theInternational Monetary Fund and other institutions must try to establish an international fund for theeradication of poverty and to improve the situation ofrefugees. There is also a need to relieve economic social and security problems  from which countriessuch as Yemen suffer due to the many refugees on itssoil  especially those from Africa."
"186",7557,"YUG",58,2003,"﻿I am honoured to addressyou for the first time on behalf of the State Union of5Serbia and Montenegro. The State Union of Serbia andMontenegro was created in the interest of peace stability  the democratic right to freedom of choice andmoving quickly to a European track. We have assumedthe responsibility for a policy of non-compromise inthe Balkans. We have assumed the responsibility todemonstrate that in the region that used to be burdenedwith divisions and conflicts it is possible to work outan agreement that will push us forward together.We are certain that our lives can be better if all ofus in the region commit to that goal  if all of us in theregion look to the future and if all of us in the regionlook to Europe and other people who share the samegoals. That is why we are sure that life can be better forall peoples.With this hope  we agree with all who perceiveterrorism as one of the greatest evils facing the worldtoday. We can defeat terrorism only if we all joinforces. That is why  for us  there is no alternative tomultilateralism  and the United Nations is the guarantorfor that  both today and tomorrow.Terrorism is not a problem only for the richcountries  as the Secretary-General said yesterday. It isa problem for every man and every country  just as it isa problem for parents who lost their children justbecause they chose to swim in a river and belonged to adifferent religion and nationality. We deplore thedeaths of those children  the same as we deplore theterrorist attack in Baghdad  which caused the death ofinnocent people  among them Sergio Vieira de Mello.We condemn these deaths as all humane  civilized andprogressive people do. But that is not enough. We muststrive to ensure that such things happen no more.The activities of the United Nations in Kosovodemonstrate that with good intentions on all sides thereis hope for creating preconditions for dialogue  insteadof hatred and conflicts  so that people discuss andresolve their problems instead of creating new ones.We are glad that one of the crucial issues for thestability of this region   that of Kosovo   is on thethreshold of dialogue  as we have called for.We have been encouraged by the announcementsof representatives of the United Nations that thedialogue between Belgrade and Pristina could start bymid-October and that it has been supported within thecontact group. I hope that it will also be supported inPristina  as it is supported in Belgrade. In thisundertaking as well  the role of the United Nations andits representative in Kosovo is extremely important.For its part  Serbia and Montenegro will do itsutmost to ensure the success of the dialogue. This is anopportunity that we must take advantage of  in theinterest of the European and democratic future of theregion. We have to be patient and persistent.We are aware that we cannot change the past. Butwe can do a great deal to improve our present andfuture. We seek peace for all people left without theirhomes. There are more than 650 000 of them in Serbiaand Montenegro  and we want them to live where theybelieve they belong. I am sure that within theframework of the tripartite agreement with Croatia andBosnia and Herzegovina we shall soon find a commonsolution that will ultimately resolve that problem.From our own recent experience we know a lotabout victims and suffering. That is why we call for anend to violence in all parts of the world   in Baghdadand Iraq  and the Middle East. We are convinced thatthe international community and the United Nations primarily the Security Council  will find a way tostabilization and to a life in peace and freedom for allpeople. The human race has only one world to live in.We in Serbia and Montenegro stand ready to contributeto peace efforts through peace operations  to protectpeace and to defend each nation's right to a democraticfuture.Of course  we are primarily committed to thestabilization of the situation in the region of theWestern Balkans  cooperation among the countries inthe region  the fight against organized crime and fullcooperation with the Hague Tribunal. No crime shouldbe left unpunished  and all perpetrators should bebrought to justice. Our goal is to join the process ofEuropean integration as soon as possible  as well as thePartnership for Peace. The Thessaloniki summit of theEuropean Union and the countries of the WesternBalkans defined clear goals. Serbia and Montenegrowill not let go of this chance for a European future. Wehave a responsibility to create a better  more peacefuland dignified life for generations to come.That is an obligation not only for us in Serbia andThat is a motive and force keeping us together in theUnited Nations to do all we can so that good mayprevail over evil  peace over conflicts  democracy overdictatorship and economic prosperity over poverty. Wecan do it together. This is not a utopia; it is a realistic6possibility which will be successful to the extent weare able to work together. Serbia and Montenegro trustsit can be done."
"187",7585,"ZAF",58,2003,"﻿May I congratulate you  Sir for assuming the mantle of the presidency for thissession of the Assembly and thank the outgoingPresident  Mr. Jan Kavan. I would also like to echowhat other speakers have said about the death of thededicated United Nations workers who lost their livesin the bombing of the United Nations headquarters inBaghdad last month  including Sergio Vieira de Mello an outstanding international civil servant.When we met here last year  we were allconcerned about what would happen in Iraq. At thesame time  we were concerned about what role theUnited Nations would play in the resolution of the Iraqaffair. Dramatic events since then have providedanswers to those questions. However  those dramaticevents have raised important and disturbing questionsabout the very future of the United Nations. Centralamong them is the question  does the United Nationshave a future as a strong and effective multilateralorganization enjoying the confidence of the peoples ofthe world and capable of addressing the matters thatare of concern to all humanity?Quite correctly  as we meet here this time  whilestill preoccupied by the issue of the future of Iraq  I amcertain that none of us wants to rehash the debate thattook place on this matter in the period following thelast general debate in the General Assembly. While forsome time after that general debate we were concernedto provide answers to questions about the role of theUnited Nations in Iraq  today we have to answerquestions about the impact of the Iraq affair on thefuture of the United Nations. Matters have evolved insuch a manner that to our limited understanding itseems extremely difficult to resolve the issue of therole of the United Nations in Iraq  unless we answerthe question about the future of the United Nations as alegitimate expression of the collective will of thepeoples of the world and the principal guarantor ofinternational peace and security  among other globalissues.Put differently  we could say that what is decidedabout the role of the United Nations in Iraq will at thesame time decide what will become of the UnitedNations in the context of its Charter and of theimportant global objectives that have been set since theCharter was adopted.This is not a case of the tail wagging the dog;rather  history has placed at our feet an urgent andpractical test case that obliges us to answer thequestion: what do we  collectively  want the UnitedNations to be? What do we do to distinguish the treesfrom the forest? In that regard we must make the pointdirectly  that as South Africans  we are partners andactivists who campaign in favour of a strong andeffective United Nations. We do so because of theplace our country and people occupy in thecontemporary world.We believe that everything that has happenedplaces an obligation on the United Nations to reflect ona number of fundamental issues that are of criticalimportance to the evolution of human society. We areconvinced that this General Assembly woulddisappoint the expectations of the peoples of the worldand put itself in jeopardy if  for any reason whatsoever it did not address these issues.We speak as we do because we represent thepeople who are more sensitive to the imperatives ofwhat the world decides  given our experience during aperiod when apartheid South Africa was correctly amatter of focused and sustained interest by the UnitedNations and the peoples of the world  includingordinary folk  even in the most marginalized areas ofour globe.This Organization  and all of us singly andcollectively  has spoken and frequently speaks aboutthe phenomenon of globalization. Correctly  we speakof a global village driven by recognition of the fact ofthe integration of all peoples within a common andinterdependent global society.24Certainly  humanity is more integrated today thanit was when the United Nations was established morethan fifty years ago. However  many have drawnattention to the fact that  whereas objective socialprocesses have led to the emergence of the globalvillage  all of our political collectives have not yetsucceeded in designing the institutions of governancemade necessary by the reality of the birth of this globalvillage.Correct observations have also been made that theuse of the image and concept of the village does notimply that the residents of this village are equal. Thereality is that the same processes that bring all of uscloser together in a global village are simultaneouslyplacing the residents of the global village in differentpositions. Some have emerged as dominant  and therest as the dominated  with the dominant being thedecision makers and the dominated being the recipientsand implementers of those decisions.To the same extent that our political collectiveshave not designed the institutions responsive to theevolution of the global village  so have they failed torespond to the imbalance in the distribution of powerinherent in contemporary global human society. Wespeak here of power in all fields of human activity. Leftto its internal and autonomous impulses  the process ofglobalization will inevitably result in the furtherenhancement of the domination of the dominant andthe entrenchment of the subservience of the dominated however much the latter might resent such domination.This will include the perpetuation of thedominant positions by those who are dominant toensure the sustenance of their capacity to set theagenda of the global village in the interest of their ownneighbourhoods within that village. Inherent withinthis is  necessarily  reliance on the use of superiorpower  of which the dominant dispose  to achieve theobjective of the perpetuation of the situation of anunequal distribution of power.In this situation  it is inevitable that the pursuit ofpower in itself will assert itself as a unique legitimateobjective  apparently detached from any need to definethe uses of such power. This also signifies thedeification of force in all its forms as the final arbiterin the ordering of human affairs.However  from the point of view of thedisempowered  the struggle to ensure the use of suchpower to address their own interests becomes astrategic objective they cannot avoid. Necessarily thismeans that power would have to be redistributed. Thatwould be done to empower the disempowered and toregulate the use of power by those who are powerful.Thus we come back to what I said earlier.Because we are poor  we are partisan activists for astrong  effective and popularly accepted UnitedNations. We take those positions because there is noway in which we could advance the interests of thepeople  the majority of whom are poor  outside thecontext of a strong  effective and popularly acceptedUnited Nations. An autonomous process ofglobalization  driven by its own internal regularities can only result in the determination of our futurewithin the parameters set by those who enjoy thesuperiority of power. The powerful will do this in theirown interests  which might not coincide with ours.When this Organization was established 58 yearsago  its objectives and institutions necessarily reflectedboth the collective global concerns as then perceivedand the then balance of power.Among other things  our esteemed Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  has drawn attention to thefact that the United Nations started off as anOrganization of 51 States and is now composed of 191States. Undoubtedly  the perceived and real collectiveglobal concerns of our day are  to some extent at least different from those that prevailed more than 50 yearsago  when the Organization was about a quarter of itspresent size.For more than a decade  this Organization hasbeen involved in discussions about its transformation.Once more  the Secretary-General has reflected on thischallenge. The truth is that our discussions have gonenowhere. Earlier this morning the Secretary-Generalannounced steps he will take to facilitate the adoptionof decisions that will help all of us to effect thenecessary and inevitable transformation of the UnitedNations. We support the decisions he announced.The global resolve to defeat such organizations asal Qaeda has emerged out of our understanding thatinternational aggression should not necessarily beexpected to come from formal and recognized Stateinstitutions. We have all come to understand that such athreat coming from non-State institutions wouldexpress itself as the most inhumane and despicableterrorism  as was most painfully demonstrated on 11September 2001.25Our collective experience   stretching from NewYork and elsewhere in the United States on 11September 2001; and reaching back to Nairobi andDar es Salaam  in Africa  earlier still; and  morerecently  to Bali  Indonesia; to Morocco; to the conflictbetween Israel and Palestine; to Algeria  India  Russiaand elsewhere; and even our own country   tells usthat the United Nations  working in defence of thecollective interests of the peoples of the world  mustensure that we act together to defeat the threat ofterrorism  collectively defined.At the same time  we have to take on board theconviction among some of our Member States that theyconstitute special and particular targets of globalterrorism. Understandably  the argument is advancedthat it would be unreasonable and irrational to expectsuch States not to act to deter such terrorist actionsagainst themselves. None of us can defendinternational rules that prescribe that any one of usshould wait to be attacked knowing in specific waysthat we were going to be attacked by identifiedterrorists  and then act against those who had attackedus  with such horrendous costs as were experienced bythe United States during the 11 September attacks. I donot imagine that any one of us would seek to imposesuch a costly and unsustainable burden on any of ourMember States  which would also violate the self-defence provisions of Article 51 of the Charter of theUnited Nations.We also have no choice but to deal with the brutereality that the reform process of the United Nationsand all its bodies  and other multilateral organizations has got to recognize the reality of the imbalance ofpower  as represented by different countries andregions. At the same time  we must proceed from theposition that such distribution of power is notnecessarily in the interests of the peoples of the world or even in the interests of those who today have thepower to determine what happens to our commonworld. That includes acceptance of the fact that depending on the place we occupy in the globalcommunity  we have different priorities. Among otherthings  the rich are concerned about ways and means tomaintain the status quo  from which they benefit. Inpractical terms that means that all matters that threatento destabilize the status quo must necessarily beanathema to such people. Such matters will thereforebe an issue of principal concern to them. Necessarilyand understandably  they will then seek to get the restof the world to accept their assertion that themaintenance of the status quo must be a universalhuman preoccupation  precisely the kind of issue onwhich the United Nations must take a united position.On the other hand  the poor are interested inchanging their conditions for the better. Accordingly they will not accept the maintenance of the status quo which perpetuates their poverty. Accordingly  amongother things  the poor billions of the world will arguefor action by the United Nations to ensure the transferof resources to themselves  which will enable them toextricate themselves from their condition of povertyand underdevelopment  consistent with theimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals the objectives of the Johannesburg World Summit onSustainable Development and other internationalagreements. Inevitably  that will run counter to thepropositions of those who are more powerful than thepoor  namely  the Governments  peoples and countriesthat keep them afloat with development assistance.That will require   whether it is stated or not   thatthe recipients of that assistance understand that suchassistance can dry up.Important shifts in the global balance of powerand global objectives have taken place since the UnitedNations was established  58 years ago. TheOrganization has not substantially changed  in terms ofits structures and mode of functioning  to reflect thosechanges. That has served as a recipe for an inevitablecrisis  a disaster waiting to occur. And so as we meettoday we are confronted by global challenges that theglobal Organization cannot solve. Impelled by theurgent issues of the day  some of the powerful will notwait for all of us to respond to the problems we haveraised  and which they face. They will act to solvethose problems; their actions will make the statementthat they do not need the United Nations to findsolutions to those problems. Simultaneously  that willmake the practical statement that the United Nations isirrelevant to the solution of the most pending problemsof our day. The disempowered will continue to look tothe Organization  understanding  correctly  that they aretoo weak to advance their interests singly outside thecollective voice of the United Nations. In that regard they expect that the United Nations will be informed byits founding documents and other solemn decisions ithas taken since it was established  all of which havebeen approved by successive sessions of the GeneralAssembly.26Global poverty and underdevelopment are theprincipal problems that face the United Nations.Billions across the world expect that the GeneralAssembly will address that challenge in a meaningfulmanner. The masses of people of our world expect thatthe statements we will make at this session of theGeneral Assembly as representatives of variousGovernments will indicate a serious commitment toimplement what we say. The poor of the world expectan end to violence and war everywhere. They want anend to the killing that is taking too many Israeli andPalestinian lives. They want Africans to stop killingone another  continuing to convey the message that weare incapable of living in peace among ourselves. Theydesire the realization of the democratic objectiveuniversally: that the people shall govern. They believethat we are seriously committed to the objective of theeradication of poverty and the provision of a better lifefor all. They think that we mean it when we say that wewill not allow the process of globalization to result inthe further enrichment of the rich and theimpoverishment of the poor within and betweencountries. They believe us when we say that ourcollective future is one of hope  and not despair. Theyare keenly interested to know whether our gathering the United Nations General Assembly  will producethose results.To collectively meet those requirements willrequire that each and every one of us   both rich andpoor  the powerful and the disempowered   commitourselves practically to act in all circumstances in amanner that recognizes and respects the fact that noneof us is an island sufficient unto ourselves. Thatincludes the most powerful. The latter face theinteresting challenge  important to themselves in theirnational interests  that the poverty anddisempowerment of the billions will no longer serve asa condition for their success and their possibility toprosper in conditions of peace.What we have said today may not be heard because we do not have the strength to have our voiceheard. Tomorrow we may be obliged to say  No morewater; the fire next time. As the fires burn  the UnitedNations will die  consumed by the flames. So will thehopes of the poor of the world die  as they did atCancun  Mexico  not so long ago. We must act togetherto say in our words and in our actions  as countries andas the United Nations  that there will be water nexttime  and not fire."
"188",7627,"ZMB",58,2003,"﻿Let me begin bycongratulating you  Sir  on your assumption of thepresidency of the General Assembly at this session. Mydelegation pledges its support and its cooperation toyou. I wish you a very successful tenure of office. Ialso wish to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. JanKavan of the Czech Republic  for the efficient mannerin which he presided over the proceedings of theprevious session. In addition  I wish to take thisopportunity to commend the Secretary-General  Mr.Kofi Annan  for his relentless efforts and dedication tothe cause of international peace  security and economicdevelopment.My delegation wishes to express our deepestsympathies to the families of the United Nations staffwho died in the terrorist bombing at the United Nationsoffices in Baghdad on 19 August 2003. Those tragicdeaths are an incalculable loss to the United Nations.Such violent acts should not be allowed to continue.My Government also joins other Members of theUnited Nations in condemning these inhuman acts.I should like to state that Zambia condemns  in allits forms and manifestations  the terrorism that isoccurring in various parts of the world. We pledge tocooperate with the international community in the fightagainst international terrorism. It is in that vein that theZambian Government welcomes Security Councilresolution 1502 (2003)  on the protection of UnitedNations personnel  associated personnel andhumanitarian personnel in conflict zones  which wasadopted on 26 August 2003 and which  inter alia expresses strong condemnation of all forms ofviolence.The tragedy in Baghdad underscores the need forconcerted efforts to strengthen multilateral approachesto international peace and security. The United Nationsshould be allowed to lead efforts to achievecomprehensive disarmament in nuclear  chemical andconventional weapons. Terrorists should be deniedaccess to all weapons of mass destruction.Nuclear  chemical and conventional weapons including small arms and light weapons  pose a seriousthreat to international peace and security. In Africa small arms and light weapons  as well as anti-personnellandmines  have destabilized States and have taken agreat toll on life and property. My Government ishopeful that this session will advance the horizon ofthe international disarmament agenda.Zambia mourns the untimely death of Ms. AnnaLindh  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden  whodedicated her life to the pursuit of peace  socialprogress and development. My country will miss herfriendship  dynamism and broad understanding ofdevelopmental issues.As a peace-loving Member State  Zambia willcontinue to cooperate with and to support the efforts ofthe Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)  establishedby the Security Council to fight terrorism. The CTCshould be encouraged to work to raise the capacities ofMember States to fight international terrorism.Emphasis should be placed on addressing linkagesbetween terrorism  money-laundering and organizedcrime  which are among the most serious challenges tostability and peace in our era.The strength of the United Nations lies in itslegitimacy  founded on the bedrock of principles ofinternational law accepted by all Member States. It isessential that the conduct of international affairs be inconformity with those principles. The common securityagenda should reflect a global consensus on all majorthreats to peace and security. The spirit of cooperationbased on the shared values of equality and sovereignty which are enshrined in our Charter  is a source of ourstrength.Poverty is the greatest impediment todevelopment. Poverty reduction therefore remains theforemost priority of developing countries and shouldcontinue to feature highly on the agenda of the UnitedNations. It is regrettable that  since the MillenniumDeclaration three years ago  indications are that mostdeveloping countries risk falling short of achieving theMillennium Development Goals by 2015. This islargely due to lack of resources and capacity andweaknesses in national and global economies. Zambiacontinues to strive to implement those goals.Globalization has brought about bothopportunities and challenges. But the current worldeconomic conditions are unfavourable to developingcountries in general  and to the least developedcountries in particular. Unless there is an increase inthe flow of the official development assistance (ODA) foreign direct investment and other forms of assistance it will be difficult for these countries to come out of the12vicious circle of poverty and lack of development. Thissituation is exacerbated by the huge external debts thatthe least developed countries are struggling to pay off.Given their economic problems  the leastdeveloped countries  of which 34 out of 49 are inAfrica  there is need for support from the internationalcommunity within the framework of the 2001 BrusselsPlan of Action. In that vein  I wish also to urgedeveloped countries to honour their pledges to meet thetarget of 0.7 per cent of their gross national productoffered as ODA to developing countries.While we welcome the Heavily Indebted PoorCountries (HIPC) Initiative in addressing the externaldebt  there is a need to broaden and ease the process ofaccessing funds. Equally important  developingcountries need easy access to the markets of thedeveloped countries. This is important to stimulateeconomic growth. To level the playing field  mydelegation calls for the removal of agriculturalsubsidies in developed countries  which havecontributed to the adverse and poor terms of trade forthe developing countries.Zambia regrets the failure to achieve a consensusat the World Trade Organization MinisterialConference at Cancún. There is an urgent need toovercome the impasse that emerged. Developedcountries should demonstrate a give-and-take spirit inthese negotiations.In the effort to address social and economicproblems and promote development  the African headsof State and Government  at their summit held inLusaka  Zambia  in July 2001  adopted the NewPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  toplace the continent on a path to sustainable growth.Although the ownership and the implementationof the NEPAD programme is the responsibility of theAfricans themselves  in order to succeed they need thecooperation and assistance of the internationalcommunity. My delegation would like to appeal to thedonor community  including United Nations agencies to assist in the implementation of NEPAD.My delegation is mindful that Africa’sdevelopment is hampered by conflicts. Wherever theseoccur  there is no development; rather  there is moredestruction and loss of life and property. Zambiacommends the leadership of Africa for taking up thechallenge to resolve conflicts in the African way. Wethank them for their time and resources directed at thateffort. We are happy to note the positive developmentsthat have taken place in the recent past in various partsof Africa where the peace processes have led to thecessation of conflict and the return of peace.In that regard  my Government reaffirms itsreadiness to contribute to the international conferenceon the Great Lakes region initiated by the UnitedNations in collaboration with the African Union.The international community should make effortsfor conflict prevention and resolution. Conflicts shouldbe avoided by creating a conducive politicalenvironment and allow political pluralism  democracy good governance and transparency to flourish. Mycountry’s commitment to the peaceful resolution ofconflicts is unwavering  and we will continue toparticipate in peacekeeping operations.The HIV/AIDS pandemic is indeed a globalcrisis. It is no longer just a health concern  but animpediment to human development and politicalstability  which threatens international peace andsecurity. The startling figures of 42 million people wholive with HIV/AIDS globally  the majority of whom arein sub-Saharan Africa  and the 31 million people whohave died from the pandemic  should compel theinternational community to take concrete measures tocombat the scourge.The scourge has ravaged Zambia. MyGovernment is devoting considerable attention andresources to combat its spread and to limit its impacton our communities. We are also tackling the problemscreated by the pandemic such as the plight of AIDSorphans  street kids and vulnerable households. In thistask  Government  civil societies  the relevant UnitedNations agencies and the private sector are all workingtogether. Zambia is also cooperating with otherGovernments as well in tackling this pandemic.The Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria  which is a welcomeinitiative  has provided renewed impetus to theprogrammes and interventions of Member Statesdesigned to combat these deadly diseases. There is aneed to contribute more generously to the Fund for it tobe solvent and viable. My delegation wishes to appealfor easier access to these funds to enable affectedcountries to procure cheaper and affordable genericdrugs that are urgently needed.13My delegation calls for radical reform andstrengthening the world body to make it a moreefficient and effective instrument to meet thechallenges of the twenty-first century. Zambia supportsthe Secretary-General’s proposals for reform of theUnited Nations aimed at the strengthening this worldbody.In conclusion  I wish to state that my delegationrecognizes the numerous challenges that the UnitedNations faces. I have every hope  that through ourcollective effort  we will succeed in attaining peace development and prosperity for all humanity. Zambiapledges her support in these efforts."
"189",7663,"ZWE",58,2003,"﻿Let me congratulate you  Sir on your election to the presidency of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am confident thatyour leadership as well as your vast political anddiplomatic experience will successfully carry usthrough this session. We extend to your predecessor  Mr.Jan Kavan  our sincere appreciation for the excellentmanner in which he guided the work of the GeneralAssembly at its fifty-seventh session  which just ended.Our meeting today is overshadowed by the deathof Special Representative Sergio Vieira de Mello andof 22 other United Nations workers  who were killed inthe line of duty in Baghdad on 19 August 2003.I join my colleagues in extending my personalcondolences and those of my Government and of thepeople of Zimbabwe to Secretary-General Kofi Annanand the bereaved families. Against this tragedy and theinauspicious developments in Iraq  we cannot allowourselves to treat this session as merely routine. At theheart of the tragedy in that nation is the unprecedentedassault on the ethic and function of multilateralism inworld affairs represented by the Security Council  theonly guarantor of global peace  order and security.Some powerful Western nations  led by theGovernment of the United States of America and theGovernment of Britain  went into a war of unclearobjectives in the face of clear opposition from the restof the world  and  as we now know  with clearopposition from their own people as well.It was and remains an unjust  illegitimate war —unjust to the extent that it was founded and prosecutedon false words; illegitimate to the extent that it was notsanctioned by the United Nations and has transformeditself into an effective occupation of a sovereignpeople.There can never be world peace under conditionsof foreign invasion and occupation. There can never beworld security and order when naked power suspends and substitutes with unilateralism  the hallowedprinciple of multilateralism  on the basis of which wehave made  kept  preserved and expanded peace sincethe Second World War. We tell the General Assemblythat as a people from a continent that has suffered asimilar fate in recent history; indeed  as a people whohad to overthrow foreign imperial occupation throughcostly struggles.2It is a strange logic that the Iraqis pay for a badpresident  a bad government and a bad war byoccupation and loss of their sovereignty. Let us statehere quite clearly to both Britain and the United Statesthat the Iraqi people must have the sovereign right todetermine the affairs of their country restoredimmediately. Like all peoples of the world  their lovefor freedom and self-rule is just as strong and just asdeep as their hatred for bad leadership and badgovernment. Like all peoples of the world  they areunwilling to be occupied and governed by a foreigncoalition  however willing and powerful it may be. Nopeople want that  and we of Africa know it.We must reject the present road map of nakedunilateralism for consent-oriented statecraft in worldaffairs. What is the future of the world without theUnited Nations? We hope the coalition that willinglywent to war with Iraq without Security Councilsanction is now willing to admit that defeating others isnot always the same as winning peace and that wars areended not by proclamations  but by just settlements.Indeed  we hope that they have learned from theircostly mistakes and are willing to let the UnitedNations reassert its authority in the broader search forpeace and security in Iraq.If we are to overcome crises that could result incalamitous wars and social breakdowns  and to achievepeace and stability with justice  we need humane globalgovernance under the leadership of the United Nations as distinct from a unilateral global state andgovernment. Only that type of governance can makeand build peace  and indeed keep peace for mankind.Let it not be said that Zimbabwe enjoyscriticizing the United States and Britain for the sake ofcriticism. Our criticisms are founded on sound fundamental principles. Let it not be forgotten thatZimbabwe was in the chair when the Security Councilauthorized the first Gulf War. We stood firmly then bythe United Nations and the countries  including theUnited States and Britain  that removed Iraq fromKuwait. We did so on the basis that expansionism andoccupation of a sovereign country and people cannot beright  can never be just and warranted under anycircumstances. We admired the deployment of power tojust ends  under the auspices of the United Nations. Itis the absence of the same ingredients that explains ourindignation and our sharp censure of the so-calledcoalition of the willing that does not seem to recognizethat both the Iraqis and the world are unwilling tosanction the means employed and the end achieved.The inadequacies of existing internationalinstitutions in dealing with present challenges is a sadtestimony to their flawed foundational conceptionsamidst changing circumstances. We have anachronisticinstitutions relying too comfortably on traditionalnorms to address new challenges. Decades after thedefeat of Nazi Germany  does the world still need torely on a system founded on the principle of rewardingthe allied Powers for defeating Nazi Germany andthereby bringing post-world war peace?At its foundation  the United Nations collectivesystem allowed two classes of response. If a minorPower committed aggression and there was unanimityamong the five permanent members of the SecurityCouncil  a collective response could follow. However if a permanent member was opposed to such action itcould use its veto. In historical terms  that approachrepresents the institutionalization of a particular formof world order  namely  the immediate post-1945 worldorder  which sought to reward and empower the alliedPowers as the only competent stewards of world peace.But the world has changed a great deal since then. Justas many new nations have emerged since then  theallied Powers have also evolved in ways that easilymake them actors of injustice  and therefore threats toworld peace. Global power is now unipolar.The reality today is that we cannot treat theUnited Nations system as given. The institutionalarrangements in place were relevant only for aspecified period  and must inevitably be adapted transformed or even radically modified as materialcircumstances have changed and prevailing meanings practices and purposes have been challenged by newinter-subjective voices. In today’s unipolar world  whatcan the Security Council do to one of its permanentmembers whose actions threaten world peace?At a time when citizens everywhere are pressingfor a greater say in national governance  it isimperative for us as heads of State and Government toseek  in turn  a fairer representation through thedemocratization of multilateral organizations such asthe United Nations  the Bretton Woods institutions andthe World Trade Organization. What is good for thegoose must surely be good for the gander. The presentautocracy in global governance must be challengedstoutly so that all nations  big or small  have an equal3say and equal power in the way in which we governworld affairs.The Security Council just has to democratize  andthat means re-examining its composition and the wayin which power is distributed  and therefore exercised within that crucial body. I am happy that the Secretary-General’s current report entitled “Implementation ofthe United Nations Millennium Declaration”  is inagreement with our concerns that“The composition of the Security Council —unchanged in its essentials since 1945 — seemsat odds with the geopolitical realities of thetwenty-first century.” [A/58/323  para. 96]In the light of that stark reality  it is evident that thedecisions of the Security Council  which have a decisiveimpact on events in the real world  increasingly lacklegitimacy in the eyes of the developing world.Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) andthe International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment  popularly known as the World Bank whose raison d’être was to provide assistance to thedeveloping world  have succumbed to the whims andcaprices of the major Powers. The Bretton Woodsinstitutions  in their current form and practice  aredesigned to deny developing countries the capacity tochart their independent developmental path. Theextraneous conditionalities of the Bretton Woodsinstitutions  imposed by the powerful countries for thequalification or disqualification of beneficiaries  areintended to further the national interests of the bigPowers and to justify wanton interference in the affairsof small nations.Is it not a baffling irony that a small country likeZimbabwe  which  after it responded positively to adistress call by a neighbour suffering aggression —even by United Nations reckoning — was deemedineligible to access IMF and World Bank funding forthe very reason of having gone to the rescue of thatneighbour? One hopes that the new  recent realizationby the World Bank that land reforms are at the heart ofpoverty eradication mark the beginning of a newoutlook on its part.Notwithstanding that determined and resoluteattempt at frustrating our land-reform programme  thefast-track phase through which we reasserted oursovereign right over our land as a principal resource islargely concluded  and is now yielding tangiblebenefits to the vast majority of our people. There is anew sense of empowerment  yielding a happy sense ofownership  which has brought thousands upon thousandsof hitherto marginalized families back into the economicmainstream. Zimbabwe’s National Economic RevivalProgramme gives clear priority to agriculture as theengine for economic revival and growth. We areforging ahead on the basis of our own efforts andsupport from nations of good will. We are determined tomove on and succeed. A land review committee recentlyset up by my Government to assess the whole reformprogramme has now submitted its findings  which willhelp us in mapping the way forward to achievesustainable development in the agricultural sector  inline with the criteria and objectives we set ourselves.In the area of world trade  Zimbabwe believes ina multilateral trading system that serves well allmembers of the trading nations. It is therefore a matterof some grave regret that the developing countries ofthe South and those of the developed North could notreconcile their differences  and thus renderedinconclusive the Cancún mid-term review of the WorldTrade Organization’s (WTO) Doha DevelopmentAgenda. We in the South were right to reject theso-called new issues that the North insisted benegotiated first. We urge the North to engage in honestnegotiations and to desist from trying to use the WTOforum for hegemonic ends.Zimbabwe and other countries in the subregioncontinue to grapple with the effects of the HIV/AIDSscourge. To combat the epidemic  my Government hasdeclared HIV/AIDS a national emergency. We haveembarked on a national programme of prevention  thehighlight of which consists of mass mobilization todeepen awareness and understanding of the disease. Asa result of that campaign  our infection rate in thesexually active 15 to 49 age group has come downfrom 35 per cent to 24 per cent. Through our nationalefforts  the AIDS levy has to date raised $8 billion.That money is being distributed through adecentralized structure that ensures accessibility rightdown to the village level. We call upon theinternational community to complement our efforts.The situation in the Middle East remains graveand troubled. A conflict that is quite costly on bothsides of the divide continues unabated  with the onlyresponse from the international community coming byway of episodic judgements that maldistribute blameon the basis of individual national interests. Especially4wrong is the belief that settlement can come only throughostracizing and even eliminating the leadership of thePalestinian people. Assassinations and extrajudicialkillings must be rejected as a formula for peace.Zimbabwe welcomes the measures adopted by theSecurity Council aimed at strengthening the peace processin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We areencouraged by the increase  under a Chapter VII mandate of the force levels of the United Nations OrganizationMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  aswell as by the imposition of a 12-month arms embargoover areas in the troubled eastern part of the Congo.We also urge the international community to rallybehind the peace initiative of the Economic Communityof West African States aimed at bringing peace to Liberia.The transition to peace in Liberia has confirmed that  withinternational goodwill and support  African solutions toAfrican problems are possible. To strengthen the peaceprocess  we call upon the international community toaddress the humanitarian crisis facing the Liberianpeople as a result of a debilitating civil war.My country remains committed to playing apositive role in peacekeeping efforts carried out underthe auspices of the United Nations. Indeed  we have sofar played our part fully and magnificently."
